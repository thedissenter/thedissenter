Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.559
Center. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs and

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.420
to the m joined by Doctor Francesca Bela. She

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.109
is postdoctoral researcher in the er C Project Assembling

5
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.899
Life at the Center for Philosophy and the Sciences

6
00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.600
in the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History, art and

7
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.040
Ideas at the University of Oslo. She is interested

8
00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:25.389
basically in the complexity of the interactions between different

9
00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:28.565
entities and in particular, she is fascinated by the

10
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.465
interface between chemistry and biology. And today we're going

11
00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:35.014
to talk a little bit about Philosophy of Science

12
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:38.584
with the focus on biochemistry and we're going to

13
00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:42.924
discuss what are functions, what are kinds, specifically biochemical

14
00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:46.284
functions and kinds genes as well and some other

15
00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:49.305
related topics. So, Doctor Bela, welcome to the show.

16
00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:50.845
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

17
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.419
Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. It's a

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.169
huge pleasure for me to uh be part of

19
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.860
this show.

20
00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.669
Thank you. So let's start perhaps with functions. I

21
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.830
mean, uh I uh I would like first to

22
00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.230
ask you more generally in the context of science

23
00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.160
and philosophy of science. What are functions?

24
00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:16.949
Yes. Now, well, that's an excellent question. And I

25
00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.260
would say that like in a nutshell, so if

26
00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:21.459
we try to bring together all the different accounts

27
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.919
of functions, functions are special causal contributions, which can

28
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.949
give us like informations about the identity, the history

29
00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.139
and the context relativity of the role that an

30
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.650
entity uh plays. So using a classic toy example,

31
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.129
we can take the art uh the heart is

32
00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.489
a muscle that has the function to pump blood,

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.610
or at least this is one of its functions.

34
00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.949
And uh the function of pumping blood is a

35
00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.339
special causal role that the heart plays in the

36
00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.069
physiological system. It tells us what is uh what

37
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.750
makes the heart a heart compared to other muscles

38
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.290
because it specifies what uh the heart is doing.

39
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.889
But it's also telling us that the heart has

40
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.089
been selected as a muscle to pump blood. So

41
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.220
as you can see the notion of functionality um

42
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.880
can inform us on a lot of different things.

43
00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.649
Now, functions are also attributed to artifacts for instance.

44
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.919
And I think that the definition that I gave

45
00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.130
that is that um functions are really special because

46
00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.455
they contributions can work for something like a chair,

47
00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:30.235
like we can use a chair to do different

48
00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:32.895
things. Uh But what makes a chair, a chair

49
00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:34.735
is that it has the function of allowing us

50
00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:37.925
to sit on it. Uh And this uh um

51
00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.785
yeah, and this kind of like allows us to,

52
00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:43.235
to define the object. Uh Having said that. So

53
00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:47.300
having provided this kind of general definition, I do

54
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.850
think that when we apply functionality to different types

55
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.110
of different kinds of objects, uh then we might

56
00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.699
need specific account of functions. So in that sense,

57
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.910
I think that um after the first step of

58
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.529
providing like a general definition of functionality, uh we

59
00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:09.820
can be quite pluralist uh about specific notions of

60
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.740
functionality uh for uh for, for different objects. So

61
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.229
I think that the way in which we ascribe

62
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.679
functions to artifacts such as a chair might be

63
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.580
different from the specific way in which we want

64
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.449
to ascribe functions to something like the heart or

65
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.970
any other trait. And that is different also from

66
00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.119
other kinds of entities like uh molecules.

67
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.809
Mhm Yeah. So, so when it comes to functions,

68
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.190
it just came to my mind because for example,

69
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.720
when it comes to the heart and it pumping

70
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.630
blood, I mean, in that specific case and probably

71
00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.490
others in our human bodies, are we talking specifically

72
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.970
about evolved functions? There is the functions that a

73
00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.369
particular organ, for example, a particular biochemical molecule have

74
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.710
evolved to perform or can it also include other

75
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.539
types of uh I don't know secondary acquired functions,

76
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.119
for example.

77
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.119
Yeah. Yeah. Like this is an excellent question. I

78
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.428
think that probably different philosophers would give different answers

79
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.390
to this. Uh And there is no like unified

80
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.108
view, I would say that I am quite sympathetic

81
00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.839
with the idea that in order to identify what

82
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.730
is special about functions or scholar contributions, we need

83
00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:32.299
to bring in evolutionary history. So like the function

84
00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.070
of the art is what it has been selected

85
00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:38.630
for now, whether this just includes pumping blood, for

86
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.000
instance, for the art or whether it can include

87
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.260
also what are called like distal functions. Um I

88
00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:48.600
don't have uh a strong argument for neither of

89
00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:51.230
these views. I would say that generally, I'm quite

90
00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:55.070
happy to ascribe functionality if we can identify a

91
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.880
form of evolutionary background. Uh But this doesn't necessarily

92
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.859
have to be like direct. Um And I think

93
00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.700
that this is how we can bring in, for

94
00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:11.100
instance, um evolutionary talk into ascribing functionality to molecules

95
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.929
because molecules are not the classic uh target of

96
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.679
evolution. Uh They, they are a bit different, it's

97
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.279
not like they, they present different features compared to,

98
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.500
for instance, traits or phenotypic traits in particular. Um

99
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.799
So, yeah, and that like compared to maybe other

100
00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.709
philosophers, I'm a bit more loose in the fact

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.779
that what I think is interesting is a form

102
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.540
of general evolutionary context as that is helpful to

103
00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:41.059
identify like which of the causal contributions are functions

104
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.380
and which are just causal contributions or roles that

105
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.380
the different rates can perform.

106
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.220
And when you talk about uh distal functions, which

107
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.480
is something you mentioned there very briefly. For example,

108
00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:57.200
when it comes to the heart, since it pumps

109
00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.679
blood, would the distal function perhaps be that it

110
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.279
also distributes oxygen through the body to the different

111
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.589
kinds of cells. You would that would that count

112
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.040
as a distal function?

113
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.119
Yeah, that would be a kind of like distal

114
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.920
function that is quite proximal as if we unpack

115
00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:19.570
like the pumping blood. Uh THEN pumping blood is

116
00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:25.779
useful for um yeah, for moving the oxygen. Another

117
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.410
like distal function can be for instance, the sound

118
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.989
that the heart make. So the fact that like,

119
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.720
uh for instance, this can tell us whether something

120
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.670
is alive or not or can be one of

121
00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:39.350
the parameters that it can, that can be used.

122
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:42.010
Uh uh And yeah, and, and there are philosophers

123
00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.239
diff like, differing opinions about whether, for instance, the

124
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.339
sound that the heart makes, um, is a function

125
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.040
or not. Uh Because somehow it's such as an

126
00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:54.329
effect of what would be the, like some people

127
00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.519
would call the proper function uh that, um that

128
00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.320
maybe doesn't count as such, even if, for instance,

129
00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:03.279
it can have a role in uh the interactions

130
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.269
that's like an animal or uh or even us

131
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.959
with other living beings.

132
00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:13.000
Mhm. In that case, the sound would be like

133
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.440
what a by product of the heart pumping blood

134
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.640
and not exactly a function. Right? I mean, it's

135
00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:22.040
not the function of the heart to produce sound.

136
00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.470
The sound is simply a by-product of it.

137
00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:27.089
Right. Exactly. And like, and then we can even

138
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.429
say that like the heart hasn't been selected because

139
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.510
it is an organ that makes a sound. Um

140
00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.549
AND, and like an art like the heart as

141
00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:38.149
a trade has been selected in a series of

142
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.959
um animals because um it pumps blood so it

143
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.709
allows for circulation.

144
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.149
Mhm. And we'll probably get into more of this

145
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.929
when we talk about biochemistry specifically. But since I

146
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.119
already asked you about evolved functions and also what

147
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.869
I called, I'm not sure if this is the,

148
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.429
this is the correct terminology, but I call them

149
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.709
acquired functions. For example, we know that across different

150
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.250
species, different animals, plants, et cetera, the same uh

151
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.904
biochemical mo molecules can be be present for different

152
00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:19.385
or it can have different functions in different contexts.

153
00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:23.434
So I mean, what would count there as an

154
00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:27.704
evolved function, would it be the original function of

155
00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:32.155
the molecule? And then when it acquires new functions

156
00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:36.895
in more recently evolved uh organisms, for example, then

157
00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:39.933
it would be a an acquired function or I

158
00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:42.604
mean, ho how do you deal with it?

159
00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:45.969
Yeah, excellent. But I think that uh one of

160
00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:48.650
the core things about functionality is that or at

161
00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:51.169
least in how I think about functionality is that

162
00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:55.719
functionality is always context dependent. So we always need

163
00:08:55.729 --> 00:08:59.059
to consider the function of something in a given

164
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.460
context. Um So let us take a concrete example.

165
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.020
Uh THAT is one of those that I have

166
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.340
studied myself. And we can take for instance, the

167
00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:11.960
function of vitamin B 12. Um Vitamin B 12

168
00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:15.580
as the function in humans or as many functions

169
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.280
in humans actually, uh but one of them is

170
00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:24.429
to contribute to AIS. So um it intervenes in

171
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.419
this process that uh uh regards the renovation of

172
00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:32.219
red blood cells. Now, uh this biochemical function is

173
00:09:32.229 --> 00:09:34.989
quite specific to the presence of erythropoiesis. And to

174
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.270
the fact that like erythropoiesis in humans uh has

175
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.039
been selected in a way that um in a

176
00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:44.159
way thanks to which vitamin B 12 can basically

177
00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.909
display its function. However, vitamin B 12 is only

178
00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:52.049
synthesized by bacteria and archaea of specific species. And

179
00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.080
there it has a different function. Um MOSTLY an

180
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.630
an enzymatic function there as well. But of course,

181
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.840
it's not a function in in erythropoiesis because uh

182
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:05.599
bacteria and archaea don't have blood nor red blood

183
00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:07.859
cells and so on. So, in that case, we

184
00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:10.469
can notice that we have the same entity, which

185
00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:13.289
is the vitamin B 12 uh in general in

186
00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:16.609
all, in all of its vitamer. And this entity

187
00:10:16.619 --> 00:10:20.559
display different biochemical function. Why? Because they contribute to

188
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:25.690
different biological processes which have been selected to uh

189
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.590
to operate differently. So I would say that for

190
00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:33.820
instance, it doesn't make much sense or rather more

191
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.710
than doesn't make sense. It's not really informative for

192
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.960
instance to say that vitamin B 12 is a

193
00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:43.289
function in living beings in general. Uh BECAUSE we

194
00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:47.299
don't get like the specificity that we need. And

195
00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:49.700
while instead, if it, it is more meaningful or

196
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.119
it is more informative to say vitamin B 12

197
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.000
as a function in bacteria and archaea because it

198
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.140
can act in a, as a co enzyme in

199
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.219
many different um physiological processes of those species. And

200
00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:07.789
it has a function in erythropoiesis in humans and

201
00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:11.109
other mammals. So we make it specific to the

202
00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:15.020
process that has evolved. Um And in which the,

203
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.270
the vitamin displays its role

204
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.289
and then all of those different physiological processes it

205
00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:27.049
participates in across different organisms are, all of them

206
00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:30.250
are functions of that specific biomolecule,

207
00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:35.030
right? Uh Yes, in a way. Um Yes.

208
00:11:36.309 --> 00:11:38.469
And so let me just ask you one more

209
00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:41.419
question before we get into kinds because it just

210
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:43.599
came to my mind when you mentioned the example

211
00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:46.650
of the heart pumping blood. So let's say that,

212
00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:51.010
for example, someone develops cancer. So when that happens,

213
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.700
of course, the blood also reaches the cancer and

214
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.380
sort of feeds it with nutrients with oxygen and

215
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.869
all of that, uh I mean, since it's sort

216
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.299
of an um what we would consider an abnormal

217
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:10.119
process to develop cancer, uh Could we also say

218
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.890
that uh in that specific case, one of the

219
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.250
functions of the heart is to feed the cancer

220
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.099
or not?

221
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.460
Yeah, excellent question. So I think that in this

222
00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:25.619
case, and this is why bringing in evolutionary context

223
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.570
is very important in this case, we can say

224
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.320
that the heart is contributing to a dysfunctioning process,

225
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.419
which is the process of cancer application from the

226
00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:40.299
perspective of the organism. Uh And in that case,

227
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.750
the heart is not doing what it has been

228
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.219
selected to do in a way that is like

229
00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:49.520
the heart hasn't been selected to feed cancerous cells,

230
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.299
for instance, um like by providing oxygen, but the

231
00:12:53.309 --> 00:12:55.950
heart has been selected to pump blood across the

232
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.989
organism. And then somehow what is this functioning in

233
00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:02.640
itself? From the perspective of the organism? Of course,

234
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.700
uh is the cancer. Uh And this is, and,

235
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.729
and, and that's why I think that uh yeah,

236
00:13:08.739 --> 00:13:11.919
bringing in evolution can really help because we can

237
00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:16.070
say the same about, for instance, uh um the

238
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.840
role of vitamin B 12 in um erythropoiesis for

239
00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:23.830
forms of blood cancer, for instance, like in that

240
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.039
case, of course, there is still the causal contribution

241
00:13:26.049 --> 00:13:29.070
is not that vitamin B 12 stops uh intervening

242
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.429
we don't have uh unless there are like, for

243
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.619
instance, uh severe uh lack of vitamin B 12,

244
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.260
but that's a bit of a different case. Uh

245
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.020
But what happens is that it is the process

246
00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:42.669
to which these molecules are contributing that is dysfunctioning.

247
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:45.359
Why? Because it's not doing what it has been

248
00:13:45.369 --> 00:13:48.849
selected to do. So it uh it is, it

249
00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:51.270
is behaving differently. And, and I think that this

250
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.940
is really a powerful tool that uh bringing in

251
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.479
evolutionary consideration to functionality f because it can allow

252
00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:02.239
us to do this uh these distinctions between uh

253
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.630
these functions and, and functions,

254
00:14:05.489 --> 00:14:09.219
right? So let's get into kinds then, of course,

255
00:14:09.229 --> 00:14:13.760
we've probably already mentioned some biochemical kinds here. But

256
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.159
what are kinds more generally in science?

257
00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:20.179
Yes. So it is of course, like an excellent

258
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.580
question um especially when we are talking about ascribing

259
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.859
functions to, to different kinds. And I guess that

260
00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:29.369
we can take uh at at least a dual

261
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.789
answer to this kind of like minimal answer and

262
00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:34.099
a more elaborated answer. And I think that like

263
00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:36.739
the minimal answer is that well, kinds are just

264
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.659
types of things. So so we can like use

265
00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:43.299
kind talk to just mean that while things are

266
00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:47.770
clustered into different categories. Uh AND um and we

267
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.070
can distinguish them because they can be clustered into

268
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.429
different categories. And this is a kind of like

269
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.380
weak use of the of kind talk. I think

270
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.739
that in philosophy of science and in metaphysics of

271
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.130
science, in particular, the term kind is a bit

272
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.260
more loaded than, than type to. Uh AND it's

273
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.859
generally refers to the fact that we tend to

274
00:15:06.869 --> 00:15:11.169
classify objects or processes into group of things and

275
00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:15.849
these groups of things are kind. Now, these kinds

276
00:15:15.859 --> 00:15:19.609
can at least be divided into being real or

277
00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:23.510
natural kinds. Uh And here, I'm conflating the distinction

278
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.250
even if of course, there is a huge debate

279
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.429
on whether we we can do this. Um And

280
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.520
uh more conventional or um instrumental kinds. So we

281
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.729
can classify things into clusters that we think or

282
00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:38.659
respond to real divisions in nature, or we can

283
00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:42.049
classify things into cluster, which are just useful for

284
00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:46.130
scientific purposes. Uh And, and then in that, we

285
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.320
don't really have a commitment into trying to, for

286
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
instance, understand whether there are real distinctions in nature.

287
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.630
And I think that classic examples also here is

288
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.289
that we can take different molecules of gold and

289
00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:01.419
classify them under the kind of gold. And with

290
00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:03.049
that, we want to say, well, there is some

291
00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:06.734
such as at least the gold molecules which share

292
00:16:06.744 --> 00:16:10.395
something in nature for which we cluster them together.

293
00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:13.775
Or we can take for instance, the category vegetables

294
00:16:13.784 --> 00:16:16.715
in nutrition uh which seems to be much more

295
00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:19.125
of an instrumental kind. Why? Because we are clustering

296
00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:24.034
together different things um because it is useful. Uh

297
00:16:24.044 --> 00:16:27.094
BUT this distinction doesn't correspond to, for instance, a

298
00:16:27.104 --> 00:16:32.159
botanical distinction uh as stuff like uh spinach or

299
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:36.659
tomatoes would classify as vegetables in nutrition. Uh But

300
00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:41.530
their biological um classification is different. And uh technically,

301
00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:43.919
tomatoes are a fruit uh even if we wouldn't

302
00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:47.150
consider them as such uh and uh and, and

303
00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:49.640
related. So I think that this is quite an

304
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:54.010
important uh contrasting category and I do think that

305
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.530
there are some kinds that fall in between. So

306
00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:00.109
now I'm also working on the notion of investigative

307
00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:03.190
kinds. So kinds that are good for investigation in

308
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.010
which we can use to try to unpack what's,

309
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.770
what's really going on. And I think that for

310
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.439
instance, the kind vitamin is there into the investigative

311
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:15.218
notion, uh and the kind gene as well, uh

312
00:17:15.229 --> 00:17:17.828
which I know we can talk about later. It's

313
00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:20.578
something that can go into that direction that is

314
00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:25.438
it has been introduced as conventional or as instrumental.

315
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:28.358
So we don't want to have commitment in the

316
00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:30.859
actual word about the existence of something such as

317
00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:33.568
the gene. But the introduction of the term allowed

318
00:17:33.578 --> 00:17:37.079
us to discover so many things to the point

319
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.239
that now at least maybe. So, I mean, I

320
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.010
would say that for instance, the molecular gene is,

321
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.939
is a natural kind. So it corresponds to something

322
00:17:44.949 --> 00:17:45.609
existent.

323
00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:49.770
Mhm Yeah. So we'll probably come back to the

324
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.819
investigative investigative kinds later when we talk about genes

325
00:17:53.829 --> 00:17:56.250
then. But let me ask you when it comes

326
00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.060
to natural or real kinds, how do we determine

327
00:18:00.069 --> 00:18:04.150
that something is a natural kind? Are there specific

328
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.000
criteria?

329
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.900
Yeah. Yeah. So, um again, like extremely debated topic.

330
00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.459
Um And I would say that um I, I

331
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.680
wouldn't want to commit on a definition that has

332
00:18:18.689 --> 00:18:21.569
to be uh valid in, in all of these

333
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:23.430
cases. I don't find that, of course, we need

334
00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:27.920
to do the empirical investigation also to corroborate our

335
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.339
theories. But generally, I need to say that uh

336
00:18:30.349 --> 00:18:32.780
I am quite fond of a theory of natural

337
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.099
kinds that has been proposed by Mohammed Ali Khalidi.

338
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.640
And I think that his account is quite powerful

339
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.790
uh in that it allows it, it at least

340
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.949
gives us uh some tools to distinguish natural from

341
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.760
conventional kinds. And these are the fact that these

342
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.819
kinds present properties which are project. What does it

343
00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:52.479
mean? It means that we can do prediction and

344
00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:56.474
explain based on inferring the presence of a property

345
00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:58.415
from one kind to one another. So the moment

346
00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:01.555
in which we consider these properties that are associated

347
00:19:01.564 --> 00:19:03.425
to the kind we are able to predict and

348
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:08.305
explain stuff about instances of the kind. Uh And

349
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.385
the fact that these kinds have a role in

350
00:19:10.395 --> 00:19:13.505
our causal network. Now, this role is dual in

351
00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:16.785
the sense that the essences of the kinds um

352
00:19:16.795 --> 00:19:20.329
have a causal impact on the word because of

353
00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:22.750
the properties they display. So they can enter into

354
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.069
causal relation. And uh also the properties of the

355
00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:31.579
kinds are linked by causal connections. Uh So I

356
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:34.719
think that uh this this tool or the, yeah,

357
00:19:34.729 --> 00:19:38.689
this conceptual tool is quite powerful to, to distinguish

358
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:42.699
kinds or rather conventional from natural kinds or at

359
00:19:42.709 --> 00:19:46.079
least give us reason to investigate whether a kind

360
00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:48.260
is natural. So they can also be seen as

361
00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:51.750
a starting point but uh naturalness.

362
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.170
Mhm Does what we consider natural kinds depend on

363
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.530
the level of analysis we're using. So I was

364
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.760
thinking that for example, in biochemistry, we have, we

365
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.295
usually refer to molecules. But if we go down

366
00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:11.535
one level and we're looking at it through the

367
00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:16.055
lens of physics. Would the kinds there be the

368
00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:20.334
elements or even the subatomic particles? How do we

369
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.275
approach that?

370
00:20:21.604 --> 00:20:24.295
Yeah. Yeah. So I need to say that uh

371
00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:28.410
I am quite generous in my kind ascription. So

372
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.020
I would say that there are all these types

373
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.479
of kinds. Uh I know that like other philosophers

374
00:20:33.489 --> 00:20:37.250
like Thomas Taco that, that you interviewed and uh

375
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.239
and others would be, would have a much more

376
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.130
sparse account of natural kinds. They would say no,

377
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.359
like the only natural kinds are maybe like the

378
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:48.729
physical subatomic particles or if one wants to take

379
00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:50.530
like a very bottom up approach, you know, the

380
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.969
only natural kind is the universe and then everything

381
00:20:53.979 --> 00:20:56.609
guys is just a component. While I would say

382
00:20:56.619 --> 00:21:00.030
that I'm personally quite generous, I think that uh

383
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.199
yes, it depends on the type of entity that

384
00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:06.000
you are considering and that kinds can really be

385
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.719
clustered in a way that doesn't even have to

386
00:21:08.729 --> 00:21:12.699
be hierarchical. Uh Like, I'm quite happy with like

387
00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:16.900
cross cutting kinds uh or kinds that are like

388
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.520
in different, like at the same entity can present

389
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.819
different types of kinds as well. So as you

390
00:21:21.829 --> 00:21:25.119
said, like if we take um even like a

391
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.040
complex molecule like water, then water can be kind

392
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.709
and then we can unpack it and we can

393
00:21:30.719 --> 00:21:32.589
see that there is oxygen and hydrogen and then

394
00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:34.199
we can unpack it and see that there are

395
00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:37.810
protons, neurons and electrons uh and, and, and so

396
00:21:37.819 --> 00:21:40.670
on and I personally don't have a problem with

397
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.530
that. So my, my, my ontology is quite busy

398
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.020
there. There are a lot of things.

399
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.640
Yeah. No, I was just asking because I mean,

400
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.380
if we want to be as reductive as possible,

401
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.699
there are people out there, philosophers of science, scientists

402
00:21:56.709 --> 00:22:00.920
that would probably argue that the only real natural

403
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.885
kinds are the ones that we can find that

404
00:22:03.895 --> 00:22:08.234
the physics level. And so things like subatomic particles

405
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.795
and, and stuff like that and all the rest

406
00:22:10.925 --> 00:22:14.395
that we find above that level are not really

407
00:22:14.405 --> 00:22:16.895
are not real kinds, I guess.

408
00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:20.790
Yes. Yes. No, I don't like that. Um I

409
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.089
think that the word, like I need to say

410
00:22:23.099 --> 00:22:24.729
that as a kind of rule of thumb, I

411
00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:27.920
do find causality quite important. Like if something is

412
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.689
an important causal role, then we should take his

413
00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:34.060
ontological profile at least seriously. Uh So we should

414
00:22:34.069 --> 00:22:37.790
at least investigate um whether we, we have a

415
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.750
kind there. So uh yes,

416
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.709
and what uh to get into biochemistry specifically? What

417
00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:49.339
are biochemical kinds then?

418
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:52.989
Yes. So, well, again, here I start from a

419
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.329
term that comes from the discipline biochemistry. But I

420
00:22:56.339 --> 00:22:59.689
think that in my understanding of biochemical kinds, we

421
00:22:59.699 --> 00:23:04.640
find all those molecules, ma molecules compounds that ever

422
00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:09.410
all in um living systems. And that actually present

423
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.219
a combination of structural functional and evolutionary properties. So

424
00:23:14.229 --> 00:23:17.660
this is how I understand them because um of

425
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.140
course, I I take that from the term biochemistry,

426
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.500
but I want to include also maybe kinds that

427
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.089
studied by structural biology uh by molecular biology. So

428
00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:30.839
basically, like all those um chemical entities on the

429
00:23:30.849 --> 00:23:34.060
one hand that display also these properties that are

430
00:23:34.069 --> 00:23:39.420
relevant for life and for biological beings. So classic

431
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.369
examples are proteins which are of course one of

432
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.569
the main um the main cases, but I would

433
00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:50.040
also include vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, uh which are crucial

434
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.209
for membranes and the DNA and RN A which

435
00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:56.900
are crucial for her heredity uh and also protein

436
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.109
synthesis. So these are all molecules that maybe like

437
00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:04.599
in the different departments are studied by different people.

438
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:08.270
But they think that they share important properties and

439
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.250
uh my characterization of them is that uh linking

440
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.290
it. But what we were saying about kinds is

441
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.000
that in order to have these biochemical kinds as

442
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.785
I intend them, we need to have some chemical

443
00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:24.104
structural properties that we need to identify. And the

444
00:24:24.114 --> 00:24:26.425
investigation in itself of the notion of structure in

445
00:24:26.435 --> 00:24:29.535
biochemistry is quite interesting because these molecules are macro

446
00:24:29.714 --> 00:24:32.295
molecules most of the times. And so they don't

447
00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:36.675
fit easily into the discussion of chemical structure in

448
00:24:36.685 --> 00:24:39.854
the philosophy of chemistry literature because normally they focus

449
00:24:39.864 --> 00:24:44.939
on stuff like uh either single elements which are

450
00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:48.709
the most mostly discussed case study or um things

451
00:24:48.719 --> 00:24:51.670
like water, which in a way are, is still

452
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.760
much simpler than something like a protein, for instance,

453
00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:59.430
uh then they need to have a function. And

454
00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:01.780
uh and this relates to the whole discussion on

455
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.300
like proteins functionality, but basically like it's this role

456
00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:09.969
into biological processes. And this brings in evolutionary considerations

457
00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:13.189
that is these molecules again, don't display random functions,

458
00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:17.390
they display functions in processes that have been selected.

459
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.890
Um And they can have this causal contribution role.

460
00:25:21.949 --> 00:25:24.800
So, and maybe even uh but this is really

461
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.890
something that I'm still trying to work out is

462
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.050
that we can maybe even put a constraint on

463
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.339
the fact that these molecules do have that should

464
00:25:33.349 --> 00:25:36.209
be biosynthesis or there should be the possibility of

465
00:25:36.219 --> 00:25:40.910
them being biosynthesis that is synthesized by organisms. Even

466
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.000
if of course, this now, especially with the new

467
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.130
tools that have just been awarded by the Nobel

468
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.780
Prize, for instance, in which we can predict new

469
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.619
molecules structure, design new molecules um for proteins. Uh

470
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.979
Maybe this criteria is a bit too strict. But

471
00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:56.770
I think that still the fact that like these

472
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.420
molecules need to play a role in processes that

473
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.030
have been selected uh is important. So again, the

474
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.569
context is important.

475
00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:07.869
And so let me just ask you when it

476
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.709
comes, when we're talking, for example, about proteins or

477
00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:16.410
about lipids or about uh DNA, for example, uh

478
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.359
o of course, they have smaller components. They are

479
00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.895
building blocks like in the case of proteins. We

480
00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:24.375
have amino acids. In the case of lipids, we

481
00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:27.415
have fatty acids. In the case of DNA, we

482
00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:32.645
have N nucleotides. So would those be kinds or

483
00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:35.734
how would you deal with the building the building

484
00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:37.694
blocks there? What would you call them?

485
00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:40.635
Yeah, I would say that they are definitely chemical

486
00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:45.099
kind. Um So again, like given that I am

487
00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:47.670
quite generous in my kind subscription, I think that

488
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.380
they are general, there are chemical kinds. We can

489
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.579
identify chemical structural properties, probably they can fit easily

490
00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:58.849
into forms of micros structuralism, which is generally the

491
00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:03.380
criteria applied for um for chemical kinds. Uh So

492
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.859
I think that uh yes, like they, they would

493
00:27:06.869 --> 00:27:10.170
be. So I think that basically these components become

494
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.150
biochemical in the moment in which they are assembled

495
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.989
in the right way. So I think that that's

496
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.790
important and in the, and in the moment in

497
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.750
which they can display the functionality that they have.

498
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.630
So in the moment in which we can uh

499
00:27:24.239 --> 00:27:27.800
yeah, think about the function that they display and

500
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.000
the role that they play in organisms uh that

501
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.790
have evolved.

502
00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:34.880
Uh That's a very interesting point that you just

503
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.969
made there. So is it possible to identify exactly

504
00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:44.280
at what point a molecule becomes a biomolecule or

505
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.520
when it's just an inorganic molecule, let's say,

506
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.969
yeah, I think that probably it's not easy to

507
00:27:51.979 --> 00:27:54.170
identify the exact moment, but I would say that

508
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.959
the moment in which it plays a role in

509
00:27:55.969 --> 00:27:59.550
a biological system, it becomes one. So I do

510
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.020
have this quite dynamic view of the interactions between

511
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.150
the so-called chemical and biological interfaces or chemical and

512
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.905
biological domains. Um And I think that, yeah, if

513
00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:13.155
I would put it in a nutshell in a

514
00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:15.765
kind of catchy way which is not super precise,

515
00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:18.185
but maybe gives the idea is that a chemical

516
00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:23.275
molecules become biomolecule. But yeah, or a biochemical in

517
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:25.375
the moment in which it plays a function in

518
00:28:25.385 --> 00:28:29.229
an evolved system. Uh So there is this uh

519
00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:31.660
there is this component I know that there are

520
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.410
counter examples like tricky cases. So for instance, what

521
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.739
about magnesium uh or lithium, they play important physiological

522
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.380
roles while we would still understand them osmotic chemical

523
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.709
uh entities. At the end, there are elements. Uh

524
00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:49.780
And I think that there is like an interesting

525
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.969
case in which we have a chemical element or

526
00:28:52.979 --> 00:28:57.089
a chemical kind that displays a biochemical function because

527
00:28:57.099 --> 00:29:00.579
in the moment in which magnesium is contributing to

528
00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:03.920
specific physiological property uh processes or even when they

529
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.800
say that like magnesium hates sleep. This is a

530
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.839
very like um yeah, kind of maybe a very

531
00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:13.599
distal function because we're looking at a really an

532
00:29:13.609 --> 00:29:16.250
overall organism thing. But this is one of these

533
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.910
cases in which we have chemical kinds like elements

534
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.589
that display a biochemical function. Why? Because they enter

535
00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:29.339
into uh selected processes and they manifest like specific

536
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.859
contributions. Um AS yeah, II I don't think that

537
00:29:33.869 --> 00:29:37.800
we can really be the kind of like police

538
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.949
there in like saying, oh you are biochemical, you

539
00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:41.930
are chemical like all the time because I think

540
00:29:41.939 --> 00:29:44.459
that a lot of analysis should be done case

541
00:29:44.469 --> 00:29:47.699
by case. Uh But generally, there is this idea

542
00:29:47.709 --> 00:29:49.930
that in the moment in which we find an

543
00:29:49.939 --> 00:29:55.119
interaction uh in evolutionary processes, we we find something

544
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.739
biochemical and if we want to make it even

545
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.670
more strict, then we can say, well, not only

546
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.089
that, but also the fact that the processes have

547
00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:08.229
been selected to interact with those molecules. So again,

548
00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:08.969
context

549
00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:13.790
uh so in that specific case, they would, we

550
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.410
would determine them as being biomolecules functionally and from

551
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.479
an evolutionary perspective as well, right? I mean, because

552
00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:25.229
we can find, for example, lithium and other ions

553
00:30:25.239 --> 00:30:30.915
and other molecules also in geological processes, for example,

554
00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:33.395
in rocks and stuff like that. But in those

555
00:30:33.405 --> 00:30:37.594
specific cases, since they are not performing a biological

556
00:30:37.604 --> 00:30:41.824
or a physiological function, they are not biomolecules even

557
00:30:41.834 --> 00:30:44.984
though they are exactly the same kinds of molecules.

558
00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:47.944
Right? Yes, exactly. This is exactly what I would

559
00:30:47.954 --> 00:30:48.444
say.

560
00:30:49.489 --> 00:30:52.109
Uh And so uh le let me just ask

561
00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:55.829
you because uh within the domain of proteins, we

562
00:30:55.839 --> 00:31:00.500
have a very specific subcategory that is enzyme. So

563
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.430
how do we deal with them? Uh HOW do

564
00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:04.750
you deal with them? Uh Do you say that

565
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.449
enzymes are also a kind or not?

566
00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:13.189
Yes, I would say. So uh I would say

567
00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:15.560
that like enzymes are also kind and like and

568
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:20.150
structural proteins are a different or like molecular motors

569
00:31:20.189 --> 00:31:23.020
are different kinds. Uh That is, these are like

570
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.349
subcategories. And then again, given that I'm quite loose

571
00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:29.569
and I'm happy with having like crosscut kinds. I'm

572
00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:32.479
also happy for the same type of protein to

573
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:35.869
display different uh roles even at that level. So

574
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.329
one of my favorite examples are crystalline uh crystalline

575
00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:43.810
are moonlighting proteins as they are called. Exactly because

576
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:48.069
they can display uh an enzymatic function in digestion

577
00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:53.050
and the structural function inside. And uh they do

578
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.050
so basically by tweaking their ters structure a little

579
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.609
bit. So per se, they, they had the same

580
00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:02.140
protein like they are classified as the same protein

581
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.869
mostly because uh they display the same primary and

582
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.099
tertiary structure uh to a great extent. But there

583
00:32:10.109 --> 00:32:13.640
are differences like slight differences in the tertiary structure

584
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.880
which allow the molecules to perform different roles or

585
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.380
simply the inter the basically the surface of the

586
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:25.250
tertiary structure just gets slight modifications uh in a

587
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.359
way that then they can uh display different functions.

588
00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:31.530
And by displaying different functions, we can classify them

589
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.219
as like enzymes or as structural proteins in the

590
00:32:35.229 --> 00:32:38.400
different biological processes. So again, the fact that they

591
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.380
happen to be uh in processes that have, that

592
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.000
have a different evolutionary history, like the digestive process

593
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.329
and the side process uh allows us to identify

594
00:32:48.339 --> 00:32:50.729
which pro which properties are relevant?

595
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.699
Mhm. But in biochemistry, since we are combining biology

596
00:32:56.709 --> 00:33:02.689
with chemistry, do you distinguish between biological and chemical

597
00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:05.849
functions? Is that something you do or not?

598
00:33:07.099 --> 00:33:10.400
Well, so I think that well in biochemistry in

599
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.939
itself as a discipline, like I'm not a biochemist,

600
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:16.040
so probably uh my answer uh will just come

601
00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.199
from me studying biochemistry. Uh But I don't think

602
00:33:19.209 --> 00:33:21.979
that um there is a clear distinction between that.

603
00:33:21.989 --> 00:33:23.859
I think that the notion of function is used

604
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:26.900
quite loosely and to mean different things in different

605
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.369
contexts. I do think that as a philosopher, for

606
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.739
instance, one of the useful thing that we can

607
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.560
do is to provide conceptual clarity by saying that

608
00:33:36.569 --> 00:33:40.089
there are different notions of functionality at play according

609
00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:42.709
to what we want to consider. So I think

610
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:45.670
that it is important to go um to distinguish

611
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.699
chemical functions from biochemical functions from biological functions because

612
00:33:50.709 --> 00:33:54.859
these are going to tell us different information um

613
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.180
about the energy that we are considering that. So

614
00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:03.540
chemical functions are quite loosely um applied in uh

615
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.119
in a description of functional groups, functional groups are

616
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.699
specific structural features of a chemical molecule uh or

617
00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:15.500
compound or element which allow them to enter into

618
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.389
specific reactions. So it's basically what is telling us

619
00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:22.969
uh the reactivity profile of a molecule. As you

620
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:26.489
can imagine if we take uh the molecules that

621
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.409
are normally considered in biochemistry, these molecules are massive,

622
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.489
they are very very big and they will have

623
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.000
loads of functional profiles in principle. Uh There will

624
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.590
be lots of different reactions in which the molecules

625
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.030
can enter. And it is why the moment in

626
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.050
which for instance, we want to consider the function

627
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.188
of vitamin B 12 in eroses or the function

628
00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:51.080
of hemoglobin in binding and releasing oxygen. We are

629
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.290
not interested in all the functional profiles of the

630
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.199
macro molecules. We are interested in very specific ones.

631
00:34:57.209 --> 00:35:00.260
We are interested in those parts of the molecules

632
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.729
and those chemical physical properties really which allow the

633
00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.919
molecule to display the function in the given system.

634
00:35:07.479 --> 00:35:10.520
And I think that for simpler molecules like for

635
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.719
instance, vitamin B 12, which at the end are

636
00:35:12.729 --> 00:35:16.600
forms of cobalamin, then we can identify some functional

637
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.919
groups which are the specific ones that are able

638
00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:22.600
to enter into the reactions relevant for a retro

639
00:35:23.209 --> 00:35:26.949
pois. But if we consider molecules like proteins, then

640
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:30.370
not only we need to consider the chemical properties

641
00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:32.370
of the molecule, but we also need to consider

642
00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:36.129
the shape. So the ters structure is crucial because

643
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.750
again, here, it's interesting why we need to distinguish

644
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.500
chemical from biochemical functions. Because for instance, hemoglobin doesn't

645
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.879
only need to bind oxygen. The hemoglobin is to

646
00:35:45.889 --> 00:35:48.679
release oxygen at the right time. So we need

647
00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:52.770
to get this capacity um to bind the end

648
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.540
release oxygen, which is for which the the the

649
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.760
territory and then the quaternary structure uh is actually

650
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.840
crucial and then to this, we can add the

651
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.800
biological functionality, which I think is really the selected

652
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.620
effect your functionality I find is the most accepted

653
00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:12.570
and successful uh account of functionality. And then for

654
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.540
that, we need evolutionary history. Uh And I think

655
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.429
that biological function ID can be applied differently to,

656
00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:24.110
to different molecules uh because they can display a

657
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.649
more or less direct form of evolutionary history. So

658
00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:31.709
again, taking examples, vitamin B 12 as a more

659
00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:34.870
direct evolutionary history in the bacteria and archaea that

660
00:36:34.879 --> 00:36:38.250
synthesize the molecule so that we can identify what

661
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.600
are the processes that have been selected to synthesize

662
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.560
the molecule in the organism while for the great

663
00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:47.169
majority of mammals, but also algae. Uh Another species

664
00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.489
which rely on, on, on vitamin B 12, we

665
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.590
need to consider a much bigger evolutionary history because

666
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.189
we need to get vitamin B 12 from those

667
00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:59.250
bacterias that are synthesizing the molecule. And this happens

668
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.550
by a lot of different ecosystem interactions. And this

669
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.479
is of course different from the evolutionary history of

670
00:37:06.489 --> 00:37:09.879
a protein that we synthesize such as hemoglobin. Um

671
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.010
BECAUSE in that case, we can identi and and

672
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.510
other proteins, we can identify a specific set of

673
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.760
genes or uh uh specific sequences which are encoding

674
00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:23.669
for the protein. And for some of these proteins

675
00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:26.340
is it's possible to have a direct evolutionary history.

676
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.479
Like we can track it, we can compare it.

677
00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:31.469
There is a lot of really fascinating study on.

678
00:37:31.479 --> 00:37:34.929
Um YEAH, comparing the different evolutionary history of proteins.

679
00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:37.870
Uh And there we can apply biological functionality in

680
00:37:37.879 --> 00:37:41.489
a different way because somehow it's more direct uh

681
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.209
so we can track it,

682
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.239
right? One very interesting thing that you mentioned there

683
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.909
are glossed over a little bit was the fact

684
00:37:51.229 --> 00:37:53.209
that uh at a certain point you mentioned uh

685
00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:57.270
tertiary structure, the tertiary structure of proteins. And I

686
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.030
mean, it's very interesting because at least in the

687
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.580
particular case of proteins, if I understand it correctly,

688
00:38:03.679 --> 00:38:07.409
their function depends a lot on the way they

689
00:38:07.419 --> 00:38:10.550
are structured, right? I mean, uh uh the uh

690
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.764
it, it, it sort the f their function sort

691
00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:17.094
of derives at least to some extent from the

692
00:38:17.104 --> 00:38:20.524
way they are structured physically.

693
00:38:20.625 --> 00:38:24.625
Right? Yes. Yes, exactly. Um And this is uh

694
00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:28.885
this is really fascinating uh because um the FF

695
00:38:29.014 --> 00:38:31.185
folding can happen in many ways. So we move

696
00:38:31.195 --> 00:38:34.405
from basically the result of the uh of DNA

697
00:38:34.415 --> 00:38:37.284
expression to the test structure. This can happen in

698
00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:40.625
many, many ways. Uh But somehow what is what

699
00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:44.760
matters that is really the shape um because basically,

700
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.060
like it creates different surfaces that can then uh

701
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:52.179
interact differently in different contexts, which is why again,

702
00:38:52.189 --> 00:38:55.399
like there is um that has been uh the

703
00:38:55.409 --> 00:38:58.729
importance of uh for instance, the discoveries awarded by

704
00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:02.070
the Nobel Prize are so important because they allow

705
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.320
us to go from primary to tertiary structure, which

706
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.120
is where the functionality happens

707
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:10.969
Mhm. And so let's talk then a little bit

708
00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:14.879
about genes earlier at a certain point. You, I

709
00:39:14.889 --> 00:39:17.979
think if I remember correctly, you talked about genes

710
00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:21.979
as a sort of investigative kind. So te tell

711
00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:24.959
us about that. What is, uh, gene? Exactly?

712
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.620
Yeah. So, um, I think that the genes are

713
00:39:28.629 --> 00:39:32.800
a very fascinating notion because, um, they developed like

714
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.000
the kind of extension and intention of the gene,

715
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.030
the changed a lot, um through time. And I

716
00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.770
think that it is quite important to specify which

717
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.689
type of gene we are talking about. So if

718
00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:47.600
we are talking about a molecular gene or if

719
00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.040
we are talking about a medallion gene, and at

720
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.699
which point in the history of molecular biology, we

721
00:39:53.709 --> 00:39:55.870
are talking about genes because the term has been

722
00:39:55.879 --> 00:39:58.879
really changing. Now, I would say that if we

723
00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:02.205
want to make everyone happy, a common understanding of

724
00:40:02.215 --> 00:40:04.504
the gene is the one of the molecular gene

725
00:40:04.754 --> 00:40:07.995
and then the gene becomes a stretch or a

726
00:40:08.004 --> 00:40:12.074
string uh often contiguous of DNA and RN A

727
00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:15.264
that is encoding for the primary structure of a

728
00:40:15.274 --> 00:40:19.600
protein or other functional RN A molecules. And this

729
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.389
is the kind of generally accepted definition, we also

730
00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:26.659
find uh the definition of the Mendelian Gena, which

731
00:40:26.669 --> 00:40:31.310
is uh which are these groups of actually stretches

732
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.770
of DNA which encode for a trade. And as

733
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.030
you can imagine, the scale of this is quite

734
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.280
different because in the molecular gene definition, we are

735
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.870
considering just the bits that are going to encode

736
00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:44.909
for a protein, which of course is quite long,

737
00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:48.199
but it's still way less complex than for instance,

738
00:40:48.209 --> 00:40:51.449
the gene for the nose or for the heart

739
00:40:51.459 --> 00:40:54.489
or for um or for other traits. So I

740
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.100
think that these are the two big notions that

741
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.639
we find in the literature. Uh I mostly worked

742
00:41:01.649 --> 00:41:04.199
on the notion of the molecular gen as this

743
00:41:04.209 --> 00:41:06.889
is really where a lot of the interactions uh

744
00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:10.000
between uh uh chemistry and biology happen and between

745
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.989
life and chemical entities happen. Uh And I think

746
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.439
that the definition that I gave while it is

747
00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:20.010
informative at like at the first stage is actually

748
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.760
quite inaccurate in the moment in which we consider

749
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.780
new discoveries, in particular, the discoveries of the last

750
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.199
40 years. Uh And what is called like the

751
00:41:28.209 --> 00:41:32.870
post genomic revolution or a post genomic change um

752
00:41:32.879 --> 00:41:36.120
in which thanks to the, the new discoveries that

753
00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:38.750
we have made, we noticed that actually genes are

754
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.520
not, for instance, identical to conti stretches of DNA.

755
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:47.219
Uh And uh to this discovery and that like

756
00:41:47.229 --> 00:41:51.500
actually, for instance, um polypeptide chains can be transcribed

757
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.270
by noncontiguous stretches of DNA that the same stretch

758
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.659
of DNA can encode for many different products. So

759
00:41:57.669 --> 00:42:00.520
there is a lot of complexity there and uh

760
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.290
some of the reactions to these have been uh

761
00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:07.959
eliminate, at least in a kind of ontological sense

762
00:42:07.969 --> 00:42:10.139
that is, well, there is nothing like the gene,

763
00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:12.649
the gene doesn't exist, we have DNA, we have

764
00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:17.780
expression and these matters. Uh I don't walk that

765
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.449
route. Uh I think that actually what we can

766
00:42:20.459 --> 00:42:23.439
do is that we can consider genes as temporal

767
00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:26.669
entities. So this is quite, I know maybe a,

768
00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:28.870
a kind of crazy idea, but I think that

769
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:32.899
it works because uh I think of genes as

770
00:42:32.909 --> 00:42:37.969
um something that emerges or comes through uh expression.

771
00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:39.750
So they exist in the moment in which they

772
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.590
are transcribed basically. Uh And if we take this

773
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.580
temporal notion of gene and this uh kind of

774
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.850
flexible notion of genes, then genes can become entities

775
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:55.139
that exist as realized by specific sequences in a

776
00:42:55.149 --> 00:42:57.820
given moment in time. But in another moment in

777
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.709
time, the same sequences can realize or can constitute

778
00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:04.620
actually a different gene which has a different function

779
00:43:04.629 --> 00:43:10.139
because it encodes for a different protein or uh

780
00:43:10.149 --> 00:43:11.419
yeah, molecular products.

781
00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.149
Uh That's all very interesting. Uh And please correct

782
00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:17.070
me if I'm wrong. But if I understand it

783
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.090
correctly, we don't have uh uh the, the entirety

784
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.300
of the information we need to produce a protein

785
00:43:25.459 --> 00:43:29.179
in just the gene alone because in going from

786
00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:33.260
the gene through the transcription to MRN A and

787
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.979
then translation through TRN A and then getting the

788
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.350
the protein itself, we go through several steps where

789
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.090
post transcription factors, for example, play a role, right?

790
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.879
I mean, so what I'm trying to say is

791
00:43:47.889 --> 00:43:52.860
that uh when it comes to the information necessary

792
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:56.669
to produce a protein, it's not entirely in the

793
00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.239
gene itself.

794
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.620
Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's, this is, this is very

795
00:44:01.629 --> 00:44:04.840
true. And again, I think that uh the context

796
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:09.090
in which gene expression happen matters massively. Like, I

797
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.340
really love this definition from Griffiths and sts kala

798
00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:15.199
dos that the genes are things that cells do

799
00:44:15.209 --> 00:44:18.889
with their genome. Uh BECAUSE this gives the idea

800
00:44:18.899 --> 00:44:21.429
of the fact that like the cellular context is

801
00:44:21.439 --> 00:44:25.050
massively important for the determination of all of this

802
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.330
behavior and all of this uh reading. And then

803
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.889
of course, with that, all the factors around the

804
00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:35.489
sequences which you mentioned again, like recently awarded discovery

805
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.780
of Macro RN A and the the role that

806
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.500
it has in uh uh in these processes, the

807
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.649
fact that like genes are regulated, the fact that

808
00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:47.020
there are networks, uh all of these market ma

809
00:44:47.129 --> 00:44:50.570
massively. So like genes are a highly contextual entities

810
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.399
in the sense that um they are really realized

811
00:44:53.409 --> 00:44:57.090
by this very complex machinery, which is uh offered

812
00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.159
first firstly by the cell. Uh And then, um

813
00:45:01.169 --> 00:45:04.110
and then even by the, the whole organism matters.

814
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.540
And I think that this probably was one of

815
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.050
the most surprising thing about some of the research

816
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.169
projects. Uh FOR instance, the human genome project that

817
00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:15.219
they were hoping that in the moment in which

818
00:45:15.229 --> 00:45:17.169
you get the sequence, you will get all the

819
00:45:17.179 --> 00:45:19.820
information that you need. Uh And this, of course,

820
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.899
and this has proven to be quite disappointing because

821
00:45:22.909 --> 00:45:24.500
actually, it is the way in which you read

822
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.250
the sequence, the way in which the sequence is

823
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.729
transcribed, the whole interactions that happen in the cell

824
00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:33.060
that for a lot of phenomena are, are really

825
00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.209
important. This of course, doesn't mean that there aren't

826
00:45:36.219 --> 00:45:40.070
specific cases in which actually having the sequences is

827
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.820
telling you everything you need. Like luckily for medicine,

828
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.479
we know that there are some diseases that are

829
00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:48.790
caused by very specific sequences. And the fact that

830
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.989
we have this knowledge allows us to intervene. Uh

831
00:45:51.439 --> 00:45:54.709
BUT generally for uh the great majority of the

832
00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:57.270
other genes and for a lot of complex um

833
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.100
phenomena, the interaction is way more complicated than uh

834
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.389
just the realization of a sequence.

835
00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:07.389
Mhm. Yeah, it's very interesting. So there's a lot,

836
00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:09.620
if I understand it correctly, there's a lot of

837
00:46:09.629 --> 00:46:13.929
context dependency here when it comes to genes and

838
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.919
uh the link between, for example, genes and traits

839
00:46:17.929 --> 00:46:20.030
or genes and proteins. Right.

840
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.030
Yes. Yes, exactly. Um I, I do think that

841
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.760
there is um that context dependence is, is really

842
00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:30.899
crucial for uh all of the biochemical stuff really.

843
00:46:30.909 --> 00:46:33.639
So genes in particular are, are an important case.

844
00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:36.209
But also for everything we talked about, I think

845
00:46:36.219 --> 00:46:39.570
that context is crucial. Now, some philosophers I know

846
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.610
uh take context as a threat, as a threat

847
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.780
to naturalness or as a threat to reality. Like

848
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.020
if something is context dependent is like less existent.

849
00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:51.699
Uh I don't endorse that. I think that first,

850
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:55.669
it is important to distinguish context dependency from discipline,

851
00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:59.389
dependency. That is for instance, like it's not the

852
00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:02.949
fact that I am a biologist or a chemist

853
00:47:02.959 --> 00:47:05.830
that matters for my understanding for the gene, it

854
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.070
can influence my empirical study. So I can decide

855
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.040
to focus more on some properties rather than others.

856
00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:15.760
Um But it is really like an epistemic distinction

857
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.159
or the main distinction. And this is really epistemic.

858
00:47:19.459 --> 00:47:22.459
Uh And maybe that can actually matter for instance,

859
00:47:22.469 --> 00:47:25.739
for uh uh naturalness or non naturalness or uh

860
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.370
kind. But I, I think that context dependence is

861
00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:33.300
something different as this relates to the actual interactions

862
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.100
that happen in the systems that we are considering.

863
00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:40.219
And um I don't consider that as a particular

864
00:47:40.229 --> 00:47:42.840
threat also because I think that everything is actually

865
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:46.479
really context dependent. Uh BECAUSE every time we don't

866
00:47:46.729 --> 00:47:50.060
consider context dependency, we are making an abstraction. So

867
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.919
we are getting rid of parts of the context

868
00:47:53.929 --> 00:47:56.429
in which uh something exists, which can be really

869
00:47:56.439 --> 00:48:00.830
useful for, for some specific purposes. Uh But then

870
00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.479
I actually find that yeah, things really get to

871
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:08.830
be what they are because of the context they

872
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.350
are in and the relationships they are in matter

873
00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.100
for their identity. And I think the genes are

874
00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.330
a paradigmatic case, but also what we talked about

875
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.909
earlier, like lithium in a mountain or magnesium in

876
00:48:18.919 --> 00:48:21.689
a mountain is going to be something different from

877
00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:24.280
me, taking my magnesium before going to sleep because

878
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:26.500
I want to sleep better. I just say,

879
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.689
yeah, no, it's, it's really very interesting. And I

880
00:48:32.699 --> 00:48:35.330
was thinking when you mentioned that there are people

881
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.800
out there who whenever we talk about context or

882
00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.270
context dependency, they think that the things who are

883
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.189
context dependent are less real than things who are

884
00:48:46.199 --> 00:48:49.879
not context dependent. Do you think that could be

885
00:48:49.889 --> 00:48:55.330
because many the philosophers of science and even even

886
00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.649
more so scientists themselves have this sort of substance

887
00:48:59.659 --> 00:49:03.260
ontology? And uh I mean, if they adopted, for

888
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.899
example, a process ontology, then it would be easier

889
00:49:06.909 --> 00:49:12.669
for them to understand processes themselves as being real

890
00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:15.790
instead of uh substances, for example.

891
00:49:16.659 --> 00:49:19.260
Uh Yeah, I think that there is definitely something

892
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.979
like that. I don't think that substance ontology necessarily

893
00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:26.570
is uh against context, but I find that definitely

894
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.090
the focus on intrinsic properties is so I think

895
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.560
that there has been historically this um preference for

896
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.239
intrinsic properties. Like I think that one studies the

897
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.540
history of philosophy of Western philosophy uh in the

898
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.939
great majority of cases. Uh THIS has been the

899
00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:43.659
case and of course, there is a value to

900
00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:49.139
it. Why? Because intrinsic properties favor stability stabilities is

901
00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:52.409
stability. So it's easier to identify, it's easier to

902
00:49:52.419 --> 00:49:55.120
rely on. So there is this and and it

903
00:49:55.129 --> 00:49:57.479
is quite useful. I do find that it's not

904
00:49:57.489 --> 00:49:59.870
that the process of abstraction in which we focus

905
00:49:59.879 --> 00:50:02.969
on what is stable are necessarily self defeating for

906
00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:06.179
empirical or epistemic purposes. I just think that in

907
00:50:06.189 --> 00:50:08.030
the moment in which we want to bring back

908
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.929
the entity into reality and we want to get

909
00:50:09.939 --> 00:50:13.090
an overall characterization of what something is, then we

910
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.530
need to be open to consider relational level properties

911
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.929
as well and it it extrinsic properties and uh

912
00:50:19.939 --> 00:50:24.209
then definitely something like a process ontology or even

913
00:50:24.219 --> 00:50:29.080
forms of antique structural realism uh can be really

914
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.469
insightful um uh in uh in, in our understanding.

915
00:50:33.479 --> 00:50:35.860
So I don't think that there is necessarily the

916
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.320
need to like get rid of objects or get

917
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.610
rid of substances. But I think that we need

918
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.139
to become a bit loser in the type of

919
00:50:43.149 --> 00:50:45.939
properties that we think are relevant for these entities,

920
00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:49.340
especially when we consider entities that are really at

921
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:54.409
the borders like biochemical entities or genes uh for

922
00:50:54.449 --> 00:50:56.110
which the interactions matter,

923
00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.879
right? Uh uh But because genes are so context

924
00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:04.649
dependent and we also have or add post post

925
00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:07.560
genomic discoveries, like for example, the fact that the

926
00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:11.080
expression of genes is regulated. And so we have

927
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.219
epigenetics and then also, as we mentioned earlier, we

928
00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:17.939
have a post transcription factors playing a role in

929
00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:20.620
the kinds of proteins that are produced, et cetera.

930
00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:26.169
Um Can we still consider genes natural kinds or

931
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:26.489
not?

932
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.780
Yeah. Yeah. Excellent question. I do think that like

933
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:33.800
molecular genes can still be considered natural kinds. Um

934
00:51:33.889 --> 00:51:36.389
BUT we need to consider the relevant properties for

935
00:51:36.399 --> 00:51:38.129
it. So we need to consider the fact that

936
00:51:38.139 --> 00:51:41.080
genes are not simply structural entities. So they are

937
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:44.669
not simply specific strands of DNA or RN A

938
00:51:44.679 --> 00:51:47.850
for, for some species. Uh The fact that genes

939
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.830
uh needs to have a functional provider, uh it

940
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.010
is very important and this brings in also the

941
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.510
evolutionary history. So those three properties that I mentioned

942
00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.179
earlier about biochemical kinds. So the fact that biochemical

943
00:52:00.189 --> 00:52:02.429
kinds need to have a structure and they need

944
00:52:02.439 --> 00:52:04.780
to have a function and they need to have

945
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:08.169
an evolutionary history matters for our consideration of the

946
00:52:08.179 --> 00:52:11.540
naturalness of the genes. I do find that like

947
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.199
genes are natural because they can be quite project.

948
00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.790
So the moment in which we consider genes in

949
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.899
terms of their expression and we are able to

950
00:52:18.909 --> 00:52:22.729
predict and explain a lot of things uh which

951
00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.989
is similar for cases as I mentioned earlier in

952
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.879
which the stretch of DNA that realizes the gene

953
00:52:27.889 --> 00:52:31.179
is quite stable. Uh But this is still possible

954
00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:33.570
for like a lot of research. And also genes

955
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.439
display a core role in our causal structure in

956
00:52:36.449 --> 00:52:40.750
the cells because they express the protein. So and

957
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.419
they encode the protein which in other, in other

958
00:52:43.429 --> 00:52:47.409
very important molecules and this as a crucial causal

959
00:52:47.419 --> 00:52:47.909
role.

960
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.580
Mhm So there's one last topic I would like

961
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.169
to ask you about and I think it's completely

962
00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:56.959
unrelated to what we've been talking about up till

963
00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:59.270
now. But I, I want to ask you because

964
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.070
I found it really interesting. Uh You've written on

965
00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.879
the application of virtue ethics to the context of

966
00:53:06.889 --> 00:53:10.159
the COVID-19 pandemic. Could you tell us about that?

967
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.610
Yes. Yes. Uh So this is uh yeah, really

968
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.739
a a side project. II, I need to say

969
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.189
that um I think of myself as like a

970
00:53:20.199 --> 00:53:23.080
philosopher that does mostly philosophy of science, but I

971
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.280
am interested in a lot of philosophical questions. So

972
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.689
I have a lot of, yeah, uh kind of

973
00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:32.120
like side projects and side interests and uh I

974
00:53:32.129 --> 00:53:35.649
guess it, those papers as for many of us

975
00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:37.820
really came from the fact that we got hit

976
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.560
by this very, like very harsh reality. Uh And

977
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:44.629
especially for myself, I was uh stuck in uh

978
00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:47.590
far away from home. I am originally from Italy.

979
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.750
Uh And as we know, like the north of

980
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.679
Italy in particular was really impacted by, by the

981
00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:54.649
pandemic and a part of me felt that I

982
00:53:54.659 --> 00:53:56.979
needed to do something about it, which I think

983
00:53:56.989 --> 00:54:00.719
was what a lot of people felt. Uh And,

984
00:54:00.729 --> 00:54:02.729
and, and my idea was like, OK, like there

985
00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.520
is a lot of talk which seems to be

986
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:09.989
based on ethical schemes that again are quite rigid.

987
00:54:10.459 --> 00:54:13.129
Uh And they don't consider the fact that like

988
00:54:13.139 --> 00:54:15.379
a lot of our actions are done by individuals

989
00:54:15.389 --> 00:54:17.699
in context. So I feel that probably there is

990
00:54:17.709 --> 00:54:21.300
this social context which comes in again. Uh And

991
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:23.639
so I wanted to suggest a paper in which

992
00:54:23.649 --> 00:54:26.500
if we bring in vir trades, which not only

993
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.050
focuses on the actions of the character of the

994
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.239
individual, but also as this flexibility regarding what we

995
00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.409
can, what each individual can do in each context

996
00:54:36.639 --> 00:54:40.500
compared to, for instance, a more indicating or a

997
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:46.360
more uh utilitarian ethics or consequentialist ethics um which

998
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.540
seems to be up at a much more like

999
00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.830
a group level or either like at a principal

1000
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.320
level. Uh I thought that uh yeah, exploring that

1001
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:57.679
would provide a different angle to a lot of

1002
00:54:57.689 --> 00:55:01.199
the talk that especially in the UK, which is

1003
00:55:01.209 --> 00:55:03.330
not a surprise, but there was a lot of

1004
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.159
like utilitarian mindset, like we need to think about

1005
00:55:06.239 --> 00:55:08.540
what is good for the majority, uh at least

1006
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:10.830
at the beginning because then of course, the the

1007
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.260
situation changed. Uh But there was a lot of,

1008
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:14.949
a lot of like, OK, we need to think

1009
00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:16.909
about what is good for the majority, what is

1010
00:55:16.919 --> 00:55:20.689
going to maximize the outcome and then if something

1011
00:55:20.699 --> 00:55:22.439
is going to get loose or someone is going

1012
00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:25.209
to get loose in the way, whatever kind of

1013
00:55:25.219 --> 00:55:28.449
thing. Uh And that really surprised me in a

1014
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:30.310
way or rather hit me personally. And I was

1015
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.820
like, OK, we, we, we need to think about

1016
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.949
these things from a different angle. I also found

1017
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:39.729
that those type of talk in that context was

1018
00:55:39.739 --> 00:55:42.820
also taking away agency from all of us because

1019
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.820
again, deciding for the majority is not something that

1020
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.620
an individual can do unless you are a politician

1021
00:55:48.629 --> 00:55:52.239
or someone that is in the ruler position. While

1022
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.100
instead deciding every day what I can do to

1023
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.889
contribute to my situation, which is what virtually invited

1024
00:55:58.899 --> 00:56:02.979
to gives us more agency, more control. Um EVEN

1025
00:56:02.989 --> 00:56:05.040
in situations of legal control, but you are not

1026
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:10.399
anymore um spectator of choices, but it can also

1027
00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:13.870
be quite empowering. So I think that those were

1028
00:56:13.879 --> 00:56:15.169
some of the motivations,

1029
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:20.350
but in this particular case of the COVID-19 pandemic,

1030
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.689
which virtues would you say are the most relevant

1031
00:56:24.699 --> 00:56:25.689
to consider here?

1032
00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:29.879
Yes, that's a good question. Um I do find

1033
00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:33.290
that generally like the virtue of prudence as it

1034
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:37.020
is understood, which is basically trying to evaluate in

1035
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:41.860
each circumstance, which virtues you should use uh was

1036
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:44.520
probably the most relevant prudence is also the most

1037
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.540
difficult virtue. Uh BECAUSE of course, it requires a

1038
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.820
lot of um analysis and control. I also find

1039
00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:55.629
that forms of bravery, not in the sense of

1040
00:56:55.639 --> 00:56:58.520
uh bravery as, oh, I go outside and face

1041
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:01.800
danger and uh I fight the virus because unfortunately,

1042
00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:05.090
we couldn't, we can't do that braver in the

1043
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.610
sense of OK, I might sacrifice some parts of

1044
00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.090
my well being if this is going to help

1045
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.510
someone else, if this is going to help someone

1046
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.780
that is maybe more vulnerable than myself. So there

1047
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:19.699
is this element of like, OK, maybe wearing a

1048
00:57:19.709 --> 00:57:23.139
mask is not pleasant, but if wearing a mask

1049
00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:27.129
can save someone or can at least contribute to

1050
00:57:27.469 --> 00:57:29.469
uh preventing that someone that is in a really

1051
00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:33.320
vulnerable position uh gets infected, then I can choose

1052
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:37.100
as an individual to do. So. Um So uh

1053
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:41.719
yeah, so probably like prudence, benevolence, uh courage or

1054
00:57:41.729 --> 00:57:47.120
like um being brave were definitely uh relevant virtues.

1055
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:51.250
What about humility? Do you think that it would

1056
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.939
also make sense as a virtue in the context

1057
00:57:53.949 --> 00:57:57.639
where perhaps we have to rely a lot on

1058
00:57:57.649 --> 00:57:59.560
what experts are saying?

1059
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.540
Yeah, that's a very good point. So I think

1060
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:07.189
that um humidity play a role, but I understand

1061
00:58:07.199 --> 00:58:10.239
that I think that we shouldn't go with the

1062
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:13.280
kind of like proper understanding of humidity in that

1063
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.000
case. Uh I think we should really like consider

1064
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:19.780
the definition of intellectual humility that is provided in

1065
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.280
a lot of the literature on the topic, which

1066
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:24.080
is the fact that we need to be able

1067
00:58:24.155 --> 00:58:28.094
to evaluate, when is the moment to step back

1068
00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.314
and when is the moment to come forward? So

1069
00:58:30.324 --> 00:58:32.514
when is the moment in which I don't have

1070
00:58:32.524 --> 00:58:35.945
the skills to for instance, understand the technicality of

1071
00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:38.254
a problem. But I do have the skills to

1072
00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:41.570
understand maybe the social component of it. And I

1073
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.219
actually think that probably the lack uh of good

1074
00:58:45.229 --> 00:58:49.639
intellectual humidity um has also been problematic on all

1075
00:58:49.649 --> 00:58:51.639
sides because for instance, the fact that we were

1076
00:58:51.649 --> 00:58:55.760
following maybe only the information that were coming from

1077
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.070
the sciences, which is very important because they tell

1078
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.659
us the mechanism, thanks to which the virus replicates

1079
00:59:00.669 --> 00:59:04.780
and spreads, they weren't though informed by, for instance,

1080
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:07.939
studies in sociology, psychology. OK. How do we deal

1081
00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:11.510
with loneliness? Uh And somehow the social sciences got

1082
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.080
pushed back a lot. And that was also a

1083
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:18.060
case in which somehow there wasn't much intellectual humidity,

1084
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.429
for instance, at the public uh at the policy

1085
00:59:20.439 --> 00:59:24.129
making level, because some sciences were really, really put

1086
00:59:24.139 --> 00:59:26.330
very high and others were put very low and

1087
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:31.389
not considered uh and probably both at the individual

1088
00:59:31.399 --> 00:59:34.290
level in which I can bring in my skills.

1089
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.110
And maybe I don't know if I, if I

1090
00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.510
am a teacher, uh I might need to learn

1091
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.820
from scientists how the virus spread. But then as

1092
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:45.149
a teacher, I might know what is good for

1093
00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:47.179
my students and the fact that maybe they need

1094
00:59:47.189 --> 00:59:49.949
specific interactions. And so we need to find ways

1095
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.919
to give students those interactions. Um AND also the

1096
00:59:53.929 --> 00:59:56.800
policy making level. So bringing in a form of

1097
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:59.770
a good intellectual humidity in which different sciences and

1098
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.120
different perspectives coming in on different domains.

1099
01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:09.620
Mhm Yeah, because uh I mean mentioning humility, perhaps

1100
01:00:09.629 --> 01:00:12.800
there was also not much humility, at least on

1101
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.610
the part of certain types of experts, like for

1102
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:21.030
example, uh doctors, epidemiologists and so on. Uh IMMUNOLOGISTS

1103
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.659
as well because uh when it comes to, as

1104
01:00:24.669 --> 01:00:27.250
you said, there are the social aspects of how

1105
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.495
we dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, things like loneliness,

1106
01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:35.314
isolation and stuff like that. Maybe people who could

1107
01:00:35.324 --> 01:00:39.564
have played an important role there, like psychologists, sociologists

1108
01:00:39.645 --> 01:00:43.794
were pushed aside and the stage was given more

1109
01:00:43.804 --> 01:00:48.205
to, uh as I said, doctors, epidemiologists, immunologists and

1110
01:00:48.215 --> 01:00:49.685
people like that. Right.

1111
01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:53.225
Yeah. Yeah. No. Exactly. Which I think that's something

1112
01:00:53.235 --> 01:00:55.354
I said, I don't think its underlying enough is

1113
01:00:55.364 --> 01:01:00.580
that um like these situations are always complex and

1114
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.929
so they might require complex solutions. So the fact

1115
01:01:02.939 --> 01:01:06.840
that we bring in psychologists and sociologists, for instance,

1116
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:09.649
on trying to understand the impact that loneliness can

1117
01:01:09.659 --> 01:01:13.879
have, especially on vulnerable categories like kids or teenagers.

1118
01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:17.669
Uh But and everyone doesn't meet doesn't imply that

1119
01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:20.250
then the fact that it is still true that

1120
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.469
the virus spreads in many ways is pushed away.

1121
01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:26.389
Like the the ideal thing is really to find

1122
01:01:26.479 --> 01:01:28.459
an interaction between the two, which is of course,

1123
01:01:28.469 --> 01:01:32.110
super difficult and in a situation of emergency that

1124
01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:35.350
we faced and especially the Western world hasn't faced

1125
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.860
anything like that in the longest period of time.

1126
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.110
Uh So of course, it makes sense that we

1127
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.830
didn't have the tools to, to see that clearly.

1128
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.169
But somehow the contrast wasn't really to put it

1129
01:01:46.179 --> 01:01:48.729
simply like, oh let us lock everybody up or

1130
01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:51.129
let us just let the virus spread because people

1131
01:01:51.139 --> 01:01:54.929
need sociality like probably the ideal solution was trying

1132
01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:58.120
to find a common ground between the two. And

1133
01:01:58.129 --> 01:02:00.260
in, in the, in this, I do find that

1134
01:02:00.989 --> 01:02:04.879
uh probably spreading education and empowering the individuals in

1135
01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:08.560
making choices uh could have been really useful because

1136
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.870
I also feel that giving this stage to just

1137
01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:14.969
the experts that were talking mostly in experts term,

1138
01:02:15.179 --> 01:02:18.870
just made people feel extraordinarily even more frustrated and

1139
01:02:18.879 --> 01:02:22.280
isolated because they didn't have the tools to understand

1140
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.090
what was going on. And, and that was a

1141
01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.889
problem, not of the people that didn't know or

1142
01:02:26.899 --> 01:02:29.620
didn't understand. That's a problem of those that communicate

1143
01:02:29.629 --> 01:02:32.659
such knowledge. And that's again, something else in which

1144
01:02:32.669 --> 01:02:35.600
for instance, the role of sociologists and psychologists and

1145
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.080
maybe, and maybe even philosophers for us could have

1146
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.139
been helpful because I think that people should be,

1147
01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:46.179
should have the tools to understand stuff that matters

1148
01:02:46.189 --> 01:02:48.489
to their life. So to this, like I do

1149
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.729
have a project with a colleague of mine Simone

1150
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.030
Pican, like the right to science and the right

1151
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.679
to have access to science and why it is

1152
01:02:55.689 --> 01:03:00.020
important to remove epistemic barriers. And it is particularly

1153
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:04.590
important for contexts like the COVID pandemic vaccination, but

1154
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.540
even climate change in which people are required to

1155
01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:10.199
take action and the action is action that they

1156
01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:13.139
need to take. But on the basis of scientific

1157
01:03:13.149 --> 01:03:15.989
knowledge that no one is really explaining them and

1158
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.110
this is really not empowering and we, we should

1159
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.300
actually, yeah, flip that and, and, and explain people

1160
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.379
what's going on so that they can become even

1161
01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:28.219
better agents. And maybe in this, I am naive,

1162
01:03:28.699 --> 01:03:30.919
but I do believe in the power of education.

1163
01:03:32.469 --> 01:03:35.209
So with that in mind, with uh your belief

1164
01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:37.300
in the power of education, do you think that

1165
01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:40.919
this kind of work and people reflecting a little

1166
01:03:40.929 --> 01:03:44.169
bit on what individuals themselves can do and how

1167
01:03:44.179 --> 01:03:47.439
to develop certain kinds of virtues? Do you think

1168
01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:51.370
that I in a possible future pandemic? Uh THE

1169
01:03:51.379 --> 01:03:54.790
uh this kind of thing could be taught to

1170
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.159
people and to, I, I mean, e even in

1171
01:03:57.169 --> 01:04:00.229
schools and other places like that and to help

1172
01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:05.719
people, Children, adults deal with that uh with what's

1173
01:04:05.729 --> 01:04:08.270
happening in such a kind of context?

1174
01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:10.929
Yeah, I do think so. Uh And I think

1175
01:04:10.939 --> 01:04:13.280
that this is really something that all of us

1176
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.659
that work in education uh that have an interest

1177
01:04:15.669 --> 01:04:19.469
in science, communication and knowledge, communication via all sorts

1178
01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:24.030
of tools like podcast interviews. Uh PUBLIC speech, I

1179
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.520
uh public writing, I think that this is really

1180
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.070
something that, that we have to work on and

1181
01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.139
that uh and that we need to communicate. I

1182
01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:34.330
think this is really important and unfortunately, the fact

1183
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.010
that there is a lot of focus on, I

1184
01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.919
mean, of course, we need the technical research as

1185
01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:40.760
well to investigate the work. But I do think

1186
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:45.469
that it is important to bring this knowledge everywhere.

1187
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.110
Uh BECAUSE I do think that this can make

1188
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.489
us better agents or at least, can have, can

1189
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.239
have an impact in making us better agents or

1190
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.520
giving at least the capacity to choose in a

1191
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.699
more informed way which type of agents we want

1192
01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:00.330
to be and how we want to interact.

1193
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.800
Great. So just before we go, would you like

1194
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:07.110
to tell people where they can find you and

1195
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.739
your work on the internet?

1196
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.969
Yes. Well, um I do have a website uh

1197
01:05:12.979 --> 01:05:18.290
which is just my name Francesca bela.com. Uh And

1198
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.439
I keep my website up to date so that

1199
01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.330
you can find what I'm doing where I'm going,

1200
01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.560
which talks I do. Uh And there is also

1201
01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:27.610
a section on uh public outreach which is called

1202
01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.489
articles and media and um that you can find

1203
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:34.120
in my pop article, pop pop articles. I try

1204
01:05:34.129 --> 01:05:36.949
also to be quite active philosophically on Twitter or

1205
01:05:36.959 --> 01:05:41.350
now ex uh which um yeah, with the end

1206
01:05:41.379 --> 01:05:44.110
of Fran Lai. So you can also find uh

1207
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.610
what I'm doing and which talks I'm going to

1208
01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.389
my conferences and everything that is philosophy related there.

1209
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:51.979
So, thank you.

1210
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.330
