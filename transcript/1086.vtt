00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:03.130
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.010
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.649
today I'm joined by Doctor John Odling Smith. He's

4
00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.850
Emeritus Research fellow at the Mansfield College at the

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.649
University of Oxford. And today we're talking about his

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.350
book Nic Construction How Life Contributes to its own

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.850
Evolution. So, Doctor Odling Smith, welcome to the show.

8
00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:29.989
It's an honor to everyone. Thank you. So, you

9
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.029
start your book by talking about, uh, physics and

10
00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:38.919
about life itself and the origin of life. So,

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.790
uh, tell us first about the second law of

12
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.069
thermodynamics. Why is it important in the context of

13
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.790
evolution?

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.419
Well, as far as I know, the first person

15
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:56.340
to uh draw attention to the relevance of the

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.099
laws of thermodynamics, and in particular the second law,

17
00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.659
which states that entropy or disorder is always increasing

18
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.619
over time. Was a physicist, physicist Owen Schrodinger, and

19
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.819
he did so in a short book called What

20
00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.329
Is Life that he published I think about 1944,

21
00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:21.059
um. Schrodinger's point was that even the simplest organisms,

22
00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:28.069
such as, say, a single-celled bacteria is incredibly complicated

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.879
relative to its surrounding environment. Put that another way,

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.800
it's so far out of thermodynamic equilibrium. With its

25
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.639
surrounding environment, that it wouldn't survive for milliseconds, it

26
00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.400
would simply die if it couldn't oppose the second

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.959
law of thermodynamics, but without actually violating it. Um,

28
00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.730
WHEN I first read Schrodinger, um, I thought he,

29
00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.690
he really had a point, and I've been thinking

30
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.209
about it, uh, ever since, which is why I

31
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.679
took the opportunity of starting my new book, uh,

32
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.399
by considering the laws of thermodynamics and in particular.

33
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660
The second law and how organisms actually have to

34
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.440
resist it to even achieve their more conventional fitness

35
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.000
goals of survival and reproduction.

36
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.660
And can we answer the question of what life

37
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.380
is and what distinguishes it from non-life?

38
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.740
Well, I think the difference between uh. Life and

39
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.130
inanimate systems, uh, is really that. Animates living life

40
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.070
have fitness goals, they have goals. Including the prior

41
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.679
goal of resisting the second law. Unanimous systems don't

42
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:05.309
have. Fitness goals, uh, uh, they, therefore they don't

43
00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.750
actually have to oppose the second law of thermodynamics,

44
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.600
they just have to obey it. They don't have

45
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.160
the problem that life does of not even being

46
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.029
able to get started without resisting the second law.

47
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.279
I think that's probably the biggest point I would

48
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.039
make.

49
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.059
What does orthodox evolutionary theory have to say about

50
00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:31.210
how life started on Earth and how evolution unfolds.

51
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.429
That's an interesting one, they um. It, I, in

52
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:41.850
my experience, um. Let's call them orthodox evolutionary biologists.

53
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.360
I I'm not particularly interested in the origin of

54
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.179
life question. I think they think it's um too

55
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.639
difficult in some ways, and they prefer to concentrate

56
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.559
on the more immediate uh problems of how the

57
00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:04.130
mechanisms and process of evolution work, um. I think

58
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.509
they may be or we may be making a

59
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.330
mistake by not starting with the origin of life

60
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.770
question, because I think it's just possible that uh

61
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.850
the origin of life question may eventually throw light

62
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.798
on some of the ways in which evolution works,

63
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.929
which we miss if we don't start there. I

64
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.899
think it's a sort of contentious point, but um.

65
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.269
I, I think, uh, that's probably the best answer

66
00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:34.510
I can give. I don't think orthodox evolutionary biologists

67
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.950
are really uh interested to start with in the

68
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.079
origin of our question.

69
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.720
And what are the fundamental properties of life? I

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.859
mean, are there any fundamental properties?

71
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.000
Well, I think the fundamental properties of life is

72
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.359
that uh all life are sort of active purposeful

73
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.109
systems uh that um. Have to oppose the second

74
00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:08.670
law and then have to achieve their fitness goal

75
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.059
by their own activities. Uh, NON-LIFE doesn't have to

76
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.100
do that, as I've just said, it just has

77
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.329
to obey the second law, um. I think the

78
00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:24.720
active purposeful agency. Of of uh organisms is fundamentally

79
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.820
different from inanimate systems. Uh, AND, uh, that's why

80
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.350
again I start with the, the fundamental goal. Of

81
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.200
opposing the second law. Put it another way, life

82
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.160
is the goal, all lives are goal seeking systems.

83
00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:45.640
Everything in life is a goal seeking system and

84
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.279
inanimate systems are not.

85
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.589
What else is needed, if anything, beyond the known

86
00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.709
laws of physics and chemistry to understand life?

87
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.049
Um, Again, this, it comes back to the realizing

88
00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:07.890
that you're having to study active purposeful systems as

89
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.489
opposed to purposeless systems. I think the origin of

90
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:13.730
life is actually could also be thought of as

91
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.929
the origin of purpose purpose of systems and in

92
00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:21.450
a way, therefore meaning on earth, um, and I

93
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.670
think I say that somewhere, um. Now, I think

94
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.029
that also means that we uh we'll probably talk

95
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.950
about some of this later, but it does mean

96
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.220
that you have to think of more than population

97
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:44.609
genetics, uh processes. When you're studying about evolution. So,

98
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.850
I mean, one we'll get to, I'm sure is

99
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.089
things like epigenetics, um, which you certainly don't have

100
00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:51.410
to study as a physicist.

101
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.130
So you've already used this phrase a couple of

102
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.089
times before, but you say that living organisms are

103
00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:05.170
active and purposeful systems. Can you can you explain

104
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.480
that, particularly what this purpose mean in this context?

105
00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.970
Well, the purpose is to achieve. Your goals, you

106
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.970
know, the goals of life, which the with the

107
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.369
the goals of surviving and reproducing are recognized by

108
00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:30.410
everybody, but the prior goal of opposing the second

109
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.209
law in order to achieve your fitness goals is

110
00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:38.489
not. And um that's why I think I wanted

111
00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:41.970
to start with that before going to the. The,

112
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.130
the conventional goals of survival and reproduction, but living

113
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.049
systems are goal-seeking systems, uh, versus inanimate systems which

114
00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:54.690
are not. And I think that I repeatedly comes

115
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.519
back to that.

116
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.320
And uh let me ask you now about information,

117
00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:02.570
which is something you also talk about in your

118
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.410
book. What does information mean in the context of

119
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.399
evolutionary biology?

120
00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:14.989
OK. The, I think um the Where I would

121
00:08:14.989 --> 00:08:19.239
answer that, I call the information needed by organisms

122
00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:26.790
in evolution. Adaptive know-how. Uh, AND the, the purpose,

123
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.540
I mean, sorry, um, if organisms who achieve their

124
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.260
fitness goals, including their conventional goals of survival and

125
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.429
reproduction, um, they can only do so by harvesting

126
00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.140
energy and matter resources from their environments, which means

127
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.340
they have to interact with their environments, which effectively

128
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.390
means they have to be a. Have adapted to

129
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.909
their environments at the phenotypic level in order to

130
00:08:55.909 --> 00:08:59.179
uh harvest resources from them and dump their detritus

131
00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:03.150
and so on. Um, COULD you ask the question

132
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.020
again? I'm sorry.

133
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.450
Yes, uh, I was asking you what information means

134
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.500
in the context.

135
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.799
Now, the, the, the, basically, uh, in order to

136
00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:21.330
be adapted organisms have to be informed by the

137
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.500
processes of evolution, with the adaptive know-how to be

138
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.940
able to interact with their local environments in ways

139
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.900
that does allow them to harvest energy and matter

140
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.320
resources, and also, for that matter, to defend themselves

141
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.219
from threats in their environments. Uh, AND, um. I

142
00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:45.140
think the basic job of evolution. At, at more

143
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.809
than one level actually, as we'll get to later,

144
00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:52.919
is to inform organisms, that's what evolution does and

145
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:57.460
uh um. Yeah is that OK? Is that enough

146
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.979
of an answer? Mhm.

147
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.539
Yes. Uh, I, um, I have a follow up

148
00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:06.580
to that. Why do living organisms need information and

149
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:12.460
what is the difference between physical resources and informational

150
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.049
resources?

151
00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:17.669
Well, They have to have the know-how, what I

152
00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:21.270
call the adaptive know-how. How to interact with their

153
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.210
environments in viable ways. Both to take resources from

154
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.369
their environments and for that matter dump their detritus

155
00:10:30.369 --> 00:10:32.729
back in their environments, which leads to a sort

156
00:10:32.729 --> 00:10:35.729
of net increase in entropy in their environments actually,

157
00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.169
uh, which is, uh, we get to later when

158
00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:45.210
we think about ecosystems, um. And uh They can't

159
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.809
do any of that without being informed by the

160
00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:54.690
processes of evolution itself, um. It's, it's the, you

161
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.719
know, inanimate systems do not need to be informed

162
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.729
in the same way as all animate systems must

163
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:03.010
be.

164
00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:10.080
And what are the different kinds of knowledge gaining

165
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.840
processes out there? I mean, what different kinds of

166
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.960
knowledge gaining processes do organisms have at their disposal?

167
00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:26.099
Well, In my book, I eventually distinguished between the

168
00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:31.460
primary information gaining processes of population genetics due to

169
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:37.190
the mechanisms of. OF a natural selection and. Uh,

170
00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:41.739
THE inheritance of Information in Mendelian, what used to

171
00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:45.419
be just Mendelian genes, it's it genetics which has

172
00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:47.979
gone a bit beyond that now. But I also

173
00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:52.440
go for two other levels uh of uh. What

174
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.739
I call supplementary evolutionary process, supplementary informing process if

175
00:11:57.739 --> 00:12:05.159
you like, of individual developmental processes and uh sociocultural

176
00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.179
processes in social animals, um, and above all in

177
00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:15.320
us where. Well, sociocultural press has become very potent.

178
00:12:15.849 --> 00:12:20.640
Right. So let's talk now about the primary theme

179
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.530
of your book, niche construction. So what is niche

180
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.380
construction?

181
00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:30.729
OK. I define niche construction and have done for

182
00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:37.119
years now as uh the process whereby active organisms

183
00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:43.169
modify some of the natural selection pressures in their

184
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:48.950
environments in various ways, as well as uh. As

185
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:54.679
a sort of byproduct, probably modifying natural selection pressures

186
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.309
in the environments of other organisms in their shared

187
00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:02.190
ecosystems. I ought to say something here which uh

188
00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.690
I think in retrospect, I might have been better

189
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:11.820
to call my uh book. Niche construction and niche

190
00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:16.590
destruction. Uh, HOW life contributes to its own evolution,

191
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.130
because the negative side of niche construction is, is

192
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.049
also very important. Um, IT'S sometimes called it negative

193
00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:33.869
niche construction. Um, The way in which um Uh,

194
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:42.989
Organisms can, uh, you know. Increase uh disorder in

195
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:47.820
their environments and living byli really at the expense

196
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.200
of increasing entropy in their environments. It is a

197
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.270
part of the story of niche construction. After that,

198
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.320
I break, we break down um niche construction into

199
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.789
several different kinds, things like we distinguished, for example,

200
00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:11.150
between relocational niche construction. And perturbation or niche construction,

201
00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:14.020
as well as many other things. Relocation is if

202
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.780
you're in an environment which is not working for

203
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.260
you, it's possible for an animal at least to

204
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.869
go somewhere else to find a more favorable environments

205
00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:28.780
relative to the phenotypic traits it already possesses. Um,

206
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.320
PERTURBATIONAL we think of in terms of altering something

207
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.479
in your environment to suit yourself, rather than to

208
00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:41.599
have to respond to natural selections directly in your

209
00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:45.320
environment. So it always involves the modification of natural

210
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.229
selection pressures in your own and each other's environments,

211
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.719
but in different ways.

212
00:14:52.599 --> 00:14:56.840
And what functions does niche construction serve?

213
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.090
Well, I mean, that goes on from where I've

214
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.530
left off. I mean, for example, um there's such

215
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.780
a thing as opportunistic niche construction whereby Organisms who

216
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:15.219
already possess particular phenotypic traits, uh. May find a

217
00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:20.380
new purpose, as it were, for uh uh something

218
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.650
uh a phenotype they already possess. They just use

219
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.270
it in a new way, maybe to gain a

220
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.140
different kind of resource or maybe to outcompete to

221
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:35.659
some rival. Um, OPPORTUNISTIC these construction is quite frequent.

222
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:41.640
Um, Another way is what we call counteractive niche

223
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.859
construction where uh if the environment changes. You do

224
00:15:47.859 --> 00:15:53.179
something as a niche constructing organism to counteract the

225
00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:56.179
niche the way the environment is changes and bring

226
00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:59.780
it back as far as you can to a

227
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.849
more favorable state relative to the phenotypes you already

228
00:16:03.849 --> 00:16:09.380
possess. Um, So it's all the time, it's turning

229
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.210
what uh is I could put crudely as a

230
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.130
sort of one way street relationship between organisms and

231
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:20.200
their environments, which is modeled by orthodox evolutionary theory

232
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.250
into a fundamentally two-way street relationship between niche construction

233
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:32.429
organisms and their naturally selecting environments. And it prein

234
00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:35.380
introduces sorts of feedback, of course, which changes the

235
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.380
dynamics of more or less everything.

236
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.140
So in the context of niche construction, what does

237
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.349
adaptation mean? I mean, what does it mean in

238
00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:51.150
the context of an adaptive interaction or adaptive interaction

239
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:57.469
niche relationships between organisms and their local external environments.

240
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:03.669
OK. That's, I think. It, it really means that

241
00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:10.118
the. Um, INTERACTIONS between organisms and their environments, uh,

242
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.530
involve really a a kind of constant niche, active

243
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.079
niche management problem, almost on a moment by moment

244
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:22.300
basis. Organs are constantly having to adjust their relationship

245
00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.439
with their environments and therefore with natural selection pressures

246
00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:31.689
in their environments by their niche construction activities. And

247
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.680
uh it's a I give some examples in in

248
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.310
my book of where I think this goes on

249
00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:41.400
and it it's kind of opens up an alternative

250
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.550
way of adapting to your environment. You can either

251
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.119
just respond to your natural selection pressures in your

252
00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:52.319
environment, or you can try to modify selection pressures

253
00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:55.319
in your environment, uh, in the ways I've just

254
00:17:55.319 --> 00:18:00.250
been describing. So that your environment, you bring your

255
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.170
environment back to be more favorable to yourself by

256
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.949
the changes you cause in your environment. Um, Some

257
00:18:09.949 --> 00:18:13.390
way I draw attention to two different categories of

258
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.329
natural selection environments as a result. Natural selection pressures

259
00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:22.800
that arise from completely autonomous events in environments, but

260
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.689
versus another category of natural selection, which arises from

261
00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:31.729
natural selection pressures that have previously been modified by

262
00:18:31.729 --> 00:18:37.089
the active purposeful agency of organisms, either in your

263
00:18:37.089 --> 00:18:39.729
own population or in other populations.

264
00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:45.280
Uh, WHERE do the behaviors involved in niche construction

265
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.800
come from? Are they genetically encoded?

266
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:53.189
OK, to begin with, I think that inevitably yes,

267
00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:56.810
I think you you you start with um. The

268
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.170
uh information you derive from the genes you inherit

269
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.410
from your parents, at the beginning of life as

270
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.900
it were. Um, BUT subsequently, um, it needn't be

271
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.380
so restricted. I mean, I think you can learn,

272
00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:16.500
uh, for example, an individual development animal, uh, can

273
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.660
learn new tricks as it were, say through the

274
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.150
capacity of animals to learn and uh you can

275
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:30.459
uh develop new kinds of uh behaviors uh beyond

276
00:19:30.459 --> 00:19:33.099
those that you inherited, you start with say a

277
00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:37.589
repertoire. Of uh behaviors that you inherit from your

278
00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:41.680
ancestors by your parents, as a member of your

279
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.680
individual population. After that, you may acquire additional. Uh,

280
00:19:48.969 --> 00:19:52.329
YOU may add to your behavioral repertoire by say

281
00:19:52.329 --> 00:19:56.319
animal learning. Again, when you move up to the

282
00:19:56.319 --> 00:20:00.989
3rd level of sociocultural groups in, in animals, you

283
00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:05.670
can of course get still more um behaviors or

284
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.790
be taught more behaviors really and so on, as

285
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.420
a member of your cultural group now and um

286
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.790
you you you and also via different kind of

287
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.189
inheritance systems. I mean, we, for example, we are

288
00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:26.270
taught uh. Both formally and informally at school about

289
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.910
all sorts of things that add to our repertoire

290
00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:33.800
of behaviors um at the cultural level too, particularly

291
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.560
in humans.

292
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:40.270
And in what ways do organisms co-evolve with their

293
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.900
environment?

294
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.420
Could you say that one again?

295
00:20:44.189 --> 00:20:50.140
YES, in what ways do organisms co-evolve with their

296
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.819
environment?

297
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.020
Oh yes. Well, I think I've been talking about

298
00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:02.739
this already, really, but. Um, Niche construction or if

299
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:07.719
all niche construction organism modify uh components of their

300
00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:12.839
environment by their active purposeful niche construction activities. Then

301
00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:17.880
of course they, they cause their environments uh to

302
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:23.790
change in response to their own niche construction activities.

303
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.500
Conversely, it's always also true that natural selection pressures

304
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:35.180
in their environments cause organisms to respond to natural

305
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.609
selection pressures, which means in effect, uh something that

306
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:44.280
uh. The biologist Nick Lewontin pointed out years ago

307
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.880
that organisms must necessarily be co-evolving with their environments

308
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.689
by this sort of two-way street interactions between niche

309
00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:58.119
constructing organisms. And naturally selection pressures in their environments.

310
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:04.819
Um, So, the, I, I think, I think I

311
00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:08.060
say in my book that evolutionary theory should not

312
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.890
really be just about the evolving, the evolution of

313
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.420
organisms in response to the environments, it's really about

314
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.219
how organisms and their environments co-evolve as a function

315
00:22:18.219 --> 00:22:24.199
of their two-way street interactions. Between niche construction organisms

316
00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:26.040
and naturally selecting environments.

317
00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:32.979
In your book you also talk about ASB's control

318
00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:37.979
theory and how the variable properties of organisms relate

319
00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:41.619
to the variable properties of their environments. Could you

320
00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:43.050
tell us about that?

321
00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:47.020
I, I'll try to. I mean, Ashby was uh.

322
00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:54.310
Um, Ross Ash Um, unfortunately there's several aspects around,

323
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:59.550
but he was an early, uh, control theorist that

324
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.910
used to be called cyber cybernetics. Um, AND he

325
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.140
came up with some very interesting things about how

326
00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:13.219
self-controlling systems have to work, uh, which I think,

327
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:17.660
uh. HAVE quite a lot of implications for our

328
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.949
understanding of evolution. I mean, he, he, his first

329
00:23:21.949 --> 00:23:26.270
idea was that a self-controlling system had to protect

330
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.280
an essential variable, which is essentially equal to the

331
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.069
achievement of some kind of uh of of goal,

332
00:23:35.719 --> 00:23:39.979
uh, some kind of destination if you like. Um,

333
00:23:40.219 --> 00:23:43.619
AND then they said he came up with something.

334
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.760
Which he called the law of requisite variety, or

335
00:23:49.760 --> 00:24:00.930
LRV according to which organisms can uh. Uh, Protect

336
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.530
their essential variables really. And this responses to a

337
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.729
sort of endless game of of between the variants

338
00:24:08.729 --> 00:24:13.790
that expressed by organisms, particularly the phenotypic variants expressed

339
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.079
by organisms. And the variances they encounter in the

340
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:20.920
environment in the form of variant natural selection pressures.

341
00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:27.250
Um, AND They're constantly having to uh play this

342
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:33.250
game of variance, uh. Between the self uh controlling

343
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:39.760
system. And uh It's, it's environment. And um I

344
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.800
give some examples, a simple example of trying to

345
00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:46.800
uh use the uh uh for example, I use

346
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.540
the um Example of a. A sailboat that you

347
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.510
control with the Things that are at you in

348
00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:01.030
your own variants, variant sails, ropes, rudders, tillers and

349
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.229
everything else, versus the weather conditions and the sea

350
00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:05.750
states and all the rest of it that you're

351
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:12.420
sailing through. And, uh, If you can't control. Uh,

352
00:25:14.439 --> 00:25:18.640
You can't actually play counteract or drive down the

353
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.920
variance, which is another way that Ashby talks about

354
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.380
it. That you encounter in your environments by controlling

355
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.180
the variables that you have over some control over.

356
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.689
Then of course you probably lose your uh you

357
00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:36.349
you you don't get to your destination, you can't

358
00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:38.619
protect your man and you sort of run into

359
00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:41.189
a rock or something if you're on a uh

360
00:25:41.189 --> 00:25:45.459
sailing boat or something and you lose control. The

361
00:25:45.459 --> 00:25:47.099
object of course is not to do that, it's

362
00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:50.130
to arrive safely at the harbor there and everything,

363
00:25:50.140 --> 00:26:00.760
uh, every self-controlling system is uh. Affected by Ashby's

364
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.079
comments about protecting an essential variable to reach your

365
00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:07.839
destination and by playing this endless game of variance

366
00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:11.670
with your environment. Between your own variants and the

367
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.560
variances thrown at you by your environment. It's a

368
00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:21.160
it. It, it's actually a complex stuff and I

369
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.630
spent a lot of chapter 3 talking about it,

370
00:26:23.959 --> 00:26:25.280
but I think I'll leave it at that for

371
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:25.739
the moment.

372
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:31.540
Right. Uh, JUST to illustrate what we are talking

373
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.060
about here when it comes to niche construction, could

374
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.920
you, uh, give us two or three examples of

375
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.380
niche construction behaviors in different organisms?

376
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.199
Example of knee construction. Um, WELL, I gave you

377
00:26:49.199 --> 00:26:51.680
one already that if you'll find yourself in the

378
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.900
wrong. In an environment which is increasingly hostile to

379
00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.819
you. Because of the natural selection of price. Per

380
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:05.719
your country in that place and space. It's possible

381
00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:11.819
to move somewhere else, and of course uh. I

382
00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:15.989
mean, uh, a particularly good example is, uh, seasonal

383
00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:21.510
migration um in birds. I mean, there's many birds

384
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.890
in this country which uh uh. Take off before

385
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.609
the winter and fly all the way to Africa

386
00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:31.969
or South Africa even, uh, to, but it's a

387
00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:36.369
form of relocation at at considerable expense, but that's

388
00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:40.869
niche construction, uh, and then they return the following

389
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:45.930
spring. Uh, AND start building nests, building nests, of

390
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.910
course, is also niche construction. If you build a

391
00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.229
nest or build it, you know, build a dam,

392
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.719
I mean, one of the famous examples of niche

393
00:27:53.719 --> 00:27:58.229
construction is the dams built by beavers to improve

394
00:27:58.229 --> 00:28:03.229
their fishing really, um, and they change their environments

395
00:28:03.229 --> 00:28:07.160
considerably and not only the environments of themselves, but

396
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.709
the whole sort of. Riparian ecosystems in which they

397
00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:13.750
live, and so do many other organs, so they

398
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:18.699
inevitably change search and precious for other organisms too.

399
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.670
Um, SO those would be two salient examples of

400
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:30.959
niche construction, um. I mean, for me, uh, There

401
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:33.069
are just endless examples, but I hope that will

402
00:28:33.069 --> 00:28:33.829
do for the moment.

403
00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:37.760
Yes, in the book at a certain point you

404
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:45.040
mentioned two requirements of life, bioenergetics and bioinformatics. Could

405
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.280
you explain them and how they interact with one

406
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.869
another?

407
00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:56.569
Well, the Energetics, I mean, I use bioenergetics, uh,

408
00:28:56.949 --> 00:28:59.829
really more in an ecological sense than in his

409
00:28:59.829 --> 00:29:04.130
usual metabolic sense most of the time. Um, BUT

410
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.839
the, uh, the close relationship really is that they

411
00:29:08.839 --> 00:29:14.089
each depend on each other. Uh, The the uh

412
00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:21.800
gaining of uh uh energy and matter resources depends

413
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:29.599
on adaptive know-how. But the adaptive know-how is supplied

414
00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:33.780
by the processes of evolution. But the processes of

415
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:39.719
evolution have to be paid for. By the energy

416
00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:43.819
and matter gained by organisms during their lives. I

417
00:29:43.819 --> 00:29:47.459
mean an obvious thing there is, uh, if organisms

418
00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:53.619
have offspring, uh. They have to pay To contribute

419
00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:57.459
offspring to the next generation of their populations by

420
00:29:57.459 --> 00:30:02.020
gaining sufficient energy and matter resources uh to build

421
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.569
their offspring and also not only their offspring, of

422
00:30:05.569 --> 00:30:07.739
course, but to maintain their own selves and so

423
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:16.540
on. And uh. So The fundamental relationship between these

424
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.140
two different kinds of resources, which comes up endlessly

425
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.260
in my book. Is one of uh. Each needing

426
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.319
each other, and the dilemmas that go with that,

427
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.449
I mean some standard origin of life question was

428
00:30:30.449 --> 00:30:33.699
which comes first, but almost everybody nowadays thinks for

429
00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:36.709
that concept being what happened. What must have happened,

430
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.349
they must have come together in some way or

431
00:30:38.349 --> 00:30:42.439
other. And uh so on, but I think that

432
00:30:42.439 --> 00:30:45.380
this in in my chapter 8, I come up

433
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.510
with a set of rules about how these two

434
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.189
kinds of resources relate to each other and describe

435
00:30:52.189 --> 00:30:57.969
them in in some detail. um. So I think

436
00:30:57.969 --> 00:30:59.689
that's the basic answer to your question.

437
00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.189
So let me ask you a little bit now

438
00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:08.959
about ecosystems. What can, what can we learn about

439
00:31:08.959 --> 00:31:14.170
the origin and evolution of ecosystems on Earth as

440
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.189
a function of the co-evolution of niche constructing organisms

441
00:31:19.189 --> 00:31:20.829
with their environments?

442
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.689
OK. That's a big question. Um. The way I

443
00:31:26.689 --> 00:31:29.569
approach this, I think I mainly devote chapter 8

444
00:31:29.569 --> 00:31:33.380
to this in my book. Um, I start off

445
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.930
by considering, well, suppose you start off with uh

446
00:31:36.349 --> 00:31:38.229
what I call a dead planet or a planet

447
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:42.890
in which there's no light. Um, What you find

448
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:48.109
there are flows of energy and matter, uh. Um,

449
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.400
On dead planets. So geochemical flows of energy and

450
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.089
matter, but that's it. As soon as life appears

451
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.989
on. A planet Uh, then you convert the flows

452
00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:10.939
of just energy and matter into biogeochemical flows, uh,

453
00:32:10.949 --> 00:32:17.260
and cycles that involve information as well as. Energy

454
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.430
and matter, the information in organisms. And the, the

455
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:29.329
biogeochemical flows uh are then responsible or They sort

456
00:32:29.329 --> 00:32:34.530
of introduce the basic set of um relationships that

457
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.609
you find between organisms of different species or even

458
00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:42.530
the same species in ecosystems, the, the classic ones

459
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:47.579
of competition, usually thought of as a minus minus

460
00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:55.530
relationship. Mutualisms or cooperation plus plus relationships. And asymmetrical

461
00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.739
relationships between say predators and preys or hosts and

462
00:32:59.739 --> 00:33:04.660
parasites. Usually thought of as plus minus relationships, and

463
00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.770
as the life builds up on the planet, so

464
00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:13.859
those relationships so that uh get introduced and then

465
00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:19.469
developed. And uh it also um there's something that's

466
00:33:19.469 --> 00:33:24.349
interesting, which is different between conventional evolutionary biologists and

467
00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:32.420
what I'm suggesting uh here too is, um. In

468
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.969
population community ecology, for example, it's relatively easy to.

469
00:33:39.489 --> 00:33:44.619
Describe uh the co-evolution of different species of organisms,

470
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.430
uh, because each of the, the organisms in both

471
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.540
species all carry genes, so you can set up,

472
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:58.109
uh, population genetic models of covariation between different species

473
00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:01.510
of organisms. But what you can't do really is

474
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:05.750
bring in anything to do with non-living abiota, which

475
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.969
are also components of ecosystems. Into that story, uh,

476
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.550
because of course it non-living systems don't have genes,

477
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:22.149
however, um. In the the the version of evolution

478
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:27.060
that I'm describing. Um, YOU can get the indirect

479
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:33.600
coevolution of two populations. Uh, VIA an intermediate non-living

480
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.399
abiotic systems, for example, this is a bit confused,

481
00:34:37.438 --> 00:34:40.679
but if, if, if a population A niche constructs

482
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:44.639
in ways that modify an intermediate component in the

483
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.958
environment, which is non-living, and I call it Z.

484
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.159
Then the changes in Z may act as a

485
00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:56.438
change selection pressure for another population, population B. In

486
00:34:56.438 --> 00:35:00.580
effect, that leads to the co-evolution of population and

487
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:07.610
population B via an intermediate abiotic component, uh Z.

488
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.620
And that's the sort of thing that is introduced

489
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:16.169
when you realize the um. Organisms can can modify

490
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:20.719
abiotic components in the environment, non-living components, by their

491
00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:24.239
niche construction activities in ways that subsequently change the

492
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:28.520
evolution of another population in their ecosystem, which I

493
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.840
think adds to uh ways in which we can

494
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.959
think about ecosystems, uh, and the relationship of ecosystems

495
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.439
through evolution uh in biology.

496
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.719
So is niche construction a way for organisms to

497
00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:49.399
more actively participate in their own evolution?

498
00:35:50.669 --> 00:35:54.709
Well, I think so, yes, um, um, in a

499
00:35:54.709 --> 00:35:58.110
sense, if they start niche construction, as I in

500
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.750
ways I've just described, they are almost bound to

501
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.189
contribute to their own and each other's evolution by

502
00:36:05.189 --> 00:36:07.149
also some of the ways I've I've just been

503
00:36:07.149 --> 00:36:13.320
describing. Um, IT changes the process. Uh, TO repeat

504
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.929
from being just the story of the evolution of

505
00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:21.169
organisms in response to natural selection process in their

506
00:36:21.169 --> 00:36:27.260
environment to necessarily the co-evolution of organisms. With their

507
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.780
environments, where the environments of course to change too,

508
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:38.260
by the niche construction activities of organisms. So it

509
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.699
changes a lot. Mhm.

510
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.610
Is there space for any form of teleology here?

511
00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:50.310
That um, that's a nice question. I mean, that

512
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.350
takes us back to Aristotle really, doesn't it? And

513
00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:58.729
I do mention briefly, um. Uh, Aristotle's concept of

514
00:36:58.729 --> 00:37:03.169
a final cause, which appears superficially to reverse the

515
00:37:03.169 --> 00:37:09.820
arrow of time, as it were, uh. But Having

516
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.669
the effects before the cause, um, I don't think

517
00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:18.449
that's really, I, I, I, I'm not an expert

518
00:37:18.449 --> 00:37:21.179
on Aristotle. I'm not sure whether he would really

519
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.729
have meant that, um, but what I think it

520
00:37:24.729 --> 00:37:28.550
does draw attention to is the capacity of organisms

521
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.479
to, uh, Deal with, use the histories of the

522
00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:36.639
past, uh, which can be different kinds of histories

523
00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:40.239
at these three different levels, you know, collective history

524
00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:44.060
of your population at the genetic level, individual history

525
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.520
of yourself at your individual developmental level, and the

526
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.830
history of your. Uh A cultural group at the

527
00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:05.719
3rd level. Um, Now, the The ways that all

528
00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:10.510
these histories apply. Does allow for, you know, past,

529
00:38:10.629 --> 00:38:13.550
present and future to interact and the interaction of

530
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:18.159
relative to the future. Does include the possibility of

531
00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:21.360
anticipating your future, which of course is not the

532
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.479
same as teleology, but it can look like it

533
00:38:25.479 --> 00:38:28.570
superficially, and I give the example say of um

534
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:36.250
a human athlete who uh. Wants to uh win

535
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.510
a gold medal at some future Olympic Games. And

536
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:46.229
anticipates that goal and therefore trains very hard here

537
00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:50.500
and now to enable it to achieve an anticipated

538
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.840
goal in the future. Now that is, has sometimes

539
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.439
been called teleonomy rather than teleology and biology, but

540
00:38:57.439 --> 00:39:02.820
it's not uh Aristotelian teleology. Um, IT it may

541
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.340
superficially look like it a bit, but it ain't

542
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.830
the same thing. Right.

543
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:13.330
So earlier, I asked you about information gaining processes

544
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:19.330
and one that you mentioned was developmental processes in

545
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.945
individual organisms. Could you tell us now. About social

546
00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:29.074
and cultural processes in social animals, including humans, in

547
00:39:29.074 --> 00:39:33.834
what ways are those kinds of processes also information

548
00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:35.304
gaining processes?

549
00:39:35.475 --> 00:39:50.030
Yes. The, the Sociocultural. Uh, INFORMATION gaining. I studied

550
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.860
by evolution, at any rate, some evolutionary biology under

551
00:39:53.860 --> 00:40:00.840
the general heading of of of. Of uh The

552
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.110
co-evolution, gene culture co-evolution. And it's also a contentious

553
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:11.510
area in evolutionary biology. And the there's there's quite

554
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.949
a good start has already been made, but I

555
00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:16.350
think there's a long way still to go as

556
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.100
we realize how information gained at the cultural level,

557
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:25.270
it can interact with um information gained, say, at

558
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:29.959
the population genetics level at level one. And um

559
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.040
I think it, I, the way I think of

560
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.199
it is that I think it makes sense to

561
00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:41.360
consider, well, these additional processes of evolution at the

562
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.129
developmental level and the cultural level, probably wouldn't have

563
00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:47.719
evolved in the first place unless they enhanced the

564
00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:52.959
capacity of organisms for um adapting to their environments.

565
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.350
But uh it needn't always stay that way, which

566
00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.870
is one of the points of interest. The there

567
00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.469
is a possibility, because each information gaining process potentially

568
00:41:04.469 --> 00:41:07.469
picks up different kinds of information, what I call

569
00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:12.719
qualitatively different information. There is a possibility that uh

570
00:41:12.719 --> 00:41:16.750
they may become antagonistic instead of uh mutually beneficial

571
00:41:17.479 --> 00:41:21.879
uh at some stage. And the classical example of

572
00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:26.909
this is when humans first went dairy farming, um,

573
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.709
and really discovered there was a new resource available,

574
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.229
namely milk that they could use from their cattle.

575
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:40.010
Except there was one problem. That all human babies,

576
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.330
for example, are obviously able to drink their mother's

577
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:47.629
milk because they're lactose tolerant. But they're not, they

578
00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:50.870
lose their lactose tolerance as they grow older, which

579
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.550
meant that dairy farming communities found they had a

580
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.750
problem of digesting the milk that they took from

581
00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:00.370
their cattle initially. That then led to a a

582
00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:07.439
a relatively uh slow process whereby Drinking milk, modified

583
00:42:07.879 --> 00:42:11.399
natural selection pressures at level one of population genetic

584
00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:16.840
evolution. Which eventually took up the slack by uh

585
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:22.820
evolving lactose tolerance. In adults, as well as in

586
00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:27.739
children and babies. And that was an interesting interaction

587
00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:30.989
between the cultural processes at level 3 as we're

588
00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:35.810
calling it. And the population genetic processes at level

589
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:41.159
one, which was initially antagonistic, but then set up

590
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.919
uh uh interactions between the two, which eventually led

591
00:42:45.919 --> 00:42:51.969
to a restoration of adaptation by adults becoming lactose

592
00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:54.770
tolerance as well, due to a change in, actually

593
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.320
I think in genetics and chromosome 2 as I

594
00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.520
remember rightly. So that's why it can work. One

595
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.669
of the problems is you need time for that.

596
00:43:03.969 --> 00:43:06.870
And uh if we change our environment so quickly.

597
00:43:07.879 --> 00:43:10.719
At the cultural level as we are threatening to

598
00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:14.389
do now, it may not grant you enough time

599
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:18.479
for the the population genetic level to make the

600
00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:23.580
necessary adjustments to catch up with. Uh, LEVEL 3

601
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.260
changes, in which case we get what I sometimes

602
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.090
call an adaptive lag. Uh, AND which can be,

603
00:43:30.389 --> 00:43:36.169
uh, potentially probably very dangerous. OK. Herself.

604
00:43:38.729 --> 00:43:44.600
Yes, so talking about changing our environments too quickly,

605
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:49.129
how are humans currently contributing to the evolution of

606
00:43:49.129 --> 00:43:50.479
life on Earth?

607
00:43:50.689 --> 00:43:52.760
I'm not quite sure what you're getting at there.

608
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.010
Um, I've already been discussing some of the ways

609
00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.449
in which I think it changes our understanding of

610
00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:02.639
the evolution of life on Earth. Um, I, I

611
00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:04.350
think the thing I've just given you is the,

612
00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:08.679
uh, example whereby, uh, things can go wrong in

613
00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:12.550
the interaction between these three different levels of information

614
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:19.500
gaining processes, you know, population genetics, individual development. And

615
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:27.719
sociocultural processes. Um, Oh. I'm not sure what I

616
00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:29.159
can add to what I've already said.

617
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:33.719
Uh, I mean, the ways by which we are

618
00:44:33.719 --> 00:44:39.399
affecting our environment through climate change, for example, isn't

619
00:44:39.399 --> 00:44:43.439
that in some way, uh, affecting the evolution of

620
00:44:43.439 --> 00:44:45.709
life on Earth. I mean, it was something

621
00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:45.949
like

622
00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:46.379
that

623
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.600
that last chapter. I don't, I think my question

624
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.280
in the last chapter how are humans contributing to

625
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.310
the evolution of life, and I think suggested that

626
00:44:57.679 --> 00:45:02.639
they're actually um. We're facing, um, well I think

627
00:45:02.639 --> 00:45:04.879
I say we're on the threshold of two alternative

628
00:45:04.879 --> 00:45:09.590
futures really, a negative future and a positive future,

629
00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:13.429
and the negative future takes the form of, uh,

630
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.620
a human induced. Another mass extinction. Of life on

631
00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.209
Earth which we could do, I think in either

632
00:45:21.209 --> 00:45:26.649
two ways which I discussed nuclear war. Or climate

633
00:45:26.649 --> 00:45:32.340
change. Um, THE positive future really comes to the

634
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:38.800
point where humans. Begin to understand. That the processes

635
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.510
that put them together are for the first time

636
00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:47.510
becoming. Aware of themselves in the if you like

637
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:50.310
in the self in the conscious minds of and

638
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:54.260
intelligence of humans. For the first time it's possible

639
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.310
for us to begin to understand. Um, THE processes

640
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.250
that have put us together. And I think that

641
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:07.330
carries the the. Responsibility of being both the custodians

642
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.449
of life on Earth, but it also raises the

643
00:46:10.449 --> 00:46:15.449
daunting prospect that um through genome editing and other

644
00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:19.370
things we may begin to influence the future evolution

645
00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:22.810
of an awful lot of life on Earth. Um,

646
00:46:23.209 --> 00:46:28.020
WE could start um. Uh, DIRECTING it and we,

647
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.060
we, unless we can understand the process of evolution

648
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.139
much better than we do at the moment, and

649
00:46:33.139 --> 00:46:35.959
therefore understand our true relationship with the rest of

650
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:38.090
nature much better than we do at the moment.

651
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:45.020
The prospects of having to. Direct the future of

652
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.370
evolution of a lot of life on Earth are

653
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:51.830
appalling really, because we get it wrong, um. But

654
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.949
if on the other hand, we began to understand.

655
00:46:55.739 --> 00:46:59.919
Uh, THE evolutionary process. Which was responsible for us

656
00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:02.689
and all life on Earth. Much better than we

657
00:47:02.689 --> 00:47:05.429
do at the moment. We might have a very

658
00:47:05.429 --> 00:47:08.649
positive future. So I think that's a a a

659
00:47:08.649 --> 00:47:10.580
rather messy way of answering your question.

660
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.459
Um, LET me ask you now, what do you

661
00:47:14.459 --> 00:47:20.540
think about the proposal of an extended evolutionary synthesis

662
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.620
or going beyond the modern evolutionary synthesis? OK,

663
00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:28.500
well, I really belong to a group that we,

664
00:47:28.659 --> 00:47:31.899
I've been working with for many years now, in

665
00:47:31.899 --> 00:47:36.219
which we've all been trying to uh extend the

666
00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:40.250
modern synthesis or extend the evolutionary theory because we

667
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:46.340
think There's accumulating data, uh which are no longer

668
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.969
compatible with the what I call the core assumptions

669
00:47:49.969 --> 00:47:53.580
of of the modern synthesis or nowadays most often

670
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.550
called neo-Darwinism. So I'm very sympathetic to the uh

671
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:04.830
efforts to extend uh the evolutionary theory by, I

672
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.219
think we call it the ESS sometimes, it's had

673
00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:10.790
various names. um BUT I think it's, I think

674
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.479
it is a uh become a a a necessity.

675
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.250
And uh in this is where for example the

676
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:21.689
extra processes of epigenetics, for example, and uh of

677
00:48:21.689 --> 00:48:25.939
animal learning, for example, the sociocultural processes all come

678
00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:28.840
in and it'd be a much more inclusive theory

679
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.199
of evolution to bring all that together, um. And

680
00:48:33.209 --> 00:48:38.409
I think the people working the extended synthesis, uh.

681
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.459
Uh, OF which I am a sort of member

682
00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:45.000
of the team, as it were, um, are, are

683
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.260
going for this. By, by the way, that you,

684
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.229
you may know there's another book was published more

685
00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:52.070
or less the same time as my book by

686
00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:56.239
a lot of my colleagues called Evolution Evolving. It

687
00:48:56.239 --> 00:49:00.949
was published by Princeton Press in September too, and

688
00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:04.750
there they go into the additional processes involved in

689
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.989
the ESS in much more detail than I do

690
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:09.219
in my own book. Uh, BUT it would give

691
00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:12.040
you a fuller answer to the question you're asking.

692
00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:16.090
Mhm. But, uh, I mean, as a final question,

693
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.449
let me ask you then, apart from niche construction,

694
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.340
what other mechanisms or processes would need to be

695
00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.409
added to orthodox evolutionary theory

696
00:49:29.409 --> 00:49:31.739
that really a question I think I've already answered.

697
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:37.969
I, I, I mean, uh. Epigenetic processes, I, I

698
00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:41.649
would start with because uh in a sense they

699
00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:46.399
include something that. Uh, YOU know, the idea that

700
00:49:46.399 --> 00:49:50.520
you could never, um. Acquired characteristics can never be

701
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.760
inherited. Turns out not to be wholly correct when

702
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.000
you introduce epi epigenetic processes and epigerms as as

703
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.449
well as genomes, and so on. And uh so

704
00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:08.429
that would definitely be one and then um I

705
00:50:08.689 --> 00:50:14.070
I would uh. Insist that animal learning is an

706
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:20.489
information gaining process in individual organisms. Whereby organisms, as

707
00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:24.530
it were, inherit um something they learned from their

708
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.120
earlier experience for their later selves, which is a

709
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.409
rather weird way of looking, sort of internal inheritance

710
00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:36.590
system. But they also gain uh the animal learning

711
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.709
is relevant to uh the evolutionary processes of of

712
00:50:41.709 --> 00:50:45.030
animals. And then again, when one we've just been

713
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:49.550
discussing, uh, gene culture co-evolution, where there's a huge

714
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:56.639
amount of extra information gaining um due to uh

715
00:50:56.989 --> 00:51:00.669
cultural processes. Uh, AND I, above all, of course,

716
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:03.709
the information gaining process of science, which is probably

717
00:51:03.709 --> 00:51:07.669
the most potent. Form of information gaining of adaptive

718
00:51:07.669 --> 00:51:10.179
know-ha and also I'm afraid of maladaptive know how,

719
00:51:11.179 --> 00:51:13.699
like the capacity to make nuclear weapons, which is

720
00:51:13.699 --> 00:51:18.250
probably not a good thing. Um, And but it's

721
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:22.090
been an extraordinary powerful form of information gaining, and

722
00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:27.409
I, I go into the uh. Uh, WAYS in

723
00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:30.899
which science works in one of my chapters, uh,

724
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.330
because it is another information gaining process of some

725
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:39.560
importance, considerable importance. So those would be the uh

726
00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:43.800
things I would like to add. Uh, TO the,

727
00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:47.620
to the scope of evolutionary theory, which is not

728
00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.899
really covered by the modern synthesis sort of contemporary

729
00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:51.889
neo-Darwinism.

730
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:57.350
Great. So the, so the book is again niche

731
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:02.270
Construction, how life contributes to its own evolution. I

732
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.389
will be leaving a link to it in the

733
