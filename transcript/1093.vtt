00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.239
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.640
today I have a return guest for you, Doctor

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.729
Austin Fuentes, professor of anthropology at Princeton University. And

5
00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.559
today we're talking about his new book, Sex is

6
00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.670
a Spectrum, The Biological Limits of the Binary. So,

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.360
Doctor Fuentes, welcome back to the show. It's always

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.920
a huge pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.440
Ricardo, it's, it's my pleasure to be here again.

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.760
It's a fantastic show.

11
00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:33.380
Thank you. So, before we get into this discussion

12
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.860
surrounding the supposed sex binary and how sex biology

13
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.139
varies across species, let me start by asking you

14
00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:45.849
because this is also something that you talk about

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.490
at the beginning of your book. Uh, WHY has

16
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.939
sex evolved? I mean, couldn't we all, and by

17
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.740
we all, I mean, all organisms on Earth just

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.619
reproduce asexually.

19
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.389
Yeah, I, there's, uh, a number of books. There's

20
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.129
some really good books on sexual evolution of sex

21
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.589
in the 1950s and 1960s that all start with

22
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:10.279
the sort of frame that sex makes no sense

23
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:13.430
from an evolutionary perspective. It, it, it, you know,

24
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.349
uh, because of asexual reproduction, right? And the first

25
00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:19.419
billion years or so of life was asexual reproduction.

26
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.660
Um, SO when we talk about sexual reproduction, right,

27
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.805
we're, uh, talking about a particular reproductive. AND evolutionary

28
00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:30.496
process. Um, SO before I go into that, can

29
00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.375
I point out that the, the way people say

30
00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.736
sex or use sex is like 5 different kinds

31
00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:38.136
of things. Um, SO I want to identify really

32
00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:41.295
quickly. So when people talk about sex, we talk

33
00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:43.856
about sex as a biological and evolutionary process, which

34
00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:45.445
is what we're about to talk about right now.

35
00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:48.935
People also talk about sex exclusively as a reproductive

36
00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.966
process, right? That involves both behavior and biology. People

37
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.241
also talk, use the word. Sex to talk about

38
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.082
social processes that involve, you know, sexual behavior, that

39
00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:00.601
involve behavioral biology. People also use sex to talk

40
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.041
about sex biology, right? The reproductive biology and all

41
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.641
the related biology. And finally, people use sex as

42
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.991
a term to talk about the way we can

43
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.481
use sex-related biology as a way to categorize bodies,

44
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.962
behaviors, and variation in a species. And so, sex

45
00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:18.722
is really complicated when we're not clear about what

46
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:19.682
we're talking about.

47
00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.880
Right. OK, but, but then in regards to my

48
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.449
question, why has it evolved? I mean, why do

49
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.509
we have sex.

50
00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.600
Sex is a biological process, there's a number of

51
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.929
hypotheses, but the most solid one is that in

52
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.279
after about a billion years of life on this

53
00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.520
planet of organisms reproducing asexually, which is just copying

54
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.160
their sort of uh genetic or or their internal

55
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.119
components and dividing into two versions of themselves and

56
00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.169
therefore creating two sort of asexual reproduction. Um, THAT

57
00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.889
limits variation, right, to just mutation. You, you don't

58
00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.570
get other forms of variation introduced into the sort

59
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.210
of biological potential. With sex, the argument is, if

60
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.130
you have two slightly different versions of the same

61
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.884
species, same kind of organism. And they're able to

62
00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:11.024
combine their genetic material to the, and, and other

63
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.925
materials to then produce a new organism, and offspring,

64
00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:16.544
that's some version of a combination of those two

65
00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:21.785
parental, uh, uh, organisms, the chance for variation beyond

66
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:26.529
just variation introduced by mutation. Gives the possibility that

67
00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.250
the subsequent organism, the offspring, is gonna have a

68
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.330
little bit more variation and thus potential flexibility to

69
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.570
deal with environmental challenges. So, if we imagine, you

70
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.169
know, plot, you know, a bunch of single-celled organisms

71
00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.270
in the primordial muck, you know, uh, Billions of

72
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.339
years ago, um, if there were temperature gradients or

73
00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.669
salinity gradients or other kinds of gradients that emerged

74
00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.699
out of, you know, that weren't there before, some

75
00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.070
variation in the potential to respond to changing environmental

76
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.100
context would be beneficial. And on average, if sex

77
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.250
produces this variation, and this variation gives you uh

78
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.380
a little bit of advantage, over time, if you

79
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.619
get a little bit of advantage, it's gonna show

80
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.820
up more and more frequently, right? That's, that's the

81
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.259
basic argument. Um, AND so basically, sex as a

82
00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:19.290
biological process evolved to increase variation in the world,

83
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.059
right? In increased variation and thus adaptive, or at

84
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.380
least acclimatization for possibilities for organisms.

85
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.950
And when we talk about sex and sex biology

86
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.309
and particularly from uh the uh genetics perspective, many

87
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:37.790
times people use words like anisogamy. So what is

88
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.500
anisogamy and how did the transition from isogamy to

89
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.459
anisogamy occur and why is that important?

90
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.869
Yeah, it's very funny, people pronounce these in all

91
00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.589
this right. So isogamy and isogamy. Isogamy is two

92
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.950
gametes, that is the production of uh these. Cells,

93
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.690
sex cells that get together to produce an offspring

94
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.209
from two parents. An isogamy is gametes of the

95
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.769
same size, anisogamy is gametes of different size. And

96
00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:10.010
once sort of sex has been around as an

97
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.809
evolutionary biological process for a while, it looks like

98
00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.230
we start to see the development of different sized

99
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.885
gametes, that is, organisms. Of what we call mating

100
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.286
types within a species or within a, uh, uh,

101
00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:25.045
a population, begin to produce slightly different or even

102
00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:27.716
very, very different kinds of gametes that come together,

103
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:31.526
bringing both the genetic material and other materials together.

104
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:35.485
So anisogamy has become for a variety of reasons,

105
00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:37.851
uh, which we don't fully understand. Uh, FOR a

106
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:40.721
variety of reasons, has become one of the dominant

107
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.471
forms of, uh, sexual reproduction. Isogamy still exists, um,

108
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.201
but, but anisogamy for most of the things we're

109
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.391
interested in, in, in a, a discussion that's eventually

110
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.242
about humans and animals and a variety of other

111
00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:55.682
things, and, and plants too. Anisogamy, uh, is the

112
00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:59.911
typical pattern. That is one gamete that is very

113
00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:02.481
different from the other gametes. So two kinds of

114
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.601
gamete is what anisogamy means. And that's, that's the

115
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:06.282
typical pattern we see in, in animals now.

116
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.019
Mhm. So in biology, when people talk about males

117
00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:15.779
and females, what does that mean? What is a

118
00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.850
male and what is a female?

119
00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.609
So, this is also one of those things where

120
00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:22.670
we've got all of these different definitions running around.

121
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.130
But let's keep it very, very simple. And let's

122
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.059
talk about, there's two ways in which we talk

123
00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:29.529
about in biology about males and females. One is

124
00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.899
sort of a heuristic, like, OK, here's the general

125
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.890
40,000 ft. PATTERN, right? That we're just going to

126
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.000
use as a categorization. And then there's the specifics

127
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.089
when we talk about lineages or dynamics or when

128
00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:43.609
we're actually talking about evolutionary processes and behavior. So

129
00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:46.649
that 40,000 ft, the general pattern, at least for

130
00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.489
the last, you know, two centuries, maybe century and

131
00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:51.890
a half. Probably a century and a half, uh,

132
00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.970
by the late 1800s, has been to say, uh,

133
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.250
the, uh, in a sexual reproducing species, the, uh,

134
00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:02.579
suite of, of biology, right? The physiology that produces

135
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:05.420
a large gamete is a female and the physiology

136
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.644
that produces a small gamete. A male. That's the

137
00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:11.545
sort of 40,000 ft level giant characterization. The problem

138
00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:14.494
is that individual sort of lineages, when we're looking

139
00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:17.285
at particular species or lineages genera or lineages of

140
00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:19.725
species, we get a lot of variation. We still

141
00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.165
see this pattern with small and large gamete, but

142
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:26.369
what actually A large gamete or a small gamete

143
00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.690
tells you about the body size, the overall physiology,

144
00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:33.640
the ecology, the behavior, actually doesn't work that well

145
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.010
in a general sense. So, what we have to

146
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.790
do then is talk about males and females as

147
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.890
these categories. And then also, if we're asking about

148
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.450
a particular lineage, we have to talk about specifics.

149
00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:44.329
Uh, AND, and there we can get into other

150
00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.929
definitions of male and female. So, for example, in

151
00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:48.690
humans, I'm rambling here, but this is sort of

152
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.720
a long question, so I want to be clear.

153
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.704
In humans, Uh, and mammals, I would argue. But

154
00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:57.065
in humans, uh, for example, now frequently, uh, when

155
00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:59.304
we talk about sex, we're really talking about what's

156
00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:03.505
called 3G sex. That is typical clusters of biology,

157
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.855
right? Of, of physiology that include, uh, genetic pattern,

158
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:09.984
a gonadal pattern, and a genital pattern, right? And

159
00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:12.825
so, sort of 3G female in humans is someone

160
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:16.695
who is XX, uh, has, uh, ovaries and has,

161
00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:20.299
uh, uh, labia, clitoris, uh, vagina. Uh, WHEREAS a

162
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:24.420
3G male is someone who's XY, has testes, and

163
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.500
has a penis and scrotum, right? So those are

164
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.859
typical clusters of physiology. And the reason I like

165
00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.380
to use 3G and I use it in the

166
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.260
book, is because these are identifiable, measurable patterns that

167
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.065
we can Talk about that vary in particular and

168
00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:40.424
interesting ways and clustering ways. And that gives us

169
00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:43.265
something to actually talk about biologically because just saying

170
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:46.385
like, OK, uh, you know, uh, gamey, like, uh,

171
00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.234
an egg is a female and a sperm is

172
00:08:48.234 --> 00:08:50.224
a male, doesn't really tell you much in an

173
00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:51.434
actual biological sense.

174
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.219
Well, OK, but, uh, I, I mean, on what

175
00:08:55.219 --> 00:09:00.109
basis do biologists distinguish between males and females? Is

176
00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:03.650
it on the basis of sex chromosomes of go

177
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.260
nets, of gametes, of primary and secondary sexual characteristics?

178
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.700
Uh, I mean, what is it exactly? Because I

179
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.739
hear many times people saying that the, I mean,

180
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.030
the basic difference between the male. And the female

181
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.590
has to do with the, just the size of

182
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.239
the gametes that each of the sexes produces. But

183
00:09:24.239 --> 00:09:27.150
is that really enough, or?

184
00:09:27.309 --> 00:09:29.900
Um, I would argue that's enough for some basic

185
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.150
theoretical discussions, but that's not nearly enough for any

186
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.429
actual practical work, right, in biology. So, I'm much

187
00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:38.390
more interested. So, for example, you identified a whole

188
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.299
bunch of things that are associated with sex, uh,

189
00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:43.760
biology, right? So it could Be, uh, reproductive physiology,

190
00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:46.880
could be endocrine pattern, typical endocrine patterns, could be

191
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.280
behavior, right? All of those things, uh, can be

192
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.500
identified and cluster in, in, in ways that we

193
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.919
can use to categorize males and females. So, I

194
00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:57.280
mean, here's the challenge, right? It's what question are

195
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.080
we asking? So it's fine to say males produce

196
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.640
small gametes, females produce large gametes. But what does

197
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.880
that tell us, right? So, let's take a bunch

198
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.030
of large gamete producing. Uh, MAMMALS, like a human,

199
00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:13.619
a kangaroo, a cotton top tamarind, uh, a duck-billed

200
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:18.380
platypus, uh, and, um, a hyena. Like, those are

201
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.059
all five females, right? They produce large gametes. But

202
00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:24.780
let me tell you, their physiology, their ecological niche,

203
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.539
their evolutionary histories, their morphology and their behavior are

204
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:30.260
radically different from one another. So, we have to

205
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
really, so what questions are we asking, I guess

206
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.309
is is where I'm going.

207
00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:39.390
Mhm. But if, uh, males are the ones who

208
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.150
produce the small gametes and females are the ones

209
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.989
who produce the large gametes, uh, isn't it much

210
00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:51.679
cheaper for males to produce their gametes than females?

211
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.789
And doesn't that translate generally speaking into different patterns

212
00:10:57.789 --> 00:10:59.869
of sexual behavior between them?

213
00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.799
You would think so, because that's what we're taught

214
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.640
basically, right? So that, uh, notion of sort of

215
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.039
cheap sperm and costly eggs derives initially from, well,

216
00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:12.239
Darwin's perceptions, right? Darwin sort of thought this was

217
00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:14.000
the pattern, but he didn't know about gametes. He,

218
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.799
he hypothesized, right? Pangaans and things like that, but

219
00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:19.080
he, he wasn't there totally, uh, in the sense

220
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.280
of the genetics. Um, BUT really, this derives from

221
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.429
work in the 20s and 30s by Angus Bateman,

222
00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:27.979
uh, a fruit fly biologist. And, uh, Bateman did

223
00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:32.945
a number of classic experiments. He published arguing that,

224
00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:36.224
in fact, that, uh, the sexes are, are quite

225
00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:41.664
different, um, and that the investment results in indiscriminatory,

226
00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:44.265
and here is a quote from him, an indiscriminatory

227
00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:47.234
eagerness in the males and a discriminatory passivity in

228
00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:51.585
the females. That is, um, males, because sperm is

229
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:54.145
cheap, want to just inseminate as many, uh, female

230
00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:56.385
flies as possible, and females, because the eggs are

231
00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:58.265
so expensive, have to be choosy about which males

232
00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:01.950
they allow to inseminate them. However, if you look

233
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.919
over the last 30 years, a number of scholars

234
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:06.510
have tried to replicate his work and examined his

235
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.830
work, uh, Patricia Gawadi in her lab, uh, Zulmeang

236
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.309
Martinnis in her lab, and others. And they've shown

237
00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:17.580
that his actual results don't clearly support or as

238
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.070
clearly support that argument. So, one of the problems

239
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.830
is this theory has become prominent in the biological

240
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.820
literature, yet that the actual studies it was based

241
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.650
on don't quite hold out. That said, it, you

242
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.330
know, a single to produce a single ova, particularly

243
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.630
in some species, many species, it varies with a

244
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.289
couple others, but produce a single ova versus the

245
00:12:38.289 --> 00:12:41.080
cost of a single sperm, those are dramatically different.

246
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.250
But in most organisms, let's take most mammals, for

247
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.200
example, the comparison isn't one over to one sperm.

248
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.580
It's one over to millions and millions of sperm,

249
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.359
right? So in humans, the comparison for a fertilized,

250
00:12:52.659 --> 00:12:55.330
or potential fusion, right, uh, is 1 over in

251
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.840
about 14 million or 10 to 14 million sperm.

252
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.250
So this gets a little complicated when we talk

253
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.570
about costs. And then, Uh, we also have to

254
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.250
note that for many organisms, costs don't, aren't exclusive

255
00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:11.179
to the production of gametes. There's in fact a

256
00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:13.500
wide variety of other kinds of costs to successfully

257
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.659
produce. So, it's really interesting how this idea about

258
00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:21.260
anisogamy driving everything has become sort of central, even

259
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.219
though the data don't always support that.

260
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.210
Right. Well, well, you know, I, I read your

261
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.890
book and I also read uh the new book

262
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.900
by Doctor Nathan Lentz, The Sexual Revolution Revolution actually,

263
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.090
and Lucy Cook's bitch, and, uh, I, I mean,

264
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.809
now, uh, there are, I know that there are

265
00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:46.210
general patterns for males and females across species, but

266
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.020
I also tend to have more of a Let's

267
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.900
say framework where I say that maybe it's better

268
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.099
to go at it on a case by case

269
00:13:57.099 --> 00:14:00.659
basis, on a species by species basis because there's

270
00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:03.940
lots of variation and you talk also a lot

271
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.940
about that in your own book. But, uh, I

272
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.530
mean, but since we have uh two gamut producing

273
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.700
physiologies across species and perhaps here we can start

274
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.559
to get into a discussion surrounding Whether sex is

275
00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:24.000
binary or not or if it occurs on the

276
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.760
spectrum or not. Uh, I mean, uh, don't those

277
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.919
who respond to male and female, and I mean,

278
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.830
if there's not a third gamut producing physiology, uh,

279
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.440
isn't that an argument against sex occurring on the

280
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440
spectrum or

281
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.280
not? No, I don't think so at all. So

282
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.349
I I mean, here's that, that maybe people don't

283
00:14:46.349 --> 00:14:48.469
always understand what a binary and a spectrum are,

284
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.070
right? So a binary is, uh, two different kinds

285
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.650
of thing within a category. So, what, let's say

286
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.429
the classic binary, numeric binary, 1 or 0, right?

287
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.950
1 or 0. A 1 and a 0 are

288
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.510
both numbers, right? Uh, BUT they're, they're radically different.

289
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.780
They do not share anything aside from their categorical

290
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.299
representation in a number, right? They mean different. That's

291
00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:14.260
a binary. Um, A spectrum, right, is a distribution

292
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.020
of patterns with what you can call radically different

293
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.059
frequencies or very different or slightly different frequencies that

294
00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:24.500
cluster, right? So, for example, when we talk about,

295
00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:27.020
let's just talk about, uh, you know, uh, mammals

296
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.090
or humans, right? Male and female humans, um, which

297
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.140
are not the same thing at all, but they're

298
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.159
not made of different stuff. Right? Everything We have

299
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.409
is, in fact, constituted of the same things. We're

300
00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:40.719
clusters of variation, and we'll talk more about this,

301
00:15:40.729 --> 00:15:43.090
and like, how does that variation pattern out. And

302
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.169
so, rather than thinking of males and females as

303
00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:47.849
a 10, I think thinking of them as different

304
00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:52.049
frequencies or variations or typical clusters of this organic

305
00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:55.169
material, right? Uh, GIVES us a better understanding of

306
00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:59.489
development of evolutionary possibilities and of reproductive dynamics.

307
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.659
Mhm. Um, BUT aren't there at least some general

308
00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:07.830
patterns? Of course, this is a different kind of

309
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.659
question, but some general patterns when it comes to

310
00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:17.159
sexual and reproductive behavior and also parental behavior for

311
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:19.609
males and females across species.

312
00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.900
Well, across all species? No, right? I mean, if

313
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.820
you're talking about insects and birds and reptiles and

314
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.900
humans, there's huge variation in patterns of what's going

315
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.070
on. I mean, if you want to just Constrain

316
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.559
that to mammals, which is sort of the most

317
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:35.719
relevant thing. Although other patterns are also really interesting,

318
00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:37.590
which I'd love to talk about. But if we

319
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.789
just think about mammals, there's particularly because of this

320
00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:44.429
very, very, sort of, let's say, constrained and very

321
00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:48.270
successful, um, reproductive physiology of mammals, the reproductive sort

322
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.469
of biological dynamics. Um, THERE'S a clear constraint, right,

323
00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:56.909
uh, around the gestation and lactation, right? So only

324
00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:59.950
certain bodies, right? And generally, Bodies that are large

325
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.150
gamete producers can develop the physiology necessary for gestation

326
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.140
and lactation. And so that typical constraint is there.

327
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.140
But what's really fascinating is if you look across

328
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.829
all mammals, there are, of course, typical patterns where

329
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.989
let's say, those, uh, who gestate and lactate, right?

330
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.979
We tend to call females, um, are more often

331
00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:22.339
involved in higher densities of care and always involved

332
00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.939
in lactation. I mean, if they, if they're lactating.

333
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:27.310
Um, BUT there isn't a 1 to 1 prediction

334
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.390
that is We don't see large gamete means this

335
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.229
kind of care and small gamete means this kind

336
00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:35.020
of care, because we actually see a variation. Mammals,

337
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.969
again, have a little bit less variation than, say,

338
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.790
something like birds, where there's almost no variation because

339
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.630
both gamey types produce care. Um, WHEN you get

340
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.989
to fish, it becomes very variable from no care

341
00:17:44.989 --> 00:17:48.630
at all to, uh, care by either small or

342
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.099
large gamete producers. And then insects is a whole

343
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:53.390
other thing, especially with cooperative care, you know, the

344
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.430
sort of multi-individual care and only a few individuals

345
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.589
reproducing. So, I, I keep rambling at these long

346
00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:00.699
answers, but what it's so exciting though when you

347
00:18:00.699 --> 00:18:03.060
dive down into this, cause of course there are

348
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.900
typical patterns in lineages or in clusters of organisms.

349
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.699
But to say like there's one way to do

350
00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:11.099
sex across the animal kingdom is simply wrong.

351
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.410
Uh, AND how do we deal in terms of,

352
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.770
let's say, sex, biology, distribution? How do we deal

353
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.780
with species who are hermaphrodites and, uh, for, for

354
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:31.579
example, fish species whose uh individuals change sex in

355
00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.089
particular contexts.

356
00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:35.020
Yeah, so I mean, that's what's really interesting, right?

357
00:18:35.069 --> 00:18:38.055
And those are Individuals aren't hermaphrodites usually very few

358
00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:40.655
fish are hermaphrodites. But what's really interesting is that

359
00:18:40.655 --> 00:18:42.885
when we look across the animal kingdom in particular,

360
00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:45.094
let, let's not even talk about plants because that's

361
00:18:45.094 --> 00:18:47.214
amazing but so complicated, it'll just make your head

362
00:18:47.214 --> 00:18:50.045
explode. But with animals, when it comes to sex,

363
00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.974
um, what's really fascinating is that, yes, there's some

364
00:18:52.974 --> 00:18:56.765
typical patterns associated with reproductive biology, right, some constraints.

365
00:18:57.175 --> 00:19:01.119
Uh, BUT Those constraints don't map the same across

366
00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:03.189
different lineages. So, for example, as you just noted,

367
00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:05.949
there are many fish species and whole clusters of

368
00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:09.839
of of of lineages where the same body, one

369
00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:14.150
individual with one set of DNA undergoes sort of

370
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.515
physiological. Changes such that that individual has either first

371
00:19:18.515 --> 00:19:20.905
male or female reproductive small gamete or a large

372
00:19:20.905 --> 00:19:24.185
gamete producing, uh, physiology, then at some point in

373
00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:26.744
life switches to the other kind of gamete producing

374
00:19:26.744 --> 00:19:29.265
physiology. And in some cases, even switches back or

375
00:19:29.265 --> 00:19:31.935
might switch multiple times during the lifetime. So then,

376
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.089
I would argue, if we're thinking in a binary

377
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.689
frame, what do we call that? That individual doesn't

378
00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:39.890
become a different thing, right? When it switches physiology,

379
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.770
but it shows the kind of flexibility, and this

380
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.729
is what I mean by spectrum. I don't mean

381
00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:46.250
that everything is just all mixed together. I'm saying

382
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.189
they're clear typical clusters and patterns, but they're deriving

383
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.170
from the same biological materials. And so we need

384
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.729
to think about biology. And even in, in, in

385
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:55.969
mammals, right, uh, where we think, you know, it's

386
00:19:55.969 --> 00:20:00.714
a pretty constrained physiological. PROCESS. Uh, WE see wide

387
00:20:00.714 --> 00:20:03.584
ranges in, in patterns of care in both males

388
00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:06.625
and females, even though they're typical patterns. So, um,

389
00:20:06.744 --> 00:20:09.344
I, I think this argument about sex being seen

390
00:20:09.344 --> 00:20:11.944
as a spectrum as opposed to binary, doesn't in

391
00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.464
any way negate typical patterns and these sort of

392
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.964
wide-reaching sort of ways in which we can model

393
00:20:16.964 --> 00:20:18.954
stuff. But it reminds us we'd better look at

394
00:20:18.954 --> 00:20:22.094
the lineage of the species before we assert, like,

395
00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:23.984
this is how this organism works.

396
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.569
Mhm. But in regards to the hermaphrodite species, I

397
00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:32.489
mean, they, they do not respond to a third

398
00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:33.900
sex, or do they?

399
00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:37.189
I mean, no, uh, I, I, so here's the

400
00:20:37.189 --> 00:20:39.189
problem. How do we want to call this? And

401
00:20:39.189 --> 00:20:41.550
here's the problem with binary, we're like, well, it's

402
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.469
either 2 or it's 3, or it's 5, or

403
00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:47.069
it's 4. I don't actually worry about that. I'm

404
00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:49.829
much more worried about what is the patterns of

405
00:20:49.829 --> 00:20:53.910
variation in, let's say, reproductive physiology, right? So hermaphrodite,

406
00:20:53.949 --> 00:20:57.150
like, let's take earthworms, right? Um, EARTHWORMS are fascinating

407
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.670
because they're all hermaphroditic in the sense that they're

408
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.713
intersect. Truly that they have both sexual, um, components,

409
00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:07.672
right? Full reproductive systems. Um, SO what do we

410
00:21:07.672 --> 00:21:11.792
call those? MALFEM or female? It's just part of

411
00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:14.072
that variation. And then there are other things like

412
00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:17.453
C. ELEGANS, right? The most famous of all worms

413
00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:19.953
where all these biologists work on them. They have

414
00:21:19.953 --> 00:21:23.272
sort of two sort of sexual phenotypes, but it's

415
00:21:23.272 --> 00:21:25.473
not male and female, right? One is sort of

416
00:21:25.473 --> 00:21:28.995
intersex. OR hermaphrodite, and the other is, uh, male,

417
00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:32.076
no. Yeah, male. So there's no regular like just

418
00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:34.816
females. And so I think the bottom line then

419
00:21:34.816 --> 00:21:37.235
is, we got to step back from thinking there's

420
00:21:37.235 --> 00:21:40.156
just two fixed ways to do sex in the

421
00:21:40.156 --> 00:21:42.796
animal kingdom, and to ask questions about each lineage

422
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:44.836
of the dynamics, what are the adaptive histories, what's

423
00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:46.916
going on? How do we understand that. Uh, WE

424
00:21:46.916 --> 00:21:48.906
really have to do the biology rather than just

425
00:21:49.316 --> 00:21:51.515
sort of philosophize about what these things mean.

426
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.229
Mhm. When it comes to mammals specifically in the

427
00:21:56.229 --> 00:22:00.869
book, you talk about some interesting examples like monogamous

428
00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:06.510
primates, monogamous, quote unquote, and uh naked mole rats.

429
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.329
So could you, could you tell us about them?

430
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.030
What's the deal with them exactly? So

431
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.869
this is one of these just amazing things, right?

432
00:22:12.949 --> 00:22:15.550
You would expect in mammals to be of all

433
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.510
the animal kingdom. This should be the most consistent.

434
00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:21.182
And because of this reproductive structure of gestational lactation

435
00:22:21.182 --> 00:22:24.262
of particular modes, particularly of placental mammals, you would

436
00:22:24.262 --> 00:22:26.703
think that that's, there's real typical and everyone would

437
00:22:26.703 --> 00:22:29.172
be the same. But then, you know, take something

438
00:22:29.172 --> 00:22:32.542
like naked mole rats, which have, at a in

439
00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:35.662
a superficial look, you know, there is one female

440
00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:38.942
usually who's quite large, who does the reproducing. There's

441
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:42.032
a bunch of other females who are physiologically capable.

442
00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:46.166
Physiologically and endocrinologically capable of cycling and reproducing, but

443
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:48.365
who don't. And there's not some sort of behavioral

444
00:22:48.365 --> 00:22:50.806
or pheromonal control of these females, but they're sort

445
00:22:50.806 --> 00:22:53.125
of like workers, like worker bees. And then you

446
00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:55.086
have the males that do mate with the, uh,

447
00:22:55.095 --> 00:23:00.206
one or, or two, reproducing females. And so naked

448
00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:02.166
mole rats, and they're very weird to begin with.

449
00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:05.036
They have really weird thermoregulation issues. They live underground,

450
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:09.109
they look funny. Uh. But, uh, they're an extreme

451
00:23:09.109 --> 00:23:12.310
version. They have, they're a mammal that's sort of

452
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.790
moved to something that's not homologous, but analogous to

453
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.229
an insect reproductive system. Um, WHEREAS what we call

454
00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:22.010
the monogamous primates is the, the pair living primates,

455
00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:24.069
which is I studied for part of my dissertation

456
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.670
and, and, and years ago, we think that monogamy

457
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.310
is weird in, if we believe anisogamy Bateman's arguments,

458
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.349
right? So monogamy shouldn't happen because why would a

459
00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:34.030
male stay with one female? That's weird. So there

460
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.310
must be some issues. So the male, in this

461
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.670
case, must be needed to raise the young. So

462
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.439
I, I went out to do my dissertation field

463
00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:42.229
with like, oh, I'm going to study monogamous primate.

464
00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:45.569
Clearly, anisogamy happens, it's cheap for males, expensive for

465
00:23:45.569 --> 00:23:47.599
females. Why would that male stay? He must be

466
00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:49.680
doing all the caretaking of the young. OK, so

467
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.000
the males of the species, I was looking at

468
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.400
bursitiss Potenziani do no caretaking of the young at

469
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.119
all. In fact, they don't even hang out much

470
00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:56.800
with the female. They don't seem to interact much

471
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.160
at all. So what it turns out is that

472
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.760
there's a lot of pair living primates, but they

473
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.949
do a bunch of different kinds of things. So,

474
00:24:03.959 --> 00:24:07.819
again, they don't fit this sort of expectation. As

475
00:24:07.819 --> 00:24:10.280
to an explanation of social system based on what

476
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.849
we assume the costs are of reproduction. And so

477
00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:15.170
what both of these cases show us is that

478
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.410
yes, there's some mammalian constraints on reproduction, but that

479
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.530
there's a really wide range of the way in

480
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.250
which mammals engage and deal with those constraints.

481
00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:27.609
What do you mean when you say, and now

482
00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:30.569
I'm going to ask you specifically about humans, when

483
00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.400
you say that humans are biocultural.

484
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.689
I mean, I think this is one of the

485
00:24:35.689 --> 00:24:38.250
most challenging things, right, as a, as a sort

486
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.550
of biological anthropologist, human biologist, someone who studies humans

487
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.800
and and and the human past and human relatives

488
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.130
that humans are primates. Um, I, I think it's

489
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.819
really, really important. To recognize that the cultural niche,

490
00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:59.180
right? That is thoughts, perceptions, linguistically mediated contexts, sort

491
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.459
of the way in which historical, written, spoken, social

492
00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:06.699
narratives, mores and expectations in societies are not just

493
00:25:06.699 --> 00:25:09.260
sort of a separate veneer on the biology. They're

494
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.219
actually mutually interfacing with our bodies, right? What we

495
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.260
eat, right, shapes our nutrition, shapes our microbiome, which

496
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.939
in fact is a critical part of human biological

497
00:25:17.939 --> 00:25:20.005
functioning. And so, The bottom line is to say

498
00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:21.724
that anyone who studies humans for any amount of

499
00:25:21.724 --> 00:25:25.204
time recognizes that we can't just talk about bodies,

500
00:25:25.364 --> 00:25:28.444
right, or genetics or biology and environment. We have

501
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:30.724
to think about the way in which this particular

502
00:25:30.724 --> 00:25:33.364
niche that humans exist in, this cultural niche, is

503
00:25:33.364 --> 00:25:35.564
integrated into the body and how the body pushes

504
00:25:35.564 --> 00:25:37.204
on that niche. So, that's what I mean by

505
00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.045
biocultural. And let me just say, this is a

506
00:25:39.045 --> 00:25:41.005
whole other conversation, but there's a lot of good

507
00:25:41.005 --> 00:25:43.525
literature out there that says biocultural might be actually

508
00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:46.574
much more common in other organisms, particularly primates, cetaceans,

509
00:25:46.604 --> 00:25:47.645
and some other things as well.

510
00:25:48.949 --> 00:25:52.270
Is this the point where we get the difference

511
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.329
between sex and gender?

512
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.479
Uh, SO this is, uh, you know, this is,

513
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.400
it's so intellectually, it's exciting, right, to talk about

514
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.040
these things because it's, it's very important, but it's

515
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.280
so difficult, because on the one hand, I'm gonna

516
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.680
say, yes, we need to talk about biology and

517
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.000
culture in these different ways so we can understand

518
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.599
them. But in the same sentence, I'm gonna say,

519
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.530
but you can't pull them apart. So I'm gonna

520
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.079
tell you that sex and gender, let's talk about

521
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:19.959
them separately, but in reality, they never exist without

522
00:26:19.959 --> 00:26:23.589
one another. We have gender sex. So, Gender, in,

523
00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:26.290
in the general sense is that a social, cultural,

524
00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:30.339
historical expectations and practices of a society, right? It's

525
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:33.650
the way in which society expects certain kinds of

526
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.209
bodies, right, uh, to behave and to act. Now,

527
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.250
what's really interesting about gender cross culturally, is that

528
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.800
there's not always two genders. Um, SOMETIMES there's more.

529
00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.770
And also, in many cases, gender is not measured

530
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.619
in sort of categorical, but Rather a, um, uh,

531
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.300
emphasis on particular patterns, right? So, masculinity and femininity

532
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.859
is a better way to think about gender than

533
00:26:56.859 --> 00:26:59.900
male and female. Um, SO these clusters. And then

534
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.800
again, sometimes we have more than two genders in,

535
00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:04.540
in, in many societies. Sex, on the other hand,

536
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.540
here, I'm talking about 3G sex, right? So I'm

537
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.520
sorry about these typical patterns of, of genetic gonads

538
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.380
and genitals that help us understand sort of biological

539
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.729
systems in, in humans. Now, let me point out

540
00:27:14.729 --> 00:27:19.109
that using 3G sex, Excludes a certain percentage of

541
00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:21.030
humans, cause there are a cluster of humans that

542
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.819
don't fall into those typical clusters. And the same

543
00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:26.579
thing with gender, then, we can say someone's masculine

544
00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.839
or feminine, but then we get these blends, right?

545
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.819
No one is ever just all the way on

546
00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:33.180
one side or the other. And so, what it

547
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.060
comes down to it is we can identify for

548
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:41.219
specific research, specific biological, specific sex targets, or specific

549
00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:43.689
gender targets. But we always have to step back

550
00:27:43.689 --> 00:27:45.780
and, and ask, what are the relations between these

551
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.099
things? Because a human is born into a cultural

552
00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:50.660
world with a biological body, and those two things

553
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.219
are always interconnected.

554
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.030
So not everyone falls into one of the two

555
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.229
cluster, the 2 3G sex clusters in humans, but

556
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.589
I mean, isn't it that there's a very, very

557
00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:10.349
high correlation in humans, at least between genes, gonads

558
00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:11.469
and genitals.

559
00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:14.229
Yeah, there is a pretty high correlation. So here's

560
00:28:14.229 --> 00:28:17.869
what's interesting. There's a very, very rare total departure

561
00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:21.910
from that, that cluster. Right? But there's huge actual

562
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.550
variation, let's, for example, say in genitals. The range

563
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:30.589
of genital development of, of functional, phenotypic variation in

564
00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:34.150
genitals is actually fairly large. And so, so where

565
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.310
do we sort of do that dividing line? And

566
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.109
what's really interesting is we really need to look

567
00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:41.910
at adult genitals to sort of understand function and

568
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.869
things like that, because we know that, um, during

569
00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:47.910
development, during Childhood, there's a lot of plasticity in

570
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.060
genital development, particularly prior to sort of the pubertal

571
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.510
endocrine shifts where we get full development of some

572
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.189
of the genital stuff. So, yeah, most people fall

573
00:28:56.189 --> 00:29:00.420
into a general 3G categories. Um, SOME people don't,

574
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.339
but what's really interesting, a lot of people who

575
00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:06.829
probably sense that they're one particular 3G category, there

576
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:08.849
could be variation in, in any of those 3,

577
00:29:09.069 --> 00:29:11.239
3Gs that we wouldn't even notice or see.

578
00:29:12.609 --> 00:29:15.890
OK, but those people who fall outside of the

579
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:21.079
two main 3G sex categories, are you referring to

580
00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:22.290
intersex? Yeah,

581
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.839
yeah. So that would be intersex people, but again,

582
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.810
how we define that depends on different categories, right?

583
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.439
So, for example, uh, the World Athletics, uh, uh,

584
00:29:32.449 --> 00:29:35.239
group, right, the track and field uh international organization

585
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.875
has a very specific definition of a certain circulating

586
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:41.525
levels of testosterone that defines you as female, right?

587
00:29:41.724 --> 00:29:44.094
As a woman in their case. Um, BUT what's

588
00:29:44.094 --> 00:29:46.655
really interesting is that there's a very large percentage

589
00:29:46.655 --> 00:29:50.545
of females who have PCO polycystic ovarian syndrome, or

590
00:29:50.545 --> 00:29:54.505
some other syndromes, whose, uh, resting testosterone, circulating testosterone

591
00:29:54.505 --> 00:29:56.935
is much higher than that. Um, BUT they are

592
00:29:56.935 --> 00:29:59.494
full of 3G. And so, really, this becomes like

593
00:29:59.494 --> 00:30:01.354
a dependent on, we have all these different ways

594
00:30:01.354 --> 00:30:05.880
in cultures of classifying. Uh, uh, SEX, that sometimes

595
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.359
it doesn't fit. So how, how we're defining intersex

596
00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:12.030
depends if we're talking just about biological dynamics, or

597
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.439
if we're talking about the way in which cultures

598
00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:16.020
are defining. Males and females or, or men and

599
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.780
women, and I'm sure we'll get into the conversation

600
00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.969
about how those things differ later too.

601
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.339
Yes, sure. But when it comes, for example, to

602
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:28.939
medicine or at least Western medicine, people tend to

603
00:30:28.939 --> 00:30:33.670
refer to intersex people as them having some sort

604
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:38.959
of disorder of sexual development and so that would

605
00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:43.339
indicate that they are Let's say exceptions to the

606
00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:45.939
rule. I mean, how do you deal with that?

607
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.300
So let's, let's think about that when we think

608
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.540
about the distribution of variation in biological traits, right?

609
00:30:51.699 --> 00:30:55.439
So, for example, there are very, very few humans

610
00:30:55.699 --> 00:30:59.689
who reach, you know, 2.5 m in height. Right?

611
00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:03.010
That's, that's an extreme distribution of that trade. However,

612
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.739
reaching 2.5 m in height, which is, well, that's

613
00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:08.380
actually really tall, let's say 2 m, 10 centimeters

614
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.219
or something, you know, that, that, that's still very

615
00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:13.569
high, very tall. Um, THAT'S an extreme version of

616
00:31:13.569 --> 00:31:15.969
that, but that may not have any impact on

617
00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:19.000
reproductive function or, or, or some other biological functions,

618
00:31:19.109 --> 00:31:22.219
uh, affecting longevity, right? And I'm not saying that

619
00:31:22.219 --> 00:31:26.994
intersects. Conditions or intersex classification is always the same

620
00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:29.555
thing as a distribution. But what we're talking about

621
00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:33.064
in some intersex contexts is just an extreme part

622
00:31:33.064 --> 00:31:36.994
of the distribution, right? That doesn't have necessarily negative

623
00:31:36.994 --> 00:31:39.545
context in the sense of biological or social functioning.

624
00:31:39.714 --> 00:31:41.635
And so then we have to ask, we're calling

625
00:31:41.635 --> 00:31:43.875
this a disorder because it's outside of the typical

626
00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:48.030
cluster, but is that being outside A disorder or

627
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.670
part of the range of variation. I think we

628
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.170
have to be very careful here. For example, uh,

629
00:31:52.189 --> 00:31:55.880
recent work on neurodivergence has reclassified the way in

630
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.189
which we think about. So what is typical and

631
00:31:58.189 --> 00:31:59.829
atypical, and how do we think about that in

632
00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:02.510
the sense of neurobiological functioning? I mean, a recent

633
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.310
work on what's used to be or generally called

634
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.329
aut autistic spectrum also shows that there's actually a,

635
00:32:07.339 --> 00:32:11.270
a range of distribution of neurobiological and cognitive function

636
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.530
in humans that is in the range. Typical, but

637
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.849
has typical clusters, and people fall outside that typical

638
00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:19.449
cluster. And so I think the challenge here is

639
00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:22.050
to be very specific about what we're saying. So

640
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.569
for example, it's common to say, you know, an

641
00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:27.250
extra X or an extra Y chromosome is a

642
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.319
particular kind of disorder. Well, in some cases, um,

643
00:32:30.689 --> 00:32:34.420
there's really little physiological impact. So you could call

644
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.180
it a disorder, but if it isn't impacting sort

645
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.380
of the capacity for this individual to function in

646
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.150
society or to reproduce. Then you have to ask,

647
00:32:42.199 --> 00:32:44.750
well, what, what are we meaning by disorder? So

648
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.439
I, I think much, much better attention to what

649
00:32:47.439 --> 00:32:51.319
we mean by the distribution of variation uh needs

650
00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:53.359
to be clarified before we say disorders.

651
00:32:54.579 --> 00:32:56.699
Right. But I mean, the main reason why I

652
00:32:56.699 --> 00:32:59.140
asked you that, or perhaps one of the main

653
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.699
reasons is that someone might pick on that to

654
00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:07.209
say, OK, but then, I mean, sex in humans

655
00:33:07.209 --> 00:33:09.900
would still be binary in the sense that we

656
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.819
have females and males, and then there's a tiny

657
00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:18.500
minority of people who have these disorders of sexual

658
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.939
development. And they are exceptions in terms of how

659
00:33:22.939 --> 00:33:26.459
they The sexual characteristics develop and in terms of

660
00:33:26.459 --> 00:33:30.780
not perhaps having a correspondence between genes, gonads, and

661
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:36.140
genitals. Uh, BUT, I mean, we could still classify

662
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.489
them as primarily male or female with just some,

663
00:33:41.739 --> 00:33:45.569
uh, variations in terms of their sex biology. I

664
00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:47.180
don't know you, what you,

665
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.579
no, no, no, that's a very common argument. And

666
00:33:49.579 --> 00:33:51.420
I would say there's two ones. Let's talk about

667
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.699
the general bi. Biological sort of argument there. And

668
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.540
then let's talk about the medical argument. The general

669
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.739
biological argument, I, I, my response is, you're trying

670
00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:01.739
that argument is trying really, really hard to force

671
00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:05.910
variation into conceptual categories, as opposed to describe the

672
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.938
variation, the biological variation that's there. Um, IF we

673
00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:12.820
don't have two separate kinds, and there's variation linking

674
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.340
those kinds, and the variation in those kinds is

675
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.780
all from the same materials, I would argue that's

676
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.458
not a binary. That, that's, that's a kind of

677
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:21.580
spectrum. That doesn't mean in any way. SHAPE or

678
00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.100
form that males and females aren't different, and it

679
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.659
doesn't mean in any way, shape, and form that

680
00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.260
there's not two typical categories. It just means that

681
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.219
the variation, the biological variation is distributed there. So

682
00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.020
that's, that would be my response to that. Like,

683
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.860
if you have to work so hard to explain

684
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.500
away a chunk of humanity, uh, or a chunk

685
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.739
of organisms in a species, I, I think that's

686
00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.030
not good biology. On the other hand, medically speaking,

687
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.020
we have to be very, very careful because there

688
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.290
are typical patterns in gender sexed individuals, right? So,

689
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.149
for example, um, women, Uh, in, in, in contemporary

690
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:55.429
data sets, women die after heart attacks much more

691
00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.790
than men. OK. We know there's no sex differences

692
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.899
in hearts, that the hearts actually are not sex-specific.

693
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.439
Um, SO something is going on, and we really

694
00:35:04.439 --> 00:35:06.489
need them to study what's going on, what are

695
00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:09.709
differences in life, life histories, contacts between women and

696
00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:12.449
men. And so then, we want these typical categories

697
00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:14.060
because we want to look at what's going on.

698
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.360
Another, uh, example here is that intersex individuals are,

699
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.590
are prone to much, much higher, uh, risks of

700
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.000
a variety of Different kinds of, um, social, uh,

701
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.510
violence and, and other things like that. And so,

702
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.439
rather than saying, oh well, that's because of the

703
00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:28.840
er we have to think about, well, what is

704
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.719
the characteristic, the social, the historical, the frame of

705
00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:34.239
intersection individuals that, that results in these kind of

706
00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:37.360
outcomes. So, here I'm arguing for, sometimes we really

707
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.280
need to use these categories, but biologically, we have

708
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.189
to not reify them as the way humans are,

709
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.879
rather, think about the biological variation.

710
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.919
Mhm. So, we're going to come back to the

711
00:35:50.919 --> 00:35:54.110
distribution of sex biology in humans. I have a

712
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.469
few more questions about that. But now let me

713
00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:58.989
ask you also about another thing that you talk

714
00:35:58.989 --> 00:36:03.459
about in the book, namely, uh, in the comparison

715
00:36:03.459 --> 00:36:06.270
that we, or the comparisons that we can make

716
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.864
between ourselves and uh and other. Primates, particularly our

717
00:36:09.864 --> 00:36:15.385
closest primate relatives. So, in terms of primates, how

718
00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:20.344
much variability is there in terms of behavioral differences

719
00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:24.344
between males and females? And do we know how

720
00:36:24.344 --> 00:36:26.665
much of it is the result or has been

721
00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:29.054
the result of sexual selection?

722
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.689
Well, what I think primates are great and and

723
00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.939
humans are primates, so, right? Primates are the the

724
00:36:33.939 --> 00:36:36.570
logical first sort of step of comparison, right? And

725
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.250
then we might want to constrain it to apes

726
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.870
in some context, but let's say the primate-wide. Um,

727
00:36:40.889 --> 00:36:44.320
AND primates are fascinating as mammals too, because one,

728
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.129
there is a some clear typical patterns of classic

729
00:36:48.129 --> 00:36:50.689
sexual selection in, in, in primates, right? Or, or

730
00:36:50.689 --> 00:36:53.570
at least we think that's what explains. There's a

731
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.205
whole cluster of primates. It's about a quarter. SPECIES,

732
00:36:56.235 --> 00:36:58.715
maybe a little bit more, um, where we see

733
00:36:58.715 --> 00:37:02.274
body size differences, large males, smaller females, uh, males

734
00:37:02.274 --> 00:37:05.145
with much more substantial canine teeth, and some other

735
00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:09.514
musculature and physical morphology that that indicates a kind

736
00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:12.594
of increased capacity for conflict or aggressive violence or

737
00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:14.915
things like that. And so, in some species, we're

738
00:37:14.915 --> 00:37:17.864
like, wow, you know, we really see these morphological

739
00:37:17.864 --> 00:37:21.314
phenotypic outcomes of the kinds of sexual selection we'd

740
00:37:21.314 --> 00:37:24.969
expect. However, in other species, we don't, right? Uh,

741
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.570
THEN we see these sort of uh monomorphics or

742
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.590
same size primates where you get all of these

743
00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:32.250
weird things, weird. I mean, it's part of the

744
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.610
variation with extensive male care or monomorphism without male

745
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.534
care, which doesn't make sense from the basic. Standard

746
00:37:39.534 --> 00:37:43.814
sexual selection argument. Then we see some extreme dimorphism,

747
00:37:43.824 --> 00:37:46.334
like in gorillas, which are amongst the most dimorphic

748
00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:49.655
of all primates. Um, AND, and we see really

749
00:37:49.655 --> 00:37:52.405
interesting relationships between adult males, particularly silverbacks and and

750
00:37:52.415 --> 00:37:55.574
and young gorillas of affiliation. So not, not so

751
00:37:55.574 --> 00:37:58.500
much. CARETAKING in the sense of carrying and and

752
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.560
holding, but a lot of play, a lot of

753
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.840
protection, and we're wondering about what are these behavioral

754
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.080
modification like, what is that relationship between uh uh

755
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.929
male gorillas and and young, and there's something really

756
00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:12.760
important there. So, primates are a great comparative sense

757
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.780
because We have pretty much the entire range of

758
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.659
variation in uh uh uh uh an order of

759
00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:22.459
mammals that should be fairly consistent across it. I

760
00:38:22.459 --> 00:38:24.699
mean, and the example, even even in our close

761
00:38:24.699 --> 00:38:28.419
relatives, right, we get bonobos and chimpanzees, so paninniscus

762
00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:31.679
and pan troglodites. Who are actually more similar than

763
00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:34.800
most people, uh, argue, so that that's another conversation.

764
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.320
But there are some classic differences, right? Uh PANTROLODIDES

765
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.280
in on average tends to be, uh, much more

766
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.040
sort of male bonded with really strong aggression between

767
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.000
communities, lethal aggression even, um, whereas Paninniscus seems to

768
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.800
be sort of female bonded with incredibly high rates

769
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.379
of socio. Sexual behavior and more affiliative reactions, interactions

770
00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:57.889
between communities or across individuals. THEY do fight though.

771
00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.979
I think that's important. People think bonobos don't fight,

772
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.169
they do. Um, BUT what's really interesting is that

773
00:39:03.419 --> 00:39:06.459
here with the, the genus Pan, we're seeing pretty

774
00:39:06.459 --> 00:39:10.620
much the same reproductive biology, physiology, even bodies. They're

775
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.090
not that different, and yet radically different sort of.

776
00:39:14.409 --> 00:39:18.199
Sexual social systems. And, and I think that hints

777
00:39:18.199 --> 00:39:20.260
at, as I say in the book, that we

778
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.830
really need to be careful about assuming, like, one

779
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.199
way to be, uh, in regards to sex for

780
00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:28.479
organisms, because we have many organisms in the primates

781
00:39:28.479 --> 00:39:31.639
and in other mammals and other species with morphologies

782
00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:34.520
that should be presenting the same way for sexual

783
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.399
systems that do things totally differently.

784
00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:40.290
So that last point, what does the fact that

785
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:44.649
chimpanzees and bonobos have the same sex biology but

786
00:39:44.649 --> 00:39:49.290
differ in particular aspects of their behavior, tell us

787
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.879
about the link between sex, biology and the behavior

788
00:39:53.879 --> 00:39:55.159
of each sex?

789
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.419
Well, it, it illustrates, I think, very robustly that

790
00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:01.860
we have to be very, very careful about making

791
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:07.330
predictions about any given species or lineages, social, ecological,

792
00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:12.600
behavioral dynamics based on their particular reproductive physiology. Um,

793
00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:14.300
I think we, we can't make these 1 to

794
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.239
1 arguments and, and the chimpanzees and bonobos are

795
00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:19.439
really good example that we've got radically, well, they're

796
00:40:19.439 --> 00:40:21.439
really not that different, but, but, you know, pretty

797
00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:26.439
different, um, uh, social and ecological realities without an

798
00:40:26.439 --> 00:40:30.919
enormous difference physiologically or morphologically. Um, AND this, I

799
00:40:30.919 --> 00:40:33.149
would argue, is characteristic of a lot of the

800
00:40:33.149 --> 00:40:35.830
hyper-social mammals, not just primates. I think we could

801
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.590
look at cetaceans, look at some canids, and some

802
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.340
other very social mammals, and we see really interesting,

803
00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:45.979
uh, meerkats or another one, really interesting sort of

804
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.030
complex patterns of social and sexual behavior, right? That

805
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:54.399
emerge from this mammalian reproductive physiology that we assume

806
00:40:54.399 --> 00:40:56.040
tells us there's one way to be a mammal,

807
00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.550
and it turns out there's not. There's many. And

808
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.709
they're all successful, right? That's, that's the interesting thing.

809
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.629
It's not just one better way to be a

810
00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:02.949
mammal.

811
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.810
Sure. Uh, AND with that in mind, I mean,

812
00:41:06.919 --> 00:41:11.199
what can we learn about human behavior by doing

813
00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:16.389
comparative biology and studying our closest, uh, great ape

814
00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:20.929
relatives and particularly chimpanzees and bonobos because many times

815
00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:25.629
people use them as animal models and to make

816
00:41:25.629 --> 00:41:31.040
inferences about uh human, male and human female behavior.

817
00:41:31.365 --> 00:41:34.196
Well, I would say on one hand, um, the

818
00:41:34.196 --> 00:41:36.916
comparative approach to this is why I got into

819
00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:39.555
anthropology, because I was also well trained in zoology.

820
00:41:39.635 --> 00:41:41.716
And I was really, I think, to really study

821
00:41:41.716 --> 00:41:43.595
humans well, you also have to study other primates

822
00:41:43.595 --> 00:41:46.045
and that, you know, I studied what, seagulls, dusky-footed

823
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:50.706
wood rats, mantis shrimp. I, I think comparative approaches

824
00:41:50.706 --> 00:41:53.196
are, are that this is the treasure of the

825
00:41:53.196 --> 00:41:55.916
Western scientific method, right? This idea that we think,

826
00:41:55.966 --> 00:41:58.275
OK, here are a bunch of different patterns. Let's

827
00:41:58.275 --> 00:42:01.672
study. DIFFERENT organisms to understand what's distinctive about different

828
00:42:01.672 --> 00:42:04.191
lineages or different organisms. So, I think the comparative

829
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:06.191
approach is, for me, it's gold, right? That's the

830
00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:09.231
way I think we really understand what's, what's distinctive

831
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:11.912
about any given lineage, what's distinctive about humans. The

832
00:42:11.912 --> 00:42:13.872
flip side is, we have to be careful with

833
00:42:13.872 --> 00:42:16.191
the comparative approach. So for years, people said chimpanzees

834
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:18.031
and bananas, right? Genus Pan is the model for

835
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:20.832
human evolution and human ancestors. And, and I would

836
00:42:20.832 --> 00:42:22.951
suggest, as do many people now, it's actually a

837
00:42:22.951 --> 00:42:25.672
pretty bad model. Um, CLEARLY, right, in the last

838
00:42:25.672 --> 00:42:28.387
10 million years, Sort of the, the hominins and

839
00:42:28.387 --> 00:42:31.907
genus Pan have really been on very different evolutionary

840
00:42:31.907 --> 00:42:35.778
trajectories, and we've got some radically different, uh, social

841
00:42:35.778 --> 00:42:39.318
organization and behavior, some superficial similarities, but there's a

842
00:42:39.318 --> 00:42:42.028
lot of difference. And so I would argue that

843
00:42:42.028 --> 00:42:43.647
we need to look across all of the great

844
00:42:43.647 --> 00:42:46.387
apes, right? And, and, and, and the gibbons, all

845
00:42:46.387 --> 00:42:48.228
the hominoids, if we want to do this sort

846
00:42:48.228 --> 00:42:52.228
of outgroup for humans. I'm, I, I think chimpanzees

847
00:42:52.228 --> 00:42:56.253
are really quite distinctive. Um, AND chimpanzees and bonobos,

848
00:42:56.263 --> 00:42:58.503
and they overlap to a certain amount with us,

849
00:42:58.583 --> 00:43:01.704
but they're not actually very good models, especially, for

850
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:05.664
example, let's take pantroglodides, right, chimpanzees. Male and female

851
00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:09.743
dynamics in pantroglodides is nothing like male and female

852
00:43:09.743 --> 00:43:12.583
dynamics in humans. Um, AND so using that as

853
00:43:12.583 --> 00:43:15.503
our ancestor to sort of derive human, sort of

854
00:43:15.503 --> 00:43:17.704
a model for ancestral things. I think that's a

855
00:43:17.704 --> 00:43:20.384
bad idea. I think humans and chimpanzees are equally

856
00:43:20.384 --> 00:43:21.624
derived from one another.

857
00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:28.149
When it comes to understanding sexual behavior, and now

858
00:43:28.149 --> 00:43:30.879
I'm going to focus on humans, but I bet

859
00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:35.449
that it would also apply to other species. What

860
00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:38.770
does the fact that uh it's not always the

861
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.889
case that we have sex for the sake of

862
00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:46.840
reproduction, not all sex is reproductive, tell us about

863
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.050
sexual behavior and sex biology. I mean, why does

864
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.770
that matter?

865
00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:55.429
Well, I think that's really, really important, uh, because

866
00:43:55.429 --> 00:43:57.070
in, and we'll just talk about humans here, but

867
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.340
you're right, this goes for other animals as well.

868
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.739
Um, SOCIAL sex, that is the use of, let's

869
00:44:02.739 --> 00:44:06.600
say, um, the sexual arousal system, right, which is

870
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.070
connected to, but not the only component of the

871
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:12.389
reproductive system. So sexual arousal, genitals, other kind of

872
00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:17.010
physical. Physiological arousal and social interactions, these kinds of

873
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:21.800
behaviors are actually central for human social relationships. They,

874
00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:24.169
there's a lot of energy invested. There's a lot

875
00:44:24.169 --> 00:44:26.570
of risk in some cases in engaging these kinds

876
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.889
of things. Humans have, have very, very high rates

877
00:44:28.889 --> 00:44:31.850
of, uh, sexually transmitted infections, which I think is

878
00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:35.530
a very interesting thing. And so, because social sex

879
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.770
makes up such a large percentage of the actual

880
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.780
sexual activity in humans, I would argue, and, and

881
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.179
many others have, that we need to include that

882
00:44:43.179 --> 00:44:45.770
in understanding the evolution of of of human sexual

883
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.139
biology. Um, CLEARLY, social sex has been central. It's

884
00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:53.300
common across the hominoids and in many other primates.

885
00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:55.300
It's been an important part of the sort of

886
00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.100
adaptive dynamics of, of, of humans for a long

887
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.335
time. And So when we talk about sort of

888
00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:04.095
what does it mean to have a particular reproductive

889
00:45:04.095 --> 00:45:08.035
anatomy, um, we better include social sex in our

890
00:45:08.035 --> 00:45:11.416
models for the costs and benefits of those dynamics.

891
00:45:11.456 --> 00:45:13.256
And, and I think most people don't. Most people

892
00:45:13.256 --> 00:45:15.476
think of the social sex is like an add-on

893
00:45:15.476 --> 00:45:18.295
or a benefit, a side project, but I would

894
00:45:18.295 --> 00:45:22.172
argue that it's a very, very Central behavior across

895
00:45:22.172 --> 00:45:26.872
human history that it has particular energetic costs and

896
00:45:26.872 --> 00:45:30.852
particular risks associated, particularly with uh uh sexually transmitted

897
00:45:30.852 --> 00:45:33.291
infections, plus in social context, we also do it

898
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.332
with jealousy and a variety of other things. So

899
00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:37.132
I think we need to include that in our

900
00:45:37.132 --> 00:45:40.372
evolutionary models for understanding sex biology.

901
00:45:41.649 --> 00:45:44.570
Yes, that's really interesting because it does seem to

902
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:50.590
me that many biologists and people who study, uh,

903
00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:56.340
sex, human sex and human sexual behavior, whenever they're

904
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.564
talking about or studying the The weighing that people

905
00:46:01.564 --> 00:46:05.125
make in terms of weighing the pluses and minuses

906
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:08.435
or the costs and benefits of having sex with

907
00:46:08.685 --> 00:46:14.114
a particular person, they're always thinking about it leading

908
00:46:14.114 --> 00:46:18.405
to reproduction or being reproductive in some way, right?

909
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.699
Yeah, and, and it turns out that for humans,

910
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.169
we know that's not true, right? That the majority

911
00:46:24.169 --> 00:46:28.010
of human sexual interaction is not, does not produce

912
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.939
a reproductive outcome, even when those individuals are attending

913
00:46:31.939 --> 00:46:34.899
to to sort of try to reproduce. Um, AND

914
00:46:34.899 --> 00:46:36.370
we also know this is true for a number

915
00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.899
of them, he brought up bonobos, but there's a

916
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:41.100
number of primate species where social sex is actually

917
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.580
critical, um, and we can even think about, you

918
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.429
know, let's think about chimpanzee males with no. Chance

919
00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:49.989
of reproduction, right? But they engage in, in genital

920
00:46:49.989 --> 00:46:53.270
contact and genital touching in, in many social instances.

921
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.550
And it's actually very central. Uh GORILLAS are, are

922
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.830
the same way. And so, we really need to,

923
00:46:57.909 --> 00:47:00.189
I would argue, like you just said, maybe we

924
00:47:00.189 --> 00:47:02.270
need to step back and say, OK, are our

925
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:07.149
models of sexual biology and sexual activity, including these

926
00:47:07.149 --> 00:47:10.520
really important aspects, probably the most prominent aspects of

927
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.070
sexual behavior in the organisms that we're looking at?

928
00:47:13.879 --> 00:47:18.540
Mhm. So let's get to go back to gender

929
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.169
then for a bit. What, what would you say

930
00:47:21.169 --> 00:47:26.270
are the main differences really between sex and gender,

931
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.040
and I mean, is gender something that applies also

932
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.639
to species to other uh animal species apart from

933
00:47:34.639 --> 00:47:35.280
humans?

934
00:47:35.899 --> 00:47:38.580
So, I mean, this is again a whole show,

935
00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:40.320
right? To, to have a bunch of folks and

936
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.129
and fight over this. Um, I currently right now,

937
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.149
and, and I could be wrong, but I use

938
00:47:45.149 --> 00:47:47.540
gender only in humans right now, um, because of

939
00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.060
the way that we're defining gender as this sort

940
00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:56.179
of socially, behavioral, linguistically, uh, historically, politically, economically mediated

941
00:47:56.179 --> 00:47:58.659
sets of expectations and roles for, for, for in

942
00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:01.600
societies. Um. It's not to say it can't happen

943
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.360
in others, but I think it's a complicated definitional

944
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.350
process. I think there are sex roles in other

945
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.120
organisms, um, but gender is not just sex roles.

946
00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:13.750
So gender is not 100% tied to sex biology,

947
00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:17.790
right? Gender, so what, how masculine or feminine uh

948
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.760
one is actually is not 100 or not even

949
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.739
80% correlated with what chromosomes. What, uh, gonads and

950
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.459
what genitals they have. And so I think that's

951
00:48:27.459 --> 00:48:30.860
very interesting. It's like sexual attraction also is broadly

952
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.270
correlated, but not 100% correlated. And so, gender, I

953
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.659
think, is really important because it's a complex social

954
00:48:36.659 --> 00:48:39.750
dynamic. And we have to be very, very careful

955
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.350
not to conflate gender identities, gender roles, and gender

956
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:50.080
contexts with a causal relationship from Particular kinds of

957
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.939
um uh biological facets. So for example, a number

958
00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:57.040
of scholars have said, well, testosterone, right? Testosterone causes

959
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.320
these huge differences in in bodies right between males

960
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.199
and females, and that's why men, the gender, behave

961
00:49:02.199 --> 00:49:04.310
one way and women, the gender behave another way.

962
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.040
And, and I think there's a significant challenge to

963
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.439
that simplistic association. Clearly, testosterone is very important in,

964
00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:14.020
in, you know, uh, many, many. Many species, uh,

965
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.379
and in humans, it has, it's very, uh, androgens

966
00:49:16.379 --> 00:49:18.729
in general and all the hormones, but androgens have

967
00:49:18.729 --> 00:49:22.060
a very, uh, important set of effects. But to

968
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.139
say that testosterone does men and not women is

969
00:49:25.139 --> 00:49:27.939
sort of biologically inaccurate. Uh, AND so I think

970
00:49:27.939 --> 00:49:30.090
we have to be careful of that slippage between

971
00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:34.300
these really interesting gender dynamics, complicated gender dynamics, and

972
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.969
simplistic, causal biological explanations.

973
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.459
Uh, BUT when it comes to gender identity specifically,

974
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.209
what do you make of the fact that the

975
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:51.250
vast majority of humans apparently identify with their biological

976
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.010
sex?

977
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.820
Well, I'd say it's actually the reverse, right? It

978
00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:01.300
is, that is gender. Uh, CLASSIFICATIONS, gender systems are

979
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.469
correlated with, centered around, uh, genitals or other aspects

980
00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.110
of bodily appearance, right? So there is a connection

981
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.909
between that. And so it's not that most people

982
00:50:09.909 --> 00:50:12.469
are like, oh, I identify with. It's just that

983
00:50:12.469 --> 00:50:14.790
I live, this is my body, this is the

984
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:17.469
social, uh, reality I'm in. I sort of match

985
00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:19.256
to the way in which the society. I grew

986
00:50:19.256 --> 00:50:21.736
up in expects things to be. Um, BUT there's

987
00:50:21.736 --> 00:50:24.055
a large percentage of people. It's not small. A

988
00:50:24.055 --> 00:50:26.016
large percentage of people that are like, Well, I

989
00:50:26.016 --> 00:50:28.446
sort of match, but sort of don't match. Um,

990
00:50:28.456 --> 00:50:29.855
AND so I think there's a lot of variation.

991
00:50:29.936 --> 00:50:31.815
I think right now, there's this huge fights about

992
00:50:31.815 --> 00:50:34.055
gender identity because it's come to the fore. It's

993
00:50:34.055 --> 00:50:36.635
been politicized in many ways. And it's also, uh,

994
00:50:36.736 --> 00:50:40.335
I think, a complicated but very important, uh, argument.

995
00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:42.082
But, but Does, does that make sense that I

996
00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:43.761
think it's, it's the other way around. It's not

997
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:44.842
like people are like, Oh, well, I have my

998
00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:48.201
gender identity because I have these genitals or genes.

999
00:50:48.302 --> 00:50:50.281
It's more that I have this body and I

1000
00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:52.521
grew up into this society. I'm, I'm OK with

1001
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:54.922
that. I, I, things feel right. In other ways.

1002
00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:56.922
Other people, I have this body, I grew up

1003
00:50:56.922 --> 00:50:59.322
into the society. I, I don't feel it. Something

1004
00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:01.082
is not right. So I, I would, I would

1005
00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:02.721
reverse that, that pattern.

1006
00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:06.199
Uh, I, I mean, could it be at least

1007
00:51:06.199 --> 00:51:12.080
in part, uh, because of sexually dimorphic areas of

1008
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.879
the brain that would lead people to identify primarily

1009
00:51:16.879 --> 00:51:20.169
as men or as a man or a woman

1010
00:51:20.169 --> 00:51:22.560
or a female or a male?

1011
00:51:23.219 --> 00:51:25.780
No, the brain research is very, very clear on

1012
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.979
this, that there's really not male and female brains,

1013
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.020
right? There's sort of mosaics of masculine and feminine

1014
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.100
performance in brains, but I mean, I think you

1015
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.780
can look at like Lisa Elliott's work and and

1016
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.060
even the, the major arguments for different sex differences

1017
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.479
in the brain, like the big, uh, uh, uh,

1018
00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.300
article that came out recently, a couple of years

1019
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.080
back, uh, from the, the, the British, the, the

1020
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.419
big, uh, what's it called, the giant me the

1021
00:51:48.419 --> 00:51:51.790
population survey and. The UK. Anyway, the UK biodata,

1022
00:51:51.919 --> 00:51:54.439
uh, biobank, the UK biobank uh study, uh, which

1023
00:51:54.439 --> 00:51:55.679
is one of the largest ones, and they said,

1024
00:51:55.719 --> 00:51:58.520
look, there's clear differences. The differences are teeny, and

1025
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.159
they're structural, and they're not able to tie them

1026
00:52:01.159 --> 00:52:04.000
to any functional differences. So, I mean, the bottom

1027
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.760
line is there's not male and female brains, there's

1028
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.280
a lot of variation. But, and this is, I

1029
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.080
think, really important and goes to what we were

1030
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.800
just talking about. When you look at brain activity

1031
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.090
in adults, Gender shows up very strongly, like, your

1032
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.489
masculine or feminine sense, your senses of man or

1033
00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:21.649
woman, your senses sort of in uh uh someone

1034
00:52:21.649 --> 00:52:24.090
who is not male, man or woman. That shows,

1035
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:25.649
we can see that in the brain, but you

1036
00:52:25.649 --> 00:52:27.929
can't see that in kids. Um, AND so what's

1037
00:52:27.929 --> 00:52:31.169
really interesting is that clearly the way neurobiology works

1038
00:52:31.169 --> 00:52:33.169
is, as we grow up in a society in

1039
00:52:33.169 --> 00:52:35.489
this gender sexed reality, it shapes our body and

1040
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:36.729
and our mind.

1041
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.159
Yeah, I asked you that. I mean, this might

1042
00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:43.679
be outdated information. I'm not sure, but I read

1043
00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:48.100
some studies where apparently they found out that The

1044
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:53.620
brains of transgender people are more similar to the

1045
00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:58.100
brains of people of the sex they identify with

1046
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.260
that is, uh, the, the, the, the sex that

1047
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.020
is opposite to the sex that was assigned to

1048
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.419
them at birth. I mean, I'm not sure. Yeah,

1049
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.020
no, so this is, so there's been some, there

1050
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.280
were some initial work um. Uh, OVER the last

1051
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.919
couple of decades, saying, oh, well, there might be

1052
00:53:13.919 --> 00:53:17.560
these morphological variants. That's, that doesn't pattern out. What

1053
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.310
does pattern out, though, is that individuals who identify

1054
00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.719
sort of with particular feminine or particular masculine patterns

1055
00:53:24.719 --> 00:53:28.479
or contexts, they do have some overlap in brain

1056
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:30.919
function. That is on MRI and other things, which

1057
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:32.840
we can debate how good those are. But what

1058
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.100
it looks like brains are reacting, in particular In

1059
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:40.199
shared contexts, for example, individuals who identify as highly

1060
00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:42.550
feminine seem to be reacting in the same ways

1061
00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.340
to their brain, right? But morphologically, no, there's no,

1062
00:53:45.459 --> 00:53:46.810
you can't, I mean, I put, I can put

1063
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.510
40 brains up here, and, and you couldn't tell

1064
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.060
morphologically what the differences are. Um, AND there's a

1065
00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.620
big debate about that, but I would read Lise

1066
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:57.500
Elliott and colleagues, uh, giant, uh, overview called Dump

1067
00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.139
the Dimorphism, which is a really, really good. Sort

1068
00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:03.979
of argument for, yes, there's some patterns, but really

1069
00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:06.770
to say male and female brain is to reject

1070
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.840
biological fact at this point.

1071
00:54:09.399 --> 00:54:12.709
Mhm. And, and so since we're talking about gender,

1072
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.479
where do gender roles come from? I mean, how

1073
00:54:16.479 --> 00:54:17.870
do they evolve?

1074
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.229
So, as you know in the book, I, I

1075
00:54:21.229 --> 00:54:23.669
try my hand a little bit at this, but

1076
00:54:23.669 --> 00:54:25.780
let me just be very, very honest with you.

1077
00:54:25.989 --> 00:54:29.750
Uh, PALEOANTHROPOLOGICAL and pale archaeological data give us very

1078
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.110
little insight into gender. They give us a little,

1079
00:54:32.149 --> 00:54:35.669
a little bit of hints, right? Um, CLEARLY, um,

1080
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.030
some data from Neanderthal. I mean, when we go

1081
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.159
deeper than, let's say, 20 or 30,000 years, right?

1082
00:54:40.764 --> 00:54:42.604
When we look at the, the fossil and archaeological

1083
00:54:42.604 --> 00:54:45.604
record that's older than 20 or 30,000 years, we're

1084
00:54:45.604 --> 00:54:47.764
not seeing much evidence for gender roles. We don't

1085
00:54:47.764 --> 00:54:51.215
see sort of patterns of associated with sex, with

1086
00:54:51.215 --> 00:54:53.804
tool construction or or or a variety or bone

1087
00:54:53.804 --> 00:54:56.024
breakage or anything like that. But we do see

1088
00:54:56.024 --> 00:54:59.044
some patterns in Neanderthals, for example, slightly different dental

1089
00:54:59.044 --> 00:55:01.084
wear between those we think are male and those

1090
00:55:01.084 --> 00:55:05.020
that we think are female. That's Interesting, right? That

1091
00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.300
suggests some sort of patterns of behavioral difference. Anyway,

1092
00:55:07.379 --> 00:55:09.260
I, I reviewed in the book, um, and so

1093
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:13.250
what I'm arguing is that clearly I think Social

1094
00:55:13.699 --> 00:55:18.179
roles associated with morphology, bodily morphology, probably have a

1095
00:55:18.179 --> 00:55:21.540
very deep history, um, and humans have probably categorized

1096
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.530
sort of social experience and context in different ways,

1097
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.659
using bodies as a mediator, uh, or indicator of

1098
00:55:27.659 --> 00:55:29.899
some patterns. I think that's really old. We, we

1099
00:55:29.899 --> 00:55:33.260
can't really demonstrate that. Clearly, up until recently, in

1100
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.620
the last 4 or 56 1000 years, we can

1101
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.620
start to see what we Consider typical contemporary gender

1102
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.580
roles, right? Where we start to see, let's, for

1103
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.540
example, grave goods are very different between those bodies

1104
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.620
we think are male and female, although we, we

1105
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.260
keep misidentifying bodies by sex. Um, AND, and I

1106
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.899
think so we can see the emergence of, of

1107
00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:53.620
contemporary gender roles in the last, you know, 4567

1108
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.739
millennia. Um, DOES that mean gender did not exist

1109
00:55:56.739 --> 00:55:58.739
in the past? No. I think it did, and

1110
00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:02.110
I think it evolved alongside Of social complexity in

1111
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:05.179
the genus Homo. Um, DO I think Australopithecines had

1112
00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:06.659
gender in the way we think of gender? I,

1113
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.540
I don't know. I don't see any evidence for

1114
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.860
that. But I think over the last million years

1115
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.659
at least, we probably see the emergence of something

1116
00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:16.870
we would call gender. But I would suggest, given

1117
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.340
cross-cultural evidence from today, and what little archaeological evidence

1118
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.860
we have is that gender roles in the past

1119
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.939
may have been quite different from gender roles today.

1120
00:56:26.429 --> 00:56:29.179
So, in, in the book, you also talk about

1121
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:34.409
uh sex differences and and sex biology and modern

1122
00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:37.260
contemporary humans. I mean, why do you think it

1123
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:41.510
is important to talk about modern contemporary humans and

1124
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:45.110
not just humans, homo sapiens in general?

1125
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.949
Well, because I think contemporary humans are very, very

1126
00:56:47.949 --> 00:56:50.229
important in the sense that we know sort of

1127
00:56:50.229 --> 00:56:52.459
this general body plan, it's been around a long

1128
00:56:52.459 --> 00:56:55.389
time, but the contemporary dynamic changes a lot. We

1129
00:56:55.389 --> 00:56:58.000
know that height has changed over recent time, sort

1130
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.739
of weight distribution patterns, adipose tissue patterns, and so.

1131
00:57:01.149 --> 00:57:02.840
It's also, it's so it's important to sort of

1132
00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.679
get an idea of, of, of, you know, what

1133
00:57:04.679 --> 00:57:07.280
is, what are the 8 billion humans around? What's

1134
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.000
that variation look like? CAUSE I'm really interested in

1135
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.830
biological variation. So how's that pattern? I also put

1136
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.280
that section in there and it was, it was

1137
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.800
a really fun and difficult section to write, how

1138
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.239
to, what to put in and what not to

1139
00:57:17.239 --> 00:57:19.260
put in. But the point is, is, I, I

1140
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.060
want people, I want readers of this book to

1141
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.899
recognize I'm not saying males and females are the

1142
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.850
same. I'm not saying all humans are the same.

1143
00:57:25.939 --> 00:57:30.699
There's some patterned variation, typical and atypical patterns. What

1144
00:57:30.699 --> 00:57:32.300
do we know about it? How is it out

1145
00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.340
there? And so I wanted to sort of show

1146
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:38.179
that there's some very well established, very important patterns

1147
00:57:38.179 --> 00:57:41.540
of variation that differ, and other patterns that people

1148
00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.419
think differ that don't differ in the way they

1149
00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:45.659
think. So, I, uh, that whole chapter, the point

1150
00:57:45.659 --> 00:57:47.736
is like, OK, what are we really talking about

1151
00:57:47.736 --> 00:57:49.906
when we talk about sex differences? I would push

1152
00:57:49.906 --> 00:57:51.706
against the use of that term, and I would

1153
00:57:51.706 --> 00:57:55.746
say patterns of variation between categories and within categories.

1154
00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:58.065
In some cases, they meet the level of what

1155
00:57:58.065 --> 00:58:00.436
I would call difference. In other categories, they don't,

1156
00:58:00.506 --> 00:58:01.855
right? And, and, and, you know, in the book,

1157
00:58:01.865 --> 00:58:04.545
I go over things like hair, right? And adipose

1158
00:58:04.545 --> 00:58:08.196
deposition and organs, and, you know, ski. There's all

1159
00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:09.906
of these different things that we're like, sure, this

1160
00:58:09.906 --> 00:58:11.476
is the way males and females are, but when

1161
00:58:11.476 --> 00:58:12.946
you actually look at the data, it's much more

1162
00:58:12.946 --> 00:58:15.521
complicated. Um, This is not to say there aren't

1163
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:18.771
pattern differences in things like, you know, certain aspects

1164
00:58:18.771 --> 00:58:23.031
of reproductive physiology, certain frequencies and patterns of endocrine

1165
00:58:23.031 --> 00:58:26.761
response and dynamics, certain patterns of musculature and, uh,

1166
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:29.951
sort of muscle mass and activity. Those are really

1167
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:32.271
important patterns of variation that we need to talk

1168
00:58:32.271 --> 00:58:35.562
about, but they're not binary. There's almost nothing in,

1169
00:58:35.672 --> 00:58:37.741
in our bodies that is binary. A little bit,

1170
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:41.471
but we are dimorphic, right? Uh, BUT, but binary,

1171
00:58:41.672 --> 00:58:42.191
almost nothing.

1172
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:48.469
How about behavior? Uh, ARE there any average sex

1173
00:58:48.469 --> 00:58:52.629
differences that you, you, that you would consider here?

1174
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.560
So, I have that whole chapter in there, there's

1175
00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.629
no battle of the sexes, cause I, one of

1176
00:58:57.629 --> 00:59:00.110
the arguments that stems from anisogamy and this whole

1177
00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:03.229
idea of of of certain universal patterns of sexual

1178
00:59:03.229 --> 00:59:05.219
selection is, is that males and females should want

1179
00:59:05.219 --> 00:59:07.260
different things, they should be different in the world.

1180
00:59:07.469 --> 00:59:10.739
And so we can look at Physiological, biological, and

1181
00:59:10.739 --> 00:59:14.580
sort of, um, behavioral literatures, overviews, meta-analysis, different kinds

1182
00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:17.580
of context. How different are are these categories of

1183
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.979
men and women usually, because it's usually not they're

1184
00:59:19.979 --> 00:59:22.260
not testing whether they're 3G male or female, so

1185
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.870
we're we're using self-identification usually. Um, AND, and what

1186
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:28.310
we see is there's some interesting differences, but these

1187
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:32.540
differences are not clearly related to particular biological patterns.

1188
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:35.449
So here we get gender and history and context.

1189
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.669
So, um, I, I, I'm, it's very hard to

1190
00:59:38.669 --> 00:59:43.030
say for humans that there are clear biological sex,

1191
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.715
causal variants related to particular. And behavior. Clearly there's

1192
00:59:47.715 --> 00:59:49.074
some, and I talk about a few in the

1193
00:59:49.074 --> 00:59:50.794
book, but, but I, I think we need to

1194
00:59:50.794 --> 00:59:54.314
be very, very cautious and think very carefully about

1195
00:59:54.314 --> 00:59:56.715
what data we have access to, right? So, for

1196
00:59:56.715 --> 01:00:00.985
example, uh, the socio sexual, uh, inventory, right? So,

1197
01:00:01.195 --> 01:00:03.995
so men, uh, rank higher on sort of interest

1198
01:00:03.995 --> 01:00:06.514
in sexuality than women cross culturally in all these

1199
01:00:06.514 --> 01:00:09.179
different kinds of contexts. What does that actually mean?

1200
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.399
What might that mean and how are those data

1201
01:00:12.399 --> 01:00:16.399
collected, and what impact does gender, society, history, you

1202
01:00:16.399 --> 01:00:19.280
have on the way people report, self-report information? And

1203
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.479
so I talked a little bit about the sort

1204
01:00:20.479 --> 01:00:23.320
of relation between anatomy, right, and say the, you

1205
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.840
know, frequency of masturbation, anatomy, culture. History, and the

1206
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.070
interview and survey practices might influence those data. So,

1207
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.719
I, I think there's much more work to be

1208
01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:35.120
done there. I'm not saying that there's not going

1209
01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.719
to be some particular behavioral patterns that are strongly

1210
01:00:37.719 --> 01:00:40.199
and even causally related to sex biology. I just

1211
01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:42.479
think most people go there right away without actually

1212
01:00:42.479 --> 01:00:44.520
sufficient data to support those assertions.

1213
01:00:45.689 --> 01:00:49.669
So earlier I, I've asked you about definitions that

1214
01:00:49.669 --> 01:00:53.659
are based on the size of gametes. In the

1215
01:00:53.659 --> 01:00:56.949
particular case of humans, many times people refer to

1216
01:00:56.949 --> 01:01:00.580
sex chromosomes and say that if you are X

1217
01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.659
sex, you're a female and you are a woman,

1218
01:01:03.739 --> 01:01:06.620
and if you are XY, you're a male and

1219
01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.179
you are a man. I mean, what is really

1220
01:01:09.429 --> 01:01:13.620
the relationship between sex chromosomes and the sort of

1221
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:18.909
primary and secondary sex characteristics that humans tend to

1222
01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:19.350
develop?

1223
01:01:19.949 --> 01:01:22.229
That that's great. That's like 7 questions in a

1224
01:01:22.229 --> 01:01:25.110
very well phrased one. So, um, but no, no,

1225
01:01:25.229 --> 01:01:26.669
so I think let's take the first one, right?

1226
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.820
Do, do sort of whether you are XX or

1227
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.060
XY. And again, here, let's, let's even just ignore

1228
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.110
all the other variants there because there are other

1229
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:36.750
biological variants within the distribution. Let's just say XX

1230
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:40.649
and XY. Um, DOES that have a 100% correlation

1231
01:01:40.649 --> 01:01:45.639
with particular specific sort of secondary sexual characteristics, uh,

1232
01:01:45.649 --> 01:01:50.360
aspects of body hair, presentation, uh, body morphology, um,

1233
01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:54.290
sexual activity, sexual attractiveness, uh, genital morphology, things like

1234
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.290
that. In a loose sense, yes. In a tight

1235
01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:01.540
sense, no. That is, we get these general patterns,

1236
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.540
but when you go down and break down large

1237
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.739
data sets to look at let's let's take someone

1238
01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:08.909
who is XY. OK, let's actually say, you're XY,

1239
01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.899
let's look at your genitals, right? Um, AND, and

1240
01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:15.719
what is, what we see is enormous variation, not

1241
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
In the general sense, do you have a penis

1242
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.379
and scrotum? But what, what constitutes that penis and

1243
01:02:21.379 --> 01:02:23.100
scrotum and what's the dynamics going on there, and

1244
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.379
what's going on? Another thing is, is testosterone, which

1245
01:02:25.379 --> 01:02:29.030
is obviously associated, you know, androgen levels differ in

1246
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.219
X Y and XX on average. There's actually a

1247
01:02:31.219 --> 01:02:34.340
lot of variation there. But let's say XY. Within

1248
01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.500
the XY category, right, testosterone levels vary by as

1249
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.229
much as 300% between individuals. Right? So, so the

1250
01:02:41.229 --> 01:02:43.510
problem is that there's a general pattern, but then

1251
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.189
when we ask the biologically or even medically relevant

1252
01:02:46.189 --> 01:02:48.550
questions, it becomes much, much less clear. And there's

1253
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.669
much more variation than we think. So, do you

1254
01:02:50.669 --> 01:02:52.989
see how I'm saying this, these two levels? And,

1255
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:55.219
and, and then the second part of the question,

1256
01:02:55.429 --> 01:02:57.389
you know, is male the same as man and

1257
01:02:57.389 --> 01:03:00.294
this woman? And the same as female. Um, I'm

1258
01:03:00.294 --> 01:03:03.094
gonna say no. And we just had a decision

1259
01:03:03.094 --> 01:03:07.665
in the United Kingdom, uh, yesterday that basically defines

1260
01:03:07.975 --> 01:03:12.294
women via a particular biological set of characteristics. I

1261
01:03:12.294 --> 01:03:13.975
haven't read the full decision, but I think they

1262
01:03:13.975 --> 01:03:17.695
go to chromosomal, um, uh, complement. Um, AND I

1263
01:03:17.695 --> 01:03:20.415
would argue that's very problematic. You may define female

1264
01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:22.774
that way, which I still think is problematic, but

1265
01:03:22.774 --> 01:03:26.120
woman is a gender category. Man is a gender

1266
01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.280
category. There are correlations between women and female, and

1267
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.439
man and male, but they are not identical for

1268
01:03:31.439 --> 01:03:33.090
all the reasons that we've already been talking about.

1269
01:03:33.239 --> 01:03:34.689
And I think one wants to be very, very

1270
01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:38.840
careful, particularly when we get to cultural, political, economic

1271
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.979
dynamics, or otherwise known as the legal system. When

1272
01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:44.790
you make laws, right, like here in the United

1273
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.719
States, where they, the, it's not a law, but

1274
01:03:46.719 --> 01:03:49.320
the, uh, the White House, the, the current administration

1275
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.750
said. You know, that uh men and women, male

1276
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.669
and female, are the same thing, and that they're

1277
01:03:54.669 --> 01:03:58.469
defined by gametes produced at conception. Like there's so

1278
01:03:58.469 --> 01:04:01.070
many things wrong with that, but I mean, you,

1279
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.050
you can't produce any gametes at conception, right? You,

1280
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.550
you just are the fusion of two gametes. Nothing

1281
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.415
is going on yet. Um, BUT, but the The

1282
01:04:08.415 --> 01:04:12.135
bottom line is that in a society, gender dynamics

1283
01:04:12.135 --> 01:04:16.975
are quite complex, rarely binary, in truth, um, and

1284
01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:21.905
should not be artificially linked to one complex biological

1285
01:04:21.905 --> 01:04:26.564
characteristic that does not necessarily predict, uh, gendered outcomes.

1286
01:04:26.935 --> 01:04:28.695
Does that, is that close enough?

1287
01:04:29.479 --> 01:04:31.800
Yes, and I mean, I was also going to

1288
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.879
ask you because there are many people that use

1289
01:04:34.879 --> 01:04:40.320
definitions of men and women, such as men being

1290
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.439
an adult human, male and uh woman and adult

1291
01:04:44.439 --> 01:04:47.719
human female. I mean, do you think that those

1292
01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:51.840
kinds of definitions are useful in any way from

1293
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.370
a scientific perspective, of course.

1294
01:04:54.889 --> 01:04:57.610
So those are social definitions and political definitions. I

1295
01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:01.530
would argue from scientific perspective, if a man is

1296
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:04.330
an adult male human, why don't you say adult

1297
01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.929
male human? That, so there, there's a slippage there,

1298
01:05:07.209 --> 01:05:09.610
right? Why, why are you using man, which is

1299
01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:12.409
a clear gendered thing which has complex histories of

1300
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:17.610
definition and experience, experience is associated with theoretical and

1301
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.989
conceptual social realities of masculine. SALINITY and particular histories

1302
01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:23.590
of behavior. Like, if you're really talking about biology,

1303
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.340
say adult male human, say juvenile male human. OK.

1304
01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.949
Those are, like, to, to, to sort of flip

1305
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:31.629
that like boy, right? Boy and girl, right? Which

1306
01:05:31.629 --> 01:05:35.310
are very important gendered categories. Um, THEY are not

1307
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.070
biological definitions. Um, AND so I would argue when

1308
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:41.419
someone says, no, a man is an adult male

1309
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:45.489
human, um, all they're doing. Is taking a very

1310
01:05:45.489 --> 01:05:49.810
complex social, cultural, historical, political term, man, that's experienced

1311
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:54.169
differently in many ways by different individuals, and artificially

1312
01:05:54.169 --> 01:05:57.409
forcing it upon a biological frame, right? So, I,

1313
01:05:57.489 --> 01:05:59.169
I think, uh, that's what, that would be my

1314
01:05:59.169 --> 01:06:00.500
argument against that. I know a lot of people

1315
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.209
disagree with me, but really, if you're a biologist

1316
01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.250
and you're interested in biology, why would you use

1317
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.770
a complex, messy gendered term when you can just

1318
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:08.570
say adult male human?

1319
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:13.800
Mhm. So what does it mean to say that

1320
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.010
sex is a spectrum, and I mean, we can

1321
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:21.399
talk about sex being a spectrum across species, but

1322
01:06:21.399 --> 01:06:25.830
also sex being a spectrum within particular species, but

1323
01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.729
I mean, what does it mean to say that

1324
01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:30.389
it is a spectrum? I mean, couldn't it be

1325
01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:35.989
in terms of distribution simply a by modal distribution

1326
01:06:35.989 --> 01:06:40.030
or uh would you classify a bimodal distribution also

1327
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.389
as a spectrum?

1328
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.330
So, uh, that, that's really the, the bottom line

1329
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:47.899
question of my whole book. Why, why title it

1330
01:06:47.899 --> 01:06:50.169
affects the spectrum, the biological limits of the binary.

1331
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:52.110
So let me start with the second part. Um,

1332
01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:54.439
AS you see with, with our whole discussion here,

1333
01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:57.689
I've argued, and, and I think this is fairly

1334
01:06:57.689 --> 01:07:01.600
well supported, that using binary as a sort of

1335
01:07:01.649 --> 01:07:06.149
complete categorization of sex across the animal kingdom. AND

1336
01:07:06.149 --> 01:07:09.050
in humans is insufficient because it limits our ability

1337
01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:11.110
to understand biological variation. All right, let's put that

1338
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.870
aside. So, OK, what do we use then? When

1339
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.989
I say sex is a spectrum, most people think

1340
01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:17.030
it's like, oh, anything goes. I'm like, no, no,

1341
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.590
no, no. A spectrum, let's take a light spectrum

1342
01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:23.189
or a sound spectrum. It is a measurable, distinct

1343
01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:27.669
distribution of variation, right? With different clusters of frequencies

1344
01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.949
or patterns. There are typical clusters and patterns that

1345
01:07:30.949 --> 01:07:32.709
we can identify. We can circle, and we can

1346
01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:34.270
look at them, and we can identify them as

1347
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:37.870
distinct from, right? In some ways, other clusters of

1348
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:42.219
patterns, but not consisting of different kinds, right? So,

1349
01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:45.310
blue and red are not actually different kinds. They're

1350
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.790
different wavelengths of light. So they're the same, the

1351
01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:49.600
photons, the sort of patterns and what have you.

1352
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.219
And so, what I really want to get at,

1353
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:53.149
well, I think sex is a spectrum is really

1354
01:07:53.149 --> 01:07:56.030
good, is that look at my body. Uh, I,

1355
01:07:56.149 --> 01:07:59.310
I'm, I'm a 3G male, right? Uh. Uh, EVEN

1356
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:01.550
though here's a great example, so 3G males tend

1357
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.870
to have very like 90 degree jaw angles. I

1358
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.669
have a much larger than 90 degree jaw angle

1359
01:08:05.669 --> 01:08:07.389
just to show that, look, there's a lot of

1360
01:08:07.389 --> 01:08:10.229
variation. Anyway, um, I'm a 3G male. Compare me

1361
01:08:10.229 --> 01:08:12.550
with a 3G female. And there's a lot of

1362
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:15.100
patterns of variation that differ. Clusters of variation that

1363
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.740
differ, including some very important ones, right? Related to

1364
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.660
reprogressive physiology and other things. Um, HOWEVER, none of

1365
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.220
our sort of tissue masses, none of the basic

1366
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:26.540
structures within our cells, none of the bones, none

1367
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.500
of the muscles, none of those things are different

1368
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.707
in kind. And so, if we see human variation

1369
01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:35.828
as the spectrum of difference of variation of patterns

1370
01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:38.828
that clusters in typical ways, we then can understand

1371
01:08:38.828 --> 01:08:41.249
those clusters, but we also understand that there's other

1372
01:08:41.249 --> 01:08:44.120
variation. Right? That doesn't fit into those clusters. It's

1373
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.850
just as human. And also, we understand that those

1374
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:50.160
clusters of variations aren't different kinds of things, but

1375
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.200
rather different patterns. And those different patterns emerge from

1376
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.160
things like different kinds of pressures on reproductive dynamics

1377
01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.240
or different kinds of evolutionary structures and things like

1378
01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.600
that. It's just that it's not in a binary

1379
01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.439
format. And I think the binary inhibits us from

1380
01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.279
asking good questions about evolution, about behavior, and about

1381
01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:06.640
medicine.

1382
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.240
Mhm. So, OK, so you've already at least partially

1383
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.950
answered my next question, but why do you think

1384
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:19.410
that a binary approach to sex is problematic and

1385
01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:21.890
I, I mean, in this particular case, I'm also

1386
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:27.149
referring to aspects of perhaps human life and society

1387
01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.919
that uh uh in which it manifests that you

1388
01:09:30.919 --> 01:09:32.520
think are perhaps problematic.

1389
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.640
Yeah, so I, I give a bunch of examples

1390
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.569
in the book because I think this is, this,

1391
01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.640
if, if our scientific knowledge, if our study of

1392
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.520
human biology doesn't have some translation into the world

1393
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.160
into the society we live in, then I, I

1394
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.720
think we're not doing it right, right? So we,

1395
01:09:45.799 --> 01:09:47.399
we should be able to convince people that what

1396
01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:49.319
we're doing is, is relevant in some ways. So

1397
01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.229
let me just give you a couple quick examples.

1398
01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.399
I mean, one is the construction of family. Here

1399
01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:57.359
in the United States, there are hundreds of laws.

1400
01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:02.370
That are aimed at limiting family formation in legal

1401
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:06.379
sense, right? Family formation to uh uh a 3G

1402
01:10:06.379 --> 01:10:09.689
male, a 3G female, who are both um uh

1403
01:10:09.689 --> 01:10:13.379
heterosexual and they're reproductive or adopted, you know, the,

1404
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:16.890
the sort of young, um, and that's fine as

1405
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:19.890
a unit, right? But as a legal structure, first

1406
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.192
of all, it ignores. HUMAN biology, which is much

1407
01:10:22.192 --> 01:10:25.192
more complicated, and we know that families consist of

1408
01:10:25.192 --> 01:10:28.473
multiple, multiple individuals related and unrelated, and that part

1409
01:10:28.473 --> 01:10:31.112
of the whole human adaptive zone, right, is this

1410
01:10:31.112 --> 01:10:34.993
sort of large cooperative group engagement. And so, because

1411
01:10:35.353 --> 01:10:38.553
people making these laws assume that males and females

1412
01:10:38.553 --> 01:10:40.873
are two different kinds, and that getting them together

1413
01:10:40.873 --> 01:10:42.833
is the way you start a family. That's the

1414
01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:46.136
only bi. Logical reality. Um, THEY actually think it's

1415
01:10:46.136 --> 01:10:48.565
also a religious or, uh, a kind of spiritual

1416
01:10:48.565 --> 01:10:54.416
reality. Um, THAT restriction then constrains actual human success

1417
01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:57.326
because we know that humans need multiple individuals, multiple

1418
01:10:57.326 --> 01:11:00.366
connections of kin and friends and community to survive.

1419
01:11:00.576 --> 01:11:02.456
Um, AND so here's where the sort of idea

1420
01:11:02.456 --> 01:11:04.496
of a binary translates itself into, I think, a

1421
01:11:04.496 --> 01:11:08.790
harmful legal structure. Another example is, is in medicine,

1422
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:12.620
right? There's so much harm done to women in

1423
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:15.629
in contemporary medical practice right now, because for so

1424
01:11:15.629 --> 01:11:18.589
many decades, centuries, women have been seen as sort

1425
01:11:18.589 --> 01:11:21.270
of either too erratic or complicated to study, or

1426
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.109
just sort of one step down from men, right?

1427
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:26.229
Remember, up until around the 1800s, women were seen

1428
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:27.910
as there wasn't a two sex model. There was

1429
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:29.959
a one sex model where there's men. And then

1430
01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.839
those women are sort of this degraded version of

1431
01:11:31.839 --> 01:11:34.919
men. Um, SO, in the medical context, we need

1432
01:11:34.919 --> 01:11:38.279
to really understand the category, right? That cluster of

1433
01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:41.790
variation that we call female and women, right? So,

1434
01:11:41.799 --> 01:11:44.509
in, in the, in the gender sex context, um,

1435
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.040
much, much better. But if we keep this as

1436
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.089
a binary, Approach within like men and women are

1437
01:11:50.089 --> 01:11:53.850
two different kinds. And that unfortunately cuts us off

1438
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:58.689
from understanding the overlapping biological variation between these clusters

1439
01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.319
to understand what patterns do we ask questions about,

1440
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.569
about variation, about biology, what patterns do we ask

1441
01:12:04.569 --> 01:12:06.919
about sort of society and history and culture. So,

1442
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:09.370
for example, I, I, I mentioned earlier, many more

1443
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:11.729
women die after in the year after a heart

1444
01:12:11.729 --> 01:12:14.299
attack than do men. It's not based on their,

1445
01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:17.109
the biological structure of their heart because there there

1446
01:12:17.109 --> 01:12:19.540
isn't a sex difference in in hearts aside from

1447
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.970
on average a little bit of size. What's going

1448
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.750
on? How do we study that? To study that,

1449
01:12:23.759 --> 01:12:25.799
you can't say that, oh well, that's a woman's

1450
01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:27.640
heart thing. So we're gonna look at women's hearts.

1451
01:12:27.799 --> 01:12:29.319
No, you need to understand what are the social,

1452
01:12:29.399 --> 01:12:32.399
cultural, and biological dynamics that are leading into that.

1453
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.319
And so I think a binary approach, which divides

1454
01:12:35.319 --> 01:12:38.640
men and women as kinds, misses probably a lot

1455
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.339
of the underlying biological variation that might help us,

1456
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.029
you know, save lives.

1457
01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:48.299
Mhm. So, let me just run through you some

1458
01:12:48.299 --> 01:12:51.950
other criticisms that I found among people who come

1459
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:55.859
from the other side and say that sex, at

1460
01:12:55.859 --> 01:12:59.609
least in humans, is binary. Uh, THE first one

1461
01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:03.770
I, I've already sort of, uh, Alluded to it

1462
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:07.770
earlier, but, uh, they say that there's only 2

1463
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:10.890
types of games and only two different ways of

1464
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:15.009
reproducing and not a third kind of gamut or

1465
01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:18.720
a third way of reproducing or even more than

1466
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.250
that. Uh, WHAT do you respond to that?

1467
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.290
Well, there isn't only two types of reproducing, right?

1468
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.089
There's actually reproductive range. It's complicated, but let's, let's

1469
01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:29.959
let that aside because reproductive dynamics are, are complicated.

1470
01:13:30.089 --> 01:13:31.810
Um, YES, there are only two gametes and in

1471
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:35.009
all anisogamic systems there are 2 gametes, but does

1472
01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:39.049
an egg equal a female or a woman? Does

1473
01:13:39.049 --> 01:13:41.669
understanding that this is a large gamete tell you?

1474
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:47.180
Specific important things universally about all human females or

1475
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.149
all human women. No, no, it doesn't actually. And

1476
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:52.029
so, you can say that there's, you know, uh

1477
01:13:52.029 --> 01:13:53.709
a sperm and an egg, and that's the definition

1478
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:55.830
of male and female. But how does that translate,

1479
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.310
for example, to laws? How does that translate to

1480
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.020
understanding health? How does that translate to understanding, uh,

1481
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:05.109
other dynamics? Because an in the variation within individuals

1482
01:14:05.109 --> 01:14:08.490
that produce Eggs or sperm is enormous. Uh, AND

1483
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.009
if you uniform, you say, this is just this

1484
01:14:11.009 --> 01:14:14.290
one category, you're gonna undermine the potential of understanding

1485
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:17.540
of what pattern, what patterns of variation are are

1486
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.330
across these, what patterns of variation related to health,

1487
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:23.770
for example, are not related to, uh, gametete production,

1488
01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:26.890
because a ton of our body is not directed

1489
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:30.669
by the particulars that we Productive physiology. So for

1490
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:33.549
example, you can have, uh, be a large gay

1491
01:14:33.549 --> 01:14:36.310
producer, but you can also have many, many characteristics

1492
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:39.870
in the body that are more in line with

1493
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:43.140
small gay producers, right? And that's not totally atypical.

1494
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.790
So then what do you do with that? So

1495
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:46.669
that, that, that'd be my argument. Like, sure, fine,

1496
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.830
you wanna call large gamut producer, female, small gam

1497
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:52.589
producer, male, that's great. What does that actually tell

1498
01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:52.979
you?

1499
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.149
Right. Uh, SO another argument is that, uh, only

1500
01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:03.589
females have babies, uh, and not males. What do

1501
01:15:03.589 --> 01:15:04.859
you make of that?

1502
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.950
That is true. I mean, what, what kind of

1503
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:10.100
argument is that? Do all females have babies? No.

1504
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:14.854
Um. Do only female mammals, right? Only mammals with

1505
01:15:14.854 --> 01:15:18.174
a uterus, a functioning uterus, and particular other aspects

1506
01:15:18.174 --> 01:15:21.615
of reproductive biology can gestate effectively, and if they

1507
01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:24.455
have uh mammary tissue and the the right glandular

1508
01:15:24.455 --> 01:15:30.430
development, they can lactate. True. I mean, I, that's

1509
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:32.830
true, right? What, what, what, what, what is that?

1510
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:35.470
So that, that means that's a category that we

1511
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.950
have to treat completely differently. So what about female

1512
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.229
hearts? Right, that we know that hearts aren't female.

1513
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:44.390
So just because there's some patterns of clusters of

1514
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:47.990
variation that are quite distinctive in these clusters, all

1515
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:50.669
the other patterns aren't. And so just to say

1516
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:52.620
that, to say that only women can have infants,

1517
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.229
that's absolutely true. So what does that mean and

1518
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:56.620
how does that relate? What does that tell us

1519
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.490
about care? What does it tell us about physiology?

1520
01:15:58.729 --> 01:16:01.060
And a very important outcome of that that people

1521
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.859
ignore is that there's substantial differences in vascular systems,

1522
01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:10.120
some neurobiology, and some endocrine patterns between those individuals

1523
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.830
with uteri who have Reproduced and those who haven't.

1524
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:17.149
And that's actually really interesting and understudied area because

1525
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:19.580
there's like, well, women have infants, boom, we're done.

1526
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:23.750
To define a woman or a female solely based

1527
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:27.629
on their ability, potential ability to reproduce is highly

1528
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:30.229
problematic, right? And undermines a lot of the patterns

1529
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:32.790
of variation and understanding of the organism.

1530
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.520
And so finally, what would be a definition of

1531
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.620
non-binary sex?

1532
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:44.930
So, sex, as I've said, we can define it

1533
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.629
in a whole bunch of different ways, right? The

1534
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:48.790
way I'm using with humans, I'm really interested in

1535
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:53.350
using 3G sex categories. That is, uh, typical clusters

1536
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:56.589
of variation around genetics, gonads, and genitals, because these

1537
01:16:56.589 --> 01:17:00.229
are measurable, these are biological characteristics. They're patterns that

1538
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:03.589
relate to physiological and even behavioral function. And so

1539
01:17:03.589 --> 01:17:05.750
we can identify those and look at them. However,

1540
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:08.790
none of those genes is non-variable, and none of

1541
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.939
those genes are binary. Um, THEY are actually patterns

1542
01:17:11.939 --> 01:17:15.209
of variation that cluster in particular ways with overlap

1543
01:17:15.209 --> 01:17:17.140
in some cases and not overlap in others. And

1544
01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.779
so that's not a binary sex definition. It has

1545
01:17:20.779 --> 01:17:23.290
two categories, but two categories does not equal binary,

1546
01:17:23.419 --> 01:17:25.470
right? Uh, AND I think that's what people understand.

1547
01:17:25.915 --> 01:17:29.064
It means 10. That means two different kinds of

1548
01:17:29.064 --> 01:17:31.464
thing within a category. And males and females for

1549
01:17:31.464 --> 01:17:33.745
me are not different kinds of things. The variations

1550
01:17:33.745 --> 01:17:35.944
on a theme. We're all human. To say that

1551
01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:38.984
we're two different kinds of human is really, I

1552
01:17:38.984 --> 01:17:41.384
think, a philosophical assertion, not a biological one.

1553
01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:46.830
OK. Great. So, the book is again, sex is

1554
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.149
a Spectrum, the biological limits of the binary. Of

1555
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:51.910
course, I'm leaving a link to it in the

1556
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:54.700
description of the interview and also a link, uh,

1557
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:58.100
and also links to our first two interviews. So,

1558
01:17:58.270 --> 01:18:01.149
Doctor Fuentes, just before we go, would you like

1559
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:04.649
to just tell people apart from your book, where

1560
01:18:04.649 --> 01:18:06.950
they can find you and your work on the

1561
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:07.229
internet?

1562
01:18:07.569 --> 01:18:09.319
Yeah, I mean, I just, uh, let me just

1563
01:18:09.319 --> 01:18:11.080
say about the book. I mean, my goal here

1564
01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.120
is a better conversation. We need to talk about

1565
01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.200
this more, and we need to talk about this

1566
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.160
with more information. I think this sex, gender, this

1567
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.189
stuff is really important. It matters for people's lives,

1568
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.640
and, and, and I want to see better conversations,

1569
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.759
not a bunch of yelling and screaming. So being

1570
01:18:25.759 --> 01:18:29.439
something rooted in actual biological and evolutionary framing, thinking

1571
01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:31.879
about humans as biocultural organisms, I think it's beneficial.

1572
01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:33.529
I think it'll Lead to a better conversation. Or

1573
01:18:33.529 --> 01:18:36.470
at least I optimistically hope it will. You can,

1574
01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.470
uh, follow me, uh, at BlueSky Anto Fuentes at

1575
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.930
Bluesky, also on, I'm still on X. I don't

1576
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.109
know why, but I'm still there. So Anto Fuentes.

1577
01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:47.529
Um, I, I'm on Instagram, but very rarely. Um,

1578
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.959
uh, I will update my website afuentes.com soon and

1579
01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:52.959
so I'll have some, uh, videos and other kinds

1580
01:18:52.959 --> 01:18:55.279
of things there. And as always, uh, you, you

1581
01:18:55.279 --> 01:18:57.049
know, you can email me if you have questions.

1582
01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:00.689
Great. I'm also leaving links to all of that

1583
01:19:00.689 --> 01:19:03.810
in the description then and as always, it's been

1584
01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.729
a big pleasure to talk to you. Thank you

1585
01:19:05.729 --> 01:19:10.640
very much for the fun and uh entertaining conversation.

1586
01:19:10.819 --> 01:19:12.770
So Ricardo, thank you so much for all that
