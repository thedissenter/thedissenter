00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello everyone, welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:09.210
Dissenter, and today I'm here with the legendary Nina

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.689
Hartley. Uh, SHE'S, I, I mean, if you don't

4
00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.850
know it, come on. When, when have you been

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.909
born? In like 10 years ago, 5 years ago.

6
00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:22.190
If you don't, if you don't watch adult movies,

7
00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.649
you might not have any idea who I am.

8
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.399
Uh,

9
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.899
YEAH, but you're, if you're a child of the

10
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.540
80s, the 90s, even the 2000s, come on. Uh

11
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.819
SO, uh, but, but anyway, for people who have

12
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:40.930
lived under a rock and don't know Nina, she's

13
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.319
basically a legendary pornographic film actress and sex educator.

14
00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.069
And she's also a feminist and advocate for sexual

15
00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.750
freedom. We're going to talk about all of that

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.209
today, so, Nina, welcome to the show. It's an

17
00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:56.869
absolute honor to everyone.

18
00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.950
Thank you so much. I love any opportunity to

19
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.430
talk about the bigger picture besides actual sexual activity

20
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.419
because as you know, uh, sex. TAKES place in

21
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.419
a cultural context. It takes place in a situation,

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.239
and the sex that we get to have, we

23
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.319
want to have, we think we should be having,

24
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.879
is very heavily influenced by media, by culture, by

25
00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:25.550
our gender, our family, religion. And all the things.

26
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.980
So it, uh, I'm a nurse as well. Uh,

27
00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:32.430
SO, for me, sexual health is part of health,

28
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.910
right? And so, it's very important to talk about

29
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.970
this in a bigger context. So, thank you.

30
00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:40.900
Of course we're going to talk about all of

31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.980
that, but let me start. I mean, because come

32
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.610
on, I'm a big, big fan, so I also

33
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.779
have to take this opportunity to ask you a

34
00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:52.120
little bit at least about the foreign industry

35
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.980
because no, no question off limits, all, all on

36
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.440
the table.

37
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.160
OK, so tell us first. A little bit about

38
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.279
your story. I mean, how did you get into

39
00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.919
pornography in the 80s? And I know that you

40
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.440
started, and please correct me if I'm wrong here,

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.720
but I think you started as a dancer stripper

42
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.960
in 1982 and then you got into the industry

43
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.039
in 191984. Is that correct?

44
00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.380
So my, my journey to porn was actually a

45
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.339
very long one. I knew very early on when

46
00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.839
I was a middle teenager, I was in the

47
00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.220
1970s, right? So I grew up in Berkeley, California.

48
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.779
My family was very politically active, progressive. Uh MY

49
00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.899
father had been blacklisted as a communist. So I

50
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:44.830
grew up with very, um, uh, Forward-thinking ideas about

51
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.919
uh class, certainly, and education, but they were of

52
00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.320
their generation and sex was never talked about, you

53
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.589
know, good or bad, it's not. Nothing. Um, BUT

54
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:59.460
I discovered words when I was 1314, bisexual, um,

55
00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.529
exhibitionist, voyeur, and I recognized that, 00, that, that

56
00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.350
pertained to my desires. So I knew early on,

57
00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.710
I wasn't like other people. I never dreamt of

58
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.669
him. I never dreamt of my wedding day. I

59
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.149
would dream of, and before I, I'd ever seen

60
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.350
a naked person besides myself, I would dream of

61
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.380
rooms full of naked people. So for me, I,

62
00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.419
uh, I knew I wasn't like other people. I,

63
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.190
I never wanted to be married. I never wanted

64
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.949
to be a mother, although I like children very

65
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.229
much. I just knew I didn't have it in

66
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.050
me to be a good mother. And uh that

67
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.839
I found written pornography, uh, and when I was,

68
00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.710
oh my gosh, 1415. Loved it right away. I

69
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.110
saw Playboy magazine. I loved the Pretty ladies. And

70
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.669
in the 70s, of course, the whole conversation around

71
00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.110
sex was exploding, right? We had in this country,

72
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.669
we had finally legalized abortion. Women could get credit

73
00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.949
in their own names, you can get birth control

74
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.190
without being married, you can get birth control without

75
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.919
your husband's permission. Right, this is only 50 years

76
00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.949
ago. It's not that long ago how backwards things

77
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:09.350
were. Yeah,

78
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.830
but back then it was like mind blowing,

79
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.830
mind blowing, and, and people rushed to the doors

80
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.928
and they rushed to the exits, right? And so,

81
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.309
uh, I loved reading pornography and I read the,

82
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.190
you know, all the things from the 8th, 19th

83
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.070
century, you know, autobiography of a flea, um, yeah,

84
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.750
just classic stuff you can find it anywhere. And,

85
00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.750
uh, I snuck into my first adult movie when

86
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.309
I was 17. And I, it was a virgin.

87
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.309
I had barely kissed a boy. And the first

88
00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.420
time I saw people having sex on screen, it's

89
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.160
like, That's what I wanted to do. I just,

90
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.970
just fully formed him. I, I knew, I knew,

91
00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.720
I knew. That that was what I

92
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.920
wanted to. OK, but wait a 2nd, 17, so

93
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.980
that would fall into the barely legal.

94
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.279
I was not, he did not card me. I

95
00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.200
was not supposed to be in the theater. He

96
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.320
was not supposed to let me in, but he

97
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.239
did not care. He did not care. Barely Legal

98
00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:09.239
is 18 years old and one day. So in

99
00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.850
the, in the term barely legal, it's very important.

100
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.160
The term barely legal, the important term is legal.

101
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.040
Which means 18 in America means 18 years old.

102
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.600
Barely means you, you know, you're, you're still 18.

103
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.500
So barely legal is the year of 18 to

104
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.420
19 years old. Um, SO, so at 17 you're

105
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.459
not barely legal. You're, you're almost legal, but again

106
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.869
this is 1976. They didn't

107
00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:36.309
care. No, no one cared back then.

108
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:39.179
No, certainly the guy, not the guy in the,

109
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.589
in the, in the ticket counter and not the

110
00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.010
six guys in the theater who fled in terror

111
00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:48.350
to the edges of the seating because a single

112
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.790
female had come in to their inner sanctum and

113
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.429
they just did not know what to do about

114
00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:55.630
that. So I had a very early interest in

115
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.570
sex. I had a very early interest in What

116
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.010
we now call polyamory or non-ethical, non-monogamy. I didn't

117
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.649
understand monogamy. I, I, I don't understand it. I

118
00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.859
know people are. I know it, so it's culturally

119
00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:10.369
very heavily favored. So

120
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.630
people, so it's not just that you are not.

121
00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:18.325
To, uh, monogamy, you don't even understand it, is

122
00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:18.684
that it?

123
00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.545
I, I don't understand it personally. I understand it.

124
00:06:21.785 --> 00:06:23.785
So in when I was younger, I knew everything,

125
00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:27.364
you know, I, I was convinced that monogamy, enforced

126
00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:31.010
monogamy was not natural. And now I'm older, more

127
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.450
experienced, and I know that most people don't want

128
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.160
to be monogamous. They want to appear monogamous, for,

129
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.209
so it's what people think. But I do know

130
00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:43.690
truly now that some people are monogamous when they

131
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.529
love somebody, they don't want anybody else. It's not

132
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.250
a struggle to be faithful. That's just who they

133
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.089
are. So I do know for a substantial percentage

134
00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.649
of the population, monogamy is their natural, their natural

135
00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:55.970
way to be, and I don't have a problem

136
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.760
with that. And then everybody else struggles with it

137
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.359
because when you decide or discover that you are

138
00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:07.959
not normal, meaning heterosexual and monogamous, then you have

139
00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:11.070
a lot of Trouble come your way. So I

140
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.619
just, I, I knew from the very beginning that

141
00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.369
I wasn't like other people. I could not have

142
00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.220
a life like other people. Um, AND I always

143
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.179
tell people, if, you know, if the, if the,

144
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.899
if the plug had not gone into sex, the

145
00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:27.100
plug could have gone into primatology. I was going

146
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.369
to be a midwife. I could be studying 40

147
00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:31.700
years, I'm working 40 years as a midwife. I

148
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.635
could have I've been a linguist. I was interested

149
00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:37.535
in ceramics, fabrics, glass blowing. So I'm, I'm interested

150
00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:41.295
in a lot of things, um, but sex was

151
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:42.855
the thing that tied it all together. It

152
00:07:42.855 --> 00:07:45.804
ties together. I'm, I'm in primatology. You could have

153
00:07:45.804 --> 00:07:47.815
been the next Jane Goodall,

154
00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:50.774
exactly, who was a personal hero of mine. I,

155
00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:53.214
I really appreciate her. So I was designed to

156
00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:55.894
study one thing my whole life. As it turns

157
00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:59.375
out, sex is the thing because, of course, sex

158
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:07.420
involves. The body, culture, relationships, expression, philosophy, um, uh,

159
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.260
so it encompasses everything. So it is, so every

160
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.980
sex is both universal. Everybody has some of it

161
00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:23.269
and completely personal. So, while there's a universal sex

162
00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:26.929
idea, everyone experiences it as a personal thing, and

163
00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:30.809
how they experience it depends on race, class, culture,

164
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.090
religion, all the things. So, um, everyone experiences it

165
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.369
differently. Some people, for many people, it's traumatic. It

166
00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:41.650
is painful. It is sad. It is, makes them

167
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.330
angry. Um, THE idea of sex, when I think

168
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.229
of sex, it's supposed to make you at least,

169
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.929
mm. And most people don't get that. When they

170
00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:55.940
think sex, they are very anxious, angry, sad, upset,

171
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.770
uh, frustrated, uh, victimized, and, and, and, and, and

172
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.489
I'm even talking about people, I'm not even talking

173
00:09:03.489 --> 00:09:08.450
about, uh, uh, non-consensual behavior. We're talking about just

174
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.789
most people have a very difficult relationship to sex,

175
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.039
and it does not bring them peace and joy.

176
00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:19.059
It brings them anxiety and confusion. So

177
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:22.080
let me just ask you about that. Where do

178
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.219
you think that stems from? I mean, you've been

179
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.599
er alive for more than 60 years now and

180
00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:31.940
you've been in the business since the early 80s.

181
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:37.039
Um, WHERE do you think that er attitude towards

182
00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:41.760
sex from, I mean, mostly conservative people stems from?

183
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.900
Oh, religion. So, every culture in every world, every

184
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.450
culture that we know of has rules around sexuality.

185
00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:52.260
Who gets to have it? When do they get

186
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.150
to have it? Why are they having it? And

187
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.229
so it's, so, when I say, you know, we

188
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.390
should be free sexually, it doesn't mean free for

189
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.140
all, it doesn't mean I get to Because it's,

190
00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:03.659
there's what I get to do sexually, then I

191
00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:06.150
get to, of course, have consent, right? I cannot,

192
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.280
I cannot take my clothes off in public because

193
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.099
other people have not consented to see me naked.

194
00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:12.039
So I don't get to be free that way.

195
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.859
I don't get to be free with your body

196
00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:16.340
if you don't say, yes, please be free with

197
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.659
my body. So, the, uh, in the way, I

198
00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:21.580
don't know enough about other cultures. I'm going to

199
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.760
talk about Western culture because that is my history,

200
00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:26.020
and I'm not a, I'm not an anthropologist. I'm

201
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:33.320
not a sociologist, but the, um, the Deep fear

202
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.700
and misogyny and fear of women and fear of

203
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.739
sexuality goes back thousands of years. The Greeks had

204
00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:41.739
it, the Romans had it. Um, AND what it

205
00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:46.520
comes from in the very short history is it

206
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.760
comes from the need of the state to control

207
00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:52.539
and the fear that men have of women. I

208
00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.219
think it goes back to fear of the fact

209
00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:58.890
that women are their children. Um, AND that women

210
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.440
have capacity that men don't have to, to create

211
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.169
life. And that, I think that terrifies men going

212
00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:09.000
back many, many centuries, millennia, and they have to,

213
00:11:09.099 --> 00:11:11.849
they have to, uh, have a tight, tight control

214
00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:15.190
of it. Many, many philosophers have talked about this,

215
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.229
um, in the 20th century, of course, um, Uh,

216
00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:22.119
Simone, uh, de Beauvoir was the biggest one, and

217
00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:25.340
Germaine Greer, but in modern era, right now, living

218
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.390
right now, there are two amazing, Writers and philosophers

219
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.929
who are talking about this. The most famous one

220
00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:34.460
is called Kate Mann, M A N N E,

221
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.630
and her book Down Girl, The Logic of Misogyny,

222
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.469
she just, she, she just ties it up in

223
00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:43.469
a bow. And also, uh Manon Garcia wrote two

224
00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.169
amazing books. One is called We Are Not Born

225
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:49.349
Submissive, and the other is The Joy of Consent.

226
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.190
So if anyone wants to know more, why the

227
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.190
question, why, why these three books, The Joy of

228
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.719
Consent. We Are Not Born Submissive by Manon Garcia

229
00:11:57.719 --> 00:12:00.719
and Down Girl by Kate Mann. I can't say

230
00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.739
it any better than these books have said it,

231
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.580
um,

232
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.460
and, and you know what, I've read those books.

233
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.880
I'm not surprised. So you, you understand, they're brilliant.

234
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.679
They're brilliant books, and the fact that Manon Garcia

235
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:18.239
is English is not her first language. Wow, she's.

236
00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:21.250
Wow, just crazy.

237
00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.109
And you know what, I also have another book

238
00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:28.989
here that you would probably love. Uh, SEX, yes,

239
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.950
pleasure and agency for everyone.

240
00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:33.270
Oh yes, uh, please send that to me. Send

241
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.739
me the title again, uh email later. So, yeah,

242
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.669
yeah, um, but there is, uh, there's lots of

243
00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:44.130
scholarship about, uh, the, the embedding into the law,

244
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.630
um, uh, and common law of a deep mistrust

245
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.900
of female agency, female independence, female sexuality. Um, AND

246
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.609
it, it, many, many books, books as tall tall

247
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.369
as me have been written about this very thing.

248
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.210
So it's an amazing scholarship. So since I'm not,

249
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.239
I'm not a scholarship.

250
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.260
Yeah, let me just ask you because we're also,

251
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.780
we're already getting into feminism and it just crossed

252
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.500
my mind that you were there during the sexual

253
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.820
revolution, right?

254
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.299
I wasn't having sex, uh, but, um, I was

255
00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:19.659
there, so I saw a lot of the, my,

256
00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:22.780
my mother and her sister were, um, also, you

257
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.460
know, I, I was raised in the, in the,

258
00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:29.065
in the environment. Right, of, of, uh, female empowerment.

259
00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:32.565
And, and so I understood that I, I did

260
00:13:33.005 --> 00:13:34.465
believe that I had a choice of what to

261
00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:35.984
do. I had a choice to either become a

262
00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:38.445
mother. No one pressured me to have kids. My

263
00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:42.244
parents didn't care. Um, SO, I was fortunate that

264
00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:45.344
I did not have a lot of the indoctrination

265
00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:48.424
that many women get, uh, about, you know, you

266
00:13:48.424 --> 00:13:50.895
must be a mother. Why aren't you married? Where's

267
00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:53.005
my grandchild? I never got any of that. So,

268
00:13:53.424 --> 00:13:56.419
um, I'm the only, my, my aunt was gay,

269
00:13:56.909 --> 00:13:58.469
and I have some gay cousins, but in my

270
00:13:58.469 --> 00:14:00.510
immediate family, I'm the only one who is queer.

271
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.869
Everyone else is very conventional married kids, you know.

272
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.070
Um, AND they don't understand what I do, um,

273
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.380
but I wanted to ask you, I wanted to

274
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.210
ask you specifically about the sexual revolution because nowadays

275
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.409
there are some people that have, uh, distorted what

276
00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:24.750
the sexual revolution actually was about, and they say

277
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.705
that, oh my God. The sexual revolution turned people

278
00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:35.265
into degenerates and the sexual revolution ruined marriage, and

279
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:40.065
the sexual revolution, the feminists are the cause behind

280
00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:43.664
falling, uh, fertility rates and all of that. I

281
00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:47.085
mean, is it really about those kinds of things?

282
00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:50.039
I do not believe that that is the case.

283
00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.640
So, again, the people who, the people who are

284
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.479
saying that feminism caused these things are also people

285
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.739
who are very much, men and women both, uh,

286
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.599
support the old ways tradition, where you could beat

287
00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:04.320
your wife, where you could rape your children, where

288
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.039
you, uh, you could beat your wife and rape

289
00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.880
your children and rape your wife. I mean, marital

290
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.979
rape wasn't outlawed in America till the early 90s.

291
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Mhm. So the

292
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.479
idea, yeah, yeah, that, that's, that's mind blowing

293
00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:19.599
that women that, and then now that's a big

294
00:15:19.599 --> 00:15:22.479
movement in America, you know, take to, uh, I

295
00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:25.559
think they're rage baiting, but who, who truly believe

296
00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:26.880
that women should not have the right to vote

297
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.479
with a terrible idea, um, they should all, all

298
00:15:29.479 --> 00:15:30.919
that. So I, I don't want to give them

299
00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:33.989
any more credence. They're very dangerous. They have a

300
00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:36.359
lot of influence and power right now, and it's,

301
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:40.390
and it's been. Uh It's been a long time

302
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.549
building. So when we got rid of Richard Nixon

303
00:15:43.549 --> 00:15:46.900
and we got out of Vietnam, our side, the

304
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.369
left, the, the left decided to party and the

305
00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:53.729
right said, oh yeah. OK. And 50 years later,

306
00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:55.250
here we are. So they, they took the long

307
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.169
view. So that's, there's a lot to be, I'm

308
00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:59.130
not, I'm not, again, I'm not a political scientist,

309
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.729
but there's a lot to be said about that.

310
00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:04.130
And they're, they own most of the industry, they're

311
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.369
trying to consolidate media, they're trying to break down

312
00:16:06.369 --> 00:16:09.179
the education system and all the things because The

313
00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:11.929
powers that be need ignorant people to vote for

314
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:15.179
them, which we saw, and vote against their best

315
00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:18.820
interests, which we saw. So they say it ruined

316
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.299
it because then they don't get to have the

317
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:21.890
little candy. These are people who are still mad

318
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.299
that slavery is over, OK. So there's a small

319
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:28.590
group of men, mostly pale, who liked it when

320
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.380
the world was theirs. The world was built for

321
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.419
them, and they don't want to have to think

322
00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:36.380
about the causes of the consequences of their actions.

323
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.659
They don't want to think about their heart. They

324
00:16:37.659 --> 00:16:39.820
don't want to think about it. And so, anytime

325
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.460
they're forced to confront the truth of what they

326
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.460
have begat, they get really upset. So, you know,

327
00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.859
they're trying to take away no-fault divorce. Um, SO

328
00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:52.900
women are forced to stay with abusive, all the

329
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.780
things. I don't want to get it, it's a

330
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.419
whole other conversation. So, female sexual freedom is very,

331
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.729
very scary because, then, because one statistic that we

332
00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:07.368
need to talk about. Who lives longest, Married men,

333
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.920
single women. Who lives shortest, single men, married women.

334
00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:16.510
What does that say? And so, the traditional home

335
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:22.699
depends on the tremendous emotional labor of females. To,

336
00:17:22.979 --> 00:17:25.709
and there's a whole, there's a whole, um, uh,

337
00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:28.579
new term now, mental load, and how modern husbands

338
00:17:28.579 --> 00:17:30.619
have to understand that the mental load the wife

339
00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:33.180
carries is, you know, he, you're not marrying your

340
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.699
mother, you're marrying a partner. So the, the millennials

341
00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:40.339
and younger, um, are, are more aware of this.

342
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.069
Traditional fact because they're being raised by women who

343
00:17:44.069 --> 00:17:46.430
are now in their 40s and 50s who are

344
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.099
themselves feminists. So I, for some of the younger

345
00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:51.619
men, not the Trump guys, but the other younger

346
00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:54.550
men who are, you know, involved fathers who are

347
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.229
caring partners, I do feel hope with them because

348
00:17:57.229 --> 00:18:00.869
they, they, they all realize patriarchy hurts everybody, patriarchy

349
00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:02.770
hurts men. As well. I've been saying this for

350
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.040
40 years. The patriarchy is bad for men because

351
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.489
most men are not in power. They're never going

352
00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.489
to be in power. They're not going to accrue

353
00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:14.770
that kind of wealth. Um, THE people in power

354
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.290
have been accruing wealth for hundreds of years and,

355
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.329
and, and placed in hedging their bets and, and

356
00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:24.459
stacking the system. And so patriarchy keeps men amputated

357
00:18:24.459 --> 00:18:26.770
from their feelings. It keeps women amputated from their

358
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.180
sexuality, and then says, go make friends, go find

359
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.880
somebody to love you. But we are raised big

360
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.040
groups to be antagonistic towards each other. Men only

361
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.819
want one thing. Women are like this. And so

362
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.160
we're too busy fighting each other to see the

363
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.239
people on top, and it's an age-old tactic. It's

364
00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:48.319
been going on for thousands of years. So it's

365
00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:51.359
just hypercharged in this culture. So I do not

366
00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:54.640
think that feminism ruined relationships or that feminism ruined

367
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.869
marriage. I think what ruinined traditional marriage is real

368
00:18:57.869 --> 00:19:00.180
people realizing, oh my gosh, you're being abused too.

369
00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:05.209
It's not just me because again, abuse happens in

370
00:19:05.209 --> 00:19:08.250
isolation, right? They cut you off, and so it's

371
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.010
just, and they tell you things like, well, you

372
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.689
know, I love, I love you. Anybody else knew

373
00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:15.969
the real you, they wouldn't love you, but I

374
00:19:15.969 --> 00:19:18.160
love you. And because I love you, I get

375
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.250
to treat you badly. It, it's quite sick. There's

376
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.689
lots written about it. I'm not going to go

377
00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:24.430
into psychology. So no, I do not think feminism

378
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.910
ruined anything.

379
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:29.920
Oh, OK. So let me just take a step

380
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.660
back because I was asking you at the beginning

381
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.380
about your, uh, I mean, your path toward, uh,

382
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.520
pornography, but, uh, I, uh, before we go back

383
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.449
to feminism, let me just ask you a few

384
00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:47.459
questions here because I, I'm very curious about these

385
00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:50.525
kinds of things, the, the. In Formations that happened

386
00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:54.295
uh in the porn industry for the past four

387
00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:58.885
decades, basically. So, uh when you look back uh

388
00:19:59.305 --> 00:20:02.704
to the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, the 2010s,

389
00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:06.744
and now the 2020s, um what would you say

390
00:20:06.744 --> 00:20:11.564
are the biggest changes that you see across those

391
00:20:11.824 --> 00:20:13.964
four decades in the porn industry?

392
00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:19.099
Well, certainly, um, uh, internet. So the switch from

393
00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:22.939
the switch from analog to digital media. Um, ON

394
00:20:22.939 --> 00:20:27.020
the positive side, it enables the individual performer to

395
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.579
make direct contact with the consumer and get more

396
00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:33.589
of the money. On the downside, um, revenge porn,

397
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.130
certainly, um, and the fact that People think sex

398
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:45.250
work is easy, um, uh, the nicheification of, of

399
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.229
images, um, and what I don't like, of course,

400
00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:50.849
in the in the digital age is the ability

401
00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.010
for people to access images with no context. So

402
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.369
in the analog years, until the individual person, absent

403
00:20:58.369 --> 00:21:01.439
abuse situation, the individual person did not look for

404
00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:04.790
pornography until they were told by their body that

405
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.900
it's time. You know, I'm, I'm interested in, in

406
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.859
naked adult people, right? Because you're of a certain

407
00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:12.719
age. You had to go out of the house

408
00:21:12.719 --> 00:21:15.060
and go find it. It was mysterious. It was

409
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.369
dangerous. It was scary. It was exciting. It was

410
00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:20.859
all the things, but you still rarely had it

411
00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:25.140
thrust upon you on Knowingly or thrust upon you

412
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.339
without your consent.

413
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.660
I mean, unless you found your father's magazine

414
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.459
collection that you were looking, that means you were

415
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:35.170
looking, right? It's not like someone, you know, so,

416
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.180
so what happens, what worries, so up until the

417
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.979
digital age, I would say pornography is a mirror

418
00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:44.609
to culture. So the culture gets the pornography it

419
00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:47.050
deserves, which for the most part, because of our

420
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.489
culture is still. With very few exceptions, quite racist,

421
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.290
quite sexist, quite ageist, quite ablest, quite all, all

422
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.589
the things. And so, it is a media product

423
00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:04.290
born out of our twisted sex, uh, erotophobia, racist

424
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.050
and sexist culture. So, the images made to titillate

425
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.609
and excite you are going to be pulled on

426
00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:15.319
that with The internet with with the digitization of

427
00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:17.239
everything now, in the old days, if you had

428
00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:18.680
a thing that you like, you might have to

429
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.319
look at 5 or 6 or 8 movies to

430
00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:25.239
find one scene of that thing. That you like.

431
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.119
And now there's a whole 2 hour compilation of

432
00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:29.239
just that thing. And it doesn't matter how crazy

433
00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:35.290
the thing is, balloons, splashing, toes. Tickling, there's going

434
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.900
to be massive amounts of material just for you.

435
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.770
So now pornography has been siloed, right? Used used

436
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.589
to be more broad. Used to be a movie,

437
00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:46.270
had a little bit of everything in it, right?

438
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.630
You were in a 5 scene movie. You had,

439
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.130
you know, a little kinky, a little vanilla, a

440
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.750
little cheating, a little voyeurism, you know, and now

441
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:59.410
it's just one movie of just a thing. So,

442
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.489
the access to the images has the, the bar

443
00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:07.750
to entry, both as a consumer and a provider

444
00:23:07.989 --> 00:23:11.760
has lowered considerably. I don't know if that is

445
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.209
all good. As a, as a, as a pro-creator,

446
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.910
as a provider of images, um, I do it,

447
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.609
if a provider has a good work ethic and

448
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:25.569
understands the wheels and the, and the, and the

449
00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:29.689
mechanism, you can make a living. Selling images just

450
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:30.979
to people who want to see you, so you

451
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:33.489
don't have to deal with the bigger porn system

452
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:36.369
because in the analog days, if the director, if

453
00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:38.290
the owner of a company didn't want to have

454
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.869
sex with you, you didn't get hired. Um, AND

455
00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:43.479
not that you had to have sex with someone

456
00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:45.199
to get hired, but if he didn't find you,

457
00:23:45.449 --> 00:23:48.010
you know, effable, he wasn't going to hire you.

458
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.430
Now, You, no matter what you look like, can

459
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.020
go find the people who think that you're sexy.

460
00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:57.859
That's not terrible. And especially if you're queer and

461
00:23:57.859 --> 00:24:01.069
trying to make community over being, um, uh, on

462
00:24:01.069 --> 00:24:05.550
the spectrum, uh, sexually queer, kinky, it is easier

463
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.390
to find more like you and make community that

464
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.849
way. So that's a Benefit. The, the downside, of

465
00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:16.170
course, again is, you know, revenge porn and the

466
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.880
fact that there's no There's little ways to effectively

467
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.160
keep people who don't know what they're looking at

468
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.640
finding it. I'm not in favor of the age

469
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.239
verification technology that we're using because those are absolutely

470
00:24:28.239 --> 00:24:32.560
designed to be, uh, to, to chill and to

471
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.339
chill, uh, Demand. They want, they want to shut

472
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.060
down demand. So if they can make you feel

473
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.760
bad for looking at adult material, um, then they

474
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.060
can shame you and make you frightened enough to,

475
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.810
to back off. So, I don't know enough about

476
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:51.729
that to have a deep opinion. I don't, it's

477
00:24:51.729 --> 00:24:53.819
not coming from a good place. Protect the children.

478
00:24:53.949 --> 00:24:57.060
Protect the children. Um, THERE'S a great book. Um,

479
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.180
THERE'S a wonderful book by Judith Levine called Harmful

480
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.979
to Minors, The Dangers of Protecting Children from Sex.

481
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.219
So Judith Levine, Harmful to Minors, great book, and

482
00:25:08.219 --> 00:25:12.760
it is So, on the one hand, um, the

483
00:25:13.219 --> 00:25:15.699
conservative side wants to protect children, but of course,

484
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.489
we know with all the scandals, they are the

485
00:25:17.489 --> 00:25:20.699
ones harming children. The the pastors and the parents

486
00:25:20.699 --> 00:25:23.359
and the foster parents are the ones harming children,

487
00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:26.329
um, under the guise of, you know, God wants

488
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:31.140
this for you. So, the hypocrisy and the blindness

489
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.869
of the anti-sexual side is very It's heartbreaking. It

490
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:40.819
is enraging. It is dangerous, um, and it has

491
00:25:40.819 --> 00:25:46.619
consequences going on for generations. Um, AND I But

492
00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:48.589
what I do see, what makes me happy is

493
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.430
I see a lot of, um, younger people under

494
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:55.459
30 who are escaping family cults and escaping high

495
00:25:55.459 --> 00:25:58.469
pressure religions and talking about it. This one young

496
00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:01.459
woman online who says, you know, who's basically saying,

497
00:26:02.089 --> 00:26:05.709
send me your, send me your unhinged experiences with

498
00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:09.790
youth pastors or in youth, youth group. It's, it's

499
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.390
just astonishing, you know, Jeffrey Epstein has nothing on

500
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:17.319
this behavior. So, We know the power of sexuality,

501
00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:20.609
and we know the power of bodily autonomy. We

502
00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:23.380
know what it means to, to be able to

503
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.420
say what happens to my body and what I

504
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.099
do with it, who gets to have access to

505
00:26:27.099 --> 00:26:28.880
it and who does not get to have access

506
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.260
to it.

507
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.859
Oh, OK, so, can I, can I mention, uh,

508
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.739
three things that I think happened or I saw

509
00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:39.959
happening? I mean, I did. DIDN'T experience them directly

510
00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:42.670
because I, I was born in 1990, so I

511
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.680
wasn't there in the 1980s, but anyway, uh three

512
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.630
big changes that I saw happening in the porn

513
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.199
industry that I think are very positive. So the

514
00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:56.060
first one. You mentioned ageism. I think that in

515
00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.010
the late 2000s, particularly with the rise of the

516
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.199
MILF category,

517
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.900
started in 2000, I remember.

518
00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:07.819
Oh, in 2000, OK, but with the rise of

519
00:27:07.819 --> 00:27:13.380
that category, uh, I think that ageism really got,

520
00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:16.170
uh, I, I, I mean, it got less popular.

521
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:18.140
I mean, because until the 190s, OK, I'll

522
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.660
give that to you. I have something to say

523
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.170
about that. OK, so what

524
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.430
else? OK, OK, OK, OK. And then in terms

525
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.209
of racism, I've noticed of course that and at

526
00:27:29.209 --> 00:27:32.689
least in the 80s and 90s, probably also in

527
00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:36.310
the early 2000s or until the mid 2000s, it

528
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.969
was, I mean, I don't think there were even

529
00:27:38.969 --> 00:27:41.630
interracial sex scenes

530
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.489
in my first one was interracial. They've always had

531
00:27:44.489 --> 00:27:48.729
interracial sex scenes, but now, so interracial always means

532
00:27:48.729 --> 00:27:52.209
African American man, pale woman. It never means pale

533
00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:57.479
man. Darker skinned female, always, always, so the interracial

534
00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:02.890
boom is absolutely 100% directly tied to white supremacy

535
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.770
and chattel slavery here in the United States. The

536
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:10.489
direct, direct line, direct line, um, and it's become

537
00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:13.770
quite fetishized. So again, race is fetishized. They're not,

538
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.250
they're not just a guy, they're a big black

539
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.660
guy. It, it, it's. So, and, and then, of

540
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.719
course, and then, um, and racism toward black females

541
00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:27.180
up until the mid-nineties, there was one famous black

542
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.250
performer at a time, female, only one. Um, AND,

543
00:28:30.369 --> 00:28:33.050
and it wasn't until the mid-nineties, um, I can't

544
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:36.209
remember his name, uh, who started the urban, the,

545
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.010
you know, urban cheerleaders scene that where we had

546
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.930
multiple black women who were shown in a movie.

547
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.619
But again, almost all the time, all caricatures, right?

548
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.930
Um, AND, uh, that's why Shawn Michaels is so

549
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.089
important at the time in the 1980s. He will

550
00:28:52.089 --> 00:28:53.569
not play a thug. He would not play a

551
00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:56.310
gangster. He would not put on an orange jumpsuit

552
00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.760
and pretend to be a prisoner. He always He

553
00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:01.500
was played a smooth character, so he would push

554
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.310
him back and he lost work because of it.

555
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.979
So don't forget, uh, up until still now, most

556
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:09.540
company owners are white. So even if they're hiring

557
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.880
black performers, the black performers are performing an idea

558
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.439
of masculinity, idea of, of, of racial sexual superiority,

559
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.329
and, and you see it in the, in the

560
00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:23.640
marketing, right, that, you know, the men are always

561
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:30.359
Massively endowed. Yes, that's part of the cartoon. So

562
00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:33.569
the most important thing to remember about pornography as

563
00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:35.930
a media product, it is best to think of

564
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.469
it as a live action cartoon, a mix of

565
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:47.630
WWE wrestling, documentary, uh, sporting events, live entertainment, um,

566
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:53.130
uh, bad dinner theater, uh, and it, it's an

567
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.339
idea of sex based on the directors. Notion who

568
00:29:57.339 --> 00:30:00.079
has probably been fucked up by the system, etc.

569
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.420
ETC. So, oh, OK,

570
00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.300
that's a very good point, but then you were

571
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.229
going to say something about the mill,

572
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.660
oh yeah, so um. So I think MILF is

573
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.030
the most popular category and then followed by teen,

574
00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:16.550
right? So the extremes, right? So in porn, it's

575
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.280
all about the extremes, bigger, smaller, darker, lighter, younger,

576
00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:23.099
older, so you hardly, so pornography is not for

577
00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:31.689
the Documentation of, of intimacy, rep reciprocity, equality, um,

578
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.160
respect. It's about it's performative, it's sex strictly as

579
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.660
a performance because most people watching it are masturbating

580
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.619
and they're in their family, they don't want to

581
00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:43.949
hear a lesson about intimacy that's gonna ruin my

582
00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:47.939
heart on. Because arousal, sexual arousal is very self-focused,

583
00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:50.060
it's very selfish. I want what I want. I

584
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.859
want what I, I want this. I want this.

585
00:30:51.979 --> 00:30:55.060
And in that moment when they're hyper aroused, they

586
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.349
don't want to think of anything else. There is

587
00:30:57.349 --> 00:30:58.900
uh an old saying, I don't know it in

588
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.219
Yiddish, a man with an erection is in no

589
00:31:02.219 --> 00:31:05.180
need of advice. And the second one, an erection

590
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.060
has no conscience, because when a person is in

591
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:14.280
the very height of sexual engagement, their focus narrows.

592
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.579
And they're not here to think about the big

593
00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:19.500
picture. They want their, they want their gratification in

594
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.339
that moment. So it's very important before you get

595
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:25.780
to that moment that you've set up the situation

596
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.719
for gratification in an ethical, legal, moral, and, uh,

597
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.260
uh, mutual way. We can play around with, you

598
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.579
know, inequality and dominance and submission, but before we

599
00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:41.020
go there, before we start the game, we have

600
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.000
to make sure the playground is safe. We're picking

601
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.579
the right people who understand what's going to happen

602
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.760
and all the things, and that doesn't happen enough

603
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.199
because our culture, sex should just happen. It should

604
00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:56.239
just happen. And it was beautiful. And we just

605
00:31:56.239 --> 00:32:00.079
fell into each other's arms. And that works once

606
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:03.760
or twice. But then once the, once the person

607
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.959
becomes a real person to you, then, then people

608
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:08.599
don't know what to do. So, I don't want

609
00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:10.560
to plan for sex. It takes all the romance

610
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.699
out of it. Then you never have sex again,

611
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.599
because when you wait for both, both people to

612
00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.180
be around at the same time, It just doesn't

613
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.500
happen and you add kids and work and it's

614
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.500
never gonna happen. So, we have a very backward

615
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.380
view of intimacy in our culture, I believe, and

616
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.819
based and, and, and it's not that women are

617
00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:31.540
unaffected by sexism. Women are also very affected by

618
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.079
sexism. Um, Kate Mann talks about the, the fact,

619
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.689
oh, there's other great book, um, called Slut Shaming,

620
00:32:39.819 --> 00:32:45.369
Whorephobia, and the Unfinished Sexual Revolution. Um, AND it's

621
00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:48.329
about the, about the good girl privilege. So, yes,

622
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.849
men slut shame, but women slut shame just as

623
00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:54.949
much because if I'm seen as a slut, then

624
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.650
the culture says bad things can happen to me.

625
00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:59.089
If I'm a slut, I don't deserve respect. If

626
00:32:59.089 --> 00:33:00.569
I see you as a slut, I don't have

627
00:33:00.569 --> 00:33:02.530
to respect you. I don't have to respect your

628
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.770
boundaries. I don't have to respect your wishes because

629
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.130
you're a slut, therefore, you're worthless. I can just

630
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.619
take what I want from you. And so if

631
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.900
I'm a good girl. Girl girls get privilegeg. Girl

632
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.609
girls get protection. They get taken to the, to

633
00:33:16.609 --> 00:33:19.810
the party. And so I have to distance myself

634
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.680
from a bad girl so that I don't get

635
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.489
tainted instead of seeing that it's putting me in

636
00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:27.250
a cage as well. Um, SO I'll, I'll send

637
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.880
you these titles, so when you post the interview,

638
00:33:29.969 --> 00:33:32.780
you can have the, the suggested reading list, um,

639
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.329
there for you. Um, THERE'S so much written about

640
00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:36.969
this. It's not, it's not just coming out of

641
00:33:36.969 --> 00:33:40.260
my head. So the mill thing. Uh, IT was

642
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.780
about 2000. I don't know the movie American Pie,

643
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.599
and that's where the term first came in.

644
00:33:45.949 --> 00:33:48.699
Yes, yeah, it was in 1999, I think. OK,

645
00:33:48.859 --> 00:33:50.900
so, so MILF, so that was the year I

646
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.709
turned 41, um. And people are saying, Nina, why,

647
00:33:54.829 --> 00:33:57.630
why, why is this with all things? So, a

648
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.910
couple of things. First, um, the original porn youths

649
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.010
were aging out, they're getting married and having kids.

650
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.109
So first, in, at a home for couples who

651
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:09.270
watch pornography together, the wife controls what movies come

652
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.350
into the house. Secondly, a lot of these guys

653
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.408
were parents and they're realizing, ew. That, that actresses

654
00:34:15.408 --> 00:34:18.688
might, oh, so they themselves rightfully got sort of

655
00:34:18.688 --> 00:34:22.967
disgusted at the idea of masturbating to somebody who

656
00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:24.608
was the age of their own child, that just

657
00:34:24.608 --> 00:34:29.739
made them weird. And thirdly, young men. So, um,

658
00:34:29.978 --> 00:34:33.539
the idea of the young man being educated by

659
00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:35.697
the older woman, so don't forget, the older woman

660
00:34:35.697 --> 00:34:37.378
is going to have done the emotional labor. She

661
00:34:37.378 --> 00:34:39.299
does the emotional labor for you. She's going to

662
00:34:39.299 --> 00:34:41.138
make it all right for you. She's going to

663
00:34:41.138 --> 00:34:43.138
tell you what she needs cause the 21 year

664
00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:44.554
old girl doesn't know what she She wants yet.

665
00:34:44.844 --> 00:34:46.685
She's going to guide you because a 21 year

666
00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:49.114
old boy doesn't know what to do yet. She's

667
00:34:49.114 --> 00:34:51.165
going to make it OK for you because she's

668
00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:53.524
going to be caring and kind, and she just

669
00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:55.885
wants you for your sexual prowess. She doesn't need

670
00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:58.034
you for a relationship or baby. She just wants

671
00:34:58.034 --> 00:35:00.169
you for sex, which is a male fantasy. I

672
00:35:00.169 --> 00:35:02.489
just want to be a sex object, right? And

673
00:35:02.649 --> 00:35:04.290
for women, they're trained to be, I just wanna

674
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.169
be a love object, right? And so, the, the

675
00:35:08.169 --> 00:35:11.129
joke is, you know, the, the, you know, women

676
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:12.929
give sex to get love and men give love

677
00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:14.770
to get sex, and then they get angry that

678
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.290
they lied to each other. Because in our culture,

679
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.620
again, if I can't be horny, I'm horny, you're

680
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.500
cute, let's do it. I have to convince you

681
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.699
or tell myself that I love him and he

682
00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:28.459
loves me, and that takes the love, takes the

683
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:32.260
taint of horny away. So, she's taught, and also

684
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.419
she, women are taught to be the, the, the,

685
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.939
the gatekeepers of male behavior. So men are taught

686
00:35:37.939 --> 00:35:39.770
to go get, get, try, try, try. We're supposed

687
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.219
to, no, no, no, if we give in too

688
00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:42.979
quickly, we're a slut. If we don't give them

689
00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:46.100
at all, we're approved. That's again, another long discussion

690
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.139
many people have written about this. But in the

691
00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:50.379
moment, so if I'm horny and I, and I

692
00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:53.179
need to convince you, convince myself that it's OK

693
00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:54.899
to sleep with you, I have to believe you

694
00:35:54.899 --> 00:35:56.860
love me and you're horny, you're gonna tell me

695
00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.850
you love me because you want to get laid.

696
00:35:59.379 --> 00:36:01.860
The, the best song on this ever is by

697
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.610
the artist Meat Loaf called Paradise by the Dashboard

698
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.219
Light. Came out in 1980. Anyway, it's the song

699
00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:12.979
says it all. It's in a nutshell, and it

700
00:36:12.979 --> 00:36:16.379
is the reason for so many bad marriages because

701
00:36:16.379 --> 00:36:18.040
you have that time because you don't know about

702
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.580
birth control or alternative ways of getting off that

703
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.739
avoid pregnancy. I can't, I can't imagine how many

704
00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:29.820
millions of marriages were forced because, and the baby

705
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.000
came at 8 months after the wedding. Um, AND,

706
00:36:34.189 --> 00:36:36.520
uh, and how many people that were thrust together

707
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.659
for their whole life who had no business being

708
00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:41.120
together because of one mistake, because she couldn't be

709
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.590
sexual, he could not bring a, all the things,

710
00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:45.830
all the things. So, it ripples out through the

711
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.459
whole culture when we deny women their sexual autonomy

712
00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:52.939
and we deny men their emotional intelligence.

713
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:57.310
Right. So, let me ask you then, uh, I

714
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.750
mean, there's those aspects of the porn industry that

715
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.030
we have to keep in mind and also the

716
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.870
fact, of course, that it's basically a fantasy. It's

717
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.050
not how people usually have sex in real life,

718
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:14.310
but I, I, uh, how about sex education because

719
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.195
you're, you're also Into sex education and of course

720
00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:22.205
back in 2006, you released your book Nina Hartley's

721
00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:24.614
Guide to Total Sex and you also have a

722
00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:29.004
film series on it which uh which is uh,

723
00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.495
I have to tell you as um an adolescent

724
00:37:31.495 --> 00:37:33.314
I appreciate it a lot.

725
00:37:34.165 --> 00:37:35.534
Thank you, that's why I made them. I made

726
00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:39.979
them because So sex is many layers. There's the

727
00:37:39.979 --> 00:37:42.580
physical behavior. What is it called? Where is it

728
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.179
located? How does it work? Just, just like, like,

729
00:37:45.189 --> 00:37:47.929
a car, a car engine. But there's the social

730
00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:52.459
aspect, the emotional aspect, the intrapersonal aspect, how well

731
00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:54.479
do I know myself, how emotionally regulated I am,

732
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.510
interpersonal. Can I talk to people? Can I hear

733
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.350
them? Can we negotiate? So, all these skills take,

734
00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:02.489
and then there's what I believe about sex. So,

735
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.500
there's 5 main aspects about sex that Develop at

736
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.300
different times. So I knew very young the the

737
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:17.389
mechanics. I had 00 ability to actually. Discuss and

738
00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:19.229
talk about it. So, for me, porn, going into

739
00:38:19.229 --> 00:38:20.469
porn was a way to get the sex I

740
00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:23.139
wanted without having to be in a relationship, without

741
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:24.830
having to pretend that I wanted to see you

742
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.020
again, without having to be alone in a room

743
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.750
with a man after dark who might be drunk

744
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.110
or high. So, for me, pornography was the safest

745
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.790
way to have the most amount of sex with

746
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.570
the least amount of bullshit. And I have been

747
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.090
correct in that matter. Um, I've had the most

748
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.129
amount of sex, the least amount of bullshit. For

749
00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:44.209
me, the bullshit about sex was all in my

750
00:38:44.209 --> 00:38:49.179
personal life, um, with partners who were Not the

751
00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:54.639
best for me, right? So keeping, so sex education

752
00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:58.260
is very important, um, because if I don't know

753
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.360
anything, I can be manipulated. I can be lied

754
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.800
to, I can be coerced more easily. Like, I

755
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.239
don't know my rights. Um, A friend of mine

756
00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:08.679
said the reason they don't want, uh, the reason

757
00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.219
the right wing does not want to teach sex

758
00:39:11.219 --> 00:39:13.719
education in schools is because kids would then know

759
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:17.449
they're being abused. So if I keep you ignorant,

760
00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:18.709
this is the way that it is. This is

761
00:39:18.709 --> 00:39:21.889
what daddies do to their, whatever people are told.

762
00:39:22.669 --> 00:39:25.389
And, but if I, if you have education, then

763
00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:27.469
you can have more autonomy, you can have more

764
00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:31.429
self, um, agency and say things like, yes and

765
00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:34.280
no, not like this. I'd like it like that,

766
00:39:34.429 --> 00:39:36.989
and just yourself have a better relationship to your

767
00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:39.949
body and to other people. Um, AND also,

768
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.699
so that that's how it links to feminism as

769
00:39:43.699 --> 00:39:43.780
well,

770
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.500
of course, of course, um, you cannot be fem

771
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.919
you cannot be infected feminist if you're kept ignorant,

772
00:39:49.379 --> 00:39:53.459
if, if only you know is what you're. Um,

773
00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:55.489
AND, and what happens, of course, a lot of

774
00:39:55.489 --> 00:39:58.770
when these women who believed all of this, and

775
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.260
they get married at 1718, and have 5 or

776
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.679
6 kids, and then the husband leaves them, they're

777
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:06.169
now 40 years old with 4 kids and no

778
00:40:06.169 --> 00:40:09.010
job and no skills and no education, because they

779
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.729
barely got out of high school because they were

780
00:40:10.729 --> 00:40:12.370
supposed to be a wife and mother. He was

781
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.770
supposed to take care of me. And so I'm

782
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.250
going to be a good wife and mother and

783
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.449
devote myself to my family. And then he gets

784
00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:22.540
to go and leave. Because he can, and, and

785
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.379
if her, if his kids, and, uh, there's gonna

786
00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:27.540
be thousands of those women and thousands of those

787
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.689
families in America alone who realize I'm 40-something years

788
00:40:31.689 --> 00:40:33.360
old, I have no savings, I have no education.

789
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.899
I have no, I have no job skills. I

790
00:40:35.899 --> 00:40:37.659
was a mother all these years and now I'm

791
00:40:37.659 --> 00:40:40.820
working in, at a greeter at a, a, a

792
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:45.020
big box store. So, and all because, all because

793
00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.860
we won't educate our girls. So, it's very annoying.

794
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.439
So, but feminism is for everybody. It doesn't mean

795
00:40:52.439 --> 00:40:54.350
women are better than men. It means that everyone

796
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.030
should get an equal chance. And for me, feminism

797
00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.429
is also about people being able to do the

798
00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:03.250
job they're best for. I think about my, my

799
00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:07.209
father and his parents. Um, IN a perfect world,

800
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.429
His mother would have gone to work with her

801
00:41:09.429 --> 00:41:12.060
father because she was very strong, outgoing, good in

802
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.389
business, but it was the early 1900s, no way.

803
00:41:15.669 --> 00:41:18.750
So his poor sweet country father had to go

804
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.929
to work with his father-in-law. He had no aptitude.

805
00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:24.110
My father's father should have been able to stay

806
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.149
home and run the house, and his mother, after

807
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:27.909
burying the children, should have been able to go

808
00:41:27.909 --> 00:41:30.909
out into the world with her father. Temperamentally, it

809
00:41:30.909 --> 00:41:32.780
would have been a better suit, a better fit.

810
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.070
My father would have had a happy childhood and

811
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.330
life would have been different. So think of all

812
00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:40.290
of the people crammed into the wrong box because

813
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.590
of what's between their legs and what the culture

814
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.110
says that means for you. And you never get

815
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.629
a chance to question it. You don't get a

816
00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:49.989
chance to learn another way of being, and it's

817
00:41:49.989 --> 00:41:52.629
very painful, and it causes, you know, a lot

818
00:41:52.629 --> 00:41:54.669
of problems. It causes, I'm sure, lots of addictions

819
00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:56.989
and, and all kinds of things. It's just because

820
00:41:56.989 --> 00:42:02.600
people People have to express the pain of isolation

821
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.760
and the pain of loneliness somehow. Some people take

822
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.919
it out on themselves through addiction and depression. Some

823
00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:10.639
people take it out on others through violence and

824
00:42:10.639 --> 00:42:13.760
murder, but it must express itself somehow.

825
00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:18.810
Oh, OK, but then what is sex positive feminism?

826
00:42:18.929 --> 00:42:21.330
What does it mean to be sex positive?

827
00:42:22.379 --> 00:42:24.939
So I don't know if there's an official definition,

828
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.020
but for me, sex positive, um, starts with the

829
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.479
notion that sexuality is a either God-given or nature-given

830
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:36.340
fact of life. We are, most humans are sexual

831
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.100
beings, um, very, I think very few, vanishingly few

832
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.459
percentage of the population are what we call asexual,

833
00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:44.899
just not done it. So, and they should get

834
00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:46.580
to go to, they should go live in monasteries

835
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.090
and, and do what they do, right? Um, SO,

836
00:42:50.129 --> 00:42:53.330
it starts with the idea that everyone, um, is

837
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.570
an autonomous being who has a right to, um,

838
00:42:56.649 --> 00:42:59.489
have the intimate and erotic life that, that works

839
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:02.340
best for them, um, that does not, uh, hurt,

840
00:43:02.729 --> 00:43:04.570
that sex, you do not use sex to hurt

841
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.790
yourself or to harm other people or take advantage

842
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.850
of other people, that, uh, we use it to

843
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.649
promote, um, Peace and calmness within ourselves, and intimacy

844
00:43:13.649 --> 00:43:17.899
and connection with other people, um, and that just

845
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:23.449
recognizing it is a, it is a It's really

846
00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:25.370
important. Sex is how we get the next generation.

847
00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:27.770
We have to have it, right? We have, we

848
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.489
have, to have sexual intercourse. That is how most

849
00:43:30.489 --> 00:43:33.669
people are created and we need it for people,

850
00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:39.090
right? But what the, um, antis don't like to

851
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.080
understand is that for some reason, now, whether you

852
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.570
believe so, either, I, again, I do not believe

853
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.129
in the God of the Bible. I do believe

854
00:43:46.129 --> 00:43:51.179
in evolution. For some reason, God or nature, Made

855
00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:56.800
sexual, the capacity for erotic pleasure really important, or

856
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.320
we would not have, we would not mate all

857
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.959
year round. People say, oh, you have sex, you

858
00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:03.479
like animals, not really. If we're like animals, we

859
00:44:03.479 --> 00:44:07.709
would have sex in You know, December, we'd have

860
00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:09.629
sex in July to have babies in March. I

861
00:44:09.629 --> 00:44:11.989
mean, we did do the math, but so we

862
00:44:11.989 --> 00:44:14.110
would have sex, you know, we, we'd have seasons,

863
00:44:14.229 --> 00:44:17.989
but humans are sexually receptive year-round. That's weird. Very

864
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:22.290
few animals, um, outside of humans. Humans, bonobos, dolphins.

865
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.610
Um, YOU know, mate year round. It's just not

866
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.770
at rats, rats and rodents, you know, rats and

867
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.790
mice will mate year round,

868
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.750
and some of those animals also have sex just

869
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.699
for fun, not for.

870
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.530
So, humans, humans have a lot, so humans have

871
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.810
a lot of sex just for fun because of

872
00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.830
the nature, because of it in a healthy relationship.

873
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.320
Effective sexuality, not just scratches and itch, but also

874
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.750
brings me closer to my partner. We are creating,

875
00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:53.120
we're creating love and affection and affinity between us

876
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.679
when it is mutual and beneficial and not forced.

877
00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.600
So, the capacity, so sexual arousal is an altered

878
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.239
state of consciousness. It is, it, it connects us

879
00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:06.360
to the divine. So before we had the idea

880
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.500
of God, don't, I, I believe God is a,

881
00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:12.919
this means everything all at once. It's, it's a,

882
00:45:12.969 --> 00:45:17.879
it's a paltry human attempt to put words on

883
00:45:17.879 --> 00:45:24.510
the ineffable. Because the feeling of That's a real

884
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.689
human emotion and chimpanzees can have it too, just.

885
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:33.129
Gobsmacked, awestruck, struck dumb by beauty, and that's just

886
00:45:33.129 --> 00:45:35.409
a very human emotion. And we can tap into

887
00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:42.850
that through prayer, through meditation, through, um, fasting, through

888
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.514
spinning, dervishing, or directly through the Citation of our

889
00:45:47.965 --> 00:45:51.995
erotosensory system to tap into the divine. Turns out

890
00:45:51.995 --> 00:45:54.685
that something side note, so you've heard about chakras,

891
00:45:54.725 --> 00:45:57.135
right? And, you know, there's a base chakra all

892
00:45:57.135 --> 00:45:59.135
the way to the crown chakra. The spot in

893
00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:04.935
the brain that processes the neurological information coming from

894
00:46:04.935 --> 00:46:11.050
our phalluses. I coincides with the crown chakra. OK,

895
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.889
so sexual pleasure, sexual pleasure is a direct. Cultivated

896
00:46:16.889 --> 00:46:20.500
sexual pleasure is a direct line to the feeling

897
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:25.699
of ineffability, of awe, of transcendence, of melting away

898
00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:27.780
into the arms of your lover, of melting into

899
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.379
the bigger universe of things. So it is. The

900
00:46:30.379 --> 00:46:34.739
capacity for awe and transcendence is a human thing.

901
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.100
Our brain is made for that. You can get

902
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.580
to it a whole bunch of ways. Psychedelic drugs,

903
00:46:39.899 --> 00:46:41.939
all, you know, lose sleep for a while, you're

904
00:46:41.939 --> 00:46:45.699
gonna start seeing things. Again, meditation, fasting, uh, spinning,

905
00:46:45.979 --> 00:46:50.054
um, uh, trance dancing, and And, of course, erotic

906
00:46:50.324 --> 00:46:55.554
stimulation, um, done with respect and, and intention. You

907
00:46:55.554 --> 00:46:58.985
can absolutely take yourself into a whole other realm

908
00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:01.344
and never leave the house. So, it is very,

909
00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:04.794
very powerful. And conservatives hate sex and want to

910
00:47:04.794 --> 00:47:08.435
control it because desire is chaotic and it is

911
00:47:08.435 --> 00:47:13.195
anarchic. It, it crosses boundaries. We're, we're, we're taught,

912
00:47:13.235 --> 00:47:15.114
OK, you're a, you're a man, right? And you

913
00:47:15.114 --> 00:47:17.899
were taught, this is what men want. And so,

914
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.280
anything outside of this that you might want makes

915
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.489
you doubt yourself, makes you not trust yourself. Am

916
00:47:23.489 --> 00:47:25.679
I a real man because I want this? Am

917
00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:27.000
I a real woman because I don't want to

918
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.879
be a mother? Am I a real woman because

919
00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.350
I want to have sex with a bunch of

920
00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.760
people? And depending on how I was raised, I,

921
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.649
oh, what's so, what's wrong with me? I'm so,

922
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.780
I'm so damaged. Why do I want that versus

923
00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:43.110
So for me as a sex-positive feminist, I believe

924
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:46.810
everyone has the right to have a fully autonomous

925
00:47:47.189 --> 00:47:51.070
sexual expression of their life with people who also

926
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.350
want that thing. Everything,

927
00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:54.510
yeah, you know, uh, you, you want, uh, do

928
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.550
you want to hear a funny one that I

929
00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.570
heard from a conservative philosopher a few years ago.

930
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:06.090
I heard from him that Uh, men who perform

931
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:12.689
oral sex on women are less manly than men

932
00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:21.149
who don't do it, basically, so. So I, I

933
00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:21.590
mean, I

934
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.310
thought what, what is, what is manly? What is

935
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.229
manly about having a female partner who wants to

936
00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:29.860
be intimate with you? What is unmanly about that?

937
00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:32.270
So people, these are men who, of course, who

938
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.270
don't have sex and have unhappy women and wonder

939
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.510
where did the divorce come from. So if a

940
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.790
man, who we're getting very binary here, if a

941
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.030
man wants a woman to be sexual with him,

942
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.229
it is useful for him to make it fun.

943
00:48:46.639 --> 00:48:49.780
And safe for her to be sexual with him.

944
00:48:50.209 --> 00:48:54.090
He can, he can change his behavior, his attitude,

945
00:48:54.169 --> 00:48:57.590
and his thinking in such a way that women

946
00:48:58.169 --> 00:49:02.969
will want to be with him. But that, so,

947
00:49:03.129 --> 00:49:05.290
so I heard it the other day and I

948
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.030
believed it, you know, so men who are saying,

949
00:49:07.409 --> 00:49:09.169
you know, women just want, you know, six figures,

950
00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:12.280
6 ft, 6 pack abs, it's like. That's not

951
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.479
true. It's objectively not true. But if you believe

952
00:49:15.479 --> 00:49:17.399
that, then you don't have to work on yourself.

953
00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:19.320
You don't have to look in the mirror. You

954
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.760
don't have to work on your horrible personality, your

955
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.000
stunted emotional growth, your limited intellectual, um, well, some

956
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.379
of these guys who think this are actually quite

957
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.479
educated, but they're not, um, they're, they're, the emotionally

958
00:49:35.479 --> 00:49:40.939
very, very, uh, Uneducated, uneducated, emotionally ignorant, um, and

959
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:43.020
then they, and so, but when you act like

960
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.060
a victim, that's a very childish, that's a boy,

961
00:49:45.139 --> 00:49:48.219
it's a boy thing. Man, this happened to me.

962
00:49:48.379 --> 00:49:49.810
They're mean to me.

963
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.580
Yeah, and, and that's, that's a

964
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.580
little boy. So that, that's a little boy who

965
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.000
does not want to do the work to become

966
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.300
a mature man. He just wants to sit there

967
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.620
and, you know, those mean girls, they don't like

968
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.020
me. I don't like girls, those feminists made all

969
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.429
this. Sorry.

970
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.399
No, and as if rich men never get divorced

971
00:50:14.399 --> 00:50:18.159
or rejected or have failed relationships,

972
00:50:18.399 --> 00:50:20.000
right? And if it wasn't, if so many women

973
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.919
didn't get killed over it, it would be laughable.

974
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.560
But actually, and again, in America, I don't know

975
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.629
what happens in Europe, but in America there are

976
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:30.610
I tried the website about this, but just for

977
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.949
saying no, women have been killed, just for saying,

978
00:50:33.129 --> 00:50:34.810
I don't want to give you my number. So

979
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:38.209
the impulse control, uh, you know, these so-called men

980
00:50:38.209 --> 00:50:40.350
have the impulse control of a two year old

981
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:49.280
and have the, the The full rage enhancement of,

982
00:50:49.389 --> 00:50:51.409
of, you know, again, as a young child, you

983
00:50:51.409 --> 00:50:53.560
feel your emotions fully when you're very young, right?

984
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.090
You feel fully rage, fully joy, fully sad, fully

985
00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.889
all the things. And as we are hopefully, you

986
00:51:00.889 --> 00:51:04.909
know, um, cultivated correctly, we learn how to identify.

987
00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:11.750
Manage and transform those emotions into. Better behavior and

988
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.149
more integrated. And these men have never learned that,

989
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.110
so they have the emotions of a 2 year

990
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.300
old and the body of a 30 or 40

991
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.860
or 50-year-old, and the strength. So if your 2

992
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.649
year old comes and hits you on the leg

993
00:51:23.649 --> 00:51:26.010
and goes, you're a bad, bad, bad mom, you're

994
00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:29.050
a bad daddy, but a 30-year-old man does that,

995
00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:31.929
you die, all because you didn't want to sleep

996
00:51:31.929 --> 00:51:36.070
with him. And Again, it's a bigger question than

997
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.050
I can answer here, um, but it doesn't mean

998
00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:41.030
that the feminist movement was wrong. We needed it.

999
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.590
But again, women couldn't, can now get credit. Before,

1000
00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:46.229
you couldn't open it, you can't get credit without

1001
00:51:46.229 --> 00:51:47.959
your husband. You couldn't get birth control without your

1002
00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:49.899
husband. You couldn't get a bank account without your

1003
00:51:49.899 --> 00:51:55.469
husband 50 years ago, barely, it's very recent. And

1004
00:51:55.469 --> 00:52:00.149
so when one group is losing power, um, they,

1005
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.169
it's called extinction birth, but they're trying very hard

1006
00:52:02.169 --> 00:52:04.669
to keep it. It's very terrifying because then. And

1007
00:52:04.669 --> 00:52:06.919
also their good time is about to end. They

1008
00:52:06.919 --> 00:52:08.560
get to be held accountable. They get to have,

1009
00:52:08.639 --> 00:52:10.320
they have to do the work. They can't expect

1010
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.679
her to do all the household labor, all the

1011
00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:16.840
emotional labor, all the executive functioning labor, so they

1012
00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.840
can walk around and, and pretend to be a

1013
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:26.610
big man. That is really It's terrifying, but they

1014
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.729
can't admit to being scared because that's a sissy

1015
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:32.350
emotion, so they have to be angry and outraged.

1016
00:52:32.709 --> 00:52:34.989
So again, it's just energy. It can come out.

1017
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.189
Positively, it can come out negatively, it can come

1018
00:52:38.189 --> 00:52:41.050
out destructively, it has to express itself.

1019
00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.709
Oh, OK, but, but then let me ask you

1020
00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:46.909
this because you're well aware of this, that there

1021
00:52:46.909 --> 00:52:51.870
are some particularly radical feminists out there who are

1022
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:56.770
against porn, against sex work more generally. And they

1023
00:52:56.770 --> 00:53:00.840
tend to have very unhealthy views of sex,

1024
00:53:00.959 --> 00:53:04.090
to say the very traditional patriarchal views of sex.

1025
00:53:05.479 --> 00:53:05.800
Women

1026
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.080
don't what, what, what, what do, what do you

1027
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.340
think about those,

1028
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.429
um, I think that they are just as sex

1029
00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:15.699
negative as any, uh, preacher or any, any man.

1030
00:53:15.949 --> 00:53:19.840
Um, THEY, again, the book, um, uh, slut shaming

1031
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.169
and whorephobia and the Unfinished Sexual Revolution by Meredith

1032
00:53:23.169 --> 00:53:29.929
Ralston talks about this extensively. It is. It is,

1033
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:35.830
they have been indoctrinated with a Western Judeo-Christian idea

1034
00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:40.689
that, that, um, uh, men are bad and sex

1035
00:53:40.689 --> 00:53:42.719
is how they get over on women and that

1036
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:46.100
women don't want it for their own sake, that

1037
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.699
if women do want sex, it's because they're brainwashed

1038
00:53:48.699 --> 00:53:50.939
into pleasing men. I remember this in the, in

1039
00:53:50.939 --> 00:53:54.000
the 70s and early 80s, um, the idea that

1040
00:53:54.219 --> 00:53:58.760
they're, it's called bisexual erasure or bi erasure. So,

1041
00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:00.854
yeah, I understand. People can be gay, and some

1042
00:54:00.854 --> 00:54:02.814
people can be, but bi, they just haven't made

1043
00:54:02.814 --> 00:54:05.104
up their mind. They're just sitting on the fence.

1044
00:54:05.294 --> 00:54:07.415
They're just, and so a lot of, a lot

1045
00:54:07.415 --> 00:54:10.375
of the feminist rhetoric against bisexual women was that,

1046
00:54:10.574 --> 00:54:12.534
oh, you're just bi for the attention of men.

1047
00:54:12.774 --> 00:54:14.635
You're just kissing a girl for the attention of

1048
00:54:14.635 --> 00:54:18.054
men, and it's like, no, I like kissing girls.

1049
00:54:18.215 --> 00:54:24.600
And also, um, uh. That to objectify is to

1050
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.110
wish and cause harm, right? I'm not, and so

1051
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.290
for me, I've, when I was younger, it's like,

1052
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.030
I objectified women because everyone outside of us is

1053
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.629
an object. Now, I, I don't have to, I,

1054
00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:37.030
I don't know you. I'm going to look at

1055
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.110
you and form an opinion. Now, when I speak

1056
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.750
to you, I need to drop the objectification and

1057
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.750
see you as a person and a human and

1058
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.439
have that. But from across the room before I

1059
00:54:46.439 --> 00:54:49.870
met you, I don't know you, so you're tall,

1060
00:54:49.949 --> 00:54:54.520
you're cute, you're whatever. And so I knew right

1061
00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:00.010
away that their fundamental. Um, ASSUMPTION that to objectify

1062
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.449
is to cause harm, is to wish harm was

1063
00:55:02.449 --> 00:55:05.429
fundamentally wrong. I did not wish to cause harm.

1064
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:08.330
I wanted to make the pretty lady happy. I

1065
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.530
wanted to give her pleasure and hopefully be in

1066
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:13.050
the room and help. So I knew that their

1067
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:17.629
idea that desire is harmful. WAS wrong. Now, how

1068
00:55:17.629 --> 00:55:20.409
we act on desire, of course, can be harmful

1069
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.419
and is often unwanted and harmed, but the, the

1070
00:55:24.429 --> 00:55:26.469
energy itself, the fantasy is never wrong. There are

1071
00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:30.550
no wrong thoughts. There are wrong actions, and sometimes

1072
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.979
the wrong action is believing this thought. Right? The

1073
00:55:33.979 --> 00:55:36.300
thought that she's mine or I get to have

1074
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.620
this, or I must have this, or I don't

1075
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.889
care. That's a thought you had, and you're then

1076
00:55:41.889 --> 00:55:44.100
acting on it in a way that is harmful.

1077
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.979
So, the thoughts themselves are not harmful. Some of

1078
00:55:46.979 --> 00:55:49.889
them are not useful. So, if I have a

1079
00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:52.610
thought, and I hold it, and I just really

1080
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.649
think, Oh, this is, this is a thought, this

1081
00:55:54.649 --> 00:55:57.709
is a thought, I am perhaps going down a,

1082
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.679
a blind path that's going to hurt myself or

1083
00:55:59.679 --> 00:56:02.770
other people. Um, Buddhists talk about, you know, thoughts

1084
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.070
come and go like clouds on a windy day,

1085
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.449
or bubbles and popcorn. You think of popping corn.

1086
00:56:07.649 --> 00:56:11.179
Every popcorn is a thought pop, pop. So what

1087
00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:13.669
humans do is that that thought's real and that

1088
00:56:13.669 --> 00:56:18.080
thought's real, true, and that thought's true. Ignoring all

1089
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.449
the other thoughts that also popped up, right? This

1090
00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:22.290
thought, and then we take this, and this is

1091
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:24.169
my truth. I'm going to act on it, as

1092
00:56:24.169 --> 00:56:27.290
opposed to, wow, is this true? Is it a

1093
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:30.639
good idea? Do I really want this? We don't,

1094
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.800
we're not taught to question our desires. Except to

1095
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.989
shame myself for them. I shouldn't want that. We

1096
00:56:38.989 --> 00:56:42.540
want what we want. We want what we want.

1097
00:56:42.979 --> 00:56:45.659
How bad, well, how we feel about what we

1098
00:56:45.659 --> 00:56:49.179
want, depends on how far apart what we want

1099
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:55.949
is. From what we're taught. So if I'm normal.

1100
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.639
And I just want a single partner of the

1101
00:56:58.639 --> 00:57:00.919
opposite gender. I don't ever have to question my

1102
00:57:00.919 --> 00:57:04.520
sexuality because I'm normal, but the further away one

1103
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.070
is from what is normal, the more we have

1104
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.479
to question, right? So, I was bisexual and all

1105
00:57:08.479 --> 00:57:10.399
the things. Like, is that OK to be bisexual?

1106
00:57:10.429 --> 00:57:13.040
It's OK to be exhibitionistic. For me, it was

1107
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.320
OK to be exhibitionistic if I went to the

1108
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.070
place where it was safe to be exhibitionistic. So,

1109
00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.760
for me, stripping was very feminist. It was the

1110
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.780
place to go be naked for men to look

1111
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.889
at you. Not on the street where something could

1112
00:57:24.889 --> 00:57:27.570
happen, in a theater where there's bouncers, and they

1113
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.330
know they can't take you home, and they know

1114
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:31.729
they can't touch you. They're there to watch, and

1115
00:57:31.729 --> 00:57:33.770
I'm there to show. So, for me, not a

1116
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.889
club where people are drunk and going to, you

1117
00:57:36.889 --> 00:57:38.850
know, so let's, so let's say, I was full

1118
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:42.064
of shame. About my exhibitionism. Oh, I can't have

1119
00:57:42.064 --> 00:57:44.705
this. I'm such a bad girl. Oh, my God.

1120
00:57:44.915 --> 00:57:46.705
So I'll go to a bar, I loosen up

1121
00:57:46.705 --> 00:57:49.344
with some drinks, and now I'm having a good

1122
00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:52.225
time. I'm so pretty. And then something bad happens

1123
00:57:52.225 --> 00:57:55.445
to me, right? Um, BECAUSE I'm drunk in public,

1124
00:57:56.104 --> 00:57:57.824
because I'm showing off in public to other drunk

1125
00:57:57.824 --> 00:58:00.185
people. And then I, oh, see, I knew it.

1126
00:58:00.385 --> 00:58:03.205
I knew I couldn't have that. I'm so bad.

1127
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:07.290
Rather than, hmm, I like being naked. I don't

1128
00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:11.000
like drinking. A strip club for me, a strip

1129
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.560
club was the place to go. Nothing bad ever

1130
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.679
happened there. No guy ever got handy because they

1131
00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:18.100
knew that I'd had to, all a woman had

1132
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.399
to do is raise her hand. He'd be kicked

1133
00:58:19.399 --> 00:58:21.479
out and never let back in again. They did,

1134
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.080
they want to do that. They're gonna be very

1135
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.959
good boys. I never had a guy act weird

1136
00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:29.239
in a strip club, ever, not one time. But,

1137
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:29.469
but

1138
00:58:29.469 --> 00:58:32.219
you know, but you know something that I find

1139
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:36.659
quite funny about these sex negative feminists is that

1140
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.389
I mean feminism should be about treating, uh, women,

1141
00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:47.439
treating adult females as people that are capable of

1142
00:58:47.439 --> 00:58:53.050
making their own decisions, but. But but but but

1143
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.909
if, but you can in their mind you can

1144
00:58:55.909 --> 00:59:01.149
never consciously choose to be a sex worker. I

1145
00:59:01.149 --> 00:59:04.149
mean you, you can only do it under coercion

1146
00:59:04.149 --> 00:59:08.629
and, and, and then the, the their, the morality

1147
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:12.445
they have associated with. Sex, they try to impose

1148
00:59:12.445 --> 00:59:13.915
it on other women.

1149
00:59:13.955 --> 00:59:21.024
It's very Judeo-Christian, erotophobic, anti-female thinking. So the game

1150
00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:23.074
when you, when you start bending the horseshoe and

1151
00:59:23.074 --> 00:59:26.524
you get further, but eventually the extremes meet in

1152
00:59:26.524 --> 00:59:29.764
the middle because again, this is what I understand.

1153
00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:34.669
The sensation of extreme extremism. I really, really, really,

1154
00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:37.770
really, really believe this. That's an energy, right? Oh,

1155
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:45.639
injustice. What we apply that to is cultural. So

1156
00:59:45.639 --> 00:59:48.719
before they became radical feminists, they were raised in

1157
00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:50.919
such a way that they're deeply distrustful of sex

1158
00:59:50.919 --> 00:59:53.800
and sexuality. Maybe they were hurt. I don't, that

1159
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.199
didn't have to be that way. Um, MAYBE they're

1160
00:59:56.199 --> 00:59:59.330
closeted, you know, who knows, but they were raised

1161
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.840
in such a way that they have a lot

1162
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.100
of righteous anger and indignation. And I'm not saying

1163
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.280
that some of the more radical anti-porn feminists don't

1164
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.399
have a point about, uh, misogyny in the culture,

1165
01:00:10.639 --> 01:00:15.600
but the, the answer is not more. Um, AUTHORITARIANISM.

1166
01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:20.379
So authoritarians, no matter what ideology they espouse, are

1167
01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:23.219
coming from a place of I need control. I

1168
01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:25.379
don't like when things are not tidy. I want

1169
01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:27.419
everyone lined up. I don't like, I don't like

1170
01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:30.320
pink hair. I don't like, I, I need, I,

1171
01:00:30.379 --> 01:00:33.360
I need things to be clear. Now, the ideology

1172
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.629
I pick. To organize what I want, that is

1173
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.810
up for grabs depending on your culture and all

1174
01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:44.090
the things, but the feeling of, I really, really

1175
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.899
need things to be a certain way. Um, OR

1176
01:00:48.899 --> 01:00:56.439
I'm against injustice. You're, right? So. And people in

1177
01:00:56.439 --> 01:00:59.719
that emotional state cannot listen to reason because you

1178
01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:01.709
cannot be reasoned with in that state. You cannot,

1179
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.840
you cannot logic and emotion. You have to feel

1180
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.600
an emotion, acknowledge it, validate it, and hope you

1181
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.159
can work through it. Um, BUT in the heat

1182
01:01:11.159 --> 01:01:13.520
of the moment, in the heat of emotion, logic

1183
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.520
is not going to work. In the heat of

1184
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.439
sexual moment, in the heat of anger moment, in

1185
01:01:17.439 --> 01:01:21.479
the heat of righteous indignation moment, logic doesn't come

1186
01:01:21.479 --> 01:01:22.080
into play.

1187
01:01:22.989 --> 01:01:26.429
You know, I find it really funny and interesting

1188
01:01:26.429 --> 01:01:29.570
that there are people out there that are able

1189
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:35.570
to live for decades and they're still not able

1190
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.250
to process the idea, the thought that there are

1191
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:43.949
other people out there with different values that might

1192
01:01:43.949 --> 01:01:50.439
include having different attitudes towards sex. Welcome

1193
01:01:50.439 --> 01:01:51.120
to my world,

1194
01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:55.120
yeah. But for me it's just mind blowing. I

1195
01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.219
mean, how is it, how is it that you

1196
01:01:57.219 --> 01:01:59.360
can live for, I don't know, 40 years, 50

1197
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.760
years, 60 years, and not notice that.

1198
01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:07.560
The way we raise children, the way we. Conditioned

1199
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.860
children, we start very, very early. We make them

1200
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.600
very, very frightened of themselves. We, so a child,

1201
01:02:12.659 --> 01:02:14.600
a young child is completely at ease in their

1202
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.860
body. You look at a 23 year old person

1203
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.899
walking around outdoors without dying. He's, they're so happy.

1204
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.149
They're just free. They have no shame. Shame is

1205
01:02:23.149 --> 01:02:25.679
given to us, and that is the original sin.

1206
01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.419
The original sin is not that Eve sought, um.

1207
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:31.520
Uh, KNOWLEDGE, uh, although one feminist back in the

1208
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.280
70s says Eve was framed, right? So Adam took

1209
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.760
the bite because he was easily manipulated and then

1210
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.800
put the blame on Eve. So, again, all this

1211
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.639
is just stories made up years ago. So, the

1212
01:02:41.639 --> 01:02:44.719
Bible is not truth. The Bible is not literal

1213
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.840
truth. Um, SO, but when you, for whatever reason,

1214
01:02:48.879 --> 01:02:51.080
you have insecure attachment, you, you just, you're just

1215
01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.800
not OK with yourself, and you're always, you're just,

1216
01:02:53.879 --> 01:02:58.080
you're not. You aren't good with yourself, partly because

1217
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.929
of the way you're raised, attachment, abuse, mind fucking,

1218
01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:05.370
mind fuckery in the, you know, don't forget, uh,

1219
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.610
especially, uh, in American culture and Puritan culture, the

1220
01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:11.530
job of education is not to educate the child,

1221
01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.850
it is to break the child's will, to make

1222
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:18.199
it obedient. And when people have been broken to

1223
01:03:18.199 --> 01:03:23.120
be obedient, anybody, any sniff of disobedience is too

1224
01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.320
anxiety producing, they can't, they can't cope. And they

1225
01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.919
have to have things settled in. They have to

1226
01:03:29.919 --> 01:03:34.370
have things OK. And they don't care if it

1227
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.489
steps on me because I'm the one making them

1228
01:03:36.489 --> 01:03:37.389
uncomfortable.

1229
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.770
OK, so, uh, we have like 10 more minutes

1230
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:44.050
maximum. Let, let me just tell you this one

1231
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:48.370
anecdote from feminists here in Portugal, and then I

1232
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.439
will ask you just one final question. I mean,

1233
01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:53.409
10 years ago or so, there was a group

1234
01:03:53.409 --> 01:03:57.945
of feminist. Here they have a website and they

1235
01:03:57.945 --> 01:04:02.004
wrote posts there and there was this one post

1236
01:04:02.185 --> 01:04:05.905
that I mean I almost died laughing because this

1237
01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:11.870
one feminist claimed or told other women. That they

1238
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:15.719
shouldn't have sex with their male partners with the

1239
01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:25.169
lights on because they would be objectified. Oh my

1240
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.979
God, I mean, what, what do you think about

1241
01:04:27.979 --> 01:04:28.350
that?

1242
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.870
So they're, they're. From a purely logical point of

1243
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.870
view, if objectification is evil to you, um, from

1244
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:40.989
a purely logical point of view, yes, that makes

1245
01:04:40.989 --> 01:04:42.780
sense, but from a human point of view, it's,

1246
01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:47.840
it's laughable and ludicrous. Plus, all animals objectify. Any,

1247
01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:50.870
we could go back to Neanderthals, they had paint,

1248
01:04:50.989 --> 01:04:54.389
they had jewelry. As long as we know homonyms

1249
01:04:54.389 --> 01:04:57.310
and human and any kind of sapiens. They have

1250
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.750
painted themselves with mud. They have do their hair.

1251
01:05:01.399 --> 01:05:05.370
Every animal identifies. Why do birds, why do rams

1252
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:08.760
have big horns? Because chicks like it. Why do,

1253
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.550
you know, peacocks have those big tails? Because women

1254
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.719
like it. For most of the animal kingdom, um,

1255
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:20.800
uh, um, the males display. And the females choose.

1256
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.209
What do you think, Edna, that one? This one,

1257
01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:26.639
what do you think? So, the, the males are

1258
01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:29.570
out there bashing horns, flitting their tails, making a

1259
01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:33.010
bower, strutting, you know, just, you know, making it

1260
01:05:33.169 --> 01:05:37.590
and proving themselves fit for, for mating. Um, AND,

1261
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.989
and the females sit around and, and, and pick.

1262
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.969
Um, I would like to talk to a biologist

1263
01:05:42.969 --> 01:05:47.270
and find out how many, how many, um, animals.

1264
01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:51.100
Forcibly mate with females the way that we would

1265
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.540
consider as rape, elephant seals, um, dolphins have been

1266
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.020
known to, to gang up on a single female

1267
01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.659
and harass her. Um, BUT I don't know how

1268
01:05:59.659 --> 01:06:02.330
many other animals do that on the regular, right?

1269
01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:02.689
I'm,

1270
01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:03.840
I'm not

1271
01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:06.219
sure about if you don't know a biologist, please

1272
01:06:06.219 --> 01:06:07.179
put them in touch with me. I would love

1273
01:06:07.179 --> 01:06:11.169
to ask that question. Um, SO. And it is,

1274
01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:14.689
we objectify. I'm not going to walk across the

1275
01:06:14.689 --> 01:06:17.010
room to talk to you because your aura. I'm

1276
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:18.449
gonna say, oh, I like the cut of his

1277
01:06:18.449 --> 01:06:20.889
jib. I like his smile. He seems funny. I'm

1278
01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:24.139
gonna go talk to him. So, to say, um,

1279
01:06:24.459 --> 01:06:29.209
and This is really very controversial, but years ago,

1280
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.899
a woman, we were talking about this, you know,

1281
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.459
objectification bad, and she, and she was someone who

1282
01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:36.260
didn't get pretty until after high school. She's very

1283
01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.939
plain, and she goes, what about the pain of

1284
01:06:37.939 --> 01:06:40.340
someone who wants to be objectified, who would like

1285
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.219
a boy to notice her, but she wasn't considered

1286
01:06:42.219 --> 01:06:44.800
pretty enough. And then on top of everything else,

1287
01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:48.709
it's It's not very frustrating because, so it's one

1288
01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:50.629
thing to not, not, I don't want to fuck

1289
01:06:50.629 --> 01:06:51.969
you. I don't want to have sex with you.

1290
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.770
But then for a lot of people, often men,

1291
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.469
because I don't find you sexually attractive, that it

1292
01:06:57.469 --> 01:07:00.149
gives me permission to be mean to you. It

1293
01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.870
gives me permission to, to, to seek you out

1294
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.310
and be mean to you as opposed to just

1295
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:08.739
ignore you. What the fuck? As I saw it

1296
01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:10.939
the other day, if you're only, if you're only

1297
01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:12.939
pro-women to those you want to have sex with,

1298
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.409
you're not pro-woman. And that was, like, very, um,

1299
01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:20.020
telling. So, it's, it's not everyone's going to be

1300
01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.860
attracted to everyone. Of course not. But why on

1301
01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.780
earth? Because you don't find me attractive, then you

1302
01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.929
feel you get to be mean and shit on

1303
01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:33.649
me and call me names and, or worse. Yeah.

1304
01:07:34.469 --> 01:07:36.350
And that being said, I would also, when I

1305
01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:37.590
was in New York, I never lived in New

1306
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.669
York, so it wasn't all my life. But when

1307
01:07:39.669 --> 01:07:41.189
I would walk down the streets in New York

1308
01:07:41.189 --> 01:07:44.030
looking normal, not dressed up as Nina, and a

1309
01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.300
guy from a construction site would, you know, holler

1310
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.979
at me and go, hey, thanks, and keep walking.

1311
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.010
I never took it badly, you know, I'm just,

1312
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:53.989
you know, he didn't, I didn't stop. I didn't

1313
01:07:53.989 --> 01:07:56.020
give him my number, but I didn't go, fuck

1314
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.969
you. It's like, hey. So it's, it's very nuanced,

1315
01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:01.909
and it's very, and I have pretty privilege. I

1316
01:08:01.909 --> 01:08:05.639
know that. I'm a cis female. I am of

1317
01:08:05.639 --> 01:08:10.149
what's considered a good body shape. Um, uh, SO,

1318
01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:12.800
I, I recognize that a lot of the energy

1319
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.510
I've gotten from men, certainly, and also as Nina,

1320
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.759
because I'm a professional sex person, they're much more

1321
01:08:18.759 --> 01:08:22.500
respectful of me. They're terrified of me, right? If

1322
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.220
I was just a regular pretty girl, as a

1323
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.859
civilian pretty girl, I would, I might not feel

1324
01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:31.620
so protected, but Nina, they all, they, they all

1325
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.620
want to be with me, so they're not gonna

1326
01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.140
be mean to me. No, they're gonna try to,

1327
01:08:34.419 --> 01:08:38.169
try to, You know, make me interested in them.

1328
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:44.500
Um, SO, I think, hm. I think women should

1329
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.020
date in pairs, you know, again, I, I didn't,

1330
01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.540
I got into porn, so I wouldn't have to

1331
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.299
be alone with a strange man just to get

1332
01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:55.707
my sexual curiosity satisfied. Right? So, in, in pornography,

1333
01:08:56.328 --> 01:08:57.568
all we had to do, you show up at

1334
01:08:57.568 --> 01:08:59.249
work, I get to touch you. I get to

1335
01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:00.877
talk to you about sex. You get to talk

1336
01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:02.769
to me about sex. We get to decide what

1337
01:09:02.769 --> 01:09:04.929
are we doing? What do you hate? What do

1338
01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:08.167
you love? Got it. And I, I love the

1339
01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:11.358
clarity of that in our culture because slut shaming,

1340
01:09:11.528 --> 01:09:14.167
we can't be clear. I can't say, I'm horny,

1341
01:09:14.328 --> 01:09:17.048
you're cute. Let's go. 5 minutes, broom closet. What

1342
01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:20.279
do you say? And the scariest thing a woman

1343
01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.990
can do to a guy who's like, hey, baby,

1344
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.089
he's like, OK, sure. Come on, let's go. They

1345
01:09:26.089 --> 01:09:28.689
think their brains smell. They don't understand. I'm gonna

1346
01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:30.379
bring my girlfriend too. Ready for two of us,

1347
01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:36.459
uh, uh, uh. Right? So, so they depend on

1348
01:09:36.459 --> 01:09:38.180
us being scared of them. They depend on us

1349
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.540
being offended. It's like, yeah, of course you want

1350
01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.500
to fuck. Of course you want to be with

1351
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.379
me. I'm cute, and my girlfriend's cute too. Let's

1352
01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:48.299
go. Uh, YOU know, so, um, dating in pairs,

1353
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.459
dating and dating in numbers is, because I would

1354
01:09:50.459 --> 01:09:52.839
never be alone with a strange man after dark.

1355
01:09:53.419 --> 01:09:56.540
What? Because I know that's dangerous. And I don't

1356
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.379
have, you know, I'm on the spectrum. So I

1357
01:09:58.379 --> 01:10:01.129
really did not. I did not have good, you

1358
01:10:01.129 --> 01:10:04.689
know, nuanced understanding. So, I like porn, very straight

1359
01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:08.819
and ji. You're my partner, blowjob, intercourse repositions, Kunne

1360
01:10:08.819 --> 01:10:12.549
Lingus, done. Got it. Let's go. And so, um,

1361
01:10:12.729 --> 01:10:15.290
I've done 2000 scenes. I've only regretted 5 of

1362
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.100
them. Like, I should have called in sick that

1363
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:22.060
day, like, uh. So, but, but for me, it's

1364
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.149
very important, you know. Everything I do on camera,

1365
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:29.229
I like doing at home anyway, plus things I

1366
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.620
do at home that I don't put on camera.

1367
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:35.390
So, I was never going against my, many people

1368
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.790
who make pornography were raised in our culture and

1369
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:42.270
are full of shame and, and, and, and have

1370
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:46.629
issues around sex because they were taught much more

1371
01:10:46.629 --> 01:10:48.770
strictly than I was what it was for and

1372
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:50.950
hell and sin and damnation. I never got any

1373
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:55.779
hell sin, damnation. Gender-based teaching of any kind. It

1374
01:10:55.779 --> 01:10:58.060
was never boys this or girls this, nothing. So

1375
01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:03.950
I was left to discover myself. And it was

1376
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.459
a great, a great blessing my parents offered me,

1377
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:07.790
actually. I didn't like it for a number of

1378
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.479
years because I was actually, you know, rather abandoned

1379
01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:14.390
and neglected, but because I'm queer, I was also

1380
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:20.310
not indoctrinated by any, uh, deep cultural bullshit because

1381
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.189
they thought they were doing me a solid by,

1382
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:23.830
you know, making sure I went to church or

1383
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.509
anything like that. So, I'm grateful that they did

1384
01:11:25.509 --> 01:11:28.390
not. Um, TAKE me to church. And I'm grateful

1385
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:31.529
that they picked Buddhism as a religion because Buddhism

1386
01:11:31.979 --> 01:11:36.069
prohibits, um, proselytizing. So this, this is the 60s

1387
01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:39.790
and 70s in Berkeley, California. So, they could have

1388
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:43.350
picked Scientology, they could have picked, uh, something called

1389
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:46.750
ET earner seminar training. They could have picked Hare

1390
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:51.220
Krishna, all of which were very, um, Indoctrinating, meaning,

1391
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.390
you bring your kid into it. And they picked

1392
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:57.310
Buddhism, which is anti that. So, of all the

1393
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:00.209
religions my parents could have found to figure out

1394
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.430
what the fuck in their life, I'm glad they

1395
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:06.109
picked Zen because it was the, the, the best

1396
01:12:06.109 --> 01:12:06.770
of a bunch.

1397
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:11.629
Yeah, I mean, I guess that for these sort

1398
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:18.390
of sex negative feminists, if you objectify another person,

1399
01:12:18.509 --> 01:12:22.629
if you're attracted to another person's body, you should

1400
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:28.015
be, Put on level one of Dante's Inferno and

1401
01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:31.504
just I mean, which, which is actually quite fun,

1402
01:12:31.654 --> 01:12:33.895
let me tell you, because it's like being in

1403
01:12:33.895 --> 01:12:37.654
a tornado with your loved one for all eternity,

1404
01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:38.115
so.

1405
01:12:38.759 --> 01:12:42.149
So yeah, so the, the anti-sex, uh, Christian religious

1406
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:45.419
people, I don't agree, and the anti, the, the

1407
01:12:45.419 --> 01:12:48.359
anti-sex or sex negative feminists, I don't agree, because

1408
01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:52.680
they are philosophically and energetically, the, the, the anti-sex

1409
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.279
Christians and the anti-sex feminists are very, are very

1410
01:12:55.279 --> 01:12:58.140
close because take away the words, so go, again,

1411
01:12:58.839 --> 01:13:02.500
before words, before ideology, there's energy. And so you,

1412
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.379
you tape up their mouth and they can't spew

1413
01:13:05.379 --> 01:13:09.129
their hate. You can feel their deep discomfort, their

1414
01:13:09.129 --> 01:13:11.459
deep pain. They, they're in great amount of pain.

1415
01:13:11.569 --> 01:13:14.700
They are, they are isolated from themselves. They don't

1416
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.100
know how to make connection with other people, and

1417
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.620
they're, and, and it's painful. And so, again, which

1418
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:24.339
ideology they choose to spew depends on the individual

1419
01:13:24.339 --> 01:13:27.700
person, but what is being expressed is a great

1420
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:32.049
deal of pain and terror. Abs abject terror um

1421
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.390
of Terror.

1422
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:38.270
Oh, OK. So let me just ask you one

1423
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:41.310
last question then because we've already talked about porn,

1424
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:45.310
sex education, feminism. Let me try to, or let

1425
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:47.750
me see if there's also a link here between

1426
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:51.600
your attitudes towards sex and the fact that You

1427
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.830
are a nurse as well and worked in healthcare.

1428
01:13:54.879 --> 01:13:58.640
I mean, do you think that sex should be

1429
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.709
considered a part of healthcare?

1430
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.169
Of course, absolutely, 100%. 1st, we start with um

1431
01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:08.660
always age appropriate sex education. Um, AND again, this

1432
01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.089
is what the right wing is trying to kill

1433
01:14:10.089 --> 01:14:13.209
and successfully killed. Um, America is the only industrialized

1434
01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:16.520
country that does not have a standardized teaching curriculum

1435
01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.029
for every class and every age. So in Japan,

1436
01:14:19.529 --> 01:14:22.689
a child goes from grade level 6 and moves

1437
01:14:22.689 --> 01:14:24.209
in the middle of the year to a different

1438
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.290
school. He's gonna be able to step into the

1439
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:28.089
class and know where he's at and what he's

1440
01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.569
doing cause level 6 learns this, level 7 learns

1441
01:14:30.569 --> 01:14:34.899
this, and in America, Um, every school district gets

1442
01:14:34.899 --> 01:14:37.580
to pick what it wants, and then even worse,

1443
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.069
every school district is locally funded. So, in which

1444
01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:45.129
neighborhoods have better schools and better paid teachers. So

1445
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:47.830
there's no, there's no federal standard for teacher pay.

1446
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:51.660
There's no federal standard in America for curriculum, and

1447
01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:55.549
there's no standard for any kind of health education.

1448
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:58.310
And even the ones that do offer it. Children

1449
01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:00.270
can be, can opt out if their parents think

1450
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:02.589
it's not right. It's the parents' job to teach

1451
01:15:02.589 --> 01:15:04.990
a child about sex, but you're not doing it.

1452
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.310
And that's you get all these pregnant 1314, 15

1453
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:10.609
year olds, you know, um, the father may be

1454
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:16.759
1314, or 15, or 1819, 20, the pastor. Don't

1455
01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:21.100
get me started. Um, SO, the hypocrisy, um, is,

1456
01:15:21.109 --> 01:15:26.189
is, is bright and shining. And they don't see

1457
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:29.520
it because, again, it's too painful to, it's too

1458
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.009
painful to confront. They're keeping, they're keeping the boogeymen

1459
01:15:32.009 --> 01:15:35.720
at bay, and they are ensuring generational trauma is

1460
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.370
passed down, right? Um, uh, Which is how it

1461
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:44.009
works, and there's wonderful work on generational trauma that

1462
01:15:44.009 --> 01:15:46.649
we can, you know, uh, and not just sex

1463
01:15:46.649 --> 01:15:48.609
abuse, but of course, racial abuse and religious abuse.

1464
01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:50.729
So it, it, it just, it, it lasts and

1465
01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:54.810
lasts and lasts. And now we've had 3000 years

1466
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:58.729
of anti-female propaganda that is baked into every law,

1467
01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:03.000
every attitude, every religious text in the West, um,

1468
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:09.120
a, a fundamental mistrust. Of, of women. Um, YOU

1469
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.040
know, back in the day, if a man, a

1470
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.959
man could accuse a woman of witchcraft if he

1471
01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:14.839
desired her because he was taught by his church

1472
01:16:14.839 --> 01:16:17.120
that desire is of the devil. So if I

1473
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.680
feel desire for her, she must be of the

1474
01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.270
devil because she is tempting me. All the things.

1475
01:16:21.319 --> 01:16:23.799
I mean, I, I'm not saying anything new here.

1476
01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:28.500
Woman's virtue is man's greatest invention. I don't sound

1477
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.970
like the the Oscar Wilde would say, but the

1478
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:34.500
idea, so if women, if women are powerless, why

1479
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.259
do they need to be controlled so much? No,

1480
01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:40.740
women are very powerful. And, um, again, and we

1481
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.080
have what men want. We have, obviously, we have

1482
01:16:45.029 --> 01:16:48.350
Sex, we have, you know, female bodies, and we

1483
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.009
also, of course, are the bearers of, of life.

1484
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:54.629
Um, AND that just confounds a lot of men

1485
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:56.740
and terrifies them. So they do need to control

1486
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.229
us because it's the one thing they can't do

1487
01:16:58.229 --> 01:17:01.629
is make more, right? And in terms of, you

1488
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:04.229
know, maintaining the population, we could, and I don't,

1489
01:17:04.299 --> 01:17:06.379
I don't recommend this. I'm not advocating for this,

1490
01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.750
but we could lose 70% of the male population

1491
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.439
in the world and be fine. In terms of

1492
01:17:11.439 --> 01:17:14.080
enough men to keep populating and make sure no

1493
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.620
one's marrying a cousin. So, if It is The

1494
01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.060
avenues to be considered a real man are just

1495
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.540
changing so much, it's really scary to people who

1496
01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.100
are very rigid in their thinking, and extremists are

1497
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.620
rigid in their thinking, whether they believe in leftist

1498
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:37.709
ideology or right-wing ideology. Extremists are very They're very

1499
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:39.689
controlled, and they can't, they'll break. They're, they're, they're,

1500
01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:45.089
they're rigid, they are brittle, and they're fragile. And

1501
01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:47.169
they're also very dangerous because they still hold most

1502
01:17:47.169 --> 01:17:50.060
of the levers of power in this country. And

1503
01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.080
most of the world, and we see it happening

1504
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.060
all over, you know, our current president making You

1505
01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.379
live in Europe. I don't got to tell you

1506
01:17:58.379 --> 01:18:00.149
nothing about what's going on.

1507
01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.580
Uh, I mean, uh, you know, another thing that

1508
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.779
you should try in America, social democracy. I mean,

1509
01:18:07.859 --> 01:18:10.740
it, it, it, it, it works here. You can,

1510
01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:13.100
you can, you, you can trust us, it works.

1511
01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.819
I mean, it's not like, it's not like, oh

1512
01:18:15.819 --> 01:18:19.020
my God, you will turn it in Venezuela or

1513
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.500
North Korea. No,

1514
01:18:20.939 --> 01:18:23.419
no, I'm, I'm a democratic socialist. Some things should

1515
01:18:23.419 --> 01:18:26.040
be locally controlled, some things should be nationally controlled.

1516
01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:32.439
Um, BUT again, the, the particularly Puritan Calvinistic view

1517
01:18:32.439 --> 01:18:36.740
is that they are deserving and undeserving people. And

1518
01:18:37.359 --> 01:18:41.560
the idea that your more means my less, right?

1519
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.359
They don't think the pie can get bigger. So

1520
01:18:43.359 --> 01:18:46.629
if you get more, I get less, and you

1521
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:48.919
don't get no. And so again, that 2 year

1522
01:18:48.919 --> 01:18:51.560
old, mine, mine, this is mine. You don't get

1523
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.509
to have any of it. No. But they make

1524
01:18:54.509 --> 01:18:57.939
policy. We have a bunch of 2 and 3

1525
01:18:57.939 --> 01:19:01.140
year olds running the country making policy, and it

1526
01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:04.879
is. It is heartbreaking and the, and the damage

1527
01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:08.120
being done, the damage, certainly damage of America's standing

1528
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.279
worldwide is in the toilet, um, and was for

1529
01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.799
good reason, and then the damage, we saw 3

1530
01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:17.580
more years of this situation. And so the damage.

1531
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.220
But he's just a figurehead. The powers behind our

1532
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.890
president have been working for years and years and

1533
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:27.310
years, so they want, they want to take over

1534
01:19:28.049 --> 01:19:30.009
energy, they want to take over education, they want

1535
01:19:30.009 --> 01:19:31.689
to take over healthcare, they want to take, they

1536
01:19:31.689 --> 01:19:34.209
want to take over all the, all the pillars

1537
01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:36.810
of the culture and mold it into their shape,

1538
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.930
which is very retrograde, women in the house, all

1539
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:42.950
the things. And But you can't do that with

1540
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:48.169
350 million people who have 500 million guns between

1541
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:50.189
them. So I don't know what's going to happen.

1542
01:19:51.379 --> 01:19:53.979
I have no, I have no crystal ball, um,

1543
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.379
but I do know that it is serious. We're

1544
01:19:57.379 --> 01:20:01.140
in a serious situation. And so, but porn, man.

1545
01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:04.140
For me, it was a way to get my

1546
01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.100
message out there on somebody else's dime. So, if

1547
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:12.290
I think about myself, um, Uh You know, I

1548
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:15.470
look very straight, but I'm actually quite queer. So,

1549
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:17.209
all my movies have a little, a little bit

1550
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:19.970
of queer there all the, all the time, how

1551
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:22.979
I treat women on camera. Um, BUT I also,

1552
01:20:23.089 --> 01:20:26.470
I'm a bit of 1/5 columnist. Um, CAUSE I

1553
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:28.990
knew that images are very important. So, here's the

1554
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.509
most, here's the most radical thing about pornography. It

1555
01:20:31.509 --> 01:20:35.350
is juvenile, American commercial pornography. It is juvenile, it

1556
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:38.189
is shallow, it is sexist, it is racist, it

1557
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:43.549
is stupid. But women don't die. So the fantasy,

1558
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:46.189
male fantasy is she wants it, that's not a

1559
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:48.950
bad thing. She, and then what happens in pornography,

1560
01:20:49.109 --> 01:20:53.419
she has amazing adventures, crazy experiences, lots of orgasms,

1561
01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:59.810
and lives. She lives. Every time in American media

1562
01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:04.109
up until the 1960s, if a woman transgressed, she

1563
01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:07.450
had to die, go crazy, lose her family, her

1564
01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:10.490
man, her child, her freedom. She had to be

1565
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:13.609
punished somehow for crossing whatever line the movie she

1566
01:21:13.609 --> 01:21:17.169
crossed, right, sexual line, cultural line. Whatever. She had

1567
01:21:17.169 --> 01:21:19.029
to be punished, had to be, and now, in,

1568
01:21:19.169 --> 01:21:21.520
in porn, so if porn is male fantasy. So,

1569
01:21:21.529 --> 01:21:24.330
in porn is male fantasy, sex is easy. She

1570
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.850
wants it, she's horny, and she lets you know

1571
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:27.729
that she wants it. In real life, sex for

1572
01:21:27.729 --> 01:21:31.209
men is very difficult. You know, because we're not

1573
01:21:31.209 --> 01:21:32.770
told to tell you what we want because you'll

1574
01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:34.970
have your feelings hurt or be a slut, or

1575
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:36.770
I can't, I can't admit that I want that

1576
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:38.770
because what does that say about me. So, in

1577
01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.490
porn, all the bullshit is stripped away. She's horny,

1578
01:21:41.609 --> 01:21:46.209
you're here, let's go. And she doesn't die. For

1579
01:21:46.209 --> 01:21:48.100
all the, and there's plenty of porn that I

1580
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.669
find visually and energetically unappealing and not nice. But

1581
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:55.649
the vast majority, I'm gonna say 90% of the

1582
01:21:55.649 --> 01:21:58.649
porn out there is just silly, stupid fun where

1583
01:21:58.649 --> 01:22:05.299
she lives. Go figure, to have sex another day.

1584
01:22:07.209 --> 01:22:09.629
Get out of town. And it's actually quite radical.

1585
01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:13.700
Yeah. Well, look, uh, uh, anyway,

1586
01:22:14.319 --> 01:22:15.959
even we can do this again another time if

1587
01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:17.560
you ever want to do a part two, I'm

1588
01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.299
always down for this conversation. Oh,

1589
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.049
OK, awesome. I was going to suggest that also

1590
01:22:23.049 --> 01:22:25.450
because after you read this book,

1591
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.109
I can't wait.

1592
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.319
I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm going to send you.

1593
01:22:30.395 --> 01:22:32.794
Uh, THE title and the author, and then we

1594
01:22:32.794 --> 01:22:35.714
will have to, to talk about this, but I

1595
01:22:35.714 --> 01:22:38.754
mean, just to say that I, even with all

1596
01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:41.555
the issues with the porn industry and all of

1597
01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:44.705
that, I'm very appreciative and have been for a

1598
01:22:44.705 --> 01:22:47.984
long while of your body of work, pun intended,

1599
01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:52.649
