bit nervous because I, I, I thought, uh, like,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.650
I, I mean, come on, I'm going to talk

27
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.349
to a legend. I have to come up with

28
00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:27.629
some pretty good questions, but let, let's see how

29
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.669
this goes. So, sure,

30
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.574

00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:33.995
about me, I'm very easygoing, you know, believe it

32
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:35.894
or not, I'm, I'm pretty like laid back, so

33
00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:38.415
I mean, we're, we're gonna have fun regardless.

34
00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.574
Oh yeah, no, that's for sure. So I, I

35
00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:45.775
mean, walk us all the way back to basically

36
00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:52.375
your origin story in the adult film entertainment business,

37
00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.294
let's call it that way. I mean, uh, what

38
00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:58.355
got you into porn, basically?

39
00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.610
OK, well, um, you know, it's funny because like

40
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.989
I've, I've always explained, you know, I, I was

41
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.010
growing up as a child, I was, uh, sex

42
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.089
was never frowned upon, um, so I, I've always

43
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.690
had a wonderful, uh, open mind about sex, and

44
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.970
I was very comfortable with sex and sexuality, and

45
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.529
I was never confused or embarrassed or ashamed. So,

46
00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.479
um, I've always been, I've always admired sex, sex

47
00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:33.279
industry as a whole, you know, regardless, um. What

48
00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.089
happened was I, I was, uh, an escort. I,

49
00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.039
I, I worked backwards. I was an escort, stripper,

50
00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.710
then I got into adult films.

51
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.009
Oh, OK. So in terms of sex work, you

52
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.869
started as an escort, is that it? Yes,

53
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.470
yes, actually, I started out as a phone girl

54
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.289
back in the day. There, there were phone girls

55
00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.929
for escort services, and I was very promiscuous as

56
00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:00.850
a young girl, of course, very experimental, very sexual,

57
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.279
sexually driven. And um I met a lady. I,

58
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.279
I was uh working at a handbag store at

59
00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.880
the time, like a very high-end retail, uh, luxurious

60
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.960
handbag store in, in a hotel, Bally's at the

61
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.149
time. And, um, the, the lady that I was

62
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.160
working with goes, you know what, she, she would

63
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.320
tell me her story that she was an escort,

64
00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.720
um, uh, you know, many years ago, and she

65
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.300
goes, you know, you have a lot of sex.

66
00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.029
Like you should get paid for it. I'm like,

67
00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.470
good idea. Like, great idea, you know. But so

68
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.979
anyway, fast forward, so, so I was introduced to

69
00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.860
that life, right? Um, AND not by force. I

70
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.699
wasn't on heavy drugs. I wasn't, you know, nobody

71
00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.610
coaxed me into it. It was my own free

72
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.429
will. I very much enjoyed, like I said, it's

73
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.270
sexuality and uh profiting from it. So it's like,

74
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.070
oh my God, this is my calling. So fast

75
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.429
forward, uh, you know what, I'm, I'm 28. I'm

76
00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.800
in this strip club, and, uh, where was it?

77
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.309
Uh, SO, so this girl's like, you know, you

78
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.550
should do porn, and I'm like, really? But I

79
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.589
was so nervous that um I, I, I, I

80
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.710
was very insecure, so I'm like very scared of

81
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.015
like being on TV and The way I look

82
00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:19.135
and my body and you know whatever you know,

83
00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.415
so, so I had, I had a few hangups,

84
00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:26.454
but um for some reason I really wanted to

85
00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:28.834
and uh I met somebody that was like, OK,

86
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.894
I'm gonna introduce you to someone that knows he,

87
00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:35.654
he worked for Penthouse and he knows, uh, Hannah

88
00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:38.975
Harper and Derek Hay of LA Direct Models, and

89
00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:40.894
I can, he's like, I can introduce you to

90
00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:45.359
this company and you can become trip porn. So

91
00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:48.029
anyway, so I, I, before I did that, I,

92
00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.179
I met someone, some girl in the strip club,

93
00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:53.359
and she introduced me to, uh, Mr. Chris, who

94
00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:56.670
is a filthy first-timers of Evil Angel, I think,

95
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.809
or Elegant Angel. I think Evil Angel. And I,

96
00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.480
I did my first porn scene in Vegas with

97
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.019
Mr. Chris, and his wife at the time was

98
00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.779
shooting our video, which I was OK about. I'm

99
00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.260
like, All right, girl, like make sure you get

100
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.179
my best side, like, what, well, I fuck your

101
00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.959
husband, you know, but, um, so, uh, you know,

102
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.820
I just, I just had a lot of fun

103
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.750
with it, and I was like, wow. How great

104
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.429
is it that I can like totally sexually express

105
00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:29.670
myself on camera in, in an environment that's safe

106
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.429
and sound. We have testing, you know, we have,

107
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.190
we have tests, so I can have bareback sex.

108
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.420
Um, WE'RE in a confined area where there's a

109
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.230
camera person, so nobody's, you know, that everyone's on

110
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.899
board. We're, we're all consensual. I was like, oh

111
00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:46.529
my God, this is fun. I, I, it was

112
00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:47.920
a very long, like I was like, oh my

113
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.640
God, I gotta do a cowgirl position for like,

114
00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.049
how, how many more minutes? Like, you know. So,

115
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.149
but other, other than that, I did love the

116
00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:02.200
sexual expression and be and being able to uh

117
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.010
just like tap into like my inner slut self

118
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.929
and have it recorded, so.

119
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.910
Yeah, I, I, I mean, let, let me ask

120
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.670
you then, what did you like doing or what

121
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.869
do you like doing the most? Is it escorting?

122
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.630
Is it porn or something else?

123
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.709
You know, I, I mean, I, I will, I'm

124
00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:26.309
gonna happily say every, everything brings everything, every service

125
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.630
brings something different to the table. So, you know,

126
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.829
sometimes when I'm like, oh, I'm gonna see a,

127
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.350
a fan privately, and then I'm like, oh, I'm

128
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.109
not in the mood or whatever, but then the

129
00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:41.010
minute I get there. And, and our energies combine

130
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.649
and, and we gel as a, as, you know,

131
00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:47.779
sexual partners, like it's so much fun, you know,

132
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.170
or I do an adult, adult film, uh, a

133
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.809
movie, right, a scene, right? Oh God, I'm, I'm

134
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.730
very nervous. I'm very nervous. I'm always nervous. So

135
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.029
I'm like, oh my God, I'm, you know, I'm

136
00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:00.470
petrified, whatever. And then I get on set and

137
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.350
like I see the performers and and the camera

138
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.109
when we're taking pictures, the makeup artists, whatever. Then

139
00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:07.989
I get very relaxed and then I get into

140
00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:11.149
my zone, you know, so it's like stripping, you

141
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.359
hear the music, you're with your friends, you're whatever,

142
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.350
like it all, it, it all brings something spectacular

143
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.929
to the table in in all different ways. So

144
00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:21.049
I love it all.

145
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:27.450
So you started doing porn around what, 2003, somewhere

146
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.070
around that, yeah, OK, 2003, so, so 22 years.

147
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.369
I imagine that over those 22 years, over the

148
00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:37.690
past, this past 22 years, you've seen many people

149
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.084
coming and coming. And exiting, coming into and exiting

150
00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:45.535
the sex industry, I mean, what, looking back at

151
00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:49.524
all those people and thinking about yourself, what do

152
00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:53.445
you think are perhaps the traits that make uh

153
00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:57.364
a female successful in the sex industry?

154
00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:01.929
You know, I mean, I, I really don't know.

155
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.720
I, I mean, for me, I can only speak

156
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.799
for myself, you know, for me, I, I have

157
00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:11.760
to be, uh, coherent and sober. I have to

158
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.500
be, uh, comfortable in my own skin. And I

159
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.380
have to enjoy sex. So, like, that, that, that's

160
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.170
what works for me. I don't, I can't speak

161
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.739
for other people and their success. I don't know.

162
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.700
Maybe they suck the right dick. I don't know.

163
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.899
Maybe they, they're just that star quality. I've no

164
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:33.130
clue. But for me, Miss Ava Devine, I had

165
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.900
to come to a place where I had to

166
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.179
get sober, because I like to drink and jog,

167
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.739
and unfortunately, that skews my, my mind, body, and

168
00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:46.659
spirit. And, and it, it just, I don't, for

169
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.590
me, like I had to get that out of

170
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.859
my system. And then I'm able to learn to

171
00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:56.479
be comfortable in my own body, my skin. Like,

172
00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:00.739
if I'm heavier, thinner, bigger boobs, smaller boobs, whatever.

173
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.179
Like I gotta be comfortable in my skin. And

174
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.190
then also, I have to really enjoy sex, which

175
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.690
I do. So, so when, when it became, when

176
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.969
it was becoming a little bit robotic for me,

177
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.510
that's when I had to like take a break.

178
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.400
OK, so look, uh, uh, in my conversation with

179
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.710
Marcella, I suggest that at least one trait for,

180
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.159
uh, porn actresses and uh escorts is good to

181
00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.359
have because they have lots of sex with different

182
00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:36.429
people. Uh, I mean, I guess that it is

183
00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:39.460
more comfortable for women, at least if they are

184
00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:43.710
or if they score higher on sociosexuality, that is,

185
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.135
they are. More interested in having sex with more

186
00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:52.135
people, even people they are not attached to, and

187
00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:56.734
they don't need that sort of more emotional side,

188
00:09:56.854 --> 00:10:00.734
more attachment side of things to have sex with

189
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.135
someone. I mean, do you agree with that, or?

190
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:06.655
I mean, honestly, for, for me, I really feel

191
00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:08.775
like I do have to have some kind of

192
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.674
emotional connection with, with, with whoever because guess what.

193
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.859
It's, I'm, I like, I don't wanna be robotic.

194
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.859
If I'm robotic, I need to stop and like

195
00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:22.130
step away. I don't wanna be, it's not like

196
00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:24.950
it's not, I'm not, I'm not just here to

197
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.010
bounce. Like anybody can bounce, right? But what, what

198
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.969
do you do? What's behind that bouncing? I wanna,

199
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.049
I wanna get in your brain, I, which, which,

200
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.090
right? I wanna get in your brain. I wanna

201
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.450
talk about fetishes. I wanna talk about what turns

202
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.330
on, what your turn-ons are, and, right? And then

203
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.409
that ties into emotional, right? Because guess what? Now

204
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:50.109
we're emotional. I'm on the same wavelength as you.

205
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.510
I'm not, I'm not coming from a higher up

206
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.650
angle or a lower end angle, right? I, I'm

207
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.849
like, I'm meeting you right there. We're, we're locking

208
00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:02.809
eyes. We're locking souls. We're lacking sexual kindred spirits

209
00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:05.409
right now. Regardless if we love each other or

210
00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:08.280
not. Like, it, it. Cause, cause for me, sex

211
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.299
is way more than just the physical bouncing penetration.

212
00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:15.950
It's way more. There, there's so many layers and

213
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.640
depth of sex and dimensions that I have to

214
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.489
touch to be successful in the bedroom.

215
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.859
Yeah. Uh, LET, let me ask you another thing.

216
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.349
I'm really curious about this because over time, I

217
00:11:31.349 --> 00:11:34.229
mean, first in the 90s, I guess that when

218
00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:37.260
you got into porn uh in the early 2000s,

219
00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:40.559
I mean, VHS cassettes were no longer a thing,

220
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.750
like we were into DVDs. So uh when you

221
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.685
went through the porn industry. It was, uh, there

222
00:11:46.685 --> 00:11:49.366
were still DVDs being sold, and then

223
00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:52.135
I believe some VHS too, I believe. Oh, OK,

224
00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:54.445
I believe it was called box covers at the

225
00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:56.325
time. We had to make the box cover,

226
00:11:57.085 --> 00:11:59.505
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I know about that

227
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:02.046
thing about the box cover. I've ordered it from

228
00:12:02.046 --> 00:12:05.726
other, from other porn actresses, so, uh, but I

229
00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:09.502
mean DVD. Or VHS and then it it became

230
00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:13.921
more and more progressively more online, right, online business

231
00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:16.981
and now you also have OnlyFans and other platforms.

232
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:20.992
So uh across all of those kinds of mediums,

233
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.661
which of them do you think is the one

234
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:27.861
that best serves, uh, the performers?

235
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.849
I really feel that, uh, OnlyFans has really, for

236
00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:34.840
me, like I said, I'm gonna speak for myself,

237
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.150
uh, it helped my career tremendously, where I'm able

238
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.179
to connect with my fans on a much Intimate

239
00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:48.479
basis, but also the, the bonuses, right? I, I

240
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:51.840
feel like OnlyFans came about and then it, now

241
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.599
it, it, it changed the porn game for it

242
00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:58.359
being about the creators, the providers, the porn, the

243
00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:01.359
talent, right? It's, it's, I don't have to kiss

244
00:13:01.359 --> 00:13:04.400
naughty America's ass or browser's ass because guess what?

245
00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:08.320
I could shoot with whoever, and, and then, and

246
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.919
then guess what? I'm getting all the money for

247
00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:15.599
the content. Right? Granted, browsers Naughty America has much

248
00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:19.710
better marketing skills than my little Instagram page, right?

249
00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:24.020
But It, they, they both help each other out.

250
00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:27.080
All I'm saying is, but OnlyFans for me is,

251
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.299
has really uplifted my intimate connection with my fans

252
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:34.739
and also my career for myself. It, it's for

253
00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:36.969
me. If I want to shoot at 8:00 p.m.

254
00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:39.880
or 2 p.m. and hire my own makeup. Makeup

255
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.489
artist and work with the talents that I wanna

256
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.789
choose and maybe do anal triple anal. I could

257
00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:47.169
do it. I could book it. I don't gotta

258
00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:50.169
wait. Oh, I hope, uh, Dog Fart hires me

259
00:13:50.169 --> 00:13:52.049
for that BBC gang bang because guess what? I'm

260
00:13:52.049 --> 00:13:55.760
gonna call all these guys, all these BBC people,

261
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.270
and like, hey, let's collab.

262
00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:00.770
Yeah, look, uh, uh, as I was telling you

263
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.969
before we start the recording, I mean, not this

264
00:14:02.969 --> 00:14:05.619
bit that I'm going to mention now, but, uh,

265
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.890
like, uh, 1520 years ago when I was an

266
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.950
adolescent, I mean, it was very much, uh, about

267
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.984
not the not the America, a reality. The Kings

268
00:14:17.984 --> 00:14:22.525
razors, so that those were, those were the places

269
00:14:22.525 --> 00:14:25.864
where the big players were on

270
00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.164
for sure, for sure, like, like being hired for

271
00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:30.304
Vivid or whatever, like you're like, oh my God,

272
00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:33.325
that's, which I never was, but like it, it's

273
00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:36.809
a big deal, right? And now it's like. Not

274
00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.489
really. Not anymore. I mean, it could be. I'm

275
00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:42.530
not, I'm not discounting that whatsoever, but, uh, for

276
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.729
me, once again, I'm speaking for myself, I'm not

277
00:14:45.729 --> 00:14:50.169
beholden to these bigger companies to get validation or

278
00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:51.309
to get recognition.

279
00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:55.320
Even with the contract, I mean, even people who

280
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.640
get contracts with browsers or other, another company, I

281
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.299
mean, is that not good enough?

282
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.760
I mean it's great. I think it's, it's, it's

283
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.479
a great opportunity for them, but for me I

284
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:09.359
never have, and so I don't know that that

285
00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:12.200
avenue. But, but for me I enjoy having my

286
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.559
own free will and being able to do whatever

287
00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.880
I want, you know, that, that's the bonus of

288
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.619
it. Like I said, I'm not beholden. Oh please,

289
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.799
please, oh please, I'll do whatever it takes to

290
00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.880
be browsing, you know, whatever. Like I don't, I

291
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.159
don't, thank God it doesn't, it's not like that

292
00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:31.250
anymore for me. But, but, but I, I, I'm

293
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.159
not, I'm not putting down any company. I think

294
00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.809
it's great. I would love to work. I, I'm

295
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.090
with a porn agent, so I could work with

296
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.320
browsers, Naughty America, all these different companies. I love

297
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.090
them all. I'm just saying the game has changed

298
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.349
for me since OnlyFans is relevant.

299
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.280
OK, so with 22 years of experience, what would

300
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.479
you say are the pros and cons of doing

301
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:53.900
porn?

302
00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:57.409
Oh God, I mean, there's so many pros. There,

303
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.520
there, uh, I mean, there's more pros than cons,

304
00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:02.049
way more for me. Pros is, I mean, I

305
00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:05.130
get to sexually express myself in a safe environment,

306
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.250
um, with people who care that people are on

307
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.090
the same page, uh, people that get tested regularly,

308
00:16:12.169 --> 00:16:16.210
responsibly. Um, IF it gets too rough, I could

309
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.609
always say, stop, you know, code word, whatever, and,

310
00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:25.409
and we can pause. Um, If there's any accidents,

311
00:16:25.489 --> 00:16:27.570
people are like, oh, it's normal. Like, it's like,

312
00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.179
you know, and I'm not, oh my God, how

313
00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:31.330
embarrassing. Is he gonna call me back tomorrow? What,

314
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:33.650
you know, like, or she, or whatever, like, it's,

315
00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:36.750
it's all like we're all, um, it's all uh

316
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.979
uh a team effort. Versus versus personal life. So,

317
00:16:41.989 --> 00:16:43.429
yeah, that's definitely a pro.

318
00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:47.200
And I mean, how do you look at um

319
00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.580
porn in society? I mean, because there are many

320
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.739
people, of course, you're aware of this, everyone is

321
00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:55.960
aware of this. There are many people out there

322
00:16:56.179 --> 00:17:00.330
with a more conservative kind of mentality that are

323
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.840
against porn and against sex work in general, and

324
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.689
they say that porn and sex work are only

325
00:17:07.824 --> 00:17:11.135
Harmful to society and so on, but what would

326
00:17:11.135 --> 00:17:13.574
you say are the benefits of porn

327
00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:17.015
for? Well, I mean, there, there's benefits of porn

328
00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:20.005
in society is, uh, uh, freedom and, and sexual

329
00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:23.334
expression. I mean, anything is bad to society, eating

330
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.655
too much food, drinking too much alcohol, you know,

331
00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:29.375
I mean, anything is shopping, gambling, like, like what

332
00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:32.491
isn't, right? That that's all. Subjective, right? That's all

333
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.891
subjective of what is bad for society and what

334
00:17:34.891 --> 00:17:39.281
isn't, because I can't help you that you ruin

335
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:41.972
your life or your marriage or whatever because you

336
00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:45.411
are addicted to a certain whatever, right? That's not,

337
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.291
that's not my problem. Nobody put a gun to

338
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:51.332
your head and said, consumer, abuse, abuse, abuse. That's

339
00:17:51.332 --> 00:17:54.729
on you, right? That, that's on the consumer. So

340
00:17:54.729 --> 00:17:56.969
I mean, is it bad or is it, is

341
00:17:56.969 --> 00:17:58.969
it a danger to society? I think not. I,

342
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.239
I mean, like I said, it's all subjective, drinking

343
00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:04.859
too much alcohol, eating too much food, eating too

344
00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:08.650
much sugar, eating too much cookies. Like what, what

345
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.609
isn't harmful to society, right? That's a, that's an

346
00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:15.449
individual, uh, thing for someone to decide, right? But

347
00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:17.969
as a whole, as a whole, no, I mean,

348
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.410
It's, it's just all about sexual expression, and the

349
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.170
wonderful thing is, is that today's society, there's not

350
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.489
a specific body type. Like years ago when I

351
00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:33.089
was growing up, you know, it was very Pamela

352
00:18:33.089 --> 00:18:37.170
Anderson, tits on a stick, blonde Caucasian women, right?

353
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.250
That, that's what I was in my era, that

354
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.359
was popular in the early 2000s and 1990s, right?

355
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.890
Today, now, everybody's different, all walks of life, all

356
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.699
different walks of body. There's no specific body type.

357
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.250
More curvaceous, right? More curvaceous, but, but that's great,

358
00:18:55.329 --> 00:18:58.199
right? Or, or not, you know, I mean, it

359
00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:00.849
doesn't really matter. I just think in today's society,

360
00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:06.295
there's no stereotypical. Look for porn, porn stars. Like

361
00:19:06.295 --> 00:19:09.974
I think we all have our own uh look

362
00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:12.155
and, and I feel like it's, it's, you know,

363
00:19:12.295 --> 00:19:15.814
all, all over the place. Some from natural tits

364
00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:19.494
to small skinny to BBLs through the roof and,

365
00:19:19.734 --> 00:19:22.935
you know, or, or BBW like all, it's all,

366
00:19:23.015 --> 00:19:25.255
it, it, it ranges. It used to be from

367
00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:28.729
what I recall in my experience. Tits on a

368
00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:32.949
stick, blondes, skinny girls. That's, that was what I

369
00:19:32.949 --> 00:19:36.569
witnessed. Today, it's, it's, there's such a large variety,

370
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.859
which I love because now everybody can feel sexy.

371
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.540
For sure. I mean, that's, uh, that was actually

372
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.819
one of the points that I was about to

373
00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:49.660
bring up because, I mean, I've noticed as well

374
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.140
that over time from the 90s to 1000s and

375
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.849
now through the 2010s and the 2020s, I mean,

376
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.829
uh there's more and more variety in terms of

377
00:19:59.829 --> 00:20:04.000
women, uh particularly women who perform in the industry.

378
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.579
I mean, we, you have uh fat people, skinny

379
00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:11.312
people, people with big Small boobs, big small asses,

380
00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:13.271
and so on and so forth. And I mean,

381
00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:16.112
I think that's great and actually it goes, it

382
00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:19.271
goes against one of the points made by, for

383
00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:22.911
example, certain feminists who are against sex work and

384
00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:27.982
pornography because they say, oh, pornography reinforces beauty standards,

385
00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:32.102
uh, no, no, no, or at least not anymore,

386
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:34.832
right? Exactly. And, and honestly, like I used to

387
00:20:34.832 --> 00:20:36.472
think like that too, like, oh, why is it

388
00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:41.443
all blonde. Whatever. But honestly, porn, uh, uh, caters

389
00:20:41.443 --> 00:20:44.644
to what sells the best. It's a business, right?

390
00:20:44.923 --> 00:20:47.043
If, if the blonde girls with the, with the

391
00:20:47.043 --> 00:20:50.163
skinny bodies and the big tits make money for

392
00:20:50.163 --> 00:20:53.884
the, those consumers for that business, hell yeah, continue

393
00:20:53.884 --> 00:20:57.004
to push that, right? It's, it's not about what,

394
00:20:57.104 --> 00:20:59.923
what's hot and, and whose opinion. It's what, it's

395
00:20:59.923 --> 00:21:02.884
a business, what makes the most money. I'm, I'm

396
00:21:02.884 --> 00:21:05.995
not, for me, I'm not gonna. Work with things

397
00:21:05.995 --> 00:21:07.855
that don't make me enough money or do things

398
00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:09.615
that don't make me enough money just because I

399
00:21:09.615 --> 00:21:11.936
like it or it feels good. Like I, I

400
00:21:11.936 --> 00:21:15.336
want, as a businesswoman, right, I want to see

401
00:21:15.336 --> 00:21:17.306
what will generate the most income.

402
00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:20.056
Mhm, YEAH, for sure. I, I mean, let me

403
00:21:20.056 --> 00:21:22.135
just tell you two things because I, I mean,

404
00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:25.456
I'm one of those guys. I'm very bookish, very

405
00:21:25.456 --> 00:21:26.515
into science,

406
00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:27.735
and I'm, I, I, I,

407
00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:29.696
I'm a, I'm a nerd, basically, so

408
00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:30.885
I like it, nerds,

409
00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:34.387
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and. Basically, I mean two

410
00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:39.748
things because these are two common arguments or accusations

411
00:21:39.748 --> 00:21:42.508
people make of of porn. I mean, one of

412
00:21:42.508 --> 00:21:46.228
them is that people say, oh, porn causes sexual

413
00:21:46.228 --> 00:21:49.407
violence. I mean, actually there's no data at all

414
00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:52.348
to back up that claim because over the, over

415
00:21:52.348 --> 00:21:57.348
time porn consumption has been going up and sexual

416
00:21:57.348 --> 00:21:59.988
violence has been going down. So there's not even.

417
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.439
A correlation there. I mean, if, if you want

418
00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:08.280
to establish a sort of a causal relationship there,

419
00:22:08.359 --> 00:22:10.119
then I guess it would be the other way

420
00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:13.079
around. If you watch more porn, you engage less

421
00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:16.319
in sexual violence, I guess. So, uh, and the

422
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:19.739
other thing is, uh, because you mentioned addiction there.

423
00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.959
I mean, I have two interviews on the show

424
00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:24.280
with Nicole Perrosi. I mean, she's awesome. She's a

425
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.052
neuroscientist, a psychologist. She studies. Pornography and one of

426
00:22:29.052 --> 00:22:31.952
the things she studies or she has studied is

427
00:22:33.462 --> 00:22:36.092
a porn addiction. I mean, I'm putting it uh

428
00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:40.871
in scare in scare in scare quotes because um

429
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:44.332
that that's what she found out is that that's

430
00:22:44.332 --> 00:22:47.491
actually not the thing. I mean people who identify

431
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:50.991
as porn addicts, the thing is that they are

432
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:55.052
either religious or very conservative and so they were

433
00:22:55.052 --> 00:22:57.384
brought. Up in a culture or in an environment

434
00:22:57.384 --> 00:23:01.583
that condemns porn and sex work and if they

435
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:06.173
go and watch porn, even if it's even if

436
00:23:06.173 --> 00:23:10.303
they do it very little, I mean they identify

437
00:23:10.303 --> 00:23:13.634
themselves as porn addicts, but it's basically a moral

438
00:23:13.634 --> 00:23:16.864
incongruence. I mean they feel bad because they watch

439
00:23:16.864 --> 00:23:19.864
porn and then they claim they are porn addicts.

440
00:23:19.904 --> 00:23:22.563
I mean that that's really fascinating work she did,

441
00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:22.904
so.

442
00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:26.349
I mean, I, I'm, I'm in a twelve-step program,

443
00:23:26.449 --> 00:23:30.839
so I understand what addiction means, it to me.

444
00:23:31.189 --> 00:23:35.339
It's like, If it controls my life and makes

445
00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:38.459
me unmanageable, makes my life unmanageable where I can't

446
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:41.619
function and it spins out of control, yeah, it's

447
00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:44.739
a problem, but I mean, like I said, it's

448
00:23:44.739 --> 00:23:48.219
all subjective. Like I, I can't tell you. If

449
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.459
it's making your life a problem, you can tell

450
00:23:50.459 --> 00:23:52.660
me if it's making your life, only you can

451
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.660
identify that. I can't go around and go, he's

452
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.140
a porn addict. That's a porn addict, or, or

453
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.219
whatever, right? You have to decide that for yourself.

454
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.979
It's a self-diagnosed disease. You gotta figure it out

455
00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:06.729
for yourself, um, but like, you know, for, uh,

456
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.180
porn, uh, uh, um, for like aggressive sex, I

457
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.719
mean, today, in today's day and age. I mean,

458
00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:19.060
we're uber safe about the word rape and all

459
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.180
that other stuff like you can't go crazy with

460
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.510
someone anymore and, and be like, OK, we're cool.

461
00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:29.219
Like if, if it, if it's too aggressive, you

462
00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:32.020
gotta speak up and say, uh uh, no, you

463
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.180
know, or, or whatever like in today's today's, in

464
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.489
today's day and age, you can't be aggressive with

465
00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:40.510
People so easily like it was back in the

466
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.109
day, but I understand some people going, oh, you

467
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:47.910
know, um, the sexual aggression and porn, but people

468
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.920
don't understand that. Like, like when I meet people,

469
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.699
they go, Oh my God, are you, are you

470
00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:55.459
going to suck me off like that? And I'm

471
00:24:55.459 --> 00:24:59.739
like, no, because guess what? During that scene that

472
00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:03.380
was shot at 10:11 a.m., I starved all day

473
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.560
long. We're meeting up at 78 p.m. I ate

474
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.430
a full freaking meal. I'm sorry. You know, or,

475
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.380
or like, or like, hey, like I said, sometimes

476
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.854
there's accidents, right? We got to cut. We gotta

477
00:25:16.854 --> 00:25:19.214
clean up. We gotta do whatever. Not all the

478
00:25:19.214 --> 00:25:21.094
time, like, like in real life, you don't do

479
00:25:21.094 --> 00:25:23.864
that. You don't go, oh, cut, pause. I gotta,

480
00:25:23.954 --> 00:25:26.775
you know. So like, so I understand like the

481
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:31.244
misconception of watching a porn and going, wow, I

482
00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:33.655
wanna do that in real life. And, and guess

483
00:25:33.655 --> 00:25:35.675
what? A lot of the porn girls are very

484
00:25:35.675 --> 00:25:37.494
talented. So when the guy gets mad at his

485
00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:39.435
wife cause she can't deep throat him the way

486
00:25:39.694 --> 00:25:42.680
I do on an empty stomach. That, that's on

487
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.160
him. EVERY, we're selling a fantasy and people don't

488
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.359
understand that, you know. They think it's, it's real-time,

489
00:25:50.479 --> 00:25:54.839
real life, every day. My, my entire day revolves

490
00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:57.640
around deep throating, sword swallowing, and it's like, I,

491
00:25:57.719 --> 00:26:01.079
I can't. I'm a human, right? I gotta eat.

492
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.319
I, I, and I don't, I don't go around

493
00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:05.959
begging for gang bangs all night long. Like the

494
00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:07.589
reality of this, like I got stuff to do.

495
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.599
I gotta go to the gym. I got grocery

496
00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:11.310
shop. I got to pick up the dogs. Like

497
00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:14.560
we are, and that, and now I'm bringing them

498
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.949
back to humanizing adult film actresses or film, uh,

499
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.619
adult films. The human the humanization is that we,

500
00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:25.199
it's an, uh, it's, it's a, uh, it's a

501
00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:29.530
service. It's a job. It's a business. And it,

502
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.770
it's, it's in a safe time slot and, and

503
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.290
it's not my everyday minute to minute being, you

504
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.689
know, we're, I'm selling a fantasy and I'm blessed

505
00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:43.089
to be great at sword swallowing, anal gang bangs

506
00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:45.209
and all that, double anal, but I'm not gonna

507
00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:47.770
do that on an everyday basis. That's not who

508
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.849
I am or my everyday life. I'm not gonna

509
00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:54.050
call two dudes from the bar or meet some

510
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.050
guys at the bar and say, let's double anal

511
00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.930
me tonight. Like, That's not really gonna happen, unfortunately,

512
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.270
but fortunately.

513
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.770
Yeah, but I, I mean, I guess that people

514
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.010
have to keep in mind as well that uh

515
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.810
porn is basically entertainment. I mean, you don't, you

516
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.089
don't do that or you don't have to do

517
00:27:14.089 --> 00:27:16.770
that in real life sex.

518
00:27:17.199 --> 00:27:19.530
Yeah, I mean, and sometimes I do if I'm

519
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.680
not, if I didn't eat a meal before, like,

520
00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:24.319
I mean. Uh THINGS happen that, that I can't

521
00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.359
do that, you know. And, and like, I, I

522
00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:28.949
wanna bring home, home the point that like when,

523
00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:32.119
um, you know, guys go, oh my wife can't

524
00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:33.800
deep throat me like that or, or I can't

525
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.680
bang my wife in the ass like that. It's

526
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.599
like, well, you know, maybe you guys gotta like

527
00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:42.459
plan that out or teach her like You know,

528
00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:45.180
it's, it's not like I do that every 5

529
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.380
minutes of the day, you know, on my downtime.

530
00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:50.099
It's like, sometimes I do. Don't get me wrong,

531
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.219
I'm not, I'm not discounting or, or saying I

532
00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:55.939
don't. But it's not, I don't put the full

533
00:27:55.939 --> 00:27:59.219
effect. In the the my porn scenes that I

534
00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:01.579
do in my private life. I don't want that

535
00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:02.079
actually.

536
00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:05.660
Yeah, and I mean there are many women out

537
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.939
there who just don't like to do those kinds

538
00:28:07.939 --> 00:28:10.170
of things, and that's perfectly fine. I mean,

539
00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:12.939
sure, yeah, it doesn't make you less of a

540
00:28:12.939 --> 00:28:16.500
person. It's just saying. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm,

541
00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:18.829
I'm, I'm a human, and there are times where

542
00:28:18.829 --> 00:28:21.910
it's physically impossible. I just ate a meal. I

543
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.459
can't sword swallow you cause I just ate a

544
00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:26.849
meal. You know, like there's, there's suck or, or

545
00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:30.910
I, I didn't do, prepare for anal. Sorry, you

546
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.989
know, it's like, I, I'm not, I'm not douching

547
00:28:32.989 --> 00:28:34.910
my ass out every second of the day to

548
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:35.930
do anal.

549
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.030
So, uh, when you were like 2028, 29, and

550
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.829
now that you are in your early fifties, I

551
00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:49.849
mean, how have things changed in terms of how

552
00:28:50.069 --> 00:28:54.270
you prepare for a porn scene, for example, has

553
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.724
anything changed? Changed as you got older or not,

554
00:28:57.885 --> 00:29:01.724
uh, no, not, nothing has changed, um, because I'm

555
00:29:01.724 --> 00:29:03.645
still, I, I was, uh, I'm a lot more,

556
00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:07.604
I was a lot more reckless, younger, irresponsible, but

557
00:29:07.604 --> 00:29:11.364
reckless, but today I'm much more responsible. I'm much

558
00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:15.380
more, um. Uh, I'm older, I'm more mature. I'm

559
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.819
a little bit more wiser, but other than, other

560
00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:20.459
than things changing from in my, not really, I

561
00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:22.260
mean, I won't, I won't go out and party

562
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.699
the night before, you know, like, I mean, I,

563
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.979
I, you know, back in the day, maybe I'd

564
00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:30.099
be doing some lines till 3 in the morning,

565
00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:33.579
but not, not, that's not my story today. I,

566
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.839
I like, I like sleep. I like good rest.

567
00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:38.020
And, and I work out more. I like to

568
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.119
work out more too.

569
00:29:39.989 --> 00:29:41.949
Yeah, sleep is good. Sleep is good. I like,

570
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.349
I like a good night's sleep. Yeah, I mean,

571
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.500
yeah, and do you feel that, uh, like adult

572
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.810
performers are still as stigmatized in society today as

573
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.750
they were, for example, two decades ago? Do you

574
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.209
feel that,

575
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.750
no, OK, cause I, I believe since OnlyFans came

576
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.030
out and, and a lot of people are, I

577
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.790
guess, are called influencers and, you know. They twerk

578
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.670
their butt and, and they now they got like

579
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.670
20 million followers and they shoot a couple videos

580
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.670
with their boyfriend and then now they're, I don't

581
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.390
know, they're, they claim porn star, whatever, but like,

582
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.939
you know, so it's a little bit different today,

583
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.819
but You know, I just, uh. I don't know.

584
00:30:26.869 --> 00:30:28.750
I just, I just feel like it, it, it's,

585
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.550
it all works out. It, it all works out.

586
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.750
It doesn't really matter to me cause, cause I,

587
00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:36.790
there's a saying, you know, cream rises to the

588
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:43.109
top. My professionalism and my love for my job,

589
00:30:43.189 --> 00:30:47.150
my sex, whatever, will rise, you know, everyone that's

590
00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.930
pretending or whatever, it drops off. So, You know,

591
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.819
and, and I'm not hating on anyone. I'm just

592
00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:55.619
saying like that's my work ethic. Like, I do

593
00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:57.939
it cause I love it and, and I do

594
00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.699
it cause I want to be, Yeah, you know,

595
00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:02.979
I, I just, I just enjoy it tremendously and,

596
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.739
and I take it seriously. I'm, I take it

597
00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:09.660
seriously. This isn't like, I'm not gonna, it's, it,

598
00:31:09.739 --> 00:31:11.660
it matters to me. It's not, it, it, it

599
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.979
is a big deal to me, my, my work

600
00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:14.579
ethic.

601
00:31:15.469 --> 00:31:18.260
OK, so look, I have to take this opportunity

602
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.959
because as I told you before we started recording

603
00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:24.119
when I was an adolescent, you were one of

604
00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:27.920
my favorite performers. I mean, the other ones were

605
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.719
like, uh, Lisa Hand, Phoenix Marie, Cyn the Mayor,

606
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.589
and people like that. So I like your. Some

607
00:31:37.589 --> 00:31:40.349
of them are still in the business, so, you

608
00:31:40.349 --> 00:31:42.630
know, uh, uh, but I, I have to ask

609
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.069
you this, and I, I will probably steal one

610
00:31:46.069 --> 00:31:50.030
of the future questions that one of your fans

611
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.430
was going to ask you in your own podcast,

612
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.369
but I have to ask you this question. So

613
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.510
what kind of men do you appreciate the most?

614
00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:03.189
Well, huh, well, the nice thing is I'm very

615
00:32:03.189 --> 00:32:06.910
fluid, so I like men and women, um. I

616
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.150
love it all, um, but I do say that

617
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:16.030
today, uh, November or whatever, 2025, I am looking

618
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.750
for someone that, um, is emotionally available. I like,

619
00:32:20.829 --> 00:32:24.819
I like that. I want a great communicator. Um,

620
00:32:24.869 --> 00:32:31.670
I love honesty. Um, A well-endowed penis helps tremendously.

621
00:32:32.329 --> 00:32:35.140
It does. I, I'm realizing like, uh, the smaller

622
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.109
dicks just aren't that. Fun for me and um

623
00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:42.380
I do need someone that, did I say honest?

624
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.170
I like honesty and responsible. I like responsibility and,

625
00:32:46.189 --> 00:32:48.930
and consideration. I like considerate people.

626
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.109
I, I, I mean, that's interesting because, uh, you

627
00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:56.989
know, there's this kind of podcasts and shows on

628
00:32:56.989 --> 00:32:59.949
the internet now. Uh, YOU'VE probably heard of them,

629
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.060
I mean, uh, shows from the so-called manosphere, the

630
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.709
red pill, the black ill, and so on and

631
00:33:06.709 --> 00:33:09.805
so forth, where Uh, those kinds of guys are

632
00:33:09.805 --> 00:33:13.074
always making the claim that, oh, all women are

633
00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:16.905
hypergamous, so they all want men who, for example,

634
00:33:16.974 --> 00:33:20.734
earn more than them, and men who are dominant

635
00:33:20.734 --> 00:33:22.974
and men who put them in their place and

636
00:33:22.974 --> 00:33:25.494
so on and so forth. I, I mean, it

637
00:33:25.494 --> 00:33:28.935
doesn't seem to me that all women are interested

638
00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:30.375
in that kind of thing,

639
00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:34.369
right? No, I mean, I, I don't. I, I

640
00:33:34.369 --> 00:33:38.010
don't want to ignore red flags anymore. I don't,

641
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.689
if somebody has a criminal record or no job

642
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:45.020
or no car or no place to live. I,

643
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.729
I'm not, that's not like hot to me anymore.

644
00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:52.310
Um, I, I do want somebody that is somewhat

645
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.910
established. I'm not asking for sugar daddy or like

646
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.869
someone that's like, you know, CEO of a, of

647
00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:01.869
a big company. I'm just, I just want somebody

648
00:34:01.869 --> 00:34:04.989
that, um, can fend for themselves. I think that's

649
00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:08.228
a nice quality too, that you're not reliant or

650
00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:10.228
dependent on other people or, and you don't want

651
00:34:10.228 --> 00:34:14.489
a handout. Um, I like self-sufficient people, yeah.

652
00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.658
Yeah, that's great. So what kind of hobbies do

653
00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:20.239
you have?

654
00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:25.628
Huh, OK. Well, what hobbies do I have? I'm

655
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.050
Kinda learning that I do like to read. I

656
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:34.228
like to write. Um, I'm really enjoying having this

657
00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:40.280
podcast, cause, um, it's I, I, I don't even

658
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.370
know how vulgar I could be on here, but

659
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.889
there's no, uh, phallic object in my mouth other

660
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.969
than a microphone, which is pretty cool because uh

661
00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.489
there, there's another dimension of me that likes to

662
00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.534
tap into the mind, body and spirit. Of things,

663
00:34:55.574 --> 00:34:57.415
you know, like, um, or should I say the

664
00:34:57.415 --> 00:35:02.014
mind and spirit versus just sexual acts. So, I'm,

665
00:35:02.094 --> 00:35:04.375
I'm really enjoying having a podcast. I'm having a

666
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.814
lot of fun with that. I like, uh, I

667
00:35:06.814 --> 00:35:11.925
like conversing with people about life. Um, I, uh,

668
00:35:12.094 --> 00:35:13.735
what else do I like? Um, I want to

669
00:35:13.735 --> 00:35:16.655
start maybe taking like a paint class or something.

670
00:35:16.715 --> 00:35:18.614
I don't know. I'm like, I, I just, I

671
00:35:18.614 --> 00:35:21.415
just wanna do kind of like, uh, just some

672
00:35:21.415 --> 00:35:25.139
fun things. Like, like that, that, that aren't like

673
00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:28.100
my usual, you know, I mean, I can say

674
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.620
shopping is a hobby, but not really, you know,

675
00:35:32.419 --> 00:35:35.459
that's more like an addiction for me. It makes

676
00:35:35.459 --> 00:35:38.679
my life unmanageable, OK, but, um. But no, I

677
00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:40.189
mean, you know, I, I, I wanna like, I

678
00:35:40.189 --> 00:35:43.179
wanna experience, and I love, I love going to

679
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.520
music fests like concerts and like I'm really into

680
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.100
music and I love it because being sober and

681
00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.399
uh listening to music and like especially like my

682
00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:56.800
EDM that I love, it's freaking amazing. Like I

683
00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.739
went to EDC and it was like I don't

684
00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:02.780
know, just, just being able to be sober and

685
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.620
present in the moment and very coherent and enjoying

686
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.100
the hard music that I used to do drugs

687
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.479
to is like, oh my God, the, you know,

688
00:36:11.699 --> 00:36:14.459
dichotomy of that, like, how crazy is that?

689
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.330
Look, I, I, I, I certainly share some of

690
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.159
those interests. I mean, I'm very much into books.

691
00:36:22.209 --> 00:36:26.530
I mean, my show is primarily with, uh, academics

692
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.080
and intellectuals, so I mean, you already get the

693
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.370
sense that I'm very much into intellectual stuff and

694
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.929
I love music, I love movies, I love. A

695
00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:37.030
porn, of course,

696
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.540
of course, I

697
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.379
mean, that's

698
00:36:39.379 --> 00:36:39.889
important,

699
00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:43.860
and I, and I, I'm also into, uh, sports

700
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.620
like wrestling and soccer and so on. I mean,

701
00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:49.090
I have a multitude of interests, but yeah, no,

702
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.209
and, but my prime, my primary interests are intellectual,

703
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.739
so. Yeah, I like it, and, and you know,

704
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.780
I, I'm really enjoying, uh, weight training, working out.

705
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.540
I think that's fine. That's one of my hobbies

706
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:02.800
too.

707
00:37:03.669 --> 00:37:06.350
Yeah, awesome. Let me ask you, I, I mean,

708
00:37:06.389 --> 00:37:10.629
I don't know if you ever identified yourself as

709
00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:13.830
such, but do you identify as a feminist?

710
00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:17.879
Um, YOU know what, I, I don't even truly

711
00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:20.610
know what the full definition is, to be honest.

712
00:37:20.879 --> 00:37:22.780
Will you describe it to me? Will you explain

713
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.110
it? What, what the true definition is?

714
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.560
I mean, for me, it's just uh giving women

715
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.879
freedom to do whatever they want to do with

716
00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:36.280
their lives. I mean, that would be, I guess,

717
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.010
a basic definition of it.

718
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.590
Oh yeah, sure, then, then, then I'm all about

719
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.949
that. I, I believe. How about, how about giving

720
00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:47.729
people freedom of choice, period. Like men, women, children,

721
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.449
trans, what like, how about that? Like, what, what

722
00:37:50.449 --> 00:37:52.969
would that be considered a humanitarian? I, I guess

723
00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:55.969
I'm a humanitarian. Like, I, I feel, I feel

724
00:37:55.969 --> 00:37:59.340
everyone should, uh, Do what they love and do,

725
00:37:59.459 --> 00:38:00.939
do what's healthy for them.

726
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.620
Yeah, but that's the thing, right? I mean, uh,

727
00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:08.439
feminists, at least the choice feminists, I mean they,

728
00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:11.879
they don't care if you are a porn star,

729
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:14.479
a sex worker, or if you are a traditional

730
00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:16.840
woman and want to stay at home and raise

731
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.239
your kids and cook food. I mean, as long

732
00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:21.879
as you're doing it out of your own free

733
00:38:21.879 --> 00:38:25.280
will, free choice, and you have agency, I mean.

734
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.320
That's well,

735
00:38:26.439 --> 00:38:28.040
that, yeah, then I guess so. But I, but

736
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.560
I feel like, uh, uh, people should be like

737
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.199
that regardless of gender. I just, I just feel

738
00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:36.040
like, why, like why? But yeah, I mean, I'm

739
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.800
all for, uh, I'm for anyone. I, I don't

740
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.959
look down at people cause they're sex workers. I

741
00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:42.669
don't look up to, to people because they're sex

742
00:38:42.669 --> 00:38:45.439
sex workers. I don't look down at people if

743
00:38:45.439 --> 00:38:47.639
they're a librarian. I don't look up to people

744
00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:50.939
if they're a doctor like. If you're, if you're

745
00:38:50.939 --> 00:38:52.739
a good person, you're a good person, you know,

746
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.969
or, or, or if you're, you know, healthy mind,

747
00:38:55.659 --> 00:38:57.850
body, and spirit, then I'm all on board with

748
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.620
you. If you're evil and you're rude, I don't

749
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.600
care if you're the president, porn star, a doctor,

750
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.929
like if you're evil, I don't, I don't condone

751
00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:06.600
that, no.

752
00:39:07.419 --> 00:39:11.540
Uh, YEAH, I agree. Uh, WHAT kind of relationships

753
00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.580
do you have with your fans?

754
00:39:13.899 --> 00:39:16.820
I have wonderful relationships with my fans. It's um,

755
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.629
It's, it's really crazy is that I, I, for

756
00:39:21.629 --> 00:39:24.810
some reason, like I have like a decent memory

757
00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:27.669
of like each and every what each and every

758
00:39:27.669 --> 00:39:29.790
fan likes, and I love that. I mean, sometimes

759
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.229
I can't remember it all. There's, there's so many.

760
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.620
Thank you God. Thank you fans for being so

761
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.310
loving and so supportive. But like, yeah, I, I

762
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.409
get them. I totally get them. I get like,

763
00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:45.060
I see eye to eye with them, so. I

764
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.760
have a really great relationship with my fans. And

765
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:52.379
I'm the type that really feels that without them,

766
00:39:52.419 --> 00:39:55.020
I'd be nothing. Without them, I'd be sucking dick

767
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.239
in a back alley, just whatever. You know, like,

768
00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:00.979
without them, uh, like, so if people come up

769
00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:02.699
to me and, and like, I'm not the type

770
00:40:02.699 --> 00:40:05.459
that gets Annoyed. I don't care if you know

771
00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:08.139
me or if you're, like, I'm honored. I'm honored

772
00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.860
that you knew me. I'm honored that you took

773
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.300
the time out of your day, work up the

774
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.979
nerve to come up to me and tell me

775
00:40:13.979 --> 00:40:16.419
that you love me. Like, that's amazing because I

776
00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:17.979
know, I, I know what that's like. I, I

777
00:40:17.979 --> 00:40:19.419
went up to someone and I said, I'm a

778
00:40:19.419 --> 00:40:21.780
big fan, and they shot me down. And I

779
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.219
was like, ah, that hurt. That was uncomfortable, you

780
00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:25.780
know, I was like, fuck. And then it made

781
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.209
me like be sour about them, like, damn, really?

782
00:40:29.419 --> 00:40:31.209
So it's like, like, you know, like, like some

783
00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:33.820
people go, oh, so annoying. These fans keep bothering,

784
00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:37.419
not me. I'm like, give me, give me lovin

785
00:40:37.419 --> 00:40:39.620
cause I, I, I'm, I, I owe you. I'm

786
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.000
indebted to you guys.

787
00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:44.969
Look, this is something that this is an assumption

788
00:40:44.969 --> 00:40:48.270
that many times, at least the feminists who are

789
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.030
against sex work because there are also feminists who

790
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.590
are in favor of sex work, uh, I mean,

791
00:40:54.709 --> 00:41:00.889
they say that er all fans and clients objectify

792
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.510
the women they like or the women they are

793
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.429
with. I mean, do you feel objectified at all

794
00:41:06.429 --> 00:41:06.899
by them?

795
00:41:07.229 --> 00:41:10.709
Not at all, not at all. I mean, I.

796
00:41:12.399 --> 00:41:18.090
I'm selling. As a fantasy. I'm selling sex. So

797
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.090
how can I be objectified, like, That's cool. Do

798
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.639
you wanna ask me how my day is and,

799
00:41:22.689 --> 00:41:25.500
and, you know, whatever, but honestly, like, I'm here

800
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.330
to get you off, like, That that's cool. You

801
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.530
want to talk more and see, you know, other

802
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.449
things, but honestly, like I'm not offended because you

803
00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:36.520
don't ask me how my day is or if

804
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.169
I'm feeling emotionally well today. Like I don't care.

805
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.889
Like I get it, you know, like for me

806
00:41:41.889 --> 00:41:44.850
I don't have, um, I have a very good

807
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.860
understanding of what, what's in play. So being objectified,

808
00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:51.219
I don't have a problem with that. I don't

809
00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:55.399
feel that that's what's happening. I mean, or, or

810
00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.899
great, bring it on. Objectify some more. Like, that's

811
00:41:59.899 --> 00:42:01.820
what I'm here for. Like, I, I, I, I

812
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.979
have a very clear understanding of, of what my

813
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:04.820
purpose is.

814
00:42:06.219 --> 00:42:09.939
So do you think that sex work is for

815
00:42:09.939 --> 00:42:13.050
anyone? I mean, if, for example, you met, OK,

816
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.540
let, let me just ask you the second part

817
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.290
of my question. If you, for example, met an

818
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:22.100
18-year-old girl, a 19-year-old girl, and she was saying

819
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.860
that, oh, I want to get into porn, I

820
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.179
mean, what kind of advice would you give her?

821
00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:30.649
Well, since I do give the worst advice ever,

822
00:42:30.729 --> 00:42:33.489
I give really bad advice. I'd, I'd be like,

823
00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:36.770
I'd be like, I don't know. Uh, ARE you

824
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.850
sure? Are you comfortable with this? Do you understand

825
00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.250
the ramifications that are gonna happen after you post

826
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.459
something or you, you put yourself out there? And

827
00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:48.620
remind them it's on the internet forever. Like, are

828
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.659
you OK with that? And are you comfortable with

829
00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:55.310
saying yes or no? Stop and start. I, that's

830
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.459
too rough. That's too much. Like, are you comfortable

831
00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:00.689
speaking up for yourself? Because I don't appreciate when

832
00:43:00.689 --> 00:43:03.739
people, things happen to them and then like years

833
00:43:03.739 --> 00:43:07.560
later they talk, they complain about it like. I

834
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.080
don't know. I, I feel like, I mean, speak

835
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.159
right then and there like that, that would be

836
00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:16.399
my advice. Don't wait till later and say you

837
00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:19.600
whatever negative shit happened, like squash it right there.

838
00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:23.750
Squash it, right, if you're uncomfortable, stop.

839
00:43:24.409 --> 00:43:27.689
So, uh, uh, without naming names, what do you

840
00:43:27.689 --> 00:43:33.929
think about, uh, former performers that, uh, regret having

841
00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:38.189
participated in the porn industry and now would like

842
00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:42.250
for the companies to take their sins down from

843
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:43.030
the internet?

844
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.649
Well, I, I don't know any of that, but

845
00:43:45.649 --> 00:43:50.100
unfortunately my attitude about that is like. You were

846
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.580
a volunteer, not a victim. Like, nobody put a

847
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.100
gun to your head and said, you have to

848
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.110
shoot this, or we're gonna murder you. And you

849
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.370
got to shoot this to save your life and

850
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.250
save your family. You were a willing volunteer, and

851
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.379
I'm sorry that life took a different path for

852
00:44:05.379 --> 00:44:08.620
you, but you have to be responsible for your

853
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.419
actions. That's that for me, that's my Outlook on

854
00:44:13.419 --> 00:44:16.500
it. I, let me speak for myself. I have

855
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.500
to be responsible for my actions. Nobody put a

856
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.459
gun to my head and said, you have to

857
00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:25.209
shoot this. You have to do porn or whatever,

858
00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:26.739
or I was a druggie and I needed to

859
00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:28.860
get my fix, or like, no, that I was

860
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.729
a volunteer. I voluntarily Put the dick in my

861
00:44:33.729 --> 00:44:37.550
mouth for the paycheck on camera for whatever ulterior

862
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.669
motives I had. I'm up, I'm on board.

863
00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:47.280
Have you ever regretted doing anything in the porn

864
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:47.620
industry?

865
00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:52.000
No, cause it served its purpose. Whether I'm embarrassed

866
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.199
of it now, today or not, like, it serves

867
00:44:55.199 --> 00:44:57.479
a purpose at it's at its time, so it's

868
00:44:57.479 --> 00:45:02.320
like, Why regret it? It's done. It's, I, I

869
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.800
did it, you know, whether I, I was in

870
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.000
the right mind or not, like I did it.

871
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.239
Like, like I said, I volunteered. I was there

872
00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:12.280
with the camera and the dick and whatever else

873
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.199
is around. So, I, I don't, and, and I,

874
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.340
I really don't want to have any regrets because

875
00:45:18.679 --> 00:45:21.409
I feel like it's all taking me down to

876
00:45:21.409 --> 00:45:24.419
this. PATH that I'm on now,

877
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:28.229
right? Mhm. No, yeah, I think that's a very

878
00:45:28.229 --> 00:45:29.929
healthy way of dealing with the past, right, for

879
00:45:29.929 --> 00:45:30.370
sure. And, and,

880
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.750
and I feel like I don't ever wanna play

881
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:39.270
victim cause that will keep me sick and that's

882
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.250
trouble for me.

883
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.350
OK, so, look, we have, uh, around 12 more

884
00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.750
minutes. Tell us about your podcast. I mean, you

885
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.830
started it around 3 weeks ago, right? So yeah,

886
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.560
what, what do you want to do with it?

887
00:45:54.989 --> 00:45:57.270
OK, well, actually it was an idea I came

888
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.350
up with in 2012. It finally, yeah, so it

889
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.239
finally came into fruition 3 weeks ago, 3 or

890
00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:09.729
4 weeks ago, um. I, uh, I was like,

891
00:46:09.939 --> 00:46:11.899
I wanna do this. I've been wanting to do

892
00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:16.169
it. And I just felt like um the time

893
00:46:16.169 --> 00:46:18.810
was right. My, my trainer at the time was

894
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.810
very helpful. He's like, I'll do it with you.

895
00:46:20.919 --> 00:46:23.330
Let's, let's try it. And I thought it would

896
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.409
be fun and funny, cause I, I get a

897
00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:29.969
lot of fan questions all day, every day for

898
00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:31.820
my whole entire career. So I was like, why

899
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.449
don't I just make a podcast about it and

900
00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:37.719
like, answer my fans' questions, either with guests or

901
00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:41.409
by myself. And another, another avenue where I can

902
00:46:41.409 --> 00:46:44.959
like, Interact with the fans, and also like, have

903
00:46:44.959 --> 00:46:47.939
a different dimension to who Ava is.

904
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.510
Yeah, uh, look, as I told you, I, I've

905
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.790
already watched episode 1 and 4. Episode 4, I

906
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:57.429
really loved it with that doctor. I can't remember

907
00:46:57.429 --> 00:46:58.860
his name, but he was, he was great, yeah,

908
00:47:00.189 --> 00:47:02.550
yeah, he was, he was amazing too. Do you

909
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.989
plan on having many guests there, or are you

910
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:10.389
trying to perhaps, uh, shoot most episodes just you

911
00:47:10.389 --> 00:47:11.110
and Kyle?

912
00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:14.879
Well, actually, I'm gonna start doing, uh, he, he's

913
00:47:14.879 --> 00:47:17.500
just like a, was a part-time co-host. I want

914
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.360
to, um, probably do it solo, maybe sometimes bring

915
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.350
on some co-hosts, but I don't wanna rely on

916
00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:27.620
that. And I don't really wanna rely on having

917
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.080
nonstop guests. They're fun, but I don't wanna rely

918
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.919
on that cause then for me, I just feel

919
00:47:33.919 --> 00:47:37.129
like it's too much pressure and it's like, I

920
00:47:37.129 --> 00:47:39.489
don't know. I, I, I just, I just felt

921
00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:42.129
like I don't really want any rules, like set

922
00:47:42.129 --> 00:47:45.800
rules. I just wanna have fun and answer fans'

923
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.090
questions and have a giddy, funny time and like

924
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.330
make fun of it cause my advice sucks. So,

925
00:47:51.449 --> 00:47:53.719
or, or it could be helpful, but, you know,

926
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.909
whatever. Take it as you will.

927
00:47:56.939 --> 00:48:00.179
Yeah, no, I've been doing podcasting for almost 8

928
00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:03.580
years, and, uh, now I'm starting to have some

929
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.080
fun.

930
00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:05.830
Yeah, oh really? Yeah,

931
00:48:06.939 --> 00:48:08.780
I mean, I, I, I, I mean, don't get

932
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.620
me wrong, I've always loved the podcast. I, I

933
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.834
love. Having intellectual conversations, but now, I mean, with

934
00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:18.995
this series with uh sex workers, now I'm really

935
00:48:18.995 --> 00:48:22.965
get, I'm really getting to have fun conversations, the

936
00:48:22.965 --> 00:48:26.314
kinds of conversations I, I always love to have

937
00:48:26.314 --> 00:48:26.975
on the show.

938
00:48:27.314 --> 00:48:30.155
Yeah, see, that's, yeah, and this wise man told

939
00:48:30.155 --> 00:48:33.314
me, he goes, Ava, if you make your business

940
00:48:33.314 --> 00:48:35.354
your pleasure, you will never have to work a

941
00:48:35.354 --> 00:48:38.114
day in your life. And I, he, he, that's

942
00:48:38.114 --> 00:48:39.875
the way he told me. Some people say it's

943
00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:43.820
Backwards or I said it improperly, but I'll, I'm

944
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.620
like, that's my favorite saying and whether it's botched

945
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.379
or not, I love it, and it's so true.

946
00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:52.939
I don't want to have to like do a

947
00:48:52.939 --> 00:48:56.659
job or like, you know, forced to do something

948
00:48:56.659 --> 00:48:59.139
not begrudgingly like I wanna do it cause it's

949
00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:01.260
fun and, and like I said, I, I, I,

950
00:49:01.379 --> 00:49:03.580
I wanna be a businesswoman as well, and I

951
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.000
want it to make sense, but But, you know,

952
00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:08.919
I, I, I do, I do in my heart

953
00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:11.239
of hearts wanna have fun. I wanna have a

954
00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:11.860
good time.

955
00:49:12.909 --> 00:49:15.590
OK, so I have one more question and then

956
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.189
one final one that I told Marcela just yesterday

957
00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:22.750
that I'm going to turn it into my final

958
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.149
question of every episode of this series, which I

959
00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:28.520
hope is going to be a very long series.

960
00:49:28.629 --> 00:49:31.469
I really, I really hope that, but uh uh

961
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:33.750
earlier I asked you about men, but how do

962
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:38.030
you approach relationships and love in your life?

963
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.760
I'm sorry, the, the, it, it, we got a

964
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.520
little bit disconnected. What was that? How do I,

965
00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:46.120
OK, OK, OK. Uh, HOW do you approach relationships

966
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.139
and love in your life?

967
00:49:48.679 --> 00:49:50.879
Um, THE good, the good thing is I'm very

968
00:49:50.879 --> 00:49:56.159
open to it. I'm, uh, I'm emotionally available. I'm

969
00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:59.159
very communicative. I, and I do believe in honesty.

970
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.879
So, um, I'm, I could receive it and give.

971
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.719
I, I can take, take and get, I can,

972
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.370
what is it, give and take a relationship. Um,

973
00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:11.600
I, I, I want to be transparent at all

974
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.199
times. I think that kindly and considerately, I wanna

975
00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:18.340
be transparent. And I feel that that's like a

976
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.000
recipe for a successful relationship.

977
00:50:22.159 --> 00:50:26.639
Yeah, awesome. OK, so, uh, going to my final

978
00:50:26.639 --> 00:50:29.120
question then, uh, I, as I said, I asked

979
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.479
Marcella the same thing yesterday. Give me, I mean,

980
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.879
you've been in the business for more than 2

981
00:50:34.879 --> 00:50:40.719
decades now. Give me your Mount Rushmore of female

982
00:50:40.719 --> 00:50:41.300
performers.

983
00:50:42.189 --> 00:50:44.389
God, I, you know, that, that's a really tough

984
00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:49.550
one. Really, well, I mean, because I, I feel

985
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.590
like everybody brings something spectacular to the table, and

986
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.489
it's like there's always, you know, so it's like,

987
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.429
I mean, for me, it was like Vanessa Del

988
00:50:58.429 --> 00:51:02.739
Rio, Belladonna. You know, Jenna Jamison and, and, and,

989
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.620
but then, but then like right I come across

990
00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.620
and I'm like Sarah Jay, Gia Durza, Leah Lovely,

991
00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:09.419
like then I'm like, oh well, like, you know,

992
00:51:09.459 --> 00:51:13.540
like everyone's like, you know, coming, it like it

993
00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.580
never, it never ends, right? So, so I can't

994
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.060
really. I mean, that, that's, that's my best answer,

995
00:51:20.139 --> 00:51:22.020
I think. All I know is like everybody has

996
00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.739
something spectacular. Everyone's so unique in their own way.

997
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.500
It's like, how could, how could we put, what

998
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.699
is it 44, you know, 4 of them. How

999
00:51:30.699 --> 00:51:33.100
could it be the top 4? It's like, everyone

1000
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.239
brings something spectacular to the table.

1001
00:51:36.459 --> 00:51:38.550
Yeah, I mean this is just a segment to

1002
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.469
have some fun. I mean, I can tell you

1003
00:51:40.469 --> 00:51:43.429
mine and then you can I guess react with

1004
00:51:43.429 --> 00:51:45.830
it. I mean, by the way, Jenna Jameson was,

1005
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:50.030
uh, uh, Marcella also mentioned her, so you have

1006
00:51:50.229 --> 00:51:52.629
at least that one in common. So, but, but,

1007
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.429
but, but mine are, I mean, for me, the

1008
00:51:56.429 --> 00:52:01.739
goat is Nina Hartley. OK, that's the goat, and

1009
00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:07.149
then number 2, Lisa Ann, number 3, Phoenix Marie,

1010
00:52:07.729 --> 00:52:10.979
and number 4, I mean, it's, it's not because

1011
00:52:10.979 --> 00:52:14.739
I think she's a better performer than the honorable

1012
00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:17.659
mentions I would have here, but it's just because

1013
00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:19.629
she's my favorite, it's Shia Ryder,

1014
00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:23.790
so, OK, yeah, yeah, see, yeah, it's like everyone's,

1015
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.840
it's, it's hard I couldn't keep, I couldn't narrow

1016
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.860
it down, yeah.

1017
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.679
Yeah, and then of course in my honorable mentions,

1018
00:52:31.719 --> 00:52:36.500
I have to mention Ava Devine, Brandy Love, Cyren

1019
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.399
the Mayor, Diamond Jackson, and right, I mean

1020
00:52:39.399 --> 00:52:41.679
like how, how could we, how could we narrow

1021
00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:44.689
it down? There's like everyone has something freaking spectacular.

1022
00:52:44.719 --> 00:52:47.379
It's like, uh, I couldn't, that's too much pressure.

1023
00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:48.540
I'd be like, ah.

1024
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.389
I mean, I mean, who are your, uh uh

1025
00:52:52.389 --> 00:52:56.760
just out of curiosity, who are your closest female

1026
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.120
friends in the industry?

1027
00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.899
Um, I would say right now it'd be like

1028
00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:04.870
Rochelle Ryan and, um, oh God, there, there's, let's

1029
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.510
see who else. There's like Brandy May, there's, you

1030
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.830
know, uh, Leah Lovely, there's, there's, there's, yeah, there's

1031
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.110
like several. But, you know, it's, it's crazy cause

1032
00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:16.629
like everyone has such busy schedules that it's like,

1033
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.709
we, we, we, you know, get in our own

1034
00:53:19.709 --> 00:53:21.709
bubble, and then we're like, oh my God, how's,

1035
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.149
you know, then we reach out, you know, so

1036
00:53:23.149 --> 00:53:26.929
it's like, you know, everyone's there. It's just We're,
