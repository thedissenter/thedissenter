00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.380
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.099
the Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops,

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.369
and today I'm joined by Doctor Roderick McIntosh. He

4
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.180
is Clayton Stephenson, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at Yale

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.489
University, curator of anthropology at the Peabody Museum, New

6
00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.680
Haven, and Honorary Distinguished professor of archaeology at in

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.385
in South Africa. His interests are in Africa. And

8
00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:29.264
then old world comparative prehistory, the intellectual history of

9
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:34.025
prehistoric archaeology, ethnicity and specialization, and the origin of

10
00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:41.224
authority in complex societies, urbanism, geomorphology, paleoclimate, and many

11
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.544
other subjects, and we're going to talk about a

12
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.665
few of those today. So Doctor McIntosh, welcome to

13
00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:49.735
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone

14
00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:52.415
and it's my pleasure to be with you.

15
00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.290
So, um, uh, by reading your work, I got

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.000
this idea that at least for a long time,

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.010
and I'm not sure if it's still the case

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.129
nowadays in the present moment, but people in archaeology

19
00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:13.129
apparently have, uh, haven't paid as much attention to.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.529
Africa in comparison to other places, I mean, is

21
00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:22.199
that still the case? And even if it's not,

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.449
why is it that something like that happened? Why

23
00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:30.879
is it that people perhaps haven't paid much attention

24
00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.129
archaeologically to Africa?

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.680
Well, I think that to answer the most immediate

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.870
question, it's less the case now, but certainly compared

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.559
to the Middle East and to Europe, uh, and

28
00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:47.800
to parts of North North America and certainly Mesoamerica.

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.269
Uh, THERE, Africa is vastly underpopulated by archaeologists, um,

30
00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.489
and there are very few funds compared to those

31
00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.559
other areas that are devoted to, to archaeology. Um,

32
00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.440
BUT I will say on a bigger, bigger picture,

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.970
uh, it is true that. Historically Africa has been

34
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.720
neglected by archaeologists and also not so true because

35
00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:18.449
an aspect of African archaeology, which is paleoanthropology or

36
00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:23.289
the studies of the conditions and the evidence for

37
00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:28.210
the evolution of hominids that has since the 20s

38
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.240
and certainly since the 1950s. Uh, RECEIVED a disproportionate

39
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.309
amount of funding and of, of interest. I think

40
00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.669
that's still very much the case. Those of us

41
00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.429
who work on the later periods of African prehistory

42
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.990
are very envious of all the money that has

43
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.324
been put into, uh, human, human evolution. Um, BUT,

44
00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:56.095
uh, so, so that, that, that, that is the

45
00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:59.854
case that there's, there's has always been an interest

46
00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:05.134
in Africa for the very earliest periods, but very

47
00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:10.360
bizarrely, it almost seemed. For archaeologists with the beginning

48
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.160
of what would be called the Neolithic in Europe

49
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.690
or the later Stone Age in in Africa, it's

50
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.089
almost as if there was a belief, belief that

51
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.449
a curtain fell over Africa and all of a

52
00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.410
sudden the people, the populations of Africa no longer

53
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.000
became uh innovative, they no longer, they were really

54
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.449
stuck in, in, in, in. A timelessness, um, and

55
00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.429
I'll digress right now to say that that was

56
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:44.690
very much the mindset of the European archaeologists who

57
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.660
came into Africa during the during the colonial period.

58
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.350
You have to understand, of course, and this won't

59
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.830
be a surprise that there was a deep substratum

60
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.630
of racism involved in the whole colonial enterprise. Um,

61
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.259
I wish I could say that that's gone forever,

62
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.789
but it's, but it's not, um, but also there

63
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:13.399
was a. I, uh. An effort by the colonial

64
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:19.519
authorities to restrict the kinds of research by anthropologists

65
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.559
and archaeologists and historians that might counter the idea

66
00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.910
that these were, um, these were primitive people being

67
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.920
enlightened by the colonial regimes and that's, that's, that's

68
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.750
still a very superficial way of answering your question

69
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.350
on a deeper level. There was uh In global

70
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.720
archaeology, as well as global history, an idea that

71
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
goes way back to the Greeks um and uh

72
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.119
is, is carried on through the Arab scholars and

73
00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:59.440
early European scholars. That number one, that it was

74
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.929
more likely the case that there was only one

75
00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:07.029
or at most a very few centers of innovation.

76
00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.959
For the Greeks, this was an idea that was

77
00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.040
called the Euc Kemeny. So there was the idea

78
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.779
that before Greek civilization, there was a center of

79
00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:22.559
Innovation, uh, with the Sumerians, the Babylonians, and the

80
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.750
Assyrians, and then that passed on to a degree

81
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.459
to the Egyptians, but when it came to for

82
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.700
classical Greek, uh, Hellenic Greek, uh, civilization, that idea

83
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.750
of the Yuchey was brought to its, it's, its

84
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.859
fullest, but then that was passed on, um, to,

85
00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:49.950
uh, the, um. Uh, THE basis of Arabic geography

86
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.160
and also from there was passed on to early,

87
00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:59.290
uh, early medieval and even very early medieval, let's

88
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.489
say, uh, European conceptions of, of how to divide

89
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.549
up the world into those people who were. Innovative

90
00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:09.959
and those people who weren't and interesting if you

91
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:13.510
look at Dante's Inferno, there's a whole section about

92
00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:17.670
where he, he basically plots out the the movement

93
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.239
of the Kemeny across northern northern Italy. It could

94
00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:25.549
get as finely detailed as as that, but coming

95
00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:29.959
into the end of the 19th century and into

96
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:33.450
the 20th century when archaeology really gets its glo

97
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.790
it's where when it starts to globalize. There was

98
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.950
a sense that um. It was best to find

99
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.540
the centers of innovation. And there was a biblical

100
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.299
sort of push for that as well. And so

101
00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:54.260
much of early archaeology, archaeology cut its teeth as

102
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.899
it, as it were in biblical biblical lands and

103
00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:01.829
of course um um in the southern, southern Levant,

104
00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.540
but there was, there was a sense that Early

105
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.660
people were so innovate and inventive, and they were

106
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.140
so non-receptive to new ideas from the outside that

107
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.459
you really only had to spend your time looking

108
00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:23.739
at the innovative areas and with a sense that

109
00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:28.700
later on new ideas like urbanism and the state

110
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.540
and technological changes like iron production and and whatnot.

111
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.660
It, it would eventually pass on to other areas,

112
00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:43.260
other non-inventive areas, uh, but it would be a

113
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.420
shadow application of what what went on before. This

114
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.380
put Europe in a very kind of uncomfortable position

115
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.880
because in that early conception. Uh, MOST of Europe

116
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.000
was not inventive at all and would have to

117
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
wait for agriculture to come come up the Danube

118
00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:06.440
for, uh, iron production to come through the Mediterranean

119
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.464
after being invented in in Anatolia and work. It's

120
00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:14.464
way, way through. So there were early maps by

121
00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:17.024
early archaeologists in the 20s and then in the,

122
00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:22.464
in the 30s of uh waves of innovation spreading

123
00:08:22.464 --> 00:08:27.684
out from the centers of, of, of, of, of,

124
00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:31.994
of innovation. The interesting thing is that then there

125
00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:35.544
was a variation on that which said that there

126
00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:38.465
were other parts of the world which were supremely.

127
00:08:38.957 --> 00:08:44.359
Uninventive inventive. Africa being one, Southeast Asia being being

128
00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:48.249
another, so there was a, a parallel sense that

129
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.179
That Southeast Asia was kind of mired in primitiveness

130
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.270
until Hindu traders came in and brought the idea

131
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.669
of temples and brought the idea of, of, of,

132
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.219
of advanced religion and, and, and trade, of course.

133
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:07.789
Other places uh like uh the southern end of

134
00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:11.390
South America and the Amazon were also thought of

135
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.210
as centers of, of, of, of um of, of

136
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.039
conservatative is. Whereas we know now that there are

137
00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:24.309
enormous cities and states going on in the Amazon

138
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.719
that have only been found in the last really

139
00:09:26.719 --> 00:09:32.330
1010 years. So this Africa was not alone, but

140
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.049
I think that the sense that Africa did that

141
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:39.169
archaeologists didn't need to spend a lot of time

142
00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:45.159
in Africa was exasper exacerbated by the the racism

143
00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:49.659
that was involved in in um. Uh, COLONIALISM as,

144
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.590
as well.

145
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.700
Yes, it's very interesting because I have always also

146
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.340
had this idea that when we look into anthropology

147
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.820
and archaeology, we have this sense that, OK, so

148
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.690
we've been looking into Africa up until more or

149
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.030
less the point where the out of Africa migration

150
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.969
start occurring and then suddenly we shift our focus,

151
00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:19.565
particularly after the advent of the. Neolithic to the

152
00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:23.794
Middle East, sometimes to China and then to Europe

153
00:10:23.794 --> 00:10:27.205
as well, mostly, uh, a, a little, we look

154
00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:29.924
a little bit to also places like India, but

155
00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:36.965
basically, uh, and anything from North Africa up, I

156
00:10:36.965 --> 00:10:41.554
guess. Egypt also a little bit. But, but then,

157
00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:44.075
uh, I mean, it's interesting because there seems to

158
00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:48.750
Be that gap and hopefully it's not as big

159
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.340
nowadays as it as it was until very recently

160
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.869
where when it comes to the history and prehistory

161
00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:02.619
of the African continent, suddenly it seems that until

162
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:10.229
the European colonialists arrived there, not much really happened.

163
00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:14.375
Happens in terms of developments in terms of urbanism

164
00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:17.395
state formation and all of that, but now we

165
00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:20.804
are, we know that's not really the case,

166
00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:23.455
right, right. Well, let me tell you a quick

167
00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:26.974
story about one of my heroes from the French

168
00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:30.744
colonial period. Um, HIS name is Ramon Moni, um,

169
00:11:30.934 --> 00:11:34.364
and he was a French administrator who took it

170
00:11:34.364 --> 00:11:38.429
on as a private campaign. To go to archaeological

171
00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.789
sites all around the, the French colonies, so the

172
00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:46.909
Sahil and Sahara. So he spent his life documenting

173
00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:51.109
cities and states and, and he did a really

174
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:54.469
very good job, but he was so immersed in

175
00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:59.390
this idea that all these innovations had to come

176
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.390
in from North Africa. He wrote, he wrote a

177
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.530
book, um. Uh, SORT of a general book for

178
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.210
the general French French public, um, and he entitled

179
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:18.010
it translated into, into English, the, the, the, the

180
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.049
dark centuries of Africa where he basically said when

181
00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:25.409
the, when the Arabs started to come across the

182
00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:29.849
Sahara in the 9th century, they basically found people

183
00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:34.210
at a uniform level of complexity or or development.

184
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.820
That was essentially the same as the beginning of

185
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.400
the Iron Age in in Europe, and they had

186
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.840
been that way for centuries, if not millennia. Now,

187
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:48.000
I say he's one of my heroes because once

188
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.849
in the 1970s we started finding early cities and

189
00:12:52.849 --> 00:12:58.130
early states, the archaeological evidence. He immediately said, everything

190
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.409
that I've ever written about Africa is wrong. And,

191
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.489
and I take, I take, I take it back

192
00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:09.590
all back, uh, so he was, so so it's,

193
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.210
it's not fair in all cases to say that

194
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.229
all the colonialists were, were racists, some, some were,

195
00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:21.390
of course, but it's, it goes. It goes hand

196
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.400
in glove with, with classic racism, this cultural racism,

197
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.559
if you will, or, or centrism, um, that was

198
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:33.039
deep at the heart of the, the denigration of

199
00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:36.309
some people and the elevation of, of other people.

200
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.039
So perhaps to illustrate the things we're talking about

201
00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:44.559
here, let's get into a specific example because otherwise

202
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:47.429
we would have to look across the entire. African

203
00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:52.390
continent and that's not possible, unfortunately. So you've done

204
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.140
work on the *** band, for example. What do

205
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.849
we know about urbanism there? I mean, there's a

206
00:14:00.849 --> 00:14:05.150
common idea that up till the 14th or 15th

207
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:11.109
century urban before that period, urbanism didn't really arise

208
00:14:11.109 --> 00:14:13.419
there. But is that really true?

209
00:14:13.789 --> 00:14:15.630
Well, it's not true at all, but before I

210
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.140
talk about the The *** Bend or what I

211
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.969
think the middle middle ***, this larger, large area.

212
00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:24.679
Let me tell the real quick story about the,

213
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:27.500
the, the, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. So when

214
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:33.099
the English came into what was Rhodesia, they found

215
00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:38.390
these magnificent ruins and was clearly urban in style

216
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.880
and in proportions and whatnot. But it was so

217
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.799
antithetical to the whole colonial enterprise to think that

218
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:52.159
local people had made this magnificent ruins that they

219
00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:56.280
spent enormous amounts of time trying to find uh

220
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.400
Phoenician or Queen Sheba or King Solomon or someone

221
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.880
from the biblical past as having come down into

222
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:12.099
this gold-bearing area and created a. Uh, uh, uh,

223
00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:17.219
LOCAL enterprise really irrespective of the, of the local,

224
00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:22.049
local people. It was so bad that, uh, the

225
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.669
early colonialists dug. All of the ruins. So in

226
00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:32.549
other words, once as as early as 1928 when

227
00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:36.190
a legitimate archaeologist came into those ruins, there were

228
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.229
no deposits that had been untouched, no, no deposits

229
00:15:40.229 --> 00:15:45.190
that could be excavated scientifically. KNOW that that is

230
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.109
complete nonsense that the local Shona people or the

231
00:15:48.109 --> 00:15:52.280
ancestors of the Shona people had built Great Zimbabwe,

232
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.349
the city, but also the, the state that was

233
00:15:56.349 --> 00:16:00.190
involved in all that, but it was deeply a

234
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:05.229
part of the colonial. Signature that local people could

235
00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:08.710
not have come up with this by themselves. It

236
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.630
was a similar situation in the Middle ***. So

237
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.039
the middle ***. We call the middle ***. The

238
00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:20.979
*** River comes up from tropical West Africa, flows

239
00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:24.489
north, uh, up to the, the, the skirt of

240
00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:29.140
the, the Sahara at Timbuktu, and then bends back

241
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.780
down. But before it gets to Timbuktu, it makes

242
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.530
this enormous floodplain. Now the floodplain now is 55,000

243
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:41.890
square kilometers. Compare that to Egypt, which is 27,000

244
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.650
square kilometers in Mesopamia, which is 31, so far

245
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.950
larger. It's an arid lands. Floodplain. So in the

246
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.669
classical explanation of why cities began in Sumeria or

247
00:16:55.669 --> 00:17:00.590
why cities started along the Nile, you need a

248
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.189
river flowing through a dry area so that there

249
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.150
could be control of the irrigation controlled by a

250
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.130
king who then would have bureaucracy and have a

251
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.858
military presence and, and whatnot. So there is this,

252
00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:18.598
this, this, this uh Formula, a recipe, if you

253
00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:22.760
will, for the beginnings of of urbanism. But the

254
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.920
early colonialists just thought, well, this, this very fertile

255
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.199
floodplain in sub-Saharan Africa just had to be the

256
00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:38.260
exception. It there just couldn't be indigenous urbanism. Well,

257
00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:43.910
in the early, uh, well, 75 and first big

258
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.660
season in '77, uh we started excavating a site

259
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.819
called Jenny Geno, which is in the country of

260
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.260
Mali right now. It's in the southern part of

261
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.420
the middle ***, but historically it was a sister

262
00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.500
city to Tim Timbuktu, about 400 kilometers or or

263
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.420
so away, and we had no idea how, how

264
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.989
All this mound was going to be, so it's,

265
00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:14.319
it's like a tell that that's the word that's

266
00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:19.489
used in Mesopotamia for an artificial mound built of

267
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:25.150
basically. Eroded mud and the garbage that city dwellers

268
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.430
would build, build up above a floodplain. So it

269
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.150
looked like a classic tail. There was millions and

270
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.770
millions and millions of broken pieces of pottery on

271
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.560
the, on the surface, but we had no reference

272
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.900
for dating. So we started digging, we started digging

273
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.829
and couldn't tell if this was an island or

274
00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:51.250
if it was a digging through. Anthropogenic human-created uh

275
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.329
deposits, 5 m 6 m 7 m, and, and

276
00:18:56.329 --> 00:19:01.839
down, uh, and when the first radiocarbon dates came,

277
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:07.010
came back 200 AD, uh, 100 100 BC, we

278
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.329
were blown away because if those radiocarbon dates were

279
00:19:11.329 --> 00:19:14.680
correct, um, and they turned out to be correct

280
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.719
and if we excavated well, which I believe we

281
00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:21.479
did, we did. Then it put to the lot

282
00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:25.670
that put a lie to the idea that the

283
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.579
idea of urbanism would have penetrated across the Sahara

284
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.010
uh in about the 9th, the 9th century. So

285
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.890
this is what we call the Arab stimulation. A

286
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.780
hypothesis that there couldn't be urbanism and there couldn't

287
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.380
be states, couldn't be kings and whatnot until the

288
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.020
ideas of these penetrated. And I'll just mention that

289
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.170
the other big area of cities in sub-Saharan Africa,

290
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.060
which is the Swahili coast of East Africa, exactly

291
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.939
the same thing. There was a sense that there

292
00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:01.939
couldn't be cities, couldn't be advanced trade, couldn't be

293
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:06.140
kingdoms until the Arabs came trading down the Indian

294
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.260
Ocean. In again the 9th century or maybe even

295
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.739
a little earlier. And once the, once the, I

296
00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:16.859
mean, you had this silly situation one of the

297
00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:22.500
early colonial archaeologists dug down a great big big

298
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.729
site called Kilwa, dug down until he stopped finding

299
00:20:27.209 --> 00:20:31.290
Persian Gulf pottery and just stopped digging. There were

300
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.849
still city deposits there. There's still, I think, 44

301
00:20:34.849 --> 00:20:38.369
more meters of city deposits, but he just couldn't

302
00:20:38.369 --> 00:20:41.719
process that there could have been a city there

303
00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:45.650
before the Arabs came, came in. So subsequently to

304
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.050
that work in the 70s, we've worked in a

305
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.290
number of places, including Timbuktu, but a number of

306
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.310
places. In the middle of ***, and we now,

307
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.349
so we do survey, so we walk over the

308
00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:02.030
landscape and we look for the, the parts of

309
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.739
the landscape like islands or tells or or whatnot

310
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.630
that would be good for human habitation, good rice

311
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.550
growing lands near nearby, uh, good high ground for

312
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.270
the cattle and, and sheep and goats, uh, to

313
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.810
be protected during the flood, flood season. And we've

314
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:28.130
now found hundreds of these, these tells, uh, throughout

315
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.369
that, that great big floodplain. Hundreds, and there probably

316
00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:35.770
are thousands, we just haven't surveyed the whole, the

317
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.390
whole area, and we're now getting dates, um, certainly

318
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.170
middle of the first millennium BC or 500 BC

319
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.810
or so, um, and in other areas. Getting dates

320
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.390
800 BC, 1000 BC for. The beginnings of settlements

321
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.030
that will become cities, whether they were right at

322
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.109
the very very beginning, whether we could have called

323
00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:04.709
them cities or proto cities or just the sort

324
00:22:04.709 --> 00:22:08.709
of the nucleus of the, of an eventual city,

325
00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:12.469
but there's no question that these were independent of

326
00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:17.150
any kind of influence coming either from Egypt or

327
00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.140
from North Africa. We can tell when the trade.

328
00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:23.810
With the North African starts, the Trans-Saharan trade, we

329
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.569
can tell when the trade from Egypt begins, but

330
00:22:27.569 --> 00:22:31.010
that's well into the process, and I will say

331
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.050
you asked about, you asked, is it true that

332
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.810
it was until the 14th or 15th century that

333
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:41.969
you have, uh, urbanism. In fact, in the sequence

334
00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:44.709
from Jenny Geno and most of the other sequence,

335
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.500
the 14th century is when a lot of these

336
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.050
cities decline. So they've been there for 1500 years

337
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:58.619
doing just fine, and the population either reestablished itself

338
00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:01.699
in a different pattern over the landscape or population

339
00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:05.020
declines, but you know what's happening in Europe in

340
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.939
the 14th century with all the with the black

341
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:10.900
plague and whatnot, so we, we don't know the

342
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.750
plague. Uh, WAS the case. We know that there

343
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.260
was plague in North Africa in the at least

344
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.189
in the in the 13th century, um, and how

345
00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:24.989
many fleas does it take on a camel crossing

346
00:23:24.989 --> 00:23:29.150
the Sahara for, for, for Black Plague to come

347
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:34.430
into a virgin reservoir or population like Sub-Saharan Africa

348
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.619
would have, would have been.

349
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.119
And again you mentioned there, uh, North African I

350
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:44.780
uh I have already mentioned it earlier because as

351
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.329
I said we have this idea that anything that

352
00:23:49.369 --> 00:23:52.930
uh anything relevant that happened in Africa until just

353
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.949
a few centuries ago happened in North Africa and

354
00:23:57.339 --> 00:24:02.140
places like West Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, were for the

355
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:09.270
most part. Stagnant culturally, technologically, etc. But, uh, is

356
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.349
that really the case? Is that the, is it

357
00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:16.130
the case that, uh, West Africa and sub-Saharan Africa,

358
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.140
uh, I mean, the reason why they were able

359
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.430
to move from a stone age societies into Iron

360
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.880
Age societies was due to interventions from North Africa.

361
00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:34.729
Well, it's, uh, I, I would say definitely not,

362
00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:40.369
um, and with the caveat that so little bit,

363
00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:44.500
so little archaeology relative to the vast areas that

364
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.859
we're talking about, um, so when we talk about

365
00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:52.500
West Africa, sub-Saharan, West Africa, you could probably fit

366
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.089
5 Europes into, into that area. Um, YOU certainly

367
00:24:57.089 --> 00:25:02.449
could fit. One entire North America into, into that,

368
00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:06.630
that area. So again, this is an this is

369
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:12.579
a vast geographical subregion that's underpopulated by by archaeologists.

370
00:25:12.949 --> 00:25:19.270
So when So if If the stimulus, and not

371
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.150
the cause, but one of the stimuli to the

372
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:27.069
beginnings of states and cities is trade, long distance

373
00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:30.660
trade, trade in exotics and whatnot, we have very

374
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:37.920
firm evidence for trade in. Uh, uh, IN exotics,

375
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:42.520
uh, east-west across West Africa long before the beginnings

376
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:48.280
of of any physical evidence portrayed north, north south

377
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.040
across the area to North Africa. The issue of

378
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.050
iron. Production has always been a Let's say a

379
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.280
curious one, and it's one that's highly debated right

380
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.400
right now, um, but we've got, so, so basically

381
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.439
iron, iron is invented in Anatolia in 1600 BC.

382
00:26:11.729 --> 00:26:17.530
It spreads fairly rapidly into the eastern Mediterranean and

383
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:24.589
certainly by 900 or so. It's in places like

384
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:28.869
Carthage and Utica in North Africa, largely because of

385
00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:35.329
the trading. Activities of, of, of, of uh uh

386
00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:39.719
the the Phoenicians. So, so clearly the Iron Age

387
00:26:39.719 --> 00:26:42.319
is in place and there are local people making

388
00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:48.130
iron by 900. No real evidence before that for

389
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.890
North Africa. So now along the Senegal River, we

390
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.770
for the last, uh, well, last 12 years but

391
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.439
more intensively looking at iron, uh for the last

392
00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:06.449
5 years have been working on ironworking sites. Uh,

393
00:27:06.819 --> 00:27:12.410
IT'S a. It's a completely different iron technology. So

394
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.189
they're basically in the ancient world there are 22

395
00:27:15.189 --> 00:27:19.689
iron technologies. There was the, the Anatolian iron technology

396
00:27:19.689 --> 00:27:22.050
that spreads into Europe and into the me and

397
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.369
then there was the Chinese, basically wrought wrought iron

398
00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:28.910
and cast cast iron. This is a completely, the,

399
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.689
the furnaces are completely different. Um, THEY'RE not recorded

400
00:27:33.689 --> 00:27:36.369
anywhere else in, in, in the world, and we're

401
00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:42.630
starting to get these dates. Uh, CERTAINLY. FOR the

402
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.420
iron furnaces and the blowpipes and certainly the iron,

403
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:54.209
uh, certainly by 500 and there's earlier deposits with

404
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.750
some iron and some slag, so we don't have

405
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.310
the furnaces going back to 1000. So if there's

406
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:06.199
no iron in North Africa before 900. And these

407
00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:11.119
furnaces are dating to 1000 with a completely different

408
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.670
technology. It implies. That you have a third center

409
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:21.109
of Creation of iron iron technology. Now there are

410
00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:25.660
a lot of archaeo. Metallurgists who don't like that

411
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.449
idea at all, and they, and so we'll keep

412
00:28:28.449 --> 00:28:31.420
digging until we find or we don't find the

413
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.859
the the furnaces, but right now, um, I have

414
00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:38.630
to say that the The Senegalese are delighted with

415
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.550
the with the suggestion that uh that they were

416
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:50.349
West Africans um independently invented iron. Technologically there are

417
00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:53.229
some issues with it, but we're just at the

418
00:28:53.229 --> 00:28:57.380
very beginning of, of developing this, this story. So,

419
00:28:57.589 --> 00:28:59.390
so I think to get back to your bigger,

420
00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:04.500
bigger issue is. The more archaeology we do. The

421
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:10.890
more We underscore the point that West Africans were

422
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:17.579
not conservative culturally. They were not non-inventive. They were,

423
00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:24.989
they were innovating within their own their own environment,

424
00:29:25.209 --> 00:29:25.750
um.

425
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.689
Uh, SO earlier I've also mentioned the fact that

426
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.300
we focus a lot on out of Africa migrations,

427
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.300
particularly the spread of Homo sapiens across Eurasia and

428
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.969
also other species of the homo genus. Um, BUT

429
00:29:43.969 --> 00:29:48.329
what about Africa? Do we know much about the

430
00:29:48.329 --> 00:29:54.040
migrations and dispersals across the continent, particularly of Homo

431
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.839
sapiens?

432
00:29:55.569 --> 00:30:00.130
Right, uh, well, yes, but we wish we knew

433
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.410
more. So, uh, let me, let me put it

434
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:09.900
this way, we now for 3. Uh, SOMEWHAT recent

435
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.089
migrations. I'll talk about those in, in, in, in

436
00:30:13.089 --> 00:30:17.199
a moment and then I'll get to earlier, uh,

437
00:30:17.209 --> 00:30:22.719
the, the, the question of, of multiple Homo sapiens

438
00:30:22.719 --> 00:30:27.410
origins within Africa itself. So, so, so we were

439
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.640
talking about North Africa and there's a very good

440
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.859
archaeological but also ancient DNA evidence right now. That

441
00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:41.199
there was a big infusion of Eurasian populations, uh,

442
00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:44.410
whether coming in from Europe down to the south,

443
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.209
um, and it does seem that Gibraltar, before the,

444
00:30:49.689 --> 00:30:54.140
the sea level. The lower sea level of the

445
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.319
last glacial period before it came up to modern,

446
00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.760
uh, levels that there was a quite easy passage

447
00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:05.180
across the Straits of Gibraltar. So that would put

448
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.420
it at 10,000 or or or or so. Lots

449
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.209
of cultural contact and migrations from Eurasia back to,

450
00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:16.060
back to Africa. So this is the back to

451
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:21.979
Africa. Uh, uh, HYPOTHESIS, um, maybe as early as

452
00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:26.569
15, 15,000, um, but in a way, the migration

453
00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:32.150
is Almost irrelevant because there's plenty of cultural contact.

454
00:31:32.469 --> 00:31:34.880
So people are making stone tools and people are,

455
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:43.109
are, are trading in animals, um, uh, not, not

456
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:48.430
across the Mediterranean but around the Mediterranean. There's very

457
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:52.560
little evidence, um, with one exception, very little evidence

458
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.229
that any of that penetrated this across the Sahara.

459
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:03.979
So during the, the greenest part of the, the

460
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.420
green Sahara, which would have been about 8000 to

461
00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:14.520
let's say 66,000, there was, there were big African

462
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.650
populations in the middle of the Sahara. And some

463
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.010
of that we see in the ancient DNA some

464
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:26.170
of that penetrating into North Africa where it's mixing

465
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.369
with this already mixed population, but at, at the

466
00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:33.290
end of the that green period, there's a, the

467
00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:37.239
Sara really is a barrier. The Horn of Africa,

468
00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:40.449
so going into Ethiopia and whatnot, there seems to

469
00:32:40.449 --> 00:32:45.449
be a bit more. Of the Eurasian maybe coming

470
00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:48.199
through the the across the Red Sea and and

471
00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:52.589
whatnot to about 6, 6000 or so, but really

472
00:32:53.599 --> 00:32:58.219
ending in the southern part of, of, of Ethiopia.

473
00:32:58.319 --> 00:33:00.949
So, so you, you have the back to Africa

474
00:33:01.069 --> 00:33:06.530
and that's basically North Africa. That population in Ethiopia,

475
00:33:06.569 --> 00:33:12.000
kind of northern Kenya. Develops a uh a pastoral

476
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.880
way of life, uh, called pastoral Neolithic, very clever,

477
00:33:16.959 --> 00:33:20.959
clever term, and once that way of life kind

478
00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:25.079
of coalesces, there's a population explosion and a fast

479
00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:29.310
movement down the spine of East East Africa. Getting

480
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.530
almost into Malawi and the sort of the northern

481
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.609
part of Southern Africa. So that's a very rapid

482
00:33:35.609 --> 00:33:40.650
movement of pastoralists. I've got a South African student

483
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:46.729
right now working in KwaZulu-Natal, uh, and she believes

484
00:33:46.729 --> 00:33:52.109
that she's got. The first evidence for South Africa

485
00:33:52.109 --> 00:33:58.780
itself for pastoralists before, pastorist before iron, pastorist before

486
00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:03.150
the the classic Bantu expansion, um, and then the

487
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.349
Bantu expansion is the is the last of the

488
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.949
the more recent ones. So coming out of what's

489
00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:15.958
now sort of the Cameroon. And eastern Nigeria that

490
00:34:15.958 --> 00:34:19.358
seems to be the place for another coalescence of,

491
00:34:19.638 --> 00:34:25.228
of a of a agricultural way of life, um,

492
00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:29.428
with a characteristic language, which is the Bantu language.

493
00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:32.878
Most people in sub-Saharan Africa right now speak Bantu

494
00:34:32.878 --> 00:34:37.739
Bantu languages, um. And a little bit later, so

495
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.790
this is about, let's say 5, 5000 BC, that's

496
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.810
happening. By about 3000 BC, there's a rapid movement

497
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:52.158
again down the into the Congo Basin. And, and

498
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:55.539
another wave if you will, in, in Eastern Africa.

499
00:34:55.728 --> 00:34:59.239
And they sort of get down into Southern Africa

500
00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:02.589
a little bit later than the pastoralists, but all

501
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:06.870
of the The groups like the, the, um, Sotho

502
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.379
and the and the and the the the Zulu

503
00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:14.379
and whatnot or speak up basically uh a Bantu

504
00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:17.580
language, um, as part of the end of the

505
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:24.439
terminus of of that movement. So those Recent migrations

506
00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:28.159
are well documented by archaeology and the ancient DNA.

507
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.370
Uh, AT this point there are only 10 published

508
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:37.179
studies of ancient DNA in, in sub-Saharan Africa. One

509
00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:40.379
of the problems is that it's, it's a hot

510
00:35:40.379 --> 00:35:43.820
climate, and the ancient DNA does, does not preserve

511
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.899
as, as well, but the ancient DNA seems to

512
00:35:46.899 --> 00:35:52.449
be backing up the, the, the the archaeology. Before

513
00:35:52.449 --> 00:35:56.050
that, uh, we look at the hunter hunters and

514
00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:01.000
gatherers, uh, and there's a little bit of ancient

515
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.850
DNA for the hunters and gatherers as well. And

516
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.189
right now the, there's a conflict between the archaeologists

517
00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:10.800
and the, the geneticists, and the geneticists are saying

518
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.810
that basically they were stratified populations. Latitudinally going, going

519
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.360
north, where the hundreds and gatherers down in the

520
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.919
south had relatively little contact. With the, the hunters

521
00:36:24.919 --> 00:36:27.679
and gatherers in the Congo Basin, hunters and gatherers

522
00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:30.000
in, in East Africa and certainly the hunters and

523
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.879
gatherers in, in West West Africa, uh, which It

524
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:41.110
is strange because in places like Europe where we

525
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:44.239
have a good ancient DNA record, people are exchanging

526
00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:47.540
genetic material all the time. I mean, we're, they

527
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.659
were humans like us in the same way that

528
00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.969
we're exchanging genetic material all the time. They were,

529
00:36:53.179 --> 00:36:58.139
so is, is that conclusion from the ancient DNA

530
00:36:58.139 --> 00:37:00.899
just because of the poor sample, or is that

531
00:37:00.899 --> 00:37:05.520
really what's going on? And the archaeology. EMPHATICALLY says

532
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.030
that's not what's going on, that people were that,

533
00:37:09.169 --> 00:37:11.679
I mean, we're, we're talking about tools, that tools

534
00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:15.159
are the ideas of tools are moving long, long

535
00:37:15.159 --> 00:37:22.080
distances, whether by actual migration of people or the

536
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.239
ideas or, or there may be multiple inventions of

537
00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:30.070
the same, same tools and we know that. That

538
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:34.010
does, that does happen. But, but right now there's,

539
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:39.449
there's this interesting intellectual contest between the geneticists and

540
00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:42.949
the, and the archaeologists on justice, on justice issue.

541
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.639
So Interview me again in 30 years and and

542
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.209
they made a resolution.

543
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.570
Well, it would be a great pleasure to have

544
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.399
you back on the show in 30 years to

545
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.719
to try to have maybe, maybe, maybe 20. 00,

546
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.760
OK, OK. Well,

547
00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:02.350
let's agree with 20 years then. Oh

548
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:02.840
OK.

549
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.110
So, uh, uh, I would like to ask you

550
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:11.280
now a more general question. So we've been discussing

551
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.909
here how some of the prehistory, particularly of Africa,

552
00:38:17.919 --> 00:38:23.199
has been neglected in archaeology and anthropology more generally.

553
00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:28.580
What would you say that the study of Africa

554
00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:34.909
and African populations can add to anthropology and archaeology

555
00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:40.459
and particularly to perhaps better understanding of human evolution

556
00:38:40.459 --> 00:38:43.340
and the evolution of human behavior.

557
00:38:44.209 --> 00:38:48.520
OK, well, uh, uh, could I talk about the

558
00:38:49.149 --> 00:38:52.610
end complex society first and then I'll get to

559
00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:57.090
the, the human behavior. So it is right now

560
00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.810
it's there's a very interesting conversation going on between

561
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:06.409
archaeologists in China and archaeologists working in Africa on

562
00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:10.790
the beginnings of cities and states. So these are

563
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.570
classic complex when we say complex societies, we need

564
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.439
a population that's not just large, but is stratified

565
00:39:18.729 --> 00:39:23.290
horizontally, vertically. There's usually some kind of power relations

566
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.510
or whatnot. But the classic model for the beginnings

567
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.969
of urbanism that I talked about before, um, really

568
00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:35.949
excluded a lot of sites. In China, early sites

569
00:39:35.949 --> 00:39:39.110
in China. So we get early cities, massive great

570
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:44.040
big cities in places like Shandong Province, uh, that

571
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.139
Right now don't have any evidence for kings. They

572
00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:50.850
don't have any. They don't have a lot of

573
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:55.699
evidence for inequality, um, so it's clear they're, they're

574
00:39:55.699 --> 00:40:00.939
clearly they're specialists. They're, they're places where different potters

575
00:40:00.939 --> 00:40:03.540
are making different kinds of pots. They're big places.

576
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.810
This is, this is before iron, so this is

577
00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:11.120
where different workshops for different kinds of stone tools

578
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.594
and, and, and whatnot. Big pot. Population if the

579
00:40:15.594 --> 00:40:18.024
whole area was occupied at the at the at

580
00:40:18.024 --> 00:40:21.395
the at the same time, but our older model

581
00:40:21.395 --> 00:40:24.274
coming out of Sumeria and Babylonia was you had

582
00:40:24.274 --> 00:40:26.435
to have a king. You had to have someone

583
00:40:26.435 --> 00:40:31.064
in control. You had to have despotism to keep

584
00:40:31.064 --> 00:40:36.870
the The underlings in, in their, in their position.

585
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.280
What we have in so many parts of, of

586
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.239
sub-Saharan Africa, and I go back to, I talked

587
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:46.169
about the, the sites of Timbuktu and particularly Jennyino.

588
00:40:46.899 --> 00:40:50.280
I've been digging at Jennyino for 28 years. I've

589
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.510
put a lot of holes in that big site

590
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.639
and a lot of other sites. I have yet

591
00:40:55.639 --> 00:40:58.699
to find a king. I joke with my classes

592
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.129
that if I put one more. Unit one more

593
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.580
big unit into Jenny General and I come down

594
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.340
on the king. I'll have to burn all my

595
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.899
books and, and commit suicide in a pyre of

596
00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:15.840
all my articles because I've been writing, writing so

597
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.820
much about, can there be urbanism without, without kings?

598
00:41:19.939 --> 00:41:25.330
Can there be, can there be complex society. Without

599
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.760
inequality because we really don't have any evidence for

600
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.330
massive inequality, the kind of predicted inequality that you,

601
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.760
you'd get from, uh, from Mesopotamia, from the older

602
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.350
way of looking at, at, at Mesopotamia. So inequality,

603
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:48.409
despotism, all these essentials for urbanism just don't. Exist

604
00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.379
in the middle *** the same way that they

605
00:41:51.379 --> 00:41:55.820
don't exist at these sites in China and now

606
00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:01.889
we're getting a complete Completely different. A vision of

607
00:42:01.889 --> 00:42:04.929
what was going on, particularly at the beginnings of

608
00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:10.320
the Indus civilization in In, uh, Pakistan and, and

609
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.189
in India. These, these sites classically have no citadel.

610
00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.909
They have no power, power structure and the early

611
00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:22.300
British colonialists who were digging those sites that, well,

612
00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:25.540
they're there, but we just haven't found them yet.

613
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.110
But at a certain point, uh, it becomes a

614
00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.750
sampling exercise. At a certain point, you say, we've

615
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.909
dug enough if If there, there, if there are

616
00:42:35.909 --> 00:42:40.750
these classic manifestations of despotism and inequality, we should

617
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.870
have found something. So it means that we have

618
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.939
to look in a, in a, in a different,

619
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:50.110
different way for the beginnings, for the circumstances under

620
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.629
which people elect to come together with their different

621
00:42:55.629 --> 00:43:01.139
specialties, their different belief systems, their different sense of

622
00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:04.879
identity. And yet there must be a different way

623
00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:10.000
to find peaceful coop cooperation. So that's on the

624
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.959
later period. So the, the, the, the archaeology and

625
00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:23.320
the paleoanthropology of the beginning of modern modernism as

626
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.879
not modern behavior the last I'd say 15 years,

627
00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:34.669
but certainly. 55 years. And it's because of the

628
00:43:34.669 --> 00:43:38.340
fines in a number of parts of Africa. Um,

629
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.750
MOST of the work is, most of the work

630
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.270
is done in East, East Africa, of course, but

631
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.879
the really innovative work is coming out of South

632
00:43:47.879 --> 00:43:54.169
Africa. And, and here's the frustration, uh, Ricardo, the,

633
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.830
this is a period when the sea level is

634
00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.459
going up and down. And so the caves that

635
00:44:00.459 --> 00:44:04.770
are providing this wonderful information are now right on,

636
00:44:04.939 --> 00:44:08.610
right at the, the, the present sea level, uh,

637
00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:12.459
which is high level. So there are, it is

638
00:44:12.459 --> 00:44:18.060
unimaginable that there aren't thousands of other caves below

639
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.300
sea level with even better information about this critical.

640
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.729
About this critical period. So the critical period is

641
00:44:26.729 --> 00:44:33.020
probably as early as 500,000 years ago. Really critical,

642
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:38.429
the pinnacle of critical, criticality comes at about 300,

643
00:44:38.479 --> 00:44:44.739
15 or so, um, and then And then the

644
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.229
issues I'll be talking about sort of develop continuously

645
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:55.520
to about uh let's say just arbitrarily 125,000. So

646
00:44:55.889 --> 00:45:00.320
what we're looking for is the coincidence of modern

647
00:45:00.689 --> 00:45:08.300
morphological humans. So big brain, grassile face, teeth, uh,

648
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.729
adapted to a omnivorous diet, and that, and that

649
00:45:12.729 --> 00:45:16.889
trend has been going on long, long before, uh.

650
00:45:17.669 --> 00:45:25.110
Uh, AND, and of course, uh. Uh, OTHER anatomical

651
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.689
issues that we see in, in modern, modern humans

652
00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:37.770
coincidence with, uh, a stone tool making technology, uh,

653
00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:42.110
that is, is known. It's the middle Paleolithic. It's

654
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:48.260
the classic, um, level, uh, tech tech technique, um,

655
00:45:48.469 --> 00:45:51.300
but it's, it's quite different than what went on

656
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.149
before. Before they were using the cores. Um, THIS

657
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:58.040
is, this is, they're spending a lot of time

658
00:45:58.389 --> 00:46:01.070
with a lot of knowledge of the physics of

659
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.379
the stone tool to make, uh, to make a

660
00:46:04.379 --> 00:46:08.360
tool to make a flake or a blade. Specific

661
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.919
to different tasks, so if you think of. An

662
00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:18.159
auto mechanics shop before about 500,000 years ago, that

663
00:46:18.159 --> 00:46:21.639
shop would have had, you know, a really sophisticated

664
00:46:21.639 --> 00:46:25.820
shop would have had 20 tools. At 500,000, it

665
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:35.110
goes to 200. Uh, TOOLS. By 315, all of

666
00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:39.550
a sudden you get anatomically modern people and the

667
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:45.350
toolkit expands, doubles, doubles again. Um, AND it's a

668
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.669
little bit later that you start again down in

669
00:46:48.669 --> 00:46:52.830
South South Africa to start to see. The first

670
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.760
evidence that we, um, and archaeologists tend to be

671
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:03.040
conservative in their assignation of something like symbolism, the

672
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.879
first evidence symbolism. So the very first evidence that

673
00:47:06.879 --> 00:47:14.030
comes in quite a bit earlier than 300,000 or

674
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:19.919
uh necklaces of shells, shell necklaces, um, but then

675
00:47:19.919 --> 00:47:23.889
you start to get. Scratchings on ochre use of

676
00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:27.820
ochre, uh, to make not drawings, not like the

677
00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.080
classic Paleolithic drawings in the caves of France and,

678
00:47:31.159 --> 00:47:34.020
and, and Spain and Portugal, I might, I might

679
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:39.090
add, but, uh, uh, but there is the very

680
00:47:39.379 --> 00:47:43.649
beginning. So at the same time in Eurasia. There

681
00:47:43.649 --> 00:47:50.719
are hominids and there are. Local changes to hominid

682
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.439
evolution. So of course, the biggest one being Neanderthal

683
00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:58.800
coming out of, out of, out of uh late

684
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.790
Erectus. Eectus comes in. 18 Neanderthal, you know, shows

685
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.580
up, let's say 600,000 or or or so, um,

686
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.629
that didn't happen in Africa and, and, and there

687
00:48:12.629 --> 00:48:15.969
is, there is somewhat of a debate. As to

688
00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:19.530
whether Neanderthal was responsible for some of the cave

689
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.649
art, um, I'm agnostic, you know, I'm an Africanist.

690
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.209
I'm not going to get involved in, in, in

691
00:48:26.209 --> 00:48:31.750
little, little bickers, you know, provincial bickers like, like,

692
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.409
like that, um, and there are, there are local

693
00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:44.219
changes to post. Uh, ERECTUS hominids in Asia itself.

694
00:48:44.429 --> 00:48:51.750
But these coincident changes in the complex thinking, if

695
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.750
symbolism is evidence of complex thinking and anatomically modern.

696
00:48:57.629 --> 00:49:02.100
Humanity That's all Africa. Now, is it only South

697
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:07.360
Africa? Or do we just have these spectacular caves,

698
00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:11.889
uh, by chance in, in, in South Africa? Is

699
00:49:11.889 --> 00:49:15.179
this happening in East Africa as well? Probably so,

700
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:18.070
and, and, and the evidence is coming out of,

701
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.840
uh, for that as well. The first anatomically modern

702
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.750
human is coming from Morocco at, at 3000. So

703
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:32.239
first anatomically modeled a site called Jaba Haroun 33,300.

704
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:38.530
Uh, 15,000, 15,000. I don't know that there's much

705
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:42.179
material culture associated with those, those, I, I think

706
00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.560
I would have read if there was, was, was,

707
00:49:44.699 --> 00:49:49.060
was much that doesn't, of course, archaeologists can't argue

708
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.899
from negative evidence, so it doesn't mean that there

709
00:49:51.899 --> 00:49:54.300
wouldn't be, uh, it's just that they haven't found

710
00:49:54.300 --> 00:50:00.850
it yet, but that association of Symbolism with anatomically

711
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:05.330
modern humans comes in from South Africa. Big question

712
00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:10.860
is how much contact is going across the the

713
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.860
continent at this point. And one of the big

714
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.770
issues there is that you have the Congo Basin.

715
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:23.570
Which is basically a, a great big alluvial bowl.

716
00:50:24.209 --> 00:50:31.790
So any fossil-bearing strata rocks would be covered by

717
00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:36.409
meters and meters, frankly, of, of sediment brought in

718
00:50:36.409 --> 00:50:39.250
by the Congo, Congo River. And basically it's the

719
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:42.409
same in West Africa as well. Uh, SO where

720
00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:48.110
I work, the first rocks. There are 280 m

721
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.189
below the, below the surface. There could be plenty

722
00:50:52.189 --> 00:50:58.000
of very early evidence of hominid evolution there, but

723
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.399
we'll, I mean, I won't say we, we will

724
00:51:00.399 --> 00:51:04.439
never know, but given present technology, but it is

725
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:07.919
true that the very first hominid in the whole

726
00:51:07.919 --> 00:51:12.229
world. Is in Chad in West in West Africa

727
00:51:12.439 --> 00:51:17.000
at 7 million, um, so, so it gives, gives

728
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.879
us the, the hope that that we will one

729
00:51:21.879 --> 00:51:26.639
day have enough coverage, archaeological coverage of the whole

730
00:51:26.639 --> 00:51:29.479
continent that we can answer the kinds of questions

731
00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:34.100
that that you, you presently are are asking, um,

732
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.629
so I, I, you know, I, I would. It's

733
00:51:37.629 --> 00:51:40.949
a coward's stance to say we don't know because

734
00:51:40.949 --> 00:51:44.540
we don't have, you know, that is the case

735
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.409
in in for many of these, many of these

736
00:51:47.409 --> 00:51:47.840
questions.

737
00:51:48.879 --> 00:51:52.000
Right, so I would like to get into one

738
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.100
last topic of our conversation today. So, uh, in

739
00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.360
what ways can anthropology contribute to the study of

740
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.550
climate change?

741
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.620
OK. Well, uh, so the way climate change is

742
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.300
one of the things that I do both from

743
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.820
the climatology, from the physics point of point of

744
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:21.379
view and also from the human response. So, so

745
00:52:21.379 --> 00:52:25.879
essentially when you talk about climate change. If just

746
00:52:25.879 --> 00:52:29.000
looking at the objective climate change, the physics of

747
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.199
climate change, climate is always changing. It's changing at

748
00:52:32.199 --> 00:52:36.320
different, different scales, and we've come a long way

749
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.120
to understanding the rhythms of those scales. So, and

750
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.719
we call them forcing, forcing mechanisms, um, and they're.

751
00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:49.340
They're increasingly predictable. So in other words, we know

752
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.389
what's going to happen at a scale of 100

753
00:52:53.389 --> 00:52:57.939
years because of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit

754
00:52:57.939 --> 00:53:00.739
around the, around the sun. Um, THERE'S nothing we

755
00:53:00.739 --> 00:53:02.979
can do about it, but, but we, we can

756
00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:08.250
pretty well predict in 70,000 years what that, what,

757
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.479
what the effect of the sun's distance. On the

758
00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:16.360
earth will, will be numbers of watts hitting 1

759
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:22.780
m 1 m square. The, the The second aspect

760
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.709
of climate change is, are we doing something to

761
00:53:27.709 --> 00:53:34.550
the landscape now that's interfering with those. Those patterns

762
00:53:34.719 --> 00:53:39.800
and obviously everyone is aware of the increase, the

763
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.719
really frightening increase of of parts per million of

764
00:53:44.719 --> 00:53:48.629
carbon dioxide, parts per billion of, of, of methane.

765
00:53:48.919 --> 00:53:52.705
Um, THERE may be some disagreement, um, less. And

766
00:53:52.705 --> 00:53:57.774
less disagreement among scientists about what's responsible for those

767
00:53:58.104 --> 00:54:05.104
unprecedented, um, increases in the greenhouse, greenhouse gasses, uh,

768
00:54:05.304 --> 00:54:10.344
but we, we do know increasingly, very accurately where

769
00:54:10.344 --> 00:54:15.054
those greenhouse gasses would be without human inter interference.

770
00:54:15.344 --> 00:54:20.669
And so, so that's, that's the, that's. That's the

771
00:54:20.669 --> 00:54:24.750
physics and the anthropology comes together with is it.

772
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:31.489
Increasing the acreage of rice fields in Southeast Asia,

773
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:36.250
that is increasing the parts per million of carbon

774
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.979
dioxide. Is it the deforestation of a certain amount

775
00:54:39.979 --> 00:54:43.540
of the, of the, of the, uh, uh, of

776
00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:50.590
the Amazon? What happens? With what's, what's the, uh,

777
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.989
we, we have the mechanisms to understand that part

778
00:54:53.989 --> 00:54:57.120
of, of, but those are human actions. So that's

779
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.959
where the anthropology comes in. The other, the other

780
00:54:59.959 --> 00:55:05.260
part of the anthropology is. Uh What are the

781
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:10.050
effects of not just the, the known climate cycles,

782
00:55:10.379 --> 00:55:15.830
but the perturbations to those cycles created by climate,

783
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.939
climate change, um, that's sociology, it's a bit of

784
00:55:19.939 --> 00:55:23.500
history, it's why, why is such a large part

785
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.459
of the earth's population inhabiting the, the, near the

786
00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:33.399
oceans. So that an increase by 20 centimeters or

787
00:55:33.399 --> 00:55:38.649
a meter uh would would disproportionately affect the human,

788
00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:44.830
human populations. So, so. We, we, that those, that's

789
00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:49.939
the large scale on the, on the. AND getting

790
00:55:49.939 --> 00:55:56.750
back to Africa on the. MORE finely grained scale.

791
00:55:57.199 --> 00:56:03.179
We can project. Uh, WHAT might, what might the

792
00:56:03.179 --> 00:56:10.830
effects of, uh, let's say. Uh, uh, 0.5 centimeter

793
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:17.659
uh centigrade, uh, increase in temperature due to the

794
00:56:18.159 --> 00:56:21.750
southern bo boundary of the Sahara and to the

795
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.429
populations at at the Sahara. We see that happening

796
00:56:24.429 --> 00:56:30.389
now. Um, THE ill effects, is it really is

797
00:56:30.389 --> 00:56:34.030
it just climate change or is it this very

798
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:39.340
complex mix of Of human policy. And climate change.

799
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.060
So just on, on that, the 1950s were a

800
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:47.879
time of anomalously good rain. Human population in the

801
00:56:47.879 --> 00:56:52.550
healing states rose, but also the cattle population rose,

802
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.010
and cattle were being raised, herded into parts of

803
00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.270
the Sahara where they normally had not been before.

804
00:57:00.679 --> 00:57:05.719
The Great Sahil drought hits 1968 through 1985. If

805
00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:10.340
indeed it's ever, ever ended, that's, that's debatable, um,

806
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:14.639
and that's, that was the cause of enormous human

807
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:18.800
misery. You take those facts together and now there's

808
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:26.139
a policy, um, Uh, initiative, uh, by the Sahelian

809
00:57:26.139 --> 00:57:29.500
states called the Greenbelt, and the idea is to

810
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:39.330
plant trees. 500 kilometers. Of 500 kilometers of tree

811
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:47.620
planting north south over 4 uh 450 kilometers east,

812
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.290
east west, uh, and then, and as you can

813
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:56.080
imagine, that's very controversial because some countries don't have

814
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.639
control over. Those parts of the, the, how can

815
00:57:59.639 --> 00:58:02.750
they get in the, the, the tree planting, um,

816
00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.699
how can you, uh, how can you convince local

817
00:58:07.699 --> 00:58:12.050
populations whom you would need to protect those trees

818
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.840
if there's a basic need for firewood and they,

819
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.199
you just can't cook if you don't have the

820
00:58:19.199 --> 00:58:22.280
firewood and here, here are these we, we in

821
00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:27.270
the French colonies, there's uh uh uh. PHENOMENON called

822
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:32.149
the fore, uh, uh, class A, uh, it's protected

823
00:58:32.149 --> 00:58:37.479
forests basically, it's an enormous failure because they didn't

824
00:58:37.479 --> 00:58:41.560
enlist the The local, they eliminated the local population,

825
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.189
um, and so all of a sudden became a

826
00:58:44.189 --> 00:58:50.229
uh us them a hostile situation. So anthropology and

827
00:58:50.229 --> 00:58:54.820
to a degree archaeology can combine with the physics

828
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.389
to understand what are the what are the consequences

829
00:58:57.389 --> 00:59:00.790
of these different aspects of what we call climate

830
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:01.300
change.

831
00:59:03.489 --> 00:59:07.129
Uh, AND so, um, related to that, my last

832
00:59:07.129 --> 00:59:14.169
question will be, so can studying African paleo climate

833
00:59:14.169 --> 00:59:18.709
help us tackle, not just understand but tackle climate

834
00:59:18.709 --> 00:59:19.750
change issues.

835
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:29.050
Well, I think so because uh uh The physics

836
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:34.929
of weather and climate at Let's, let's call the

837
00:59:34.929 --> 00:59:38.489
middle, middle scale are fairly well known. So in

838
00:59:38.489 --> 00:59:41.879
Europe, climate is largely controlled by the jet stream.

839
00:59:42.229 --> 00:59:45.209
Uh, Africa and many parts of the tropic are

840
00:59:45.209 --> 00:59:49.330
monsoonal. We understand the mechanisms, we understand the causes

841
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:53.050
of, of the, of the, the mon monsoon. We,

842
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:57.429
we increasingly understand the, the mechanisms of, of the,

843
00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.750
of the mon monsoon. It's what becomes interesting. Is

844
01:00:04.879 --> 01:00:10.790
that 51% of the African continent, sub-Saharan African subcontinent,

845
01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:16.050
burns every year. There's an enormous load of particulates

846
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.520
in the atmosphere, and those particulates either creating a

847
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:28.040
germ around which raindrops can, can form or something

848
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.760
that or, or in, in a certain density preventing

849
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.919
rain from, from falling. So we have an archaeological

850
01:00:37.919 --> 01:00:43.050
record going back, let's say a million. Uh, OF

851
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:47.040
purposeful burning, human control of burning, control of burning.

852
01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:51.129
That record becomes better, as you might imagine, as

853
01:00:51.129 --> 01:00:55.330
we come closer in time, but also we, we

854
01:00:55.330 --> 01:01:02.449
understand more the effects of burning widespread landscape modification.

855
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:08.540
Killing off of vast amounts of, of uh forest

856
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:13.909
or gallery forests along, um, we, we understand that

857
01:01:13.909 --> 01:01:19.100
better better as pastoralism comes in, agricultural, agriculture comes

858
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.100
in. So we have, if you will, a field

859
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:29.340
laboratory from archaeology. Of how human-based landscape modification interacts

860
01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:33.320
with the physics of the The jet stream, the

861
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.050
different jet streams, um, and also the, the monsoonal,

862
01:01:37.179 --> 01:01:41.610
monsoonal system. So I would say we're at the

863
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:46.709
We're at the very beginning of putting all these

864
01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:49.270
together, so much effort and quite rightly has been

865
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:56.500
put into the basic physics of understanding climate patterns

866
01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.649
forcing me, but increasingly, uh, we're finding conferences and

867
01:02:01.649 --> 01:02:05.459
papers and books and what and whatnot about the,

868
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:10.540
the human climate system interaction.

869
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.469
OK, great. So, Doctor McIntosh, just before we go,

870
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.620
would you like to tell people where they can

871
01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.209
fund the internet? Are there any good places for

872
01:02:23.209 --> 01:02:23.479
that?

873
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:30.330
Well, uh, there's, uh, the, the Yale University, um,

874
01:02:30.459 --> 01:02:33.739
website for the anthropology department, but also I'm a

875
01:02:33.739 --> 01:02:38.370
part of the, uh, council on archaeological studies. Uh,

876
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.300
THERE'S, there's a website, it's, it's, it's being revised

877
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.250
right now, so maybe give it a couple, couple

878
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.350
of weeks, but that's, that would be the case,

879
01:02:47.739 --> 01:02:53.649
um, and, um, I've Both in French and in

880
01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:56.209
English, I've made a real effort to try to

881
01:02:56.209 --> 01:03:00.830
write. Articles and and also books for the general,

882
01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:06.560
general public, um, and so if you go into

883
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:17.449
my page on the anthropology department uh And But

884
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.840
It's a list the web page, but um it's,

885
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.449
it's, it's an incredibly exciting time in African archaeology

886
01:03:30.449 --> 01:03:36.560
right now. It's, it's, it's an incredibly exciting time

887
01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.879
in African archaeology right now. And one of the

888
01:03:39.879 --> 01:03:43.280
things that has excited me the most is the

889
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.350
interest of the general public. In Mali, um, and

890
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:54.520
I'll just mention that, that, uh, my Co-director at

891
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.080
Jeni General became the first democratically elected president of

892
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.080
Mali. So Malians are very immersed in their own

893
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.000
history and, and archaeology, and there are now 250

894
01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:12.800
archaeology students, undergraduate students at the Department of History

895
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.479
at the University of Senegal, the, the University of

896
01:04:15.479 --> 01:04:20.879
the, the Dakar Dakar University. So we're trying to

897
01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:25.120
get the excitement but also the, the new information

898
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.679
about Africa out to Africans uh in that, in

899
01:04:28.679 --> 01:04:29.270
that way.

900
01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:34.139
