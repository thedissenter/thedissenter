00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.079
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.579
today I'm joined by your return guest, Dr. Vibe

4
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.590
Kwassen. And today we're going to talk about what

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.680
evolutionary psychology or even psychology more generally, also criminology

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.920
can tell us about political violence and the psychology

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.709
of people who commit political violence, acts of terrorism,

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
and so on. So, Doctor Rotessen, welcome back to

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.880
the show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:36.340
Thank you for having me, and I believe it's

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.540
the 4th time I'm here, so thank you so

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.159
much.

13
00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:43.860
No, that's true, that's true. I always love to

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.799
everyone, and we always have great conversations, so, um,

15
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.860
let me start by asking you, so how do

16
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.819
you approach political violence from an evolutionary perspective? I

17
00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.700
mean, what is political violence from that, uh, psychological

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.439
perspective?

19
00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:07.250
But political violence can very easily be defined, bluntly

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.750
be defined as. Violence that's perpetrated with reference to

21
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.629
with conviction of some political ideology, but one should

22
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:24.410
also include religious ideology. Um, BUT when you look

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.290
at what sort of phenomena and behaviors are included

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.550
in that again, it can get a bit more

25
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.050
difficult to define. So you can have mass shootings

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.889
and attempted mass shootings, and you can have political

27
00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.680
assassinations and attempted political assassinations, which are easy to

28
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.389
define. But as it turns out, uh, despite decades

29
00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.029
of studying it theoretically, empirically, and attempting to define

30
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.690
it and operate operationalize it, one still hasn't got

31
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.205
a definition of terrorism that everyone agrees. And that

32
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:08.684
you can easily operationalize and use in research, but

33
00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:14.244
terrorism can be defined as violence or the threat

34
00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:20.274
of violence perpetrated with reference to political or religious

35
00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:24.410
ideology. Um, BUT that isn't the only definition, and

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.289
it isn't a definition everyone agrees on. Some would

37
00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:32.360
say that it also has to include creating fear

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.149
in the general public or in specific targeted groups

39
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.050
of the public, but there are actually no definitions

40
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.199
of terrorism in the same way as one can

41
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.910
define political assassination and other mass shootings.

42
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:54.960
Yeah, and is there anything from the evolutionary psychology

43
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.919
of violence, and we've already talked a lot about

44
00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:04.179
that in our previous conversations, that might apply specifically

45
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.399
to terrorism.

46
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.179
Yes, and mass shootings and political assassinations. So, uh,

47
00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:15.059
political violence can absolutely be studied from an evolutionary

48
00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.300
approach, and one has done that over the past

49
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.380
couple of decades. And as, as we've talked about

50
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.839
before, and you've spoken to a range of brilliant

51
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.910
guests and your audience is very aware of evolutionary

52
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.520
psychology belongs to something that we call the paradigm

53
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.320
of selection thinking. That means that we start off

54
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.550
with the general theory, modern theory of evolution. How

55
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.960
does evolution happen through the processes of natural selection

56
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.199
and sexual selection. That's the meta theory. And then

57
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.160
you have a mid-level of the selection paradigm, which

58
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.940
is evolutionary biology. And in this area, political violence,

59
00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.880
um, you would use the usual suspects on this

60
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.839
mid level, which I'm sure your audience are, are,

61
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.770
are very familiar with, is the works of Robert

62
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.140
Trivers on the origin and function of sex differences.

63
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.239
Uh, BUT also one can use Hamilton's Hamilton's work

64
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:26.760
on inclusive fitness altruism, which he applied to also

65
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.510
then studying spite. But if we start with Robert

66
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.850
Trivers. And he believed that Charles Darwin's ideas of

67
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.250
sexual selection on males and females competing within their

68
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.720
genders, within their sex for mating opportunities. Um, HE

69
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.769
believed that was absolutely correct, but he felt it

70
00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.609
was a lacking somewhat. So in his theory of

71
00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:56.290
parental investment, he argued we should look at sexual

72
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.179
selection through the lens of parental investment. So he

73
00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:03.790
wrote a paper on parental investment that I recommend

74
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.600
your audience read because that's the starting point for

75
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.609
a lot of evolutionary psychology work, including that on,

76
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.540
uh, political violence, coalitional aggression, war, but also terrorism

77
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.820
and mass shooting, whether that is coalitional, or you

78
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.339
have the lone actor. And there are 3 hypotheses.

79
00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.470
That one can use. And I suggest we start

80
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.890
with the first one that came in 1985 in

81
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.450
a paper by two authors that you and your

82
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.450
audience are very familiar with, uh, Margot Wilson and

83
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.730
Martin Daly. I, I've talked about them a lot

84
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.549
on your show with regards to homicide, and they

85
00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:51.630
had a paper already back in 1985, which for

86
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.429
evolutionary psychologists is seminal, but not so well known

87
00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:01.290
outside. Uh, EVOLUTIONARY psychology, and that is a hypothesis

88
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.570
they presented in this 1985 paper called the young

89
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.910
male syndrome, also in the paper listed as the

90
00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:12.850
dangerous young male syndrome. Have you heard of that

91
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.049
one?

92
00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:17.309
Uh, YES, I think so. I mean, I, I,

93
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.279
I have Dr. Daley on the show back in

94
00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.079
early 2019, and we talked a little bit about

95
00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:28.160
the evolution of violence, and I think we touched

96
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.750
on that,

97
00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.779
yes. Yeah, it's a, it's a hypothesis that he,

98
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.440
uh, he proposed together with his late wife Margot.

99
00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.540
Uh, Wilson, and uh it's, it's a hypothesis that

100
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.600
he's still using currently in his, uh, homicide research

101
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.119
to explain, um, why most homicides are perpetrated with

102
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.619
a young male as the perpetrator and a young

103
00:06:54.619 --> 00:07:01.220
male as the victim. And uh in the framework

104
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.700
of sexual selection and Robert Trevors and other evolutionary

105
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.299
biologists like um Alexander Richard Alexander, uh, it was

106
00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:14.459
suggesting that because males are in a constant competition

107
00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:18.920
for access to females. Like literally access to females,

108
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.959
but also those things that females look for in

109
00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:27.929
males, such as the ability to, uh, obtain and

110
00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:34.160
control territory, have resources, protect, um, these abilities, uh,

111
00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:40.519
create this constant competition among males that females find

112
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:46.480
attractive, uh, um, through female choice. The the ambition

113
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.920
and drive and abilities to obtain territory, resources, status,

114
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.880
things that can translate into reproductive opportunities is selected

115
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.679
for among males more so than females because although

116
00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:06.200
females, yes, they can also gain from competition, from

117
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.500
status, from accessing and controlling resources. On the other

118
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.040
end of the scale, there's a cost to females,

119
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.779
um. The fact that they go pregnant, that they

120
00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.670
can You know, a woman gets fertilized, she has

121
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.070
to go 9 months pregnant, and then she has

122
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.929
to uh nurse her child, whereas males. You know,

123
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.950
they can take a shower and we're we're lucky

124
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.808
or not, because as it turns out, you have

125
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:41.780
a a male mortality rate, particularly among young males

126
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.289
because of this competition that you have. So you're

127
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:51.140
not that lucky actually rather than unfortunate sex. And

128
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.020
when you look at, uh, when you look at

129
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.700
the prehistoric records and what was it that young

130
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.859
males died of, it was this competition that can

131
00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:04.489
turn very lethal. Now in the 1985 paper, Wilson

132
00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:07.929
and Daley, they were focusing mainly on criminal behavior

133
00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:11.780
and also homicide, but they do touch upon, um,

134
00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:18.400
Political violence, um, and political status, uh, noting that

135
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.530
this can be translated into either fending off competition

136
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.520
of the males, but also accessing females that it

137
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.080
gives status and females find it attractive. And although

138
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.719
they were mostly concerned with the individual male, that

139
00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:37.359
the individual male has got this psychology from his

140
00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:41.599
successful forefathers, um, they were also concerned with something

141
00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:46.760
that one in social psychology terms social facilitation. Is

142
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.539
that a concept you're familiar with?

143
00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:52.719
Mhm, YES, yeah, yes, but maybe for the audience,

144
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.260
please explain it.

145
00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:58.960
So that is the mere presence of others may

146
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.919
very well change your behavior. Um, JUST riding a

147
00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:05.520
bike, you might be riding a bike at a

148
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.080
certain speed when you're alone. If you just have

149
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.340
other people present, you will cycle faster. And this

150
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.909
was research they did in the 1900s. And they

151
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:19.750
also then did some research, seeing if this social

152
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.099
facilitation. Does that occur in other species? And to

153
00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:28.369
the great amusement of my students in social psychology,

154
00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:32.940
they actually did this experiment with cockroaches where even

155
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.219
cockroaches, uh, will walk at a certain pace. Um,

156
00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:42.130
BUT if you put other cockroaches there. It increases

157
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.450
their performance. So you can increase performance, um, but

158
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.950
you can also have more extreme behaviors in general.

159
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:55.229
And so in the paper on the young male

160
00:10:55.229 --> 00:10:58.669
syndrome, which is the name of the hypothesis, um,

161
00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:02.690
also that they term in the paper itself, the

162
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.929
dangerous young male syndrome, they talk about what happens

163
00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:09.099
with young men. In the presence of other young

164
00:11:09.099 --> 00:11:12.539
men, so you can use this hypothesis both to

165
00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:17.299
study the lone actor terrorist, the lone actor who

166
00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:20.260
does a political association, the lone actor who does

167
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.059
mass shooting, but you can also look at those

168
00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:26.719
who do it in coalitions, um, but the point

169
00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.719
is. If you use it to study this, you're

170
00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:34.969
understanding the male psychology as more prone, not every

171
00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:37.849
single male in the population, but males as a

172
00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:41.830
group are selected to be more prone towards risk,

173
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.489
aggressive behavior, aggressive, lethal, violent competition than what females

174
00:11:48.489 --> 00:11:51.130
are. So you can use this, you can apply

175
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:59.130
this hypothesis to approach, um, males. Overrepresentation across the

176
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.369
board on political violence, regardless of definition, regardless of

177
00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:08.130
culture, you always have a male overrepresentation.

178
00:12:08.859 --> 00:12:11.340
I mean, I, it even, it even goes beyond

179
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.559
political violence, right? I mean, any kind of violence

180
00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:18.710
and any kind of. Or I guess at least

181
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:25.210
most crimes, uh, males are overwhelmingly represented there,

182
00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:29.390
right. So this was then again, a hypothesis they

183
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.510
had the young male syndrome, the dangerous young male

184
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.229
syndrome that was first and foremost used to apply

185
00:12:35.229 --> 00:12:40.210
the overrepresentation of males in criminal behavior such as

186
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.270
uh homicide, but it is one that lends itself

187
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:51.080
easily to political violence. And then in 2012, there

188
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.359
was a, uh, group of three researchers headed by

189
00:12:55.359 --> 00:13:00.460
Melissa McDonald, who published their paper in 2012, who

190
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.960
also had a hypothesis also based in what is

191
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.929
the male reproductive role, physiologically speaking. What is the

192
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:14.429
male reproductive role, um, and they then had a

193
00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:20.140
hypothesis which has become much more known outside evolutionary

194
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.890
psychology, which I'm quite certain your audience has heard

195
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.890
of, and that is the warrior syndrome.

196
00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:29.729
The the male warrior syndrome.

197
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.210
Yeah. Are you familiar with that?

198
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.849
Yes, I think so. Yeah. But

199
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:37.130
many people have heard of it. They haven't necessarily

200
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.210
read Melissa and her colleagues paper, but everyone's heard

201
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.479
of it. It's one that has um. It also

202
00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:49.630
gets used outside of research performed by evolutionary psychologists,

203
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.549
and they take it one step further and point

204
00:13:53.549 --> 00:14:00.469
to the fact that um males operate in coalitions

205
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.390
very often their aggression is performed in coalitions, and

206
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:09.440
they point to that tribal warfare. Has been significant

207
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.900
in um shaping the male psychology as it is

208
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.450
today. In prehistoric times, what killed young males most

209
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.260
often was the competition, um, young male on young

210
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.599
male violence, but even more so tribal warfare. And

211
00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:30.530
I mean, if you look at the numbers, I'm

212
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.609
sure you and your uh uh audience are familiar

213
00:14:33.609 --> 00:14:36.729
with Steven Pinker's work. You've you've also interviewed Steven

214
00:14:36.729 --> 00:14:40.489
Pinker, I believe, on how, believe it or not,

215
00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:43.130
and I'm sure many people are not believing it

216
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.489
currently, but we are actually historically speaking. Living in

217
00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:51.179
the most peaceful times, uh, because not only historically,

218
00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:57.960
but prehistoric, um, violent violence, um, and men and

219
00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:03.469
males and females have been selected um. In that

220
00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:06.390
regard, but in very different ways. So males have

221
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.909
been selected. Melissa and her colleagues proposed are being

222
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:14.390
selected to operate in coalitions more so than females

223
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.309
have with regards to aggressing to uh uh aggressing

224
00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:22.469
against other males. And so you will have warfare.

225
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.059
Yes, but you will also have things like just

226
00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:33.299
more mundanely, the whole social psychology phenomenon of in

227
00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:39.080
and out groups. So males will more often identify

228
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:45.030
more strongly with some group identity. And with that

229
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.750
group identity, um, they will contrast themselves more and

230
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.109
have greater animosity towards an outgroup than what females

231
00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:58.869
have. And you'll have more coherency in that group

232
00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:01.190
than what you will have in a female group.

233
00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:04.469
Female groups can be considerably more fragmented than male

234
00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:09.630
groups. And so when, when males have this coalitional

235
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:16.090
psychology, that will also explain. Not only warfare, which

236
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.090
males are much more likely to engage in even

237
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.390
currently, uh, but also the whole in out group

238
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.729
and so you can apply that also to the

239
00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:32.770
study of political violence such as mass shootings, terrorism,

240
00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.989
and political assassinations.

241
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.520
Um, BUT let me just ask you then, uh,

242
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.789
but there are instances where, uh, some of these

243
00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:49.760
young males might act, uh, alone

244
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.390
or absolutely, because a group identity with us humans.

245
00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:57.539
I mean, it was, it was selected for a

246
00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:00.010
very different time than than we live in now.

247
00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:02.859
I mean, we used to live in groups of

248
00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:07.260
say 150 individuals, most of them related. And so

249
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.098
anyone outside that group was then tribal warfare, um,

250
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.618
a real existential threat. Uh, THIS is not so

251
00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:20.939
anymore, but we're carrying the psychology of our forefathers

252
00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:26.329
and foremothers. And so the internet. Can trick us

253
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.219
into believing that we are under threat to an

254
00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:34.849
extent that we Factually or not. And we carry

255
00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:38.359
these, uh, uh, the proneness for group identity and

256
00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:43.300
hostility towards others, uh, to an extent which, um,

257
00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:49.079
is quite unnecessary today. But the belief that it

258
00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:55.420
is necessary is profound. And an individual can physically

259
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.300
have a group identity, you know, physically be in

260
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.739
a football team, physically be in a team of

261
00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:05.939
supporters in their town, in their part of town.

262
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.030
Yes, but also the internet can create group identities.

263
00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:16.140
So you can have a lone actor that identifies

264
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.500
to something that they would perceive as bigger. Um,

265
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.560
AND even those because A tendency we see is

266
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.560
with regards to political violence where you have a

267
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.359
lone actor, not a lone actor. Characteristically, Quite typically

268
00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:42.520
has mental health issues and those who have some

269
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:47.859
delusions have delusions of belonging to something big. And

270
00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:51.560
we have examples of that in my country, Norway.

271
00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:58.380
Um, WE have individuals who weren't necessarily sane in

272
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.140
the period where they committed this act and a

273
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.869
part of their psychotic delusion. WAS that they were

274
00:19:04.869 --> 00:19:08.810
part of something bigger. So even the lone actors

275
00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:12.510
may very often have an idea on a psychological

276
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.550
level of belonging to something bigger. It just so

277
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.209
happens that these things don't exist.

278
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.589
Yeah, OK, so I, I mean this might be

279
00:19:23.589 --> 00:19:27.630
a very complex question and I'm not completely sure

280
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.790
if it's something that even from a criminology perspective

281
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.030
you have enough knowledge to answer and if, if

282
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.510
not, it's not a problem at all, but we'll

283
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:44.380
see. Do you think that Um, political ideology, and

284
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.849
I'm not talking about any specific political ideology, but

285
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:52.609
just political ideology in general might play a causal

286
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.329
role in political violence. I mean, do you think

287
00:19:56.329 --> 00:20:01.489
that, er, the specific political beliefs that people have

288
00:20:01.489 --> 00:20:06.569
might cause political violence or that, Uh, those beliefs

289
00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:10.689
or them being part of this or that, uh,

290
00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:16.689
political orientation is more of a post hoc rationalization

291
00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:20.609
that people use to commit political violence.

292
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.939
Well, both Martin, uh, Daly and Margot Wilson in

293
00:20:24.939 --> 00:20:29.380
their paper and, uh, Melissa McDonald and her colleagues

294
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.319
in their paper say that the male proneness towards,

295
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:41.719
uh, political status is something that has evolved. Uh,

296
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.260
BECAUSE political status can fend off male competition or

297
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:53.500
otherwise also translate into reproductive opportunities as females prefer

298
00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:00.290
men who have status who can access, control, and

299
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:07.599
share. Very importantly, share their resources. Um, SO this

300
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:12.439
drive towards political activism in males is understood by

301
00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:18.099
evolutionary psychologists as something that has a reproductive and

302
00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:21.719
and has therefore evolved. Um, SO the ambition, political

303
00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:25.989
ambition. Is um equal to any other sort of

304
00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:29.900
ambition that men may have with regards to something

305
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.839
that obtains resources, control, political influence. It all translates

306
00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:43.239
into reproductive opportunity, um, and people who commit. These

307
00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:47.650
atrocious actions do so often with a political conviction,

308
00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:52.140
but not always, and they might have a yearning

309
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.640
for status and. Then you're more looking at that

310
00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:03.239
the ideology is secondary to the status. That they're

311
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:06.359
looking for that would be uh that would be

312
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:10.959
your classical evolutionary psychological analysis is that this is

313
00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:17.140
first and foremost about um. Status and influence more

314
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.619
than the political ideology itself. So humans are, you

315
00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:25.979
know, a political ape because it gave a reproductive

316
00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:29.199
edge in our past and it still does give

317
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.979
reproductive edge.

318
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.540
Yeah, I mean, I asked you that because I

319
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.119
sometimes get the impression that some people are prone

320
00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:44.380
to political violence, not specifically because they are part

321
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.255
of this or that political group, but. But because

322
00:22:49.354 --> 00:22:53.185
the kind of political narrative that the group they

323
00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:58.584
identify with uses serves as a sort of justification

324
00:22:59.194 --> 00:23:02.535
that they use to commit political violence and not

325
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.520
And I mean it comes after the fact. It's

326
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.160
not a direct motivation. It's more of a, as

327
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.439
I said before, a post hoc rationalization for the

328
00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:20.359
fact that they want to or they feel prone

329
00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:24.319
to committing politically violent acts anyway.

330
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.790
Um, BUT prior to the, the violent act itself,

331
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.449
obviously there will have to have been some kind

332
00:23:31.449 --> 00:23:32.199
of justification.

333
00:23:32.849 --> 00:23:33.410
Yes, of

334
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.369
course, but yes, it isn't, it is, it's in

335
00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:40.650
human nature to want political power and influence and

336
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.369
status. Violence is a way of achieving it, but

337
00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:48.910
the thing is that terrorism, for instance, is highly

338
00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.930
inefficient to get what you want, whether you whether

339
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:57.130
your poli whether your ideology is strictly political or

340
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.410
has some religious aspect to it, a given, Mass

341
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.119
shooting, a given explosion, a given act of terrorism

342
00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:10.060
is very ineffective, but what it is effective towards

343
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.040
is gaining not um notoriety. You will become a

344
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.930
face and you will become a name thanks to,

345
00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:24.439
um, mass media, both the traditional media, but also

346
00:24:24.439 --> 00:24:28.989
social media. Um, IT is. It is a way

347
00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:34.449
of obtaining notoriety, um, a celebrium that you otherwise

348
00:24:34.449 --> 00:24:39.290
wouldn't get. And, um, the what we see is

349
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.650
that you will have political violence on both ends

350
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.425
of a given. SCALE, um, any religion, uh, any

351
00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:52.444
of the, the, the big religions lends itself to

352
00:24:52.905 --> 00:24:58.824
being used as, um, a reference for committing a

353
00:24:58.824 --> 00:25:03.055
violent act in the name of that religion. Um,

354
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.520
But the the the given person has perhaps gone

355
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.599
through a rapid period of radicalization prior to the

356
00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:18.380
given act, um, and they. They're more likely to

357
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.319
be suffering. With regards to the mental health rather

358
00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:29.780
than having some kind of, um, you know, coherent

359
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:36.599
political membership, uh, they won't necessarily have like some

360
00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:41.560
kind of well thought through political platform that is

361
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.459
more when you've got the coalitional political aggression. Um,

362
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.099
THE lone actors very seldom that you will find

363
00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:53.569
that they. Have some kind of political partisan membership

364
00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:58.060
that is coherent. Uh, IT might be a one

365
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.420
issue subject, for instance, um, but, but across the

366
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:08.880
board, what you have is marginalized individuals who, um,

367
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:16.020
often experience social exclusion, mostly then from the physical

368
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.290
environment, from the community. Um, SEEKING then instead as

369
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.770
a replacement, which is a poor replacement and a

370
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:29.050
dangerous replacement on the internet, where there's then a

371
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.520
quick short period of radicalization. So it's more like,

372
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:42.020
um, marginalized social exclusion, uh, mental health issues. But

373
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:47.800
it is in human nature, uh, to aspire to

374
00:26:48.099 --> 00:26:52.380
status and to you and and and in, in

375
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.060
a male psychology more so than the female psychology

376
00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.369
to use violent methods that can be crime, that

377
00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:02.680
can be homicide, but it can also be political

378
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.489
aggression. It's a part, but, but it's an it's

379
00:27:06.489 --> 00:27:10.969
an extreme situations, um, and you can get more

380
00:27:10.969 --> 00:27:14.910
like, The old fashioned, um, you and I are

381
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.030
both of an age where we remember terrorism being

382
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.760
like terrorist groups who did have a coherent partisan

383
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.349
membership with thought through political convictions, who would use

384
00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:28.790
the threat of violence to get something that they

385
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.189
wanted, and then didn't commit the necessary the politic

386
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:34.369
act if they got what they wanted. That's, that's

387
00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:39.030
an old fashioned idea of terrorism that we seem

388
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.329
to have been, we seem to have left behind

389
00:27:41.329 --> 00:27:44.380
in. In our current societies,

390
00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:49.500
mhm, but I mean in terms of um perhaps

391
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.000
demographics, uh, we have to also, of course, there's

392
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
the evolution, they evolved psychology, but then there's also

393
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.640
social and economic factors that can play a role

394
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.180
here, right? You're, you're talking about social. Isolation, there's

395
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.209
perhaps some of these people perhaps are also unemployed.

396
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.859
They don't have many job prospects or future prospects

397
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:18.380
and stuff like that, so they are in a

398
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.550
way, many of them politically and socially disenfranchised,

399
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.189
yes,

400
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.359
as well, right?

401
00:28:25.459 --> 00:28:30.640
Yes, but with clear mental health issues. Um, YOU

402
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.989
see, when it comes to mass shootings that may

403
00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:36.869
or may not be associated with some sort of

404
00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:40.829
political ideology or religious ideology, and it can be

405
00:28:40.829 --> 00:28:45.949
quite spurious as you were suggesting, um, uh, what

406
00:28:45.949 --> 00:28:49.069
they, what they decide I'm doing this because to

407
00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:53.709
justify 80% of mass shooters in Europe in modern

408
00:28:53.709 --> 00:28:55.030
time have been suicidal.

409
00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:59.719
Oh yeah, tell us more about that aspect of

410
00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:04.359
their suicidality because er at least at first sight

411
00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:07.400
it might seem like a bit of an evolutionary

412
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:14.280
puzzle. Why would someone er who would be motivated

413
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.119
to commit political violence for the reasons you explained

414
00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:23.160
before, would also be suicidal, because I, I mean

415
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.040
if they are suicidal and if they die. By

416
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.920
suicide, then they don't reap any benefits from it,

417
00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:38.599
right. Uh, WELL, there's a hole. Filed on um

418
00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:42.969
uh suicidality and evolutionary psychological analysis of that which

419
00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:46.930
we don't have time to get into. Um, THAT'S

420
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.890
an interview in itself. Um, AND it's a puzzle.

421
00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:55.295
Yes, but we do have. Hypothesis, uh, attempting to

422
00:29:55.295 --> 00:30:00.185
answer it, um, some suggesting that rather than trying

423
00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:03.864
to have an evolutionary psychological analysis of why we

424
00:30:03.864 --> 00:30:09.145
commit suicide and the adaptations, uh, that underpin committing

425
00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:13.775
suicide, um, you have those currently suggesting Todd Shackelford,

426
00:30:13.824 --> 00:30:16.665
I believe a former guest of yours, suggesting that

427
00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:22.469
actually, um, the adaptations is not committing suicide. Um,

428
00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:25.800
BUT this is when I was suggesting earlier on

429
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.920
in our interview that perhaps we should take a

430
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.640
look at Hamilton's work. Now Hamilton, you and your

431
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.040
audience will be very familiar with his work on

432
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.640
inclusive fitness and altruism. Why will the individual do

433
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.719
something that damages itself to help others? Well, that's

434
00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:45.560
because those others we are most likely likely to

435
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.880
help in such circumstances are people we share a

436
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.055
genotype with. From our family members. So we're more

437
00:30:53.055 --> 00:30:56.145
likely to do altruistic acts when it benefits someone

438
00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:59.064
who shares our genotype. Now again, why, why do

439
00:30:59.064 --> 00:31:02.305
we then help other people like donating blood, kidneys,

440
00:31:02.464 --> 00:31:05.665
running into burning buildings, etc. Well, again, you have

441
00:31:05.665 --> 00:31:07.364
to then look at the fact that we used

442
00:31:07.364 --> 00:31:12.305
to live in groups of 150 individuals who mostly

443
00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:16.064
were related to us. Um, BUT his work then

444
00:31:16.064 --> 00:31:20.329
on altruism, Hamilton himself and I Greatly recommend your

445
00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:23.849
audience to read this. He then used these principles

446
00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:26.689
to also look at spite. We are willing to

447
00:31:26.689 --> 00:31:30.109
damage ourselves as long as we're damaging other people

448
00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:33.510
a little bit more. That's spite. We will take

449
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.489
a cost to ourselves as long as we know

450
00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:38.250
we're damaging someone else just a little bit more.

451
00:31:39.709 --> 00:31:44.900
Now, but still, anything with regards to. Um, WHETHER

452
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.900
it's homicide, suicide, altruism, spite, we have to remember

453
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.579
when we're using evolutionary psychology, we are not socio

454
00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:55.459
biologists. So so, uh, uh, you know, I mean,

455
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.359
a socio biologists, socio biologists would be looking at

456
00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:04.500
analysis analysis on a behavioral level. This behavior, does

457
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.739
this behavior make sense, evolutionary speaking. But in evolutionary

458
00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:12.219
psychology, we, we analyze things on a, on a

459
00:32:12.219 --> 00:32:18.290
psychological level. Now it psychologically men have a proneness

460
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:26.339
towards wanting influence, wanting power, wanting status, wanting celebrom

461
00:32:27.329 --> 00:32:32.709
and not uh notoriety. Being known, being a name.

462
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.380
You're willing to do quite a bit to do

463
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.449
that, and Now I'm, I'm, I apologize for the

464
00:32:40.449 --> 00:32:42.380
words I'm using now, but I'm trying to make,

465
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.170
get a point across, but then. For someone who

466
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:52.489
has no other avenues. Getting famous, doing something that

467
00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:56.719
media is willing to cover. Where you know guarantee

468
00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:59.359
they're going to show your picture, they're going to

469
00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:01.439
give you a name, they're going to give you

470
00:33:01.439 --> 00:33:04.400
what you crave, and you have no other avenues

471
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.400
for getting. You might try to attempt to kill

472
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.410
as many people as possible before you kill yourself,

473
00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:13.880
or as it also happens sometimes, I said 80%

474
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.930
are suicidal. That means some of them kill themselves

475
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.839
before the police get to them. That means some

476
00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:21.160
of them kill themselves before the police even enter

477
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.900
the scene. But some of them are also shot

478
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.880
by the police, and it's a phenomenon that they

479
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.280
call suicide by cop, that you do something so

480
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.839
extreme that you know that the police will kill

481
00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:34.739
you because perhaps Shackelford and his colleagues are correct

482
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.229
in that. It is in human nature to not

483
00:33:38.229 --> 00:33:41.810
hurt ourselves. It is. It is difficult to kill

484
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.310
other people and it is difficult to kill yourself.

485
00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.839
And when you see these mass shooters, they often

486
00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:52.209
have considerably more weapons with them. Uh, COMPARED to

487
00:33:52.209 --> 00:33:57.130
the number of people they actually victimize, uh, uh,

488
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.180
certainly lethally victimize, um, because they might be taken

489
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.180
off guard at how hard it is for a

490
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.380
human being to kill another human being and how

491
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.219
hard it actually is to harm ourselves, to actually

492
00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:13.500
kill ourselves. But it does speak to an absolute

493
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.340
desperation. It does, it speaks to an absolute desperation.

494
00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.589
Yeah, uh, so look, we're focusing mostly on or

495
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:26.678
exclusively on political violence, but since we're also including

496
00:34:26.678 --> 00:34:29.878
mass shooters here, do you think that what you

497
00:34:29.878 --> 00:34:34.958
just said would also apply to school shootings because

498
00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:38.759
there the targets are mostly children, right, who are

499
00:34:38.759 --> 00:34:40.539
not political actors.

500
00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:44.580
Well, we had a terrorist in Norway who chose

501
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:49.100
children specifically. Now he made the case that they

502
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.739
were the future of a certain political party he

503
00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.918
believed was damaging Norway. Um, BUT the thing is

504
00:34:55.918 --> 00:35:00.878
also that children are an easy target, um, but

505
00:35:00.878 --> 00:35:06.458
you're also very, very guaranteed that media will cover

506
00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:13.949
the case if you do. Something so grotesque. Mhm.

507
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.520
Yeah. And it also speaks to the mental health

508
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.330
of, of the person. Because I hope your audience

509
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.780
doesn't misunderstand. I'm not saying that we are evolved

510
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.540
to do these acts. Yes, of course we have,

511
00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:30.219
what we have is an evolved psychology that means

512
00:35:30.219 --> 00:35:35.100
that when someone is utterly marginalized and is struggling

513
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.459
with their mental health, we shouldn't be surprised that

514
00:35:39.459 --> 00:35:43.179
on occasion these things will happen, and we certainly

515
00:35:43.179 --> 00:35:46.540
shouldn't be surprised that these things happen when we

516
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.520
do have a media. That does reward these acts.

517
00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:56.820
With celebdum. They, we, we are exposed to the

518
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.939
picture sometimes sooner than they actually are confident in

519
00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:05.229
who the perpetrator is. Before we know anything about

520
00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:08.739
their mental health, uh, names are given, and when

521
00:36:08.739 --> 00:36:12.260
the audience, when normal human beings are given this

522
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.010
information. It can turn very ugly.

523
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.310
Uh, uh, SO, yeah, I, I was going to

524
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.500
just, uh, comment on another thing on that relates

525
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.679
to Doctor Daly's work, but before that, since you

526
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.590
touched on the media, uh, I mean, I, I

527
00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.510
guess that you've already answered this question at least

528
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:40.090
indirectly, but should the media divulge personal information like

529
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:45.929
the name. About mass shooters and terrorists and their

530
00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:50.929
pictures and so on. I mean, haven't, um, criminologists

531
00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:55.399
and other kinds of related experts been warning for

532
00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:59.409
a very long time that this can produce copycat

533
00:36:59.409 --> 00:36:59.909
effects.

534
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:09.770
Um, AND. And you are rewarding them with precisely

535
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:14.389
what they wanted and why they did it. You're

536
00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:17.280
giving them what they wanted. And we have just

537
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.639
had a case in Norway, uh, where a young

538
00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:27.439
male just turned 18, um, commits a homicide and

539
00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:31.040
is claiming that this, he's the one claiming this

540
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.260
was a terrorist act that he wanted to create

541
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.949
to create fear in a certain segment of the

542
00:37:39.949 --> 00:37:46.139
population and the media are. You know, reiterating this,

543
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.500
they're communicating what he wanted to do, and they're

544
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.709
also showing his picture and his name. And there

545
00:37:53.709 --> 00:37:59.600
has been, there's been one newspaper that has um

546
00:38:00.989 --> 00:38:03.629
gone a different route than what is, what is

547
00:38:03.629 --> 00:38:07.110
a normal procedure in media all over the world,

548
00:38:07.149 --> 00:38:10.469
and they have decided not to show his picture.

549
00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:13.540
Uh, I don't know if they've changed that in

550
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.300
the past couple of days because now there's a

551
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.419
court case, but this young boy said to the

552
00:38:18.419 --> 00:38:23.280
media, uh, through his defense lawyer that he wanted

553
00:38:23.459 --> 00:38:26.219
to have his picture taken in court, because the

554
00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:29.780
early court procedures have started already. And he said

555
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.139
through his defense attorney. I want my picture taken

556
00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:36.939
in court. That should be like the first sign

557
00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:40.340
for media to, you know, maybe not. And they

558
00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.459
have discussed, should they, should they not? And there

559
00:38:42.459 --> 00:38:44.830
are arguments for why, because it's a serious crime.

560
00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:47.860
Homicide is a serious crime. If this actually was

561
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.580
a terrorist act as well, that's a serious crime.

562
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.949
The public should know it's media's responsibility to let

563
00:38:54.949 --> 00:39:01.330
the public know what's going on. But Yes, as

564
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.770
a criminologist, as a homicide researcher, as a violence

565
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.840
researcher, I'm someone who has read the literature and

566
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.010
all these decades. And I remember the 90s and

567
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.129
I remember the American experts being very firm on

568
00:39:14.129 --> 00:39:16.590
like school mass shootings over there. They've had what,

569
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.250
300 mass shootings in the state so far this

570
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:23.209
year. Even the same week as a very famous

571
00:39:23.209 --> 00:39:28.870
political assassination which overshadowed. Uh, THE mass shooting with

572
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:36.250
considerably more and younger victims. Yeah. One has to

573
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.100
ask, when will they learn? And there's only one

574
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.100
country that I see seems to be taking this

575
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.479
lesson serious, and that's France. About 10 years ago,

576
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.560
um, They find not, not, not, not all media

577
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.000
in France. This is not something that all media

578
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.679
in France agree on. Um, IT isn't like across

579
00:39:59.679 --> 00:40:05.000
the board decision, and they the different news media

580
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.040
outlets, they go case by case, but some of

581
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.860
them have taken a very principled stance in that

582
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.379
we will pixelate pictures and we would will withhold

583
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.219
names. Uh, WITHHOLDING names is a little bit more

584
00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:24.500
problematic from a journalistic perspective, from a trust perspective,

585
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:32.719
but pixelating pictures is a no brainer. Um, JUST,

586
00:40:32.939 --> 00:40:35.540
you really shouldn't do that. And I, now I'm

587
00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.929
not a journalist, and so I can't make that

588
00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:42.959
sort of. Pros and cons, but from, from my

589
00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:46.399
point of view, who, who writes about and does

590
00:40:46.399 --> 00:40:51.449
interviews on what's the psychology underpinning these acts. Celebrum,

591
00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:55.909
a want for, um, fame to the extent of

592
00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:59.290
accepting that that's going to be not, uh, notoriety,

593
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.770
like a negative, famous, famous for doing something horrific.

594
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.649
It's such a strong motivating factor for these infringed,

595
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:17.659
socially isolated individuals who 80% of them in Europe

596
00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:20.889
are suicidal, so they are struggling with mental issues.

597
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:26.300
Other, other of them are having psychotic symptoms, um.

598
00:41:27.459 --> 00:41:29.229
Like we're having a court case in these days

599
00:41:29.229 --> 00:41:31.790
in Norway of someone who was supposed to have

600
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.669
done a terrorist act, um, but as it turns

601
00:41:35.669 --> 00:41:39.330
out, a couple of years later. He was so

602
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.729
severely psychotic because he hadn't been treated for his

603
00:41:42.729 --> 00:41:46.810
psychiatric symptoms. And if he had been discovered prior

604
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.889
to his terrorist act, his, uh, his stepsister might

605
00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:53.350
be alive today.

606
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.850
Uh, OH, OK. So, uh, I was going to

607
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.050
ask you another kind of question, but, uh, let

608
00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.290
me then touch already on that a little bit

609
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:04.590
more on the topic of mental illness because I

610
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.969
guess that this is a very sensitive topic and,

611
00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:11.250
uh, I, I think it's important for people to

612
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.129
get, uh, the correct information here. I mean, please

613
00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:16.949
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that

614
00:42:17.689 --> 00:42:22.600
the correct thing to say is that Most, the

615
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.919
vast majority of people who suffer from mental illness

616
00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:33.780
do not commit crime, but, but, but proportionally. There

617
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.300
are more people who suffer from mental illness who

618
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.810
commit crime than people from the general population. I

619
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.080
mean, is this the correct information, or

620
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.020
crime is a large category of behavior, um, but

621
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.739
if we just stick to mass shootings, 80% of

622
00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:56.889
them in Europe are suicidal, and I think that

623
00:42:56.889 --> 00:43:02.899
number is telling enough, uh, so. If we can

624
00:43:02.899 --> 00:43:09.429
do more to avoid Infringement or the perception of

625
00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:15.159
being infringed, trust in the political system, uh, community

626
00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:21.379
engagement, mental health, uh, being taken care of, discovered

627
00:43:21.379 --> 00:43:25.590
at an early age, and, and, and help being

628
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:32.919
offered. To more young men and also not showing

629
00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:37.139
them on a daily basis that a quick way

630
00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:44.449
to celebdom. To fame. IS to Kill other people.

631
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:49.760
No. So, uh, uh, let me ask you now

632
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.520
because we've been focusing a lot on males. How

633
00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:00.639
about females? I mean, are, are there also female

634
00:44:00.639 --> 00:44:04.239
are there also female terrorists? Are there also females

635
00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:07.560
who commit acts of acts of political violence or

636
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:07.879
not?

637
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:14.330
You know, in modern history, 60% of rebel groups

638
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:20.689
have had female members. So yes, the typical male

639
00:44:20.689 --> 00:44:25.030
warrior in historic times was males. There's no question

640
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.689
about that. Sometimes you'll get some. You know, the

641
00:44:29.689 --> 00:44:32.479
odd. And I mean that in every way, the

642
00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:37.800
odd article saying that females were warriors, females did

643
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:44.239
big game hunting. Generally no, generally no, generally, females

644
00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:46.360
don't have the upper body strength of males do

645
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.830
on a group level. So small game hunting, yes,

646
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.639
but on occasion you will have formidable women. Um,

647
00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:59.260
WHO didn't get pregnant and who could join in

648
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:04.500
in warfare, tribal or larger, and join in on

649
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.320
a wild game hunting, but they were so few

650
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.760
and far between that they haven't shaped. They didn't

651
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.000
become grandmothers like those other females who took care

652
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.379
of themselves throughout pregnancy and nursing. Um, BUT I

653
00:45:19.379 --> 00:45:19.459
mean,

654
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.340
I mean like, like the Viking shield maidens. I'm,

655
00:45:23.719 --> 00:45:27.479
I, I'm, I'm, I'm making this, I'm, I'm making

656
00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:30.040
this joke because you're from Norway.

657
00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:35.429
I've got Edward Monk on my wall there, um.

658
00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:38.729
But yeah, few and far between, they existed, but

659
00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:42.050
not to the extent that they have shaped, uh,

660
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.689
the, the psychology of women today or the physique

661
00:45:46.689 --> 00:45:51.149
of women today, um, although you will on occasion

662
00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:57.239
have formidable women. Absolutely. Um, BUT in modern days

663
00:45:57.239 --> 00:46:00.780
when women can control things to a greater extent

664
00:46:01.239 --> 00:46:06.969
than we could historically speaking. 60% of groups that

665
00:46:06.969 --> 00:46:14.290
are termed defined operate operationalized that, sorry, uh, as

666
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:18.729
rebel groups, 60% have female members. Now what those

667
00:46:18.729 --> 00:46:21.729
female members are doing, one has to study that

668
00:46:21.729 --> 00:46:25.560
research more closely, but they actually have female members

669
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:31.370
at all. And you've got numbers from Europol showing

670
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:36.219
that 5% of terrorist plots in Europe in modern

671
00:46:36.219 --> 00:46:41.429
times, current day Europe, 20% of them have females

672
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.129
associated to plotting those terrorist acts in Europe, according

673
00:46:46.129 --> 00:46:55.500
to Europol. So, females. Do perpetrate, engage, enable, assist

674
00:46:55.739 --> 00:47:01.100
terrorist acts and political violence, that's the thing, and

675
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:09.389
Europol and Europol and. The United Nations are continuously

676
00:47:09.389 --> 00:47:13.510
on a regular basis warning about this and trying

677
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.300
to draw attention to it. But no, not to

678
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.209
the same extent as men. And that's the third

679
00:47:20.209 --> 00:47:22.979
hypothesis that I promised in the beginning of our

680
00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:27.139
interview, which was proposed by Ann Campbell, the late

681
00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:30.899
Ann Campbell, the incredible Ann Campbell, uh, in a

682
00:47:30.899 --> 00:47:35.969
paper from 1999, which I know I have, um,

683
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.860
jazzed about, uh, in interviews with you previously published

684
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.540
in 1999 called Staying Alive. And that's her her

685
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.639
hypothesis. Again, just like Robert Trivers showed us we

686
00:47:47.639 --> 00:47:50.520
had to do, refer back to the reproductive role

687
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.379
of the sexes if you're trying to identify the

688
00:47:53.379 --> 00:47:58.149
evolutionary origin and function and possible adaptive role of

689
00:47:58.149 --> 00:48:00.620
a given trait. And she said that women have

690
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:04.689
evolved. Due to 9 months of gestation, up to

691
00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:07.929
4 years of nursing children in our species, in

692
00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:11.889
our evolutionary past in hunter-gatherer societies, we had to

693
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:14.409
stay alive, so we are selected, females are selected

694
00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:21.500
towards hesitating against. Committing violent acts. However, um, throughout

695
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.580
her article, she warns against ignoring the fact that

696
00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:30.699
women are capable of and do perpetrate violent acts.

697
00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:34.199
She warns against just pathologizing women for doing it,

698
00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:37.540
and you can use her work to also approach.

699
00:48:37.955 --> 00:48:42.435
Female political violence, be it mass shootings, be it

700
00:48:42.435 --> 00:48:46.675
terrorism, be it political assassinations, women can also do

701
00:48:46.675 --> 00:48:50.875
this, and I haven't studied myself, but if there

702
00:48:50.875 --> 00:48:55.274
are any budding researchers out there on female political

703
00:48:55.274 --> 00:48:59.280
violence, my suggestion would be. That we know that

704
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.290
women are often on the left side of the

705
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.889
political scale, so you're more likely to find the

706
00:49:03.889 --> 00:49:07.969
political terrorists there. Also, we know that females are

707
00:49:07.969 --> 00:49:14.169
more prone to stronger. Religiousiosity than males you might

708
00:49:14.169 --> 00:49:16.209
find them there as well. You also know that

709
00:49:16.209 --> 00:49:19.129
on the left side of the scale, the political

710
00:49:19.129 --> 00:49:25.270
violence will damage property, whereas right wing political violence,

711
00:49:25.649 --> 00:49:31.810
it targets human beings, people. Left-wing political violence targets

712
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.860
buildings, and so all in all, there's great reason

713
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.939
to believe that females might engage. There is one

714
00:49:39.939 --> 00:49:44.689
terrorist organization, ISIS, who has taken this more serious

715
00:49:44.689 --> 00:49:48.189
than any politician or group of researchers with regards

716
00:49:48.189 --> 00:49:54.610
to um um recruiting females. And that's the ISIS

717
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:59.590
in their caliphate. They were targeting with specific propaganda

718
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:05.300
targeting females to um to join their caliphate and

719
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.669
their movement. So they were targeting females on purpose.

720
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:12.179
And so Politicians and people who want to prevent

721
00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:15.520
this and researchers who want to study it, they

722
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.459
should, they should have a look at the forgotten

723
00:50:17.459 --> 00:50:20.639
female gaze in all of this because females too

724
00:50:20.639 --> 00:50:26.000
want political influence, one status, um, and can also

725
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.290
decide to cause damage. Aggress with in that regards,

726
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:39.389
and the most well known. A terrorist organization. Um,

727
00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:46.370
IN the 1900s was the suffragettes movement. Yeah. They

728
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:49.449
were deemed, they were termed, they were considered, they

729
00:50:49.449 --> 00:50:53.419
were categorized to be terrorists, and they would damage

730
00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:56.889
themselves for the cause of getting the right to

731
00:50:56.889 --> 00:51:01.270
vote. Um, SO what Campbell says in her paper,

732
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:06.409
which I absolutely demand that your audience reads, is

733
00:51:06.409 --> 00:51:10.330
she said that. If you appreciate the female gaze,

734
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.169
you can identify at what point does the scales

735
00:51:14.169 --> 00:51:18.449
tip for a female where a female is willing

736
00:51:18.449 --> 00:51:23.030
to perpetrate violence after all. Mhm. Because we are

737
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:28.300
not evolved to just be passive and meek. We're

738
00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:28.739
not

739
00:51:30.189 --> 00:51:33.669
Uh, OK, so I have one final question for

740
00:51:33.669 --> 00:51:37.070
you. Um, I mean, which is more of a

741
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:42.229
general commentary. I mean, since you're a criminologist, this

742
00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:44.790
is something that we've already touched a little bit,

743
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.790
I think in our previous conversation, but I would

744
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.270
bet, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I

745
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.889
would bet that uh this sort of thing bothers

746
00:51:54.889 --> 00:51:59.929
you. I mean, whenever. Such an act like this,

747
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:06.250
um, I mean, terrorist act, mass shooting, and assassination,

748
00:52:06.409 --> 00:52:09.229
some act of political violence, of course, or even

749
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:17.689
a school shooting, uh, even sometimes even before we

750
00:52:17.689 --> 00:52:24.669
know anything at all. About the perpetrators, people start

751
00:52:24.669 --> 00:52:31.280
immediately speculating, and they bring out their pitchforks, and

752
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.760
they are already saying who is responsible for this

753
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.120
act. It's this side or that side or Um,

754
00:52:40.219 --> 00:52:44.459
or they say that it sometimes we hear that

755
00:52:44.459 --> 00:52:47.879
from some people that it has nothing at all

756
00:52:48.219 --> 00:52:52.820
to do with mental illness or with social and

757
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.060
economic issues, that doesn't matter at all. I, I

758
00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:01.739
mean, doesn't it bother you that, um, how should

759
00:53:01.739 --> 00:53:04.459
I put it? I was going to say that

760
00:53:04.459 --> 00:53:08.189
society or the media allows for this kind of

761
00:53:08.189 --> 00:53:12.500
speculation to run amok, but uh as a criminologist,

762
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.620
as a criminologist, doesn't it bother you that people

763
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:24.959
have this impulse or this tendency to uh get

764
00:53:24.979 --> 00:53:31.320
to conclusions when the criminal. Process itself, I mean

765
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.570
what police have to go through, what investigators have

766
00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:40.510
to go through, and then, and then the trial

767
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:43.969
and the evidence that people have to evaluate and

768
00:53:43.969 --> 00:53:48.360
so on and so forth is usually so complex,

769
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.290
but people just don't care or don't seem to

770
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.850
care at all about that complexity.

771
00:53:57.139 --> 00:54:01.520
And what you're describing is this tribal coalitional psychology

772
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.699
of in out groups. Uh, THERE'S a paper I

773
00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:12.260
read recently, um, which I really enjoyed. Um, I'm

774
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.780
not very good at pronouncing, um, names from other

775
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:21.750
languages than the Anglo and Norwegian. Um, Moncrief is

776
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.469
how I pronounce it with my British accent, published

777
00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:28.750
a paper in 2024. And he suggested that the

778
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:33.689
reason why terrorism is, um, so hard to define

779
00:54:34.199 --> 00:54:38.699
is because scholars have a different approach than lay

780
00:54:38.699 --> 00:54:44.949
people have. Uh, AND he looked at research, seeing

781
00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:49.649
how Uh, lay people, you know, what will make

782
00:54:49.649 --> 00:54:54.030
lay people more or less likely to categorize an

783
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.159
act as terrorism, and one of the things here

784
00:54:58.159 --> 00:55:01.350
is that the research shows is that if it's

785
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.989
performed by an outgroup member, we're more likely to

786
00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:06.899
say it was a terrorist act than if it

787
00:55:06.899 --> 00:55:10.969
was one of our own. And his point, his

788
00:55:10.969 --> 00:55:14.649
overall point in his paper, or at least maybe

789
00:55:14.649 --> 00:55:16.169
it wasn't, but it certainly is the one I

790
00:55:16.169 --> 00:55:19.090
remember that my the the the message I took

791
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:24.050
from it was, um, that because lay people have

792
00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:29.270
ideas of what terrorism is. That suggests that both

793
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:36.360
perpetration and risk assessment. Um, HAS been selected for,

794
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.389
and we have therefore been under selection pressure to,

795
00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:44.820
uh, not only the perpetration of political violence, um,

796
00:55:44.899 --> 00:55:47.659
but also to do a risk assessment. So what

797
00:55:47.659 --> 00:55:51.260
you're describing is people trying to do a risk

798
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.419
assessment, trying to figure out whether it was one

799
00:55:54.419 --> 00:55:56.340
of their own or not. Was this a terrorist

800
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.580
act or not, uh, to protect themselves, to try

801
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:03.810
to figure out what has happened. But humans are

802
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:08.270
not very good. At this, and that's why we

803
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:11.540
have created professionals to do this for us and

804
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:16.449
I was doing an interview after a mass shooting

805
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.270
that happened in Sweden in February and I was

806
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:25.760
doing a Interview on a live debate show in

807
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.800
here in Norway, and the first question I got

808
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.919
from the anchor. Brilliant anchor. He asks me, um,

809
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.989
how can we understand the psychology of someone who,

810
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.209
who commits a mass shooting and then kills themselves?

811
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:41.919
And my first answer, unprepared, um, but it's a,

812
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.159
it's a, it's an answer to your question, uh,

813
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:47.649
is, um, if you want an answer, go to

814
00:56:47.649 --> 00:56:50.550
research, don't go to social media. Social media is

815
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.530
dangerous on so many levels. It's dangerous with regards

816
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:57.350
to encouraging such acts. It's dangerous with regards to.

817
00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:01.729
The aftermath of such acts. Um, SO social media

818
00:57:01.729 --> 00:57:08.280
is a terrifying place. And I, and whereas I

819
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:13.060
would have hoped for, and I do encourage traditional

820
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:19.449
media outlets to stay sober. I think lately we're

821
00:57:19.449 --> 00:57:24.669
seeing less and less sobriety from them, but, Yeah,

822
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:26.070
I think that I think that has to be

823
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.870
my long winded as always answers, as, as you

824
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.429
know, I, my answers are never short. I always

825
00:57:31.429 --> 00:57:33.820
give answers that last like 150 minutes, and I,

826
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:36.469
I apologize to them. I've got very long winded

827
00:57:36.469 --> 00:57:38.790
answers this time as well on your show. Thank

828
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:42.469
you so much for having me. And I hope

829
00:57:42.469 --> 00:57:43.750
to see you again a 5th time.

830
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.649
No, of course, uh, and by the way, just

831
00:57:46.649 --> 00:57:50.129
before we, uh, I end the recording, just to

832
00:57:50.129 --> 00:57:52.449
let the audience know if they're not aware of

833
00:57:52.449 --> 00:57:55.770
that, because I mentioned Doctor Daly's interview. I also

834
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:58.610
have an interview with Doctor Robert Rivers on the

835
00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:02.530
show from 2019. So some of the things referenced

836
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.850
here, you can go there and listen from the

837
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.489
man himself,

838
00:58:08.729 --> 00:58:10.850
from the man himself, the legend.

839
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:15.649
Yeah. So, Doctor Tessen, it's always a big, big,

840
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.370
big, massive pleasure to have you on the show

841
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.989
and uh, as you said, I'm also looking forward

842
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:25.280
to a 5th interview somewhere in the future because

843
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.090
it's always fascinating to talk with you.

844
