00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.210
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.369
today I'm joined by Doctor Manveer Singh. This is

4
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.039
our 3rd time together. She is an assistant professor

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.770
of anthropology at the University of California Davis. I

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.809
will be leaving links to our first two interviews

7
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.819
in the description, and we're going to talk today

8
00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.989
about his A book, Shamanism, the Timeless Religion. So

9
00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.510
Doctor Singh, welcome back to the show. It's always

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.979
a pleasure to talk with you.

11
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:35.430
Yeah, thanks for having me, Ricardo. Always, always a

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.220
pleasure to be on.

13
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.619
So let's start perhaps with the most basic question

14
00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:43.939
here, what is shamanism?

15
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:48.479
Yeah, so it's a basic question. It's also a

16
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.299
highly debated question. So the way that I define

17
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.520
it in the book, um, which follows some other

18
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.680
scholars, is a practice in which a specialist enters

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.040
a non-ordinary state, also called trans, sometimes called ecstasy,

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.680
and Thinking about all of those similarly, just non-ordinary

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.150
behavior, non-ordinary state to engage with unseen realities, often

22
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.519
unseen agents and provide services like healing and divination.

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
So I think those three features for my definition

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.800
at least are critical. The altered states, the unseen

25
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.919
realities are unseen agents, and the healing divination or

26
00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:24.800
other services.

27
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.870
And how will the shamanism in human societies do

28
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.599
we have a good idea of that?

29
00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:36.949
I mean, that is also a very debated question.

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.989
So in the book, I argue that it is

31
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.709
very old, that it's probably as old as um

32
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.199
cognitive modernity or behavioral behavioral modernity. So as long

33
00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:51.919
as we have been behaviorally and cognitively recognizably human,

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.830
I argue that we've probably had shamanism, um. But

35
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.269
it's hard to get. Of course, archaeological evidence or

36
00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:03.779
other evidence, the farther back you go.

37
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.240
Mhm. And what kinds of evidence can we draw

38
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.490
from when trying to determine whether shamanism was present

39
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.500
in prehistoric societies?

40
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.619
Yeah, so I would say there are a couple

41
00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.610
different strategies or a couple different domains of evidence.

42
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.259
One is Um, essentially evidence from the past. So

43
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.059
some people will point to burials, they will point

44
00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.419
to rock art, they will point to, um, you

45
00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:37.149
know, headgear that is found in archaeological contexts. Um,

46
00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:41.139
THESE are all interesting, and they are helpful to

47
00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.619
some degree, but they're also very hard to interpret.

48
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.460
So some people are very eager to interpret particular

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.139
finds as evidence of shamanism or evidence of buried

50
00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.860
shamans, you know, it might be a woman who

51
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.460
is deformed, who um is buried with all kinds

52
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.059
of uh animal bones and is buried in a

53
00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.470
very particular way and people, you know, there are

54
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.100
a couple of examples like this where people have

55
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.440
called those buried shamans, but Um, it's, it's actually

56
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.279
very hard to confirm that. It's very easy to

57
00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.679
fall into this kind of interpretive gymnastics where you

58
00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.320
want to see something and but it's actually open

59
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.639
to many more interpretations, and something goes similarly for

60
00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.479
rock art. Um, SO there's some rock art that

61
00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.059
people have argued was produced by shamans in these

62
00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.880
trans states, other rock art people will argue actually

63
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.000
depicts shamans, but that is again very open to

64
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.649
interpretation, open to debate. So that's one way of

65
00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.770
making this claim, but another way, um, so there

66
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.970
are two other related ways. One is to actually

67
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.610
look at shamanism among contemporary societies. So, shamanism is

68
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.809
ubiquitous. It's found almost among almost all hunter gatherer

69
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.729
societies. And so, on that basis, we can infer

70
00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.639
that it was likely present among our ancestors. Um,

71
00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.460
AND we can infer that there are two forms

72
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.220
of infants you can make there. One is, um,

73
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.970
Like, uh, Insofar as human societies today have have

74
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.770
shamanism, then um it seems that there is something

75
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.889
about our minds, our cultures that uh predisposes shamanism

76
00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.290
to emerge. Uh, OTHER people will say that look

77
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.230
at shamanism around the world, you see it everywhere,

78
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.170
that means that some common cultural ancestor had shamans

79
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.890
that, you know, some African Edenic population had shamanism

80
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.329
and then it diffused to all of them, um.

81
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.399
Now, I disagree with this, this second interpretation, but

82
00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.739
the point more generally is that because shamanism is

83
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:38.230
so ubiquitous among contemporary societies, it suggests that it

84
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.440
was probably also present among our ancestors. Um, SO

85
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.640
that's the second domain of evidence, and then the

86
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.149
third is kind of a more psychological approach. Shamanism

87
00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:48.549
seems to really reflect and gel with our psychology,

88
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.750
um, and we can kind of dig into that,

89
00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.000
but based on that, then you can also start

90
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.470
to argue that it probably, um, was very compelling

91
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.559
to our ancestors' psychology as well.

92
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.839
Mhm. Yes, we're going to come back to that

93
00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.100
bit about the sort of psychological foundations of shamanism

94
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.760
in a bit. Uh, BUT how common is shamanism

95
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.600
across human societies? Is it a human universal or

96
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.640
anything close to a human universal?

97
00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:22.950
Yeah, so it is near universal. So if we

98
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.040
think about hunter gatherers, there was a a study

99
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.390
by peoples at all, um. Yeah, I think they

100
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.179
missed a couple of examples, but that would suggest

101
00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:36.459
it's, you know, maybe among 95% of hunter gatherers,

102
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.040
other societies or other studies suggest that it's uh

103
00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:47.829
at a similar frequency among um non-industrialized societies. Um,

104
00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:52.579
And we should recognize that by the definition that

105
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:55.250
I'm using, this would include mediums, it would include

106
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.140
many profits, it would include transchanneers what are often

107
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.339
called witch doctors, individuals who are entering these non-ordinary

108
00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.339
states, engaging with unseen realities and providing services. So

109
00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.660
it's, it's ubiquitous, it's near universal. There are a

110
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.769
couple of societies in which we don't find it,

111
00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.220
um, but those are very interesting very often. So

112
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.339
some of the hunter gatherer societies that we know

113
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.179
lacked shamanism in recent history, we can actually infer

114
00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.600
that they had it. Um, A couple centuries ago

115
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.200
and then they lost it, so groups like the

116
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.959
Aceh or the Siriono, these very small mobile hunter

117
00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.519
gatherers that you find in South America, um, who

118
00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.320
actually seem like refugees or, or like they underwent

119
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.239
some really catastrophic demographic collapse during which they lost

120
00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:37.160
cultural complexity. Um, AND you find something similar among

121
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.600
other hunter gatherers. So among those hunter gatherers that

122
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.720
do not have shamanism, they tend to be very

123
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.899
small populations and we can. Infer that potentially they

124
00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.679
had shamanism in history or um or that they're

125
00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.820
they're just not at a large enough population size

126
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.540
to sustain a certain level of cultural complexity.

127
00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.690
Uh, AND you have done work on shamanism in

128
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.279
different societies. Tell us, for example, about the work

129
00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.570
you've done in, and I hope I'm pronouncing this

130
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.730
correctly, Siberut and the CA.

131
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.850
Yeah, so that is where I've done most of

132
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.970
my field work and most of my research. I've

133
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:16.000
been going to Siberut. Great job at the pronunciation,

134
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.829
um, since 2014, um. And part of the reason

135
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.640
that I was interested in, so Sibe is this

136
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.109
island, it's off the west coast of Indonesia, uh,

137
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.980
so it's Southeast Asia. It's actually, if you go

138
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.309
from Africa and you cross over the Indian Ocean,

139
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.070
it's, you know, arguably one of these first islands

140
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.070
or the first island that you'll hit. And as

141
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.869
a result, it actually has very good waves and

142
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:42.920
a lot of surfers like to surf around Side

143
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.640
so it's interesting. Um, YOU, you know, you go

144
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.320
there, you find anthropologists and like Australians who are,

145
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.950
who are going to nearby islands or going surfing.

146
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.579
But anyway, so yeah, I've been going to say

147
00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:59.880
that since 2014. Um, AND when I arrived, so

148
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.929
I, I've been working with this group, the Mentawe,

149
00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:06.890
they are, um, rainforest horticulturalists, so they grow palm

150
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.929
trees and tubers and fruit trees, and then they

151
00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:13.160
hunt, and they also raise pigs and livestock. Um,

152
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.170
AND I got, I got there, I talked about

153
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.440
the experience of arriving, it was like complicated, hard,

154
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.290
um. But very soon after I arrived, it became

155
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.369
very apparent that there were certain individuals in this

156
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:28.570
society who had kind of a social magnetism. These

157
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.850
are individuals who were very often tattooed. They wore

158
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.770
loincloths that kept their hair, um, they would paint

159
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.369
themselves in turmeric. They had a kind of social

160
00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:38.840
gravity, so, you know, they would, they would step

161
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.840
into a scene and you can kind of feel.

162
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.270
Um, FEEL the social milieu or the social environment

163
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.140
bend towards them, and these were the ikere, the,

164
00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:52.760
the shamans of mentawe, um, and the ikere are

165
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.950
the nexus of political life, of medicinal life, of

166
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.429
religious life, um, they are understood to be distinct

167
00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:02.039
from normal humans to have special eyes, to be

168
00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:06.849
able to see souls, um. And they heal people

169
00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:09.580
in these healing ceremonies that can go on for

170
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.479
several days, where they dance, they fall into trance,

171
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.130
um, and so just going to mental and experiencing

172
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:22.340
this institution was really striking it, it, um. Just

173
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.450
how prominent they were in the society and how

174
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.780
important it made me very curious about the institution,

175
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.789
but then there was also something honestly kind of

176
00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:36.679
like Phantasmagorically fascinating or or or, you know, the,

177
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.909
the, the culture was so rich, but also so

178
00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:44.169
Otherworldly. It it was just a very intriguing research

179
00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:46.119
topic, so that is what really sprung me into

180
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.289
the world of shamanism.

181
00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:51.700
So those sort of, I think we can call

182
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.219
them social markers, like, for example, when you mentioned

183
00:09:55.219 --> 00:10:00.380
that the shamans there would um Uh, I mean,

184
00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:04.260
would have tattoos, uh, and, and, and would have,

185
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.419
I, I think you mentioned also different kinds of

186
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:11.619
clothing. So is that something that we also see

187
00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:15.510
across societies? I mean, do the shamans always have

188
00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:20.369
social markers that to distinguish themselves from the other

189
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:20.780
people?

190
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.309
Yeah, I would say frequently, um, and some of

191
00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:26.049
those can be visual, but some of those can

192
00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:32.210
kind of be, we might call it. Uh, NARRATIVE

193
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.530
or mythological or in terms of how people understand

194
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.770
them. So, in mental, they are set off in

195
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.130
a couple of ways. They um have these tattoos,

196
00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.109
they have the loincloths, they have the long hair,

197
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:46.119
but then they also don't, they have to taboo

198
00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:48.650
themselves so they cannot eat a lot of food,

199
00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:50.890
they can't have sex very often, but then they

200
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.570
also go through this initiation, which I write about

201
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.809
in the book where um There are many things

202
00:10:57.809 --> 00:10:59.979
that they, that happened to them during the initiation,

203
00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.969
but one of them is like a fundamental transformation

204
00:11:01.969 --> 00:11:04.979
of their eyes. Their eyes are regularly treated, they're

205
00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:07.859
treated socially, they're treated um in the secrecy of

206
00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:11.059
the forest. And so it's also this understanding that

207
00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.739
they have different kind of eyes that they have

208
00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:16.940
fundamentally transformed that also sets them off, um, so,

209
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.340
so they're marked both in people's understandings of them,

210
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.369
but also aesthetically if that's clear.

211
00:11:22.409 --> 00:11:27.090
Yeah. Are shamans both men and women, or is

212
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.489
this kind of role gendered?

213
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.070
Um, SO it depends on the society. Uh, MENTALITY

214
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.669
is interesting, um, so the word ciquere can refer

215
00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:40.630
both to a man and his wife, but it's

216
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.239
typically the man who's kind of The shaman who

217
00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:46.789
is falling into trance, who's doing these healing ceremonies.

218
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.239
There's a general anthropological wisdom, which I think is

219
00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:53.229
counterintuitive to many people that the more egalitarian the

220
00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:55.469
society, the more likely it is that men are

221
00:11:55.469 --> 00:12:00.070
shamans, um, and as societies become more hierarchical, women

222
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.840
are more likely to become shamans, um. Um, BUT,

223
00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:07.010
you know, in some societies you'll have both men

224
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.570
and women, but then also in some societies, shamans

225
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.289
will have, they'll, they'll kind of transcend the normal

226
00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:17.919
gender binary. Um, THEY might have elements of both,

227
00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:21.469
they might cross dress, um, so, so yeah, it,

228
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.690
it really depends on the, on the context. I

229
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.690
would say on average, they, they seem to more

230
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.650
often be men though, which also reflects men kind

231
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.090
of being more prominent, often in religious and spiritual

232
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.440
life.

233
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.419
Right. So, what are the psychological foundations of shamanism?

234
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.659
Is there anything specific about our psychology that predisposes

235
00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:48.299
us towards shamanism and shamanic practices or what kinds

236
00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:51.219
of cognitive mechanisms play a role here?

237
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.630
Yeah, so that's a great question. That's a big

238
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.349
question. Um. So an argument that I make in

239
00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:00.349
the book is that shamanism recurs because it is

240
00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:04.590
a hyper compelling, essentially cognitive technology, a way of

241
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:10.059
convincing people. Of assuring people of getting these simulated

242
00:13:10.059 --> 00:13:13.820
experiences where people can control uncertain outcomes. And so

243
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.309
I, I view shamanism very much as a cognitive

244
00:13:16.309 --> 00:13:18.299
or psychological technology and so I think a lot

245
00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:21.969
about these psychological foundations, um. We can think about

246
00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:25.799
those psychological foundations in a couple ways. One is,

247
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.690
um, more generally the psychological foundations of religion, of

248
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.169
which there has been a lot of research. I

249
00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:32.570
know a lot of people have come to your

250
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.700
show to talk about this. So people are predisposed

251
00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:40.210
to believe that agents, um, invisible agents exist and

252
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.570
they oversee uncertain outcomes, gods, spirits, ghosts, that they

253
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.299
cause illness, that they cause misfortune. Um, THEY'RE predisposed

254
00:13:47.299 --> 00:13:50.340
to engage in rituals and superstitions and, and forms

255
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.770
of magic. So if there's an outcome I really

256
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.979
want to control, um, I'm very predisposed to use

257
00:13:55.979 --> 00:13:59.380
a low-cost intervention to, to control it. So, and

258
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.780
I have a big test coming up and I

259
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.179
do all kinds of superstitions or, you know, a

260
00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:04.820
family member is sick, I do all kinds of

261
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.469
superstitions. So these are very important for shamanism, but

262
00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:12.830
they're also very important for for um religion more

263
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.020
generally, the fact that we believe that agents exist

264
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.229
and we use rituals or superstitions or magic to,

265
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.960
to engage with them. So that gets us kind

266
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.400
of to the basic elements of shamanism, the fact

267
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.919
that at its foundation shamanism is a, it's kind

268
00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:30.320
of a ritualistic practice to try to control the

269
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.960
uncertain. But then that leaves open the question of

270
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.559
why does that have to look like shamanism? Why

271
00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:36.679
do you have people who are dancing, falling into

272
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:40.229
trance, you know, uh having death and rebirth ceremonies,

273
00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:43.599
um, why does it have to take this particular

274
00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:47.349
form? And so, Uh, the thing that I argue

275
00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:51.150
is most key is the intuition of transformation or

276
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.909
difference. So at, at the core, what a shaman

277
00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:56.090
is doing is they're saying I can do something

278
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.460
normal humans cannot. I can speak to this God,

279
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.510
I can see this trend, I can, you know,

280
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:04.025
battle witches. I can engage with these, these agents,

281
00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:06.864
these beings who are invisible to normal people, and

282
00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.594
the way that I make that credible, the way

283
00:15:08.594 --> 00:15:12.945
that I make that tenable is by essentially diverging

284
00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.635
from from normal humanity by becoming a different kind

285
00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:19.520
of human. And we can see a similar intuition

286
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.979
in superhero narratives. Like a superhero narrative is a

287
00:15:21.979 --> 00:15:24.299
story about this person who can do things normal

288
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.260
people cannot, but the way that's made credible or

289
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.929
tenable for the audience is through an origin story.

290
00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:31.900
They were bitten by a radioactive spider, you know,

291
00:15:31.979 --> 00:15:35.325
they're an alien from another. Plant, um, whatever they

292
00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:39.575
were zapped by some radioactive, whatever, um, they have

293
00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:42.635
some crazy genetic mutation. All of these are narratives

294
00:15:42.924 --> 00:15:45.484
to, to explain why this person differs fundamentally from

295
00:15:45.484 --> 00:15:47.835
normal humans. And so I think a lot about

296
00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:52.179
shamanism. Serves this function, promoting the sense that this

297
00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:54.919
is a fundamentally different kind of human and thus

298
00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:57.460
has abilities that as normal humans do not.

299
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.190
How about aspects of human sociality? Do they play

300
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.989
a role in any way in the development of

301
00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:06.979
shamanism?

302
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.950
For sure, um, so, a couple that I think

303
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.150
are really critical and reasons that you do not

304
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.020
see shamanism, for example, among chimpanzees. One is, um,

305
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:23.109
shamanism requires cultural evolution or or complex culture, so

306
00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:25.070
you need to be a cultural species to develop

307
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.039
these practices, elaborate them. Um, BUT then shamanism is

308
00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:31.239
also at the end of the day a service.

309
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.669
It's, you go to someone, you give them resources,

310
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:37.919
they, um, provide a service in return, and so

311
00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:39.719
you need to have a degree of sociality where

312
00:16:39.719 --> 00:16:41.919
people can trust each other, or they can also

313
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.599
provide, you know, they're, they're willing to, to engage

314
00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:47.450
in this kind of, uh, these kinds of service

315
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.440
providing. Um, SO I think those are just necessary

316
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.530
elements of a species to have something like shamanism.

317
00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:54.210
It has to be cultural. It has to be

318
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.119
sufficiently cooperative. Um, BUT then shamanism also ends up

319
00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:00.809
just intersecting so many domains of social life. So

320
00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:04.589
in mental, shamanisms, or shamans are very important mediators.

321
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:08.010
They have political influence because they have this liminal

322
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.420
status because they're seen to to be special for

323
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.170
normal humans and to potentially have special powers that

324
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.560
allows them to also take on political influence.

325
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.358
Um, WHAT kinds of attitudes do people from industrialized

326
00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:27.000
and post-industrial societies tend to have towards shamanism and

327
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.199
its practices?

328
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.650
Yeah, that's a great question. So, I would say

329
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:37.449
people's viewpoints broadly separate into two categories. One is

330
00:17:37.449 --> 00:17:40.410
this view that shamanism is a kind of primeval

331
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:47.880
wisdom that um it's embodies this older spiritual relationship

332
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.689
or or more genuine connection to nature and to

333
00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:55.890
spirituality. It is a much more edenic or rosy-eyed

334
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.280
view of shamanism. And you can contrast that with

335
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.160
a view that sees shamanism more as Superstition and

336
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.130
we might say it's kind of related to images

337
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:12.750
of savagery or backwardness, um, exploitation, um. Yeah, I

338
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.069
would say these are, these are two common stereotypes

339
00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:21.709
or or paradigms, and, and they're often deployed in

340
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:25.270
ways that are uh contingent on people's political or

341
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.229
ideological goals. So if you want to critique post-industrial

342
00:18:29.229 --> 00:18:32.579
or industrialized societies, then you'll say you can point

343
00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.750
to shamanism and say, oh, we've lost something, you

344
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.550
know, there's some genuine real important. Uh, SPIRITUAL knowledge

345
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.630
that has, that has disappeared, but if you want

346
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.270
to celebrate them, you can say, oh, post-industrialized societies,

347
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.680
um, have rid themselves of something like shamanism. Um,

348
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.239
YEAH, and, and I, I, I think often stereotypes

349
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:59.560
or images of shamanism are linked to some view

350
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.760
that people tend to have of non-Western societies and,

351
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.479
and how shamanism manifests in those stories depends on

352
00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:11.119
the kinds of arguments people want to make about

353
00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.520
industrialized societies. Mhm.

354
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.810
But can we also find shamanism or shamanic practices

355
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.760
in industrialized societies?

356
00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:24.689
For sure, for sure, um, and something that I

357
00:19:24.689 --> 00:19:30.569
have been arguing is that I what both of

358
00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:34.130
these views have in common is some fundamental separation

359
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.209
between Western or industrialized societies and the rest of

360
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:41.229
the world, and, and This view that has long

361
00:19:41.229 --> 00:19:43.660
been a part of the study of shamanism or

362
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.780
or at least the popular discourse of shamanism, that

363
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.420
pushes shamanism to the far off, to the past.

364
00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:53.270
I mean, Eliade's famous book is called um Archaic

365
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:59.280
Techniques of Ecstasy, um, uh. I, I think most

366
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.209
people, if you, you know, go to Google images

367
00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:03.310
and you type in shamanism, it's so wrapped up

368
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.400
with images and imagery of, of primitiveness or or

369
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.640
the deep past. Um, BUT instead, I think, you

370
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.880
know, just as shamanism has appeared in so many

371
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.030
other societies that manifests in contemporary industrialized societies, um,

372
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.680
and it manifests in a couple ways. So one

373
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.890
it are are actually literal shamans. So I think

374
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.709
Pentecostal pastors are very often shamans. I mean, they

375
00:20:26.709 --> 00:20:30.130
are, uh, channeling or or communing with a a

376
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.199
sky god or or some invisible being. They are

377
00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:36.319
entering non-ordinary states. They're speaking in tongues, they're healing.

378
00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:39.089
I mean, you can just search on YouTube, Pentecostal

379
00:20:39.089 --> 00:20:41.609
healing, and if there were any other tradition, we

380
00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:45.369
would very readily or easily call that shamanism. Um,

381
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.130
TRANSCHANNELERS or mediums that you might find, you know,

382
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.959
on the streets of Los Angeles or paradigmatic shamans,

383
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:57.260
um, I think many, uh, figures of Uh, the

384
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.459
history of Abrahamic religions or shamans. So these, I

385
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:03.829
would say are literal. Shamans, they qualify as shamans

386
00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:05.540
by the definition that I describe in the book.

387
00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:09.270
There are also many shaman analogs in Western and

388
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.839
industrialized societies, figures who are serving similar functions or

389
00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.560
who are supported by similar social and and cognitive

390
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.790
foundations. Um, SO in the book I write about

391
00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:24.719
what I call um Hedge wizards, so money managers

392
00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:28.969
in particular, these individuals who are, uh, despite actually

393
00:21:28.969 --> 00:21:32.949
being efficacious, promising some kind of insight or divinity,

394
00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:38.599
uh. DIVINATORY power into unseen trends to, to provide

395
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.910
some people with a sense that they can control

396
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.000
or understand the uncertain or uncontrollable. Um, SO I

397
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.479
think similar dynamics are are at play in all

398
00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:51.000
societies, and we often delude ourselves by denying the

399
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.400
universality of these practices.

400
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.989
So let's talk about the relationship between shamanism and

401
00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:06.140
other particular kinds of religion. So, historically, the shamanism

402
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.579
and when organized religion starts.

403
00:22:10.489 --> 00:22:12.800
Yeah, so I, I, I think there's a common

404
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.160
view and you find this in some of the

405
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.239
best contemporary books on the cultural evolution of religion,

406
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:22.119
um, or the evolution of religion. So Robert writes

407
00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:26.520
the evolution of God, for instance, um, that paint

408
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.280
this picture or tell this story where shamanism is

409
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.560
this oldest religion and then it, you know, is

410
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.140
replaced or evolves into um. Large scale world religion.

411
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.310
So Robert Wright has a, has a quote in

412
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.939
his book where he describes shamanism as a precursor

413
00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:46.000
on some evolutionary timeline that ends with eventually archbishops

414
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.920
and Ayatollahs, um, and, uh. In the book I

415
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.140
call this the Pokemon theory of shamanism. So as

416
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.800
a, as a child of the 90s, who played

417
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.920
a lot of Pokemon, um, you know, it paints

418
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.900
this picture where you have like this simpler primitive

419
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.310
evolutionary stage that then is replaced by this more

420
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.800
complex form. Um BUT I think that actually really

421
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.150
mischaracterizes how religious history very often works and instead

422
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.250
something that I argue is that rather, rather than

423
00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:20.910
ecstatic practice or shamanism. Um, EVOLVING into these other

424
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.489
forms. Instead, they are actually engaged in this constant

425
00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:28.099
competition and rivalry. So one thing that you actually

426
00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:33.380
see in uh a lot of histories of particular

427
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.910
religious movements is that they will start off very

428
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.180
shamanic and then, um, as they become institutionalized, as

429
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.099
they become centralized, they attack that shamanic foundation. So

430
00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:44.339
you can find this in the history of the

431
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:48.469
early Christian church. Um, THE early Christian church is

432
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.069
By everything we can tell a very shamanic place.

433
00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:56.219
It's filled with altered states, with healing, with prophecy,

434
00:23:56.589 --> 00:24:01.119
um, but within You know, a couple decades as

435
00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:03.390
power is centralized in the bishops, there is an

436
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.920
attack against charisma, against ecstatic performance. You see this

437
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.910
in the history of Mormonism. Mormonism starts off again

438
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.199
as a religion or as a movement that is

439
00:24:12.199 --> 00:24:14.560
very ecstatic, where you have speaking in tongues, you

440
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.040
have healing, you have divination, um, but again within

441
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.699
a couple decades you have key figures like Brigham

442
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:24.089
Young, Brigham Young. Who, uh, I think, I believe

443
00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:26.609
is the 2nd president of the, the Church of

444
00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:30.329
Latter-day Saints, um, the second prophet. Early in his

445
00:24:30.329 --> 00:24:33.290
life or early in his time in Mormonism was

446
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.250
very enthusiastic about entering ecstatic states, about healing, about

447
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.890
these gifts. He felt like it was an echo

448
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.410
of the earliest church, but within a couple decades,

449
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.839
he um was not condoning it in the church.

450
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:48.770
He said that to allow people to enter these

451
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.530
kinds of states, um, Introduces competing doctrine, and that

452
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.010
is essentially why organized religion has had this complicated

453
00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:02.189
relationship with shamanic practice, um. Insofar as you allow

454
00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:04.869
other people to enter altered states to experience the

455
00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:08.709
divine in this very direct way, it provides, uh,

456
00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:14.829
or it enables competition, uh, in the connection with

457
00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:17.530
the divine. If I am an archbishop, I want

458
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.469
to be the sole individual who can claim a

459
00:25:19.469 --> 00:25:23.229
relationship to divine, to to to divinity. I want

460
00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:27.589
to monopolize the ability to um Say things about

461
00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:31.510
doctrine to to prophecy, and if suddenly anyone in

462
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.469
this community, anyone's grandma can enter trans claim that

463
00:25:34.469 --> 00:25:37.469
she's, you know, channeling a spirit, then that is

464
00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.349
threatening to my own authority.

465
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.670
How about uh prophets? I mean, for example, Judeo-Christian

466
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.829
prophets, are they shaman-like figures?

467
00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:52.780
Yeah, so we can think about prophets in two

468
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.239
ways. One, we can think about prophets as they're

469
00:25:55.239 --> 00:26:00.520
described in the um Hebrew Bible, um, and those

470
00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:02.729
As far as we can tell, are very shamanic

471
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:10.040
figures. Um, THEY, uh, so, um, I actually I'm

472
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.880
always like less comfortable about uh just doing this

473
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.680
stuff from memory because there I, I want to

474
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.199
be very specific, um, so I just like had

475
00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:20.479
some notes up, but, um, this word, so in

476
00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:23.520
the Hebrew Bible, I'm probably pronouncing this incorrectly, so

477
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.400
forgive me for all the pronunciation, but the Hebrew

478
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.079
prophets are referred to with this word nabi, um,

479
00:26:29.449 --> 00:26:31.520
and from what we can tell, if you look

480
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.479
at how Nabi is used in the Hebrew Bible,

481
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.719
it is very shamanic. So it's non-ordinary behavior, it

482
00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:40.770
is often prophecy. Um, THERE is some implication of

483
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.849
a relationship with the divine. Um, HERE'S 1 Samuel

484
00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:49.170
10:6, the spirit of the Lord will come powerfully

485
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.250
upon you and you will prophecy. So this is

486
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.880
a, a, a, um, derivation of the word naia.

487
00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:58.329
It might be hit nabe with them and you

488
00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:00.209
will be changed into a different person. So you

489
00:27:00.209 --> 00:27:03.739
find this mention of a relationship with the divine,

490
00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:09.469
um, this non-ordinary behavior. There's one Samuel 1924. Um,

491
00:27:09.489 --> 00:27:11.589
HE stripped off his garments and he too prophesy

492
00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:14.339
in Samuel's presence. He lay naked all that day

493
00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:16.020
and all that night. This is why people say

494
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.619
Saul also among the prophets. So in the Hebrew

495
00:27:18.619 --> 00:27:22.069
Bible, um, the prophets are shamans. I think it's

496
00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:24.900
very hard to make the argument to the contrary,

497
00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:27.020
and I think insofar as people are uncomfortable with

498
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.939
that, it just reflects a prejudice that puts shamanism

499
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:34.010
and shamanisms into one bucket and Abrahamic religion into

500
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.020
another, um, yeah. So, so, yeah, yeah, I think

501
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.189
early Abrahamic figures are easily qualified as shamans.

502
00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:49.390
Mm, I shamanism necessarily in conflict with organized religion?

503
00:27:50.449 --> 00:27:55.589
Not necessarily. So organized religion has engaged with shamanic

504
00:27:55.589 --> 00:27:58.510
tendencies in different ways. So sometimes it has tried

505
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.469
to quash it. So again, you see this in

506
00:28:00.469 --> 00:28:03.020
the early Christian church, you see this in Mormonism,

507
00:28:03.189 --> 00:28:05.229
but in other contexts it tries to domesticate it.

508
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.989
So you can see this in the relationship between

509
00:28:07.989 --> 00:28:12.420
Buddhism and shamanic practice in Japan. So in Japan,

510
00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.199
shamans that there are shaman mediums and his historically

511
00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:20.900
they were more salient. They're called iko. Um, AND

512
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.060
early Buddhism tried to get rid of the miko,

513
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.550
you know, the miko is a, a local shaman

514
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.709
medium. She becomes, uh, possessed and then she can

515
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:31.550
heal her divine, and of course that is that

516
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:37.550
competes with uh the Buddhistist organization's power, um, but

517
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.229
it was very difficult to, to get rid of

518
00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:41.430
the miko. The Miko were are very important to

519
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.189
people, uh. People want that kind of spiritual engagement

520
00:28:45.189 --> 00:28:47.699
and so what Buddhism did it it was it

521
00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:49.550
weakened the Miko as much as it could, but

522
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:55.229
then it incorporated them into um Into it's uh

523
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.949
religious organization. So, so it, it brought them to

524
00:28:57.949 --> 00:29:01.180
shrines. It, it, it kind of domesticated the practice.

525
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.869
So I think there is a tension, but I,

526
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.150
I don't think it always necessarily has to manifest

527
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.589
as like destroying shamanism. I think it can have

528
00:29:07.589 --> 00:29:10.949
different ways of, of dealing with um the appeal

529
00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:13.109
and competition that comes from shamanism.

530
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:20.229
Tell us about neo-shamanism or how shamanism can resurge

531
00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:25.280
in societies where many people declare themselves as not

532
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.989
affiliated with any religion.

533
00:29:28.719 --> 00:29:33.030
Yeah, so, um, that's a, a great comment and

534
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.000
that actually reminds me that when I was listing

535
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.380
all of the forms of shamanism in industrializing Western

536
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.569
societies, I just forgot neo shamanism, which, um. So

537
00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:49.670
neosha is a, we might call it a trend

538
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.130
or a kind of new agey movement um in

539
00:29:54.130 --> 00:30:00.910
which people understand themselves to be practicing, um. Older

540
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:07.030
shamanic traditions and so a common Uh, tradition within

541
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.780
contemporary neo-shamanism is called core shamanism. Core shamanism is

542
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.510
is interesting. It was started by an an anthropologist

543
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.910
turned essentially new age guru. This person Mike Harner

544
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.150
did incredible research among the sar, um, but then

545
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.339
he wrote this book, The Way of the shaman,

546
00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:25.510
in which he argued that he was identifying some

547
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.599
core feature of of shamanism as it exists across

548
00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:31.589
societies, created that as a a form of like

549
00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:36.250
bite-sized. Um, EVERYDAY practice, and that has become very

550
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:42.410
popular, um, and What I think about the rise

551
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.089
of neo-shamanism, so neo-shamanism and these related practices where

552
00:30:46.089 --> 00:30:48.729
people understand themselves to be engaging in shamanism have

553
00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:51.410
become very, very popular in Western society. So I

554
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.750
think Um, in the 2021 British census, shamanism was

555
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.949
the fastest growing religion, um, just people who said

556
00:30:58.949 --> 00:31:01.750
that they were practicing shamanism it when, I think

557
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:08.060
it multiplied by tenfold within 10 years, um. And

558
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:12.670
um they're more like self-proclaimed shamans in uh in

559
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.750
England and Wales than I believe there are Rastafarians

560
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:20.589
or Zoroastrians, um, but the rise, I think, is

561
00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:23.199
partly related to something you gestured at, which is,

562
00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:27.510
um, there has been a turn away from organized

563
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.390
and institutionalized religion for a number of reasons. There's

564
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.869
been a decline in people who affiliate with organized.

565
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:37.280
Religion, but, but that is probably compensated by people

566
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.719
who consider them spiritual but not religious. And I

567
00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:43.589
think shamanism appeals to them, um, for a couple

568
00:31:43.589 --> 00:31:46.949
of reasons. I think one, it, uh, makes them

569
00:31:46.949 --> 00:31:49.880
feel like they're connecting with nature or some deep

570
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.880
spirituality, some more universal spirituality, and that just partly

571
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.310
depends on how it's packaged. But then, uh, secondarily,

572
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.640
I think shamanism appeals to them for the same

573
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.880
reason that shamanism has appealed to people everywhere that

574
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:09.719
um. Uh, THERE is something very compelling about, uh,

575
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:14.859
this more intimate relationship with divine, with the ecstatic

576
00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:17.849
experience, and with using that relationship for everyday ends,

577
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:22.510
like healing and prophecy. People want, um, people want

578
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.949
to get something out of their relationship with the

579
00:32:24.949 --> 00:32:26.869
supernatural. They want to be healed, they want to

580
00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:31.469
know what's gonna happen, um, and relationships or engagements

581
00:32:31.469 --> 00:32:36.390
with the supernatural that feel much more. Um, Intimate

582
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.550
that feel much more experiential, that feel much more

583
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.229
visceral, I think, are much more compelling than ones

584
00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:44.229
where you have a number of intermediaries or or

585
00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:47.819
a less kind of direct um spiritual experience.

586
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.920
So you've already given us different examples of these,

587
00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:57.310
but what kinds of practices can we find in

588
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:02.000
shamanism? What kinds of rituals does it involve?

589
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.660
Yeah, so it's incredibly diverse, um. You have, so

590
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.459
some common things are aesthetic practice or self-denial. Um,

591
00:33:12.579 --> 00:33:15.770
OF course, entering these non-ordinary states is very common,

592
00:33:15.819 --> 00:33:18.239
but the techniques to do so are incredibly diverse.

593
00:33:18.489 --> 00:33:22.489
So in how, shamans enter non-ordinary states through dancing

594
00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:25.380
and through drumming, but in other places, also places

595
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.020
where I've worked or or visited, they will use

596
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.844
hallucinogens, they might um use sensory deprivation. And go

597
00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:35.094
into darkness. Um, SO that's another very salient or

598
00:33:35.094 --> 00:33:37.844
important dimension to it. Um, YOU often have these

599
00:33:37.844 --> 00:33:41.275
dramatic initiations which we've talked about. So in Mta

600
00:33:41.275 --> 00:33:43.244
again, it's like the treatment of the eyes, but

601
00:33:43.244 --> 00:33:45.045
it might be a death and rebirth ceremony in

602
00:33:45.045 --> 00:33:47.484
parts of Australia. It was understood that shamans would

603
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.915
have their bodies open and crystals would be put

604
00:33:49.915 --> 00:33:53.474
inside. Um, THERE might be like a ritual burial.

605
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.989
Um, YES, so then they can have these very

606
00:33:56.989 --> 00:34:03.199
dramatic initiations, um. Shamanism is closely linked to music,

607
00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:07.489
so very, very frequently, it's, it's a a a

608
00:34:07.489 --> 00:34:12.560
ubiquitous, not necessarily universal but widespread relationship between shamanic

609
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:20.319
ritual and music, um. Displays of supernatural powers or

610
00:34:20.368 --> 00:34:23.079
or so like walking on fire, stabbing yourself with

611
00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:25.728
swords, but also speaking languages that that you maybe

612
00:34:25.728 --> 00:34:26.599
do not know.

613
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.909
Mhm. And what is a trends and what are

614
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.659
shamanic states of consciousness?

615
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.860
Yeah, so trans, um, again, is like a highly

616
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.860
debated and complicated term. The way that I think

617
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.090
about trans as it is common across shamanic practices,

618
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.070
is, um, just non-ordinary behavior, and it can manifest

619
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.379
in a huge diversity of ways. So in mentalwe,

620
00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:57.699
when or among the mentalwe when shamans are entering

621
00:34:57.699 --> 00:35:01.570
trance, they will, um, kind of shake in place,

622
00:35:01.669 --> 00:35:04.090
but in other places they might be incredibly still.

623
00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:06.629
Um, YOU know, it might be very violent. They

624
00:35:06.629 --> 00:35:09.229
might manifest the spirits that are understood to be

625
00:35:09.229 --> 00:35:12.669
embodying them. Um, ALSO the understandings of trans can

626
00:35:12.669 --> 00:35:14.949
be very diverse, so it might be that their

627
00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:16.590
soul is leaving their body, it might be that

628
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.340
a soul is coming into their body, it might

629
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.340
be that energy is boiling up through their body,

630
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.500
um. Yeah, it might be that spirits are coming

631
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.840
and talking to them. So the, the techniques to

632
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.620
induce it, the behavioral manifestations, and the general understandings

633
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.899
of these states are incredibly diverse, but what they

634
00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:40.260
all have in common is uh a state that

635
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.139
is behaviorally and psychologically distinct from normal human functioning.

636
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:49.949
And what psychological effects the strengths have and what

637
00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:52.479
kinds of practices produce it?

638
00:35:53.189 --> 00:35:56.820
Yeah, so that um is also somewhere where I

639
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.979
diverge from some other people who have written about

640
00:35:58.979 --> 00:36:02.620
shamanism. So some well-known writers about shamanism, people like

641
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.540
Michael Harner or Michael Winkelman, have argued that shamanic

642
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.020
trans states often share some fundamental similarities that, you

643
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.820
know, we can think about essentially a shamanic state

644
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.459
of consciousness. I think that's very hard to to

645
00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:19.620
conclude, I think based on what we know about

646
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:24.780
the psychological effects of these different Techniques, these are

647
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.199
actually characterized by incredible diversity. So in some states,

648
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.179
um there might be a kind of sensory overload,

649
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.780
you might be hallucinating, you might be understanding yourself

650
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.370
to be engaging with unseen agents, traveling through worlds,

651
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.429
and other, there might be very, very little sensory

652
00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:45.060
dynamics, um, in some, you might have a very

653
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.939
strong sense of self and other you might lose

654
00:36:46.939 --> 00:36:50.780
your sense of self. Um. In some you might

655
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.500
be very aroused, and others you might might not

656
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.419
be aroused. Um, AND so my own work and

657
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.820
and review of the the literature on altered states

658
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.310
of consciousness has led me to conclude that um

659
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.699
There is very little that that is shared among

660
00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:09.659
all of these traditions as they occur around the

661
00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:12.699
world. And instead, instead, shamanism is kind of like

662
00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:18.659
a humanity's um project of of um the explorations

663
00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:21.459
of the the limitations and dimensions of consciousness. I

664
00:37:21.459 --> 00:37:26.530
mean, uh, even within particular societies, shamans um entered

665
00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:28.620
very different trans states. So in the book I

666
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.169
talk about. Um, SOME of these trans healers in

667
00:37:32.169 --> 00:37:36.409
Southern Africa who ingest different herbs to induce different

668
00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:38.729
states and they understand to have different effects. Some

669
00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:43.169
are, um, some are kind of dream-inducing plants, some

670
00:37:43.169 --> 00:37:46.209
are closer to deliriums, um, and they understand this

671
00:37:46.209 --> 00:37:50.500
to be very psychologically different experiences. Mhm.

672
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.790
And what are the functions of trends? I mean,

673
00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:57.959
tell us, for example, about the concepts of transformation

674
00:37:57.959 --> 00:37:59.199
and performance.

675
00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:03.340
Yeah, so there are some people who would argue,

676
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.750
so Michael Winkleman, is this big writer who has

677
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.510
written a lot about shamanism and trance, and he

678
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.060
has argued that trance has this integrative effect on

679
00:38:12.669 --> 00:38:16.949
on cognition, that when shamans are entering trance, parts

680
00:38:16.949 --> 00:38:19.739
of, you know, networks that normally are not communicating,

681
00:38:20.229 --> 00:38:22.550
um, are communicating in the brain, and that allows

682
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.030
for insight. That means shamans are better at mediating

683
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.379
and problem solving. But I think it's very hard

684
00:38:28.379 --> 00:38:30.020
to make a conclusion like that. I think it's

685
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.969
very hard to argue that shamans across societies have

686
00:38:33.419 --> 00:38:37.179
um some particular psychological effect of trance just given

687
00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:39.659
how incredibly diverse it is. And so the way

688
00:38:39.659 --> 00:38:43.290
that I think about trance and, and what I

689
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:47.330
argue is its most important function. Is um a

690
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.760
sense of transformation or otherness both for the audience

691
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.969
but also for the specialist. Um, SO, uh, the

692
00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:56.649
thing that I think is, is an issue for

693
00:38:56.649 --> 00:39:00.070
shamanism. Or the hurdle that I think any specialist

694
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.709
needs to overcome is why do you have the

695
00:39:02.709 --> 00:39:04.739
ability that you claim, you know, my mother is

696
00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.949
sick, uh, I feel like I'm being haunted by,

697
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.989
by a witch. I want to know whether it

698
00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:11.389
will rain tomorrow or whatever, you know, I have

699
00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:13.459
some kind of goal. I go to a specialist,

700
00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:16.790
I say, can you, um, can you help me

701
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.100
solve this, this issue? They say that they can.

702
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.030
Why should I believe them? Why should I think

703
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.469
that another human should have the powers that they

704
00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:26.010
claim? Um, AND this is where I think this

705
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.330
fundamental transformation is necessary, you know, they become a

706
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.229
different kind of human, but I also think Just

707
00:39:31.229 --> 00:39:33.510
the manifestation of that power should look very different.

708
00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.949
You know, if you come to me, Ricardo, and

709
00:39:34.949 --> 00:39:37.500
you're like, Munvir, can you talk to the rain

710
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.870
god? And I say, for sure. And I turn

711
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.429
and I say, hello, rain god, how are you

712
00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:42.790
doing? That would not seem very credible. But if

713
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.629
I enter a state that looks and feels fundamentally

714
00:39:45.629 --> 00:39:47.790
different from normal human functioning, I'm lying on the

715
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.669
ground, it's darkness, I'm shaking. That makes it much

716
00:39:50.669 --> 00:39:52.989
more credible or tenable to you that I'm that

717
00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:55.239
I'm, that I have the powers that I can.

718
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.030
And so while I think that trance does have

719
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.699
very important psychological effects. What I think is most

720
00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.090
important about it is that it's creating a very

721
00:40:04.419 --> 00:40:10.989
credible Seeming experience for both audience and for for

722
00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:15.469
practitioner. It is compelling to everyone involved that this

723
00:40:15.469 --> 00:40:18.830
person has some ability that normal humans do not.

724
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.040
They have some experience that normal humans do not.

725
00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:27.550
When it comes to rituals, what are initiations, how

726
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:31.389
do they play out and what are their goals?

727
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.209
Yeah, so, um. Initiations, I think, are doing a

728
00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:46.080
couple of things, so. They might be a mechanism

729
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.719
for providing a novice with information that they don't

730
00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:53.649
have, so teaching them, providing them with knowledge, um,

731
00:40:54.159 --> 00:40:57.270
they might be a mechanism for creating common knowledge,

732
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.280
just that someone is shifting from one state to

733
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.959
another, you know, there's a very clear marker, you

734
00:41:02.959 --> 00:41:04.719
know, now you put on a particular hat, you're

735
00:41:04.719 --> 00:41:06.840
given a particular name, and now we know that

736
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.560
you've transitioned from one state to another. But then

737
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.620
again, What I think is so critical about shamanism

738
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.020
is this fundamental transformation, and I think a lot

739
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.340
of initiations are doing a lot to, to reinforce

740
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.860
that sense. They are um telling us that this

741
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.379
is no longer a regular human, that Ricardo is

742
00:41:24.379 --> 00:41:26.540
no longer like the rest of us, that he

743
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.810
has, his body has transformed, his eyes have transformed.

744
00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:32.780
Um, IN alwe, or among the mental when a

745
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.310
person is going from Um, a regular person to

746
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.500
a shaman, so they, they have these, these various

747
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.500
rituals in which their eyes are transformed. They have

748
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.899
various nights of, of trance dancing. They are understood

749
00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:48.620
to meet their ancestors for the first time. But

750
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.479
then the terminology used to describe them also changes.

751
00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:56.760
So the mentalwe referred to. Um, NON-SHAMANS as simmaa,

752
00:41:56.919 --> 00:41:58.679
a word that is also used to refer to

753
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:02.149
uncooked food or uh food that is not yet

754
00:42:02.149 --> 00:42:05.239
ripe, whereas they refer to shamans as ciquere, and

755
00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:09.399
there's this sense, this intuition that the initiation ripens

756
00:42:09.399 --> 00:42:12.239
you. It transforms you, it cooks you, that there

757
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:16.439
is this, this transformation of your fundamental being, so

758
00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:19.159
that you have these special abilities, and that I

759
00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:21.040
think is very critical to a lot of shamanic

760
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.760
initiation.

761
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.280
So you've already mentioned some of these, but what

762
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.679
kinds of social roles do shamans play in their

763
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:31.399
societies?

764
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:38.590
Foremost is roles like healing and divination, but then

765
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:42.350
very often uh they will take on secondary leadership

766
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.030
roles. They might be mediators, arbitrators, um, they might

767
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:54.949
have some political influence, um. They may, uh, they

768
00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:58.310
may have important roles in ceremonial life and, and,

769
00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.939
um, life cycle transitions, so they might oversee initiations.

770
00:43:03.469 --> 00:43:05.959
Um, I would say really, really critical though is

771
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:10.870
of course just uh as healers, diviners, you know,

772
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.149
essentially providing these kind of miraculous services to everyday

773
00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:17.270
people, and then the other roles that they often

774
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:20.550
have are implications of these these central functions.

775
00:43:22.129 --> 00:43:27.050
Do people believe in everything a shaman does and

776
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.719
if not, and if there are some cognitive contradictions,

777
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.399
what does that tell us about shamanism and how

778
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:37.060
people relate to it?

779
00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:41.189
Yeah, so people do not believe everything. Um, IN

780
00:43:41.189 --> 00:43:44.030
fact, in most societies, you will find a lot

781
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.629
of discourse about who is real, who is not

782
00:43:46.629 --> 00:43:49.679
real, um, you know, is this person faking trans,

783
00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:54.419
um, there is also sometimes articulated a skepticism about,

784
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.239
um, the reality of much of shamanism, so. I,

785
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.840
I think it's very easy to, to stand outside

786
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.639
of a particular context and just treat everyone as

787
00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:06.219
undying believers, but in fact something that I've been

788
00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:08.360
really struck by throughout my research just on the

789
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.199
evolution of religion is how much more cognitively sophisticated,

790
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:21.139
skeptical, um. Discerning people are, um. And so I

791
00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:23.810
think there are a couple important dimensions to that.

792
00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:27.090
One, so I think this the entire experience of

793
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.219
writing this book and and thinking about shamanism and

794
00:44:30.219 --> 00:44:33.570
religion more generally has made me think about belief

795
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.620
in a different way. I, I, I think it's

796
00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:39.860
easy to come from a, a tradition, a Western

797
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.379
tradition, which is the scholarly tradition that I work

798
00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:46.580
with and that has been very influenced by The,

799
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.979
the Christian discourse where belief is believed to be

800
00:44:48.979 --> 00:44:51.620
fundamental. So I act a particular way because of

801
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.580
my beliefs. Um, I respond to the world in

802
00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.870
a particular way because of my beliefs. But my,

803
00:44:56.979 --> 00:44:58.899
my research on shamanism has made me start to

804
00:44:58.899 --> 00:45:02.739
think about how our responses to the world and

805
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.419
our beliefs about the world are, are sometimes at

806
00:45:06.419 --> 00:45:09.489
odds. So I might engage in magic or superstition,

807
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.219
but also be skeptical or not sure of whether

808
00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:15.479
it works. I might go to a A shamanic

809
00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:19.239
initiation or ritual. I might uh be healed. I

810
00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:22.199
might have mixed expectations or or a half belief

811
00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:25.459
in whether it works, but that actually doesn't necessarily

812
00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:29.399
Uh, change the fact that I might still therapeutically

813
00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:35.530
respond to it, um. So, Yeah, I, I, this

814
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.610
entire project has made me think that belief is

815
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.459
maybe less critical than we are sometimes apt to,

816
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.120
to, to believe ourselves.

817
00:45:44.489 --> 00:45:48.159
And the shamanism actually work. Yeah, and if so,

818
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.850
what it is in shamanism that specifically makes it

819
00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.360
work.

820
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.010
Yeah, so I'm an, I'm a materialist. I'm an

821
00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.889
empiricist, um, and so do I think that shamans

822
00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:05.969
are engaging with unseen beings and providing services through

823
00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:07.689
that engagement? Do I think that, you know, the

824
00:46:07.689 --> 00:46:10.169
shaman is talking to a crocodile god or a

825
00:46:10.169 --> 00:46:14.459
sky god? Based on the current evidence, uh, I,

826
00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:16.679
I don't think we can necessarily conclude that, and

827
00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:19.320
I, and I present evidence. I, I, I try

828
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.439
to treat that position with respect, but I, I

829
00:46:22.439 --> 00:46:24.449
think based on our, our existing evidence, we can

830
00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:27.229
conclude that. Do we think that shamans are sometimes

831
00:46:27.229 --> 00:46:30.560
therapeutically healing people, or do I think they're providing

832
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.949
therapeutic benefits? When I started This work I, I,

833
00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.879
and in earlier periods, I was much more skeptical.

834
00:46:37.929 --> 00:46:39.600
I thought uh there are some people who are

835
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.439
so enthusiastic about saying that shamans are healers and

836
00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:45.350
they provide these therapeutic benefits, and I felt that

837
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.790
they were often doing so more from a desire

838
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.879
for what shamanism should be than from a, a

839
00:46:50.879 --> 00:46:57.540
serious and responsible engagement with You know, the empirical

840
00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.239
evidence. After having written this book, after studying it

841
00:47:00.239 --> 00:47:03.310
a lot, I am much more convinced that shamanism

842
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.949
sometimes has therapeutic effects, or it has the capacity

843
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:08.840
to provide therapeutic effects, um, and I think about

844
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.679
that through several different mechanisms. One, I think shamanism

845
00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:15.840
is a really potent or powerful way to change

846
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.479
a person's understanding of themselves, um, and this is

847
00:47:18.479 --> 00:47:21.489
what psychotherapy is often doing. And maybe more familiar

848
00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:24.040
Western context, but a patient goes into a shamanic

849
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.419
killing ceremony with some story or some expectation about

850
00:47:27.419 --> 00:47:30.580
themselves, and then the shamanic ceremony is this powerful,

851
00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:33.899
very vivid way of transforming that story. I'm haunted

852
00:47:33.899 --> 00:47:35.860
by witches or the crocodile spirit is here to

853
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.340
get me. I have this very powerful experience. The

854
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.610
shaman battles them, it removes them from my house,

855
00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:42.820
it puts them in the river, and I come

856
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.129
away with a different story. Oh, I'm, I'm not

857
00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:48.340
haunted anymore. Um, AND in the book, I, I

858
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.919
actually talked to. A well-known psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins,

859
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.679
who calls himself a shaman because he understands his

860
00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:58.010
role in precisely this way. He has to dress

861
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:03.530
himself in um signals of authority enact a powerful

862
00:48:03.879 --> 00:48:07.590
transformation so that the patient's story about themselves changes.

863
00:48:07.919 --> 00:48:10.360
Um, SO that is one thing that I think

864
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.679
shamanism is doing in many cases. Uh, ANOTHER is

865
00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:17.270
that I think it is a potent. Um, WAY

866
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:22.500
to induce the placebo effect and The experience of

867
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.419
writing that book and, and studying shamanic healing ceremonies

868
00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.459
also, I think reinforced for me that um it

869
00:48:28.459 --> 00:48:30.739
induces, it can induce the placebo effect even in

870
00:48:30.739 --> 00:48:32.780
the absence of whether people do or do not

871
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.179
believe in it. People can come, but it is

872
00:48:35.179 --> 00:48:38.030
the experience of being healed that seems to often

873
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.459
just lead to to reduced pain or or uh

874
00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:44.969
anxiety. Regardless of belief, and I think that's, that's

875
00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:47.729
a very interesting topic about how are, how is

876
00:48:47.729 --> 00:48:51.330
the placebo effect being induced even in the absence

877
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.889
of belief. Um, THE final thing that I think

878
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:57.550
is often very important for shamanic healing ceremonies is

879
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.620
that they are incredibly very often social celebratory festive

880
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.209
events. So coming from a western context, I think

881
00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:07.409
I had expected healing often to be something that's

882
00:49:07.409 --> 00:49:10.010
much more somber and much more sober, and was

883
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:16.739
struck. When with the mentalwe, um, and finding that

884
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.340
a ceremony would essentially become a party. It would,

885
00:49:19.439 --> 00:49:21.719
you know, the shamans would come, they would heal

886
00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:26.040
a person, animals would be sacrificed, um, then we're

887
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.360
feasting, then the shamans would dance, but at some

888
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.040
point they would stop dancing, and then other people

889
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.719
would stay up dancing, and everyone would try to

890
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:35.600
stay up all night and everyone, um, all the

891
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.120
friends and the family are there. Observing these healing

892
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.909
ceremonies, um, I was very struck by the fact

893
00:49:41.909 --> 00:49:45.750
that they were often much more festive and celebratory

894
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.600
than I had expected. Mhm. Right. Mhm.

895
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:54.860
But when it comes to healing specifically, could it

896
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.649
be that at least part of the effects are

897
00:49:58.649 --> 00:50:00.030
placebo effects?

898
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.330
Yeah, so I think there are good reasons to

899
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.889
actually suspect that. SHAMANIC healing ceremonies are inducing the

900
00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:09.330
placebo effect. And in fact, I think shamanic healing

901
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.810
ceremonies are very well geared or very well designed

902
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:13.709
to induce the placebo effect, and there are two

903
00:50:13.709 --> 00:50:16.800
mechanisms that I would want to highlight. The first

904
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.290
is just how sensory or visceral or engrossing the

905
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.729
experiences. So there's research showing that. Um, SHAM surgery

906
00:50:25.729 --> 00:50:28.219
induces a stronger placebo effect than giving someone a

907
00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:32.820
sugar pill or doing some massage. Um, AND if

908
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.100
you think about shamanic healing ceremonies, they are incredibly

909
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.699
engrossing, you know, it's a practitioner who is fighting

910
00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:40.540
a spirit at night, there's fire, there's music, there's

911
00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.110
dancing, there's trance. um, IT is a much more

912
00:50:44.449 --> 00:50:48.899
sensorially, um, vivid experience and so for that reason

913
00:50:48.899 --> 00:50:51.639
we would expect a hunger placebo effect. The second

914
00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:54.719
reason is that research has shown that people have

915
00:50:54.719 --> 00:50:56.879
a stronger placebo effect when they feel that a

916
00:50:56.879 --> 00:51:00.840
practitioner cares about them more, when that practitioner is

917
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.760
um more empathic, when they just have a more

918
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.370
intimate relationship with them. Um, AND shamanism, uh, I

919
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.689
think is that for two reasons, when you're surrounded

920
00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:12.879
by friends and family, but then secondarily you have

921
00:51:13.219 --> 00:51:15.449
someone who's coming out, um, and not only healing

922
00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:17.409
you but often doing so in ways that are

923
00:51:17.409 --> 00:51:21.280
understood to be risky for them. So, um, the,

924
00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:26.179
uh, the these uh Kalahari hunter gatherers. Um, TRANCE

925
00:51:26.179 --> 00:51:28.239
was called half death. It was understood that this

926
00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:31.780
person was, was approaching death in many contexts, shamans

927
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.580
are fighting for the patients. It feels like the

928
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.770
entire community is fighting for them, and I think,

929
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.179
so both of these, um, we should expect to

930
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:42.850
produce a stronger therapeutic effect through the placebo effect.

931
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.969
OK, so for the last part of our conversation,

932
00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.260
we have to talk a little bit about psychedelics

933
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.159
here, not just because they have recently sort of

934
00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:58.550
gone mainstream, but also because people tend to make

935
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.600
some claims about, some claims about their use in

936
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.439
traditional society. So what are psychedelics and why do

937
00:52:06.439 --> 00:52:08.520
people link them to shamanism?

938
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.919
So, when people talk about psychedelics, I think they

939
00:52:12.919 --> 00:52:17.239
tend to talk about them in two ways. Some

940
00:52:17.239 --> 00:52:19.139
people use the word psychedelic to just refer to

941
00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:22.179
hallucinogens more generally, but then many people are are

942
00:52:22.179 --> 00:52:25.060
using the word psychedelic to refer to a particular

943
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.860
kind of substance or compound. It's um. You know,

944
00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:34.370
drugs that um have an effect on the serotonin,

945
00:52:34.699 --> 00:52:40.840
um HT2A receptor. Ricardo, I wanna make sure that

946
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.500
that's correct. Um,

947
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:43.909
OK, no problem.

948
00:52:45.209 --> 00:52:51.850
So allergic, psychedelic. 5 HT 5 HT 2A. OK.

949
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.110
Can we do that question again?

950
00:52:53.419 --> 00:52:56.909
Mhm. Yes, uh, I will repeat the question. Uh,

951
00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:59.689
OK, so for the last part of our conversation,

952
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:02.169
we have to talk here a little bit about

953
00:53:02.169 --> 00:53:06.010
psychedelics, not just because they have recently sort of

954
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:11.530
gone mainstream, but also because many people uh make

955
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:15.969
claims about their use in traditional society. So what

956
00:53:15.969 --> 00:53:19.229
are psychedelics and why is it that people tend

957
00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.159
to link them to shamans?

958
00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:25.229
That's a great question. So when people are talking

959
00:53:25.229 --> 00:53:27.350
about psychedelics, they tend to use that term in

960
00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.310
one of two ways. First is to refer to

961
00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:34.389
hallucinogens more broadly. Um, SOME people might even call

962
00:53:34.389 --> 00:53:38.189
marijuana a psychedelic under that use, um, but then

963
00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:40.070
when many people are talking about psychedelics, they're talking

964
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:46.989
about compounds with a specific, um, neurological effect, these

965
00:53:46.989 --> 00:53:53.260
that are acting on the serotonin uh 5HT2A receptors.

966
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:58.709
Um, AND so these are compounds like LSD, psilocybin.

967
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:08.159
Um, SILICIN 5Mo DMT, DMT biotinine, um. And so

968
00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:13.040
as the serotonergic psychedelics have become more popular, you

969
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.080
often find this claim that psychedelics have been used

970
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.739
in shamanic contexts around the world and for millennia.

971
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.719
Um, AND I think part of the reason you

972
00:54:21.719 --> 00:54:25.560
find this claim so often is that it softens

973
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.750
the edge around something that has otherwise. That otherwise

974
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.310
might seem a little scary. Oh, we should legalize

975
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.590
this, or we should, you should feel more comfortable

976
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.550
about it being in clinical context, because this has

977
00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.959
been a part of human spiritual life about human

978
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:44.270
medicinal life, about human ritual and therapeutic life for

979
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.399
millennia and in cultures around the world. Um, AND

980
00:54:48.399 --> 00:54:50.560
in fact when I often when I talk to

981
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.520
people about shamanism or about my fieldwork, they not

982
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.000
only uh expect that the mentalwe use drugs or

983
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
hallucinogens, but they might even in particular expect them

984
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.520
to use psychedelics. And for the context, mental shamans

985
00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.679
do not use uh psychoactive substances to induce trance.

986
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.879
I mean they smoke tobacco like many people in

987
00:55:10.879 --> 00:55:13.560
that society, the way that they enter trance is

988
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.719
through dancing and drumming. Um, SO I think this

989
00:55:17.719 --> 00:55:20.959
claim is made very widely in the popular discourse

990
00:55:20.959 --> 00:55:24.040
that psychedelics have been used in shamanic context for

991
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.419
millennia. Um, BUT I think it's inaccurate, or, or

992
00:55:28.419 --> 00:55:32.139
at least I think it, it really misrepresents human

993
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.909
history and diversity, and I can talk a bit

994
00:55:34.909 --> 00:55:35.580
about why.

995
00:55:36.129 --> 00:55:38.550
Mhm. Yeah, yeah, tell us about why then.

996
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.340
Um, SO I think it misrepresents human diversity and

997
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.139
history in a couple ways. The first is, what

998
00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:47.780
is the actual evidence that people around the world

999
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.739
have used psychedelics and The best work for this

1000
00:55:50.739 --> 00:55:53.860
or the best attempt to to answer this question

1001
00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.360
was done by a French PhD student, Martin Fortier.

1002
00:55:57.629 --> 00:56:01.459
So, Martin went through the diaries of explorers and

1003
00:56:01.459 --> 00:56:05.580
adventurers. He went through old ethnographic documentation, he went

1004
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:10.550
through ethnobotanical work. He was building this incredible project.

1005
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.280
Unfortunately, he died while he was working on the

1006
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.520
project, really tragically, he was 30 years old, he

1007
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.280
died of cancer, um, but he presented some of

1008
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.879
his findings before he had passed, and so we

1009
00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:25.360
should treat these as preliminary, but as best as

1010
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.879
he could tell, serotonergic psychedelics have only been used.

1011
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.699
In mezzo in South America, nowhere else in the

1012
00:56:31.699 --> 00:56:35.090
world do we have reliable evidence. So observational evidence

1013
00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:40.020
or um ethnobotanical evidence of the hallucinogenic use of

1014
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:44.209
serotonergic psychedelics. It's only in Mesoamerican and South America

1015
00:56:44.209 --> 00:56:46.139
and even in those regions, it seems to have

1016
00:56:46.139 --> 00:56:48.580
been used by a a a very small number.

1017
00:56:48.695 --> 00:56:53.435
OF cultures. So he estimates that I think 5%

1018
00:56:53.435 --> 00:56:58.004
of ethnolinguistic groups in the Americas were using serotonergic

1019
00:56:58.004 --> 00:57:00.564
psychedelics and hallucinogenic doses. And so on a global

1020
00:57:00.564 --> 00:57:04.084
scale, that would be something like 1% of, of

1021
00:57:04.084 --> 00:57:07.625
ethnolinguistic groups. So a tiny slice of humanity has

1022
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:12.060
used these particular kinds of compounds. Then there's also

1023
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.179
the question of um how they have been used.

1024
00:57:15.219 --> 00:57:17.899
And so I think often the discourse wants to

1025
00:57:17.899 --> 00:57:22.580
draw a parallel between modern therapeutic or clinical applications

1026
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.080
and what is understood to be indigenous use. There

1027
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.459
is this image that the shaman is presenting a

1028
00:57:27.459 --> 00:57:30.260
psychedelic to the patient, and that they are consuming

1029
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:34.060
it, and that is somehow related to psychological healing.

1030
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:39.669
In fact, the prevailing way that psychedelics were used

1031
00:57:39.669 --> 00:57:41.959
in these contexts is that the shaman themselves, the

1032
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:46.989
specialist, would consume the substance and, and they would

1033
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.550
um consume the substance as a way of Accessing

1034
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.189
supernatural powers as a way of divining, as a

1035
00:57:54.189 --> 00:57:58.010
way of battling enemies, as a way of diagnosing

1036
00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:03.310
illness. Um, THERE'S a really striking video that Napoleon

1037
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:10.070
Chagnon took among the Yanomami, where they had uh

1038
00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:14.750
taken a psychedelic snuff, um, and then used that

1039
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:16.790
to attack babies as they understood it in an

1040
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:21.679
enemy group. So the usage that is often Described

1041
00:58:21.679 --> 00:58:24.959
in the popular psychedelic discourse is very different than

1042
00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:27.560
what you see in the societies that they're claiming

1043
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:32.239
to represent, um. And I should point out that

1044
00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:34.040
it's not only that shamans are taking it, you

1045
00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.040
also have, you have an incredible diversity of uses

1046
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.669
of, of psychedelic substances. You have apprenticeships, you have

1047
00:58:42.159 --> 00:58:44.760
situations where everyone, all of the men are taking

1048
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.520
it together for all night dances. You have it

1049
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.199
where many individuals are taking it um for some

1050
00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:55.040
shared supernatural or spiritual experience, you know, they might

1051
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.199
understand themselves to be traveling beyond the Milky Way.

1052
00:58:57.699 --> 00:59:00.179
But it's all nevertheless very, very different than it

1053
00:59:00.179 --> 00:59:04.860
is often described in the popular psychedelic literature.

1054
00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:08.989
So, uh, just one last question about that. Why

1055
00:59:08.989 --> 00:59:13.870
do you think that people in industrialized societies come

1056
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.429
up with these claims?

1057
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.820
Like I said, I think it's about making psychedelics

1058
00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:27.129
seem More approachable. And for the record, I have

1059
00:59:27.129 --> 00:59:31.929
no problem with um making reasoned arguments and drawing

1060
00:59:31.929 --> 00:59:35.070
on data. To show why there should be broader

1061
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.899
acceptance of psychedelics or, you know, why clinical trials

1062
00:59:39.189 --> 00:59:43.189
might suggest psychedelics are useful for therapeutic or clinical

1063
00:59:43.189 --> 00:59:47.120
purposes. Um, BUT I think when people start to

1064
00:59:47.129 --> 00:59:50.979
imagine or make up claims about human cultural diversity

1065
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:55.750
to support these, these monetary or ideological goals, I

1066
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:58.590
think that is very irresponsible. I think it projects

1067
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:02.850
this very simplistic image onto human cultural diversity. Mangles

1068
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.469
it in service of the kinds of goals that

1069
01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:07.810
people are having, um, and I think it does

1070
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:12.100
a disservice to uh the project more generally of,

1071
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.889
of having a better understanding or or better characterizing

1072
01:00:14.889 --> 01:00:18.760
how people have used drugs across human societies, um.

1073
01:00:19.729 --> 01:00:25.060
Yeah. Great. So the book is again Shamanism, the

1074
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.179
Timeless Religion. Of course, I'm leaving a link to

1075
01:00:28.179 --> 01:00:31.729
it in the description of the interview. And apart

1076
01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:35.179
from the book, where can people find your work

1077
01:00:35.179 --> 01:00:36.149
on the internet?

1078
01:00:36.659 --> 01:00:39.639
So they can find it on my website, Manvier.org,

1079
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:43.520
M A N V I R.org. I also have

1080
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.239

have an X account M and VR SNG H

1082
01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.000
and I have a blue sky um manvier, I

1083
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.399
think it's dot, you know, blue sky.social, the, the

1084
01:00:57.399 --> 01:01:01.399
standard um format and yeah.

1085
01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:05.810
