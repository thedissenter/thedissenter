00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.150
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.849
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopson today.

3
00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.159
I'm Jane by Doctor Kevin Hong. He's an assistant

4
00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.680
professor of sociology at the University of Macau. And

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.199
today we're going to talk about, uh, I mean,

6
00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.920
he has several different lines of research, but we're

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.360
going to focus on magic, divination, dream interpretation across

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.399
human societies and also Uh, a little, we're also

9
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.239
going to talk a little bit about cultural evolution

10
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.959
and transmission biases and taboos. So, Doctor Hong, welcome

11
00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:36.560
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.799
Thank you. It's, it's a pleasure to talk to

13
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:39.069
you.

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.220
So let's start with magic then. I mean, I

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.619
know that you approach, uh, I mean, the kinds

16
00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.020
of phenomena we're going to talk about today. You

17
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.259
approach them from a cognitive perspective. So how do

18
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:58.419
you approach magic specifically from a cognitive perspective?

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.970
Um, YEAH, so I, uh, study magic and I

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.120
conduct both fieldwork and uh theoretical analysis of magic.

21
00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.910
I approach it from a cognitive perspective in the

22
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.419
sense that I view it as a natural product

23
00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:17.470
of the human mind, um, as opposed to some

24
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.110
sort of uh phenomenon to be analyzed at the

25
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.819
societal level. Um, AS you know, it's possible to,

26
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.589
to view magic as uh a mechanism to that

27
00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.519
serves some sort of social function. So, so I

28
00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:34.169
acknowledge that um it, it does have that function

29
00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:37.510
occasionally sometimes, but I want to push back against

30
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.360
that a little bit by saying that we should

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.940
primarily focus on cognition because on social functions often

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.019
uh depends on individual cognition to, to work, right?

33
00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:51.120
So, so it's, it's really a natural product of,

34
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:56.889
of human psychological coating mechanisms, um, interacting with specific

35
00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:03.599
environmental regularities um and So I study uh classic

36
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.690
uh anthropological types of magic such as sympathetic magic,

37
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.089
um, and I argue that it's just a form

38
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.039
of intuitive, although mistaken form of causal reasoning, um,

39
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.339
humans naturally in causality from correlations, uh, and this

40
00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.110
process is usually is generally adaptive but can sometimes,

41
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.449
sometimes lead to systematic errors um in certain conditions.

42
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.610
Mhm. Uh, ARE there specific, I mean, from a

43
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.839
cognitive perspective, are there specific cognitive mechanisms underlying magic

44
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.289
and how it works?

45
00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.880
Yeah, so for example, um, I, um, psychologists and,

46
00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.160
and cognitive anthropologists often talk about intuitive causal reasoning.

47
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.630
So this is the idea that humans have, um,

48
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.470
evolved predisposition or tendency to infer causal relationships from

49
00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.460
correlations or coincidences. And this mechanism is, as I

50
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.899
said, beneficial um for survival and, and reproduction but

51
00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.740
also makes individuals susceptible to um mistakenly attributing causal

52
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.389
powers to seemingly unrelated objects or events. For example,

53
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.600
um the Uh, sympathetic magic that I referred to

54
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.479
such as voodoo dolls, um, exploits the intuitive belief

55
00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:27.000
that similarity or previous contact, and this is called

56
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.720
contagion, can sometimes establish a causal link, um, which

57
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.300
makes sense in the ancestry environment, um, if you

58
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.729
think about, um. Uh, HOW disease gets transmitted, um,

59
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.020
but sometimes, uh, we tend to overgeneralize, um, these

60
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.779
intuitions, and this creates, creates these, uh, mistaken causal

61
00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.570
beliefs, problems where we think that we can influence,

62
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.460
um, other people or, or create these causal links

63
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.770
where objectively speaking they don't exist.

64
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.050
Mhm. So you mentioned voodoo dolls there. Uh, COULD

65
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.759
you give us a few more examples of kinds

66
00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.960
of magic that you've studied in human societies?

67
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.369
Yeah, so voodoo doll is, is a classic example,

68
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.820
uh, that exemplifies, uh, some of the principles of

69
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.140
magical thinking. A voodoo doll is an object, um,

70
00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:22.970
created by humans, uh, where they intend to induce

71
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.329
harm to other human beings by this supernatural link

72
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:29.260
um that they created between the voodoo doll and

73
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.859
the real person and their enemy. Um, SO the

74
00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:35.329
typical way of doing it is to, is, um,

75
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.359
is to obtain some, so there are two ways,

76
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.160
right? And the first is to make the voodoo

77
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.920
doll similar in some sense to your enemy and

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.119
then you harm the voodoo doll and the belief

79
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.619
is that the enemy is going to, is going

80
00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:51.000
to be uh negatively affected. So you can name

81
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.589
your voodoo doll the same with the same name

82
00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.440
as your enemy, right? Or, or you can attribute

83
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.399
some sort of um create some attributes uh that's

84
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.299
that resembles the attributes of the, your enemy and,

85
00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.549
and. Um, ATTACH those attributes to the doll, um,

86
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.309
that's another possibility. Or you can obtain some parts

87
00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.549
of your enemy's body, their hair, fingernails, right? And

88
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:18.220
then, um, uh, you make that, uh, an ingredient,

89
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:20.269
uh, when you make the voodoo doll. So that

90
00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.540
now there, so that's, uh, a situation where previous

91
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.160
contact um is believed to create a lasting link

92
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.980
and then you harm the doll, um, the, the,

93
00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.670
the belief is, is that the enemy is going

94
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.220
to be harmed. Right, so it's a very straightforward

95
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.339
instrumental reasoning. You want to do this thing, you

96
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.290
want to achieve this outcome, and you believe that

97
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.140
um creating this voodoo doll, this, this form of

98
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.859
magic, um, can, can do that.

99
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.890
Mhm. And are there other cognitive mechanisms associated with

100
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.019
magic or is it's just the ones that you've

101
00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:55.149
already mentioned?

102
00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.230
So this is just an example, um, and, uh,

103
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.290
James Frazer, the classic anthropologist, uh, came up with

104
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.339
the principles of magic of sympathetic magic, what he

105
00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.459
calls, um, and the first principle is similarity. um,

106
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.940
HE calls it the law of similarity and second

107
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.859
is the law of contagion. And then both principles

108
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:19.500
manifest themselves in the example of voodoo doll. You

109
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.260
can, you can create this seemingly effective magic by

110
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.820
applying these two principles.

111
00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:30.230
Uh, uh, SO you mentioned, or you mentioned briefly

112
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.149
earlier the social functions of magic. So what are

113
00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.660
the, exactly the social functions of it? What kinds

114
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.709
of roles does magic play across human societies?

115
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.350
Right, so, uh, people have, so I, I should

116
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.609
say that I. I want to push back against

117
00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:51.529
that view, um, but obviously people sociologists, um, primarily

118
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.970
have argued that magic can serve as, um, for

119
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.890
example, a form of social control, right? The belief

120
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.730
that uh there exists this uh uh this these

121
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.799
types of mysterious power, um, can. Create a condition

122
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:12.529
where people. ARE fearful when uh would be fearful

123
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.230
when they want to commit a crime, right, when

124
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.250
they want to uh act immorally, some sort of

125
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.279
supernatural punishment monitoring hypotheses similar to that hypothesis, um,

126
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.829
and, and that's the reason they exist witchcraft, um,

127
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:29.250
practices and don't exist in human societies. So that

128
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.010
would be some sort of social function or um.

129
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.299
Or, or people have argued the opposite, not the

130
00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:39.500
opposite, but a complimentary uh role that magic plays

131
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.380
in human societies and that is it serves to

132
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.260
enhance social cohesion, and it serves intense social harmony

133
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.019
somehow. I'm not fully, um. Um I don't really

134
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:54.600
comprehend how they. The exact mechanism that produces that

135
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.429
effect, but people have argued that magic serves or

136
00:07:57.429 --> 00:08:01.470
religious practices in general serve that function, social function.

137
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.609
Uh, SO, uh, religious, you mentioned religious practices. Why

138
00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:11.390
is magic in any way tied to some religious

139
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.089
practices?

140
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:16.130
So I use the word religious practices very uh

141
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.730
liberally loosely, excuse me, uh, traditional religious practices would

142
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:27.529
include um So, so I wanna Make a distinction

143
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:31.880
between religious beliefs that posit some sort of personalized

144
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.200
um agent, a deity, a ghost or spirit that

145
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.739
that humans can interact with. And the sorts of

146
00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:45.888
More automatic mechanistic uh processes that I described as

147
00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:48.528
in the case of woods and I think they,

148
00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:52.999
they share some similarities um and some anthropologists would

149
00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:58.648
would categorize them under the same general label, um.

150
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.330
Primitive religious practices, um, which I'm OK with.

151
00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:08.440
Mhm. So let's talk now a little bit about

152
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.400
divination then. What is divination?

153
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.020
Um, DIVINATION is typically defined as the practices, um,

154
00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:21.770
aimed at generating information about uncertain or hidden matters

155
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.650
through methods perceived um by us mostly as supernatural,

156
00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:33.049
magical or beyond ordinary human capabilities, um, and specifically.

157
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:37.940
Um, DIVINATION practices has been categorized into two groups

158
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:40.830
as having two different functions. The first is to

159
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.070
predict what's gonna happen in the future. Um, FOR

160
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.750
example, the outcome of battles, um, whether a particular

161
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.950
harvest is going to be successful, um, or personal

162
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.349
fortunes. So that's the first function and the second

163
00:09:53.349 --> 00:09:57.090
function is to review. Uh, HIDDEN or obscured information,

164
00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:59.979
um, that's not necessarily about the future, it can

165
00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:03.179
be about the past, um, or something that's already

166
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:07.690
happening, for example, um, identifying the causes of, uh,

167
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.940
physical discomfort, illnesses, um, locating, um, sites of lost

168
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.190
items, um, or, or exposing secret transgressions and so

169
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.099
forth. So those are the two functions, the imminations,

170
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.669
um. Serve can be used in human societies.

171
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.119
Is the Venation common across human societies and by

172
00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:32.570
the way, I can ask you the same thing

173
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.890
about magic. Are these kinds of practices common across

174
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.650
human societies? Are they human universals or something close

175
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.090
to that?

176
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.130
Uh, I think it's some something close to it.

177
00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.849
I'm not 100% certain that every single society has

178
00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:51.070
them, um, but the ethnographic and historical record shows

179
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.450
that they are extremely common, prevalent, uh, in human

180
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.530
societies, and they've been used for a variety of

181
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.215
different purposes. So some of the social function. TALKED

182
00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:02.655
about, um, right, but that, that, that, that depends

183
00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:06.895
on um a cognitive, uh, basis. So diation is

184
00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:09.885
common because we want to know um about things,

185
00:11:10.054 --> 00:11:13.684
what will happen, uh, or something that's bothering us

186
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:17.335
on the ident what's causing the illness or misfortune,

187
00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:21.125
and magic serves as the means to, to, um,

188
00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:24.005
to fix things, right? We want to exert control,

189
00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:29.150
um, over the immediate environment. Sometimes there's ordinary instrumental

190
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.909
actions, um, other times we rely upon magic, so

191
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:33.710
they are very common.

192
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.890
Mhm. Tell us about this idea of divination as

193
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.570
an epistemic technology. What does that mean?

194
00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:47.559
Yeah, so really this, this is to say that

195
00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:52.109
uh divination is and should be viewed as what

196
00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:55.200
it appears to be and that is means to

197
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.679
generate information methods to generate information in order to

198
00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:04.919
facilitate human decision making. And the fancy word is

199
00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:08.929
epistemology is right, the, the words in philosophy for

200
00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:12.289
obtaining information, obtaining knowledge, and we just use that

201
00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:17.400
um uh to show that divination serves this purpose,

202
00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:20.869
right? So it's not about This is again to

203
00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:24.830
emphasize the cognitive dimension of divination, a way to

204
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.950
generate, ways to generate information that hopefully will be

205
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.849
useful to make decisions. EPISTEMIC technology and, and, and

206
00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:39.000
um and framed in this way, it's qualitatively similar

207
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.380
to ordinary information technologies such as weather forecasting um

208
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.489
or, or stock market uh prediction.

209
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.900
Mhm. And what kinds of social roles does it

210
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.809
play exactly?

211
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.380
Um, IT plays, it can play a lot of

212
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.780
social roles, um, for example, it, uh, it is

213
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.739
said to Uh, to have been used to resolve

214
00:13:06.229 --> 00:13:10.539
social conflict, right, when both, when, when, um, two

215
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.169
sides of the party don't agree on some matters

216
00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:16.200
of interest, uh, and there's really no way to

217
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.599
resolve the issue, they they rely upon divination and

218
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:23.700
it's let God decide what to do, um, or

219
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.739
phone political actors can use it to improve their

220
00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:32.330
legitimacy, um. Right, to say that they had a

221
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.200
dream about a dragon of some sort in China,

222
00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:39.719
this was very common, um, and, and that would

223
00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:43.809
signal to the people that, that he is the

224
00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:48.320
chosen person um to, to rule. So those are

225
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.309
some examples of how divination can be used um

226
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.070
for strategic um sometimes manipulative purposes in society.

227
00:13:57.859 --> 00:14:01.309
Mhm. Uh, SO when it comes to devilation, for

228
00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:04.010
example, in the case of magic, you mentioned voodoo

229
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.409
dolls, in the case of divation, what kinds of

230
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:10.530
forms can it take? I mean, what kinds of

231
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.690
practices can it involve?

232
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.130
Um, VERY, very diverse. So I mentioned the example

233
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.059
of dream domination. So you can use dreams somebody

234
00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:25.929
dreams of something and uh a professional, a specialist

235
00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:28.460
can offer an interpretation of the meaning of that

236
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.299
dream. So that's one form. And I have a

237
00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:35.349
paper on that, as you probably know, um. Or

238
00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:44.109
you could resort resort to some. Seemingly complicated. Algorithmic

239
00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:49.469
treatment of objects. So Chinese would use yardsticks to

240
00:14:49.469 --> 00:14:51.669
do this, right? So it's really a primitive form

241
00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:54.450
of computation, but it's really, it's not for computing

242
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:59.030
computing. In the same way as as we do

243
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.309
mathematics, it's to predict what's gonna happen in the

244
00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:06.150
future, um, numerology, so that would be a mechanistic

245
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:12.340
way of doing divination or they could um Perform

246
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.489
rituals, um, hoping to. Invoked to, to, to get

247
00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:22.489
the attention of deities, supernatural agents, uh, and to

248
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:26.090
communicate with them and get the responses um as

249
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.549
answers to some questions. That would be another primary

250
00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:32.760
way of, of doing divination and, and the, the,

251
00:15:32.789 --> 00:15:36.929
the exact method of doing that um is again,

252
00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:40.020
is very diverse. So Oracle bone divination, and again,

253
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.349
the Chinese example is, is, is one way um

254
00:15:43.349 --> 00:15:49.799
or you could use Um, Strange. Any example to

255
00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:52.239
get the attention of the deity and then somehow

256
00:15:52.809 --> 00:15:58.729
transmitting. Um, GET somehow getting their response in some

257
00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:01.469
physical object, right, and then you, you have a

258
00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:04.219
sign and then you interpret the sign to obtain

259
00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:04.869
the meaning.

260
00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:09.869
Mhm. So, uh, let's not talk then about dream

261
00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:13.030
interpretation. What, what is dream interpretation?

262
00:16:13.989 --> 00:16:16.250
Uh, DREAM interpretation, as I said, is, is the,

263
00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:21.469
the extraction of useful valuable information from dreams, um,

264
00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:26.280
and, uh, such information is then often used to

265
00:16:26.609 --> 00:16:29.169
predict what's gonna happen in the future and how

266
00:16:29.169 --> 00:16:32.640
we respond to what's gonna happen in the future.

267
00:16:32.969 --> 00:16:36.000
So that's dream divination and uh in my research,

268
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:41.369
I make a further Uh, categorization, um, offer a

269
00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:46.739
typology of different types of dream, um. Different types

270
00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:50.809
of dreams that would require slightly different interpretive effort.

271
00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:55.059
So there is message dreams, um, which refer to

272
00:16:55.059 --> 00:17:00.690
dreams, um, it's really a message. Messages being conveyed

273
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.400
by a supernatural deity, a ghost or spirit. They

274
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.868
are personalized anthropomorphic, uh, agents that tells you something,

275
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.569
um, not just in the form of plain language

276
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:18.430
that you understand. So your dead ancestor, um, uh.

277
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:23.198
Telling you that you should uh run away from

278
00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:26.378
your house for some reason, right, because disasters can

279
00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:30.540
happen and that would constitute a message dream. On

280
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.300
the other hand, there are sign dreams, um, and.

281
00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:38.680
Which are non-message dreams, right? There's a sign that

282
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.479
you have to interpret somehow, uh, and here I

283
00:17:41.479 --> 00:17:45.239
make the further division between street sign dreams and

284
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:49.790
symbolic sign dreams. Street sign dreams are. As the

285
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.390
name suggests, it's straightforward. You don't have to, you

286
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.680
basically immediately get what the meaning of that dream,

287
00:17:55.989 --> 00:18:00.790
whereas symbolic dreams are often obscure, um, mysterious, and

288
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.949
that that would require a specialist, uh, a professional

289
00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:07.790
dream interpreter to, to tell you the true meaning

290
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.430
of that dream.

291
00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:14.140
Mm. Uh, IS there any other type or just

292
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.810
those two,

293
00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:20.449
I think this is uh pretty much exhaustive categorization

294
00:18:20.449 --> 00:18:21.770
of all the dreams

295
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.199
as far as I'm concerned. And by profession. No

296
00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:30.880
dream interpreter, what do you mean exactly? What is

297
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.150
a professional dream interpreter? Does that kind of person

298
00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:39.839
hold any specific position in the society they are

299
00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.390
part in or how does it work?

300
00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:50.680
Right, so professional dream interpreter, um. Generally, generally refers

301
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.040
to a person with um the the expertise in.

302
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.609
Interpreting dreams. It is what it means, right? Uh,

303
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.609
AND in early Chinese dynasties, I believe there were

304
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.339
the the court, so that the, the dynasty would,

305
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:14.650
would, would assign a point professionally, um, government. How

306
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.719
should I say this, right? Uh, OFFICIALS officially recognized

307
00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:21.849
dream interpreters. OK, so, so they would be part

308
00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:24.530
of the government, um, the state, and their job

309
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.849
is to interpret significant dreams, um, and so, so

310
00:19:28.849 --> 00:19:32.130
that's a prominent kind of dream interpreter and they're

311
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:38.219
also. Uh, PROFESSIONALS who, um, who do not work

312
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:42.680
for the government, um, but because there existed, uh,

313
00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:45.449
the need to for people to understand their dreams,

314
00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:48.930
um, they, they get paid to interpret others' dreams

315
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.170
and to tell them the meaning of those dreams,

316
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.099
um. And there's the interesting part about this is

317
00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:57.130
that there seems to be a decline in people's

318
00:19:57.459 --> 00:20:01.500
trust um in professional dream interpreters over time, over

319
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.750
dynasty time, um, for, for some reason. So that's

320
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.569
that there seems to be this pattern, um and

321
00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:11.420
and my interpretation is that it's, it's because dreams

322
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.310
are, there are some. Characteristics about dreams that makes

323
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:21.219
it um um. A bit more suspicious, um, in

324
00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:26.479
terms of the Reliability of their interpretation. Because they're

325
00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:28.719
private, right, you can make things up about what

326
00:20:28.719 --> 00:20:32.520
you dream and um it's, it's not immediate, always

327
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.280
immediately obvious, right? There, there can be this culturally

328
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.380
agreed upon. Um, WAYS of interpreting meaning of specific

329
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.280
dreams. So compared to other divination methods, there, there

330
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.920
seems, there seems to be a decline in the

331
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.339
popularity and people's trust in uh dream interpretation, in

332
00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:57.689
interpreting dreams, especially. As a professional activity. But people

333
00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:02.829
have always believed that dreams. Meant something, right? It's

334
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:06.869
just interpreting, extracting the correct meaning of dreams can

335
00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:09.540
be very difficult, and we can't trust any single

336
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.150
professionals, uh, any single specialists, but, but it, it's

337
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.910
possible, right? If there is, there's this really smart

338
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.790
guy, um, really knowledgeable, uh, specialist, then he or

339
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.989
she could, uh, in principle obtain the true meaning

340
00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:24.469
of dreams.

341
00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:28.479
But is it that in certain specific cases it

342
00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:33.439
is the person herself that interprets her own dreams

343
00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:34.550
or not?

344
00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:38.489
I think that's possible, right? Um, AS a professional,

345
00:21:38.609 --> 00:21:41.930
you know, you master the art of interpreting the

346
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.250
mean of dreams and then you dream of something

347
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.410
yourself, then you can try to interpret that for

348
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.760
yourself. Yeah, that's certainly possible.

349
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.579
Mhm. And what influences the way that that people

350
00:21:56.579 --> 00:21:59.849
or how people interpret dreams? I mean, are there

351
00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:03.969
specific cognitive and social aspects that play a role

352
00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:04.250
here?

353
00:22:05.489 --> 00:22:14.209
Right, so, um, there are Cultural specific. Aspects to

354
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:17.689
this, obviously, right? Certain, certain cultures might view dreams

355
00:22:17.689 --> 00:22:21.770
in, in particular ways, other cultures slightly different ways,

356
00:22:21.969 --> 00:22:24.560
but the universal pattern is that they all think

357
00:22:24.729 --> 00:22:27.489
um dreams are significant, right? There's some meaning to

358
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:32.699
be extracted. And at the level of individual cognition.

359
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.939
I think there's the uh uh tendency for people

360
00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:42.500
to see patterns um even if sometimes real patterns

361
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.060
do not exist. So this is pattern detection. Um,

362
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.300
AND, um, There's also, so now I'm talking about

363
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.869
sort of the cultural transmission biases that plays a

364
00:22:53.869 --> 00:23:01.760
role, um. In this, they tend to. Retrospectively infer

365
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.349
meaning of their dreams and sometimes they would refer

366
00:23:05.349 --> 00:23:10.790
to um documented records or testimonies from other people

367
00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:16.000
that this dream uh means that thing and lo

368
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.459
and behold like that, that was fulfilled, right, accurate

369
00:23:19.459 --> 00:23:23.640
prediction, um, and that contribute to their, their, um.

370
00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:27.469
Uh, TRUST, the confidence in the validity of dream

371
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:31.540
as um something meaningful, uh, that conveys meaning to

372
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.680
be extracted. And then there's uh what I call

373
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.760
false memory or fabrication dreams. So we tend to

374
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.770
sometimes when we dream of something, we are. In

375
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.989
our brain, like we don't possess the full, the,

376
00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:49.939
the complete story. So we make things up, we

377
00:23:49.939 --> 00:23:53.010
fill in the blanks um cognitively, and then we

378
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.890
tell the story to other people um which further

379
00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.609
contributes to um transmission of um dream divination, successful

380
00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:04.209
dream divination episodes and that that contributes to um

381
00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:05.060
its persistence.

382
00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:10.910
And why is it that cross culturally, people believe

383
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.949
that dreams can foretell what will happen in the

384
00:24:14.949 --> 00:24:15.349
future?

385
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.459
Um, BECAUSE people, so somehow I already mentioned some

386
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:24.099
of the reasons, dreams are, so the the ability

387
00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:26.819
to dream is a human universal. Um, I think

388
00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:29.819
we have good neuroscientific evidence for that. So we

389
00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:36.890
dream and dreams often. Tells us, tell us or

390
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.420
or we interpret dreams as a somewhat coherent, coherent

391
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:46.369
story. Right, it has meaning and, and, um, in

392
00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:49.810
particular, we would dream of something that we are

393
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.530
familiar with or, or ancestors or friends and relatives

394
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.569
doing things. Um AND there are these plots, it's

395
00:24:56.569 --> 00:24:58.849
like a mini video, a movie of some sort.

396
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.060
And so there's this very strong intuition that. That

397
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.500
can't mean nothing, right? There there's got a got

398
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.619
means something and then there's these, this efforts to

399
00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:14.119
try to identify patterns, right to um And in

400
00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:17.520
some cases there, um there would be systematic efforts

401
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.199
to, to document other people's dreams and training for

402
00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:24.109
patterns um um and, and, um, people would, would

403
00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:27.989
uh write divination manuals, dream divination manuals based on

404
00:25:27.989 --> 00:25:31.880
these combination of transmitted records and their own intuition.

405
00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:37.369
And then readers read these, they get. And, and

406
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.410
so those are books, those are books, books mean

407
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.520
something, um, and, and uh so that contributed to

408
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.170
their confidence in dream divination for their.

409
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.910
Mhm. So, I mean, in modern industrialized societies, there

410
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.300
are many people who tend to think of magic

411
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.979
or practices like magic and divination as being archaic

412
00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:03.550
and not really, and no longer part of the

413
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.790
kinds of societies we live in. But is, is

414
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.510
that really the case? I mean, uh, do practices

415
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:15.349
like magic and divination still persist in modern industrialized

416
00:26:15.349 --> 00:26:20.430
and post-industrial societies, and if so, how do they

417
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.270
persist there?

418
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.030
Yeah, so, um, a common ar, uh, I wanna

419
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.449
say a little bit about the historical development of

420
00:26:28.449 --> 00:26:32.869
this, uh, this, this line of thought. The sectionization

421
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:36.829
thesis, uh, proposed by Max Weber and, um, and

422
00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:42.989
his followers posits that this human societies post-industrial industrial

423
00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:47.770
and post-industrial societies are becoming more secular. In the

424
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.209
sense that there, there was this gradual, uh, or

425
00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.729
just decline of magical thinking, the world has enchanted

426
00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:57.130
garden, um, that was a thing of the past

427
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.050
of the past and now we are, we are,

428
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.170
we're more than we no longer do that. And

429
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.410
then there was a pushback against that by psychologists

430
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.640
and anthropologists saying that no, no, no, we are.

431
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.839
We are still very much um superstitious um and

432
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:18.089
they they're. Profession workers to, to find, to identify

433
00:27:18.089 --> 00:27:24.180
aspects in contemporary modern humans um where. They could

434
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.020
say that look, this is evidence that you are

435
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.300
still, we are or a college educated people are

436
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.540
still reasoning magically and so forth. So I want

437
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.300
to push back against that, so I want to

438
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.699
push back against push back. It's going back to

439
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:43.500
the original seronization thesis a little bit, um, and

440
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:50.819
say that. They exist Uh, magical thinking, magical practices,

441
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.479
which includedation. Exist in uh contemporary modern societies. But

442
00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:59.390
they're not, but there there is a qualitative difference

443
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.660
between. Popularity, their popularity today in contemporary large scale

444
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:10.349
modern societies and its status in the past, uh,

445
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:15.689
traditional societies in the sense that we, um, It's

446
00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:20.290
often marginalized. Right in our societies, so we can.

447
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.349
Yes, there are people who who believe in astrology

448
00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:28.369
to some extent, tarot card divination, right, or, or

449
00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:31.640
eating divination in China, um, but those are not

450
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.040
their, their, their status, right, their social, uh, political

451
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.329
status is, is nothing comparable to what it was

452
00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:40.959
in the past, and particularly if you think about

453
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:44.410
the more. I I want, I want to use

454
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.729
the word primitive, but, but that's probably not um

455
00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:50.689
a fashionable word to use anymore. TRADITIONAL societies, right,

456
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.780
where when people get sick. What do they do?

457
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.209
They go to the minor, they try to find

458
00:28:56.219 --> 00:28:58.780
find out uh what's the the identity of the

459
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.150
ghosts or spirits that's causing the physical illness. OK,

460
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.099
that's what they do. There's no, not no medicine

461
00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:11.699
in contemporary, uh, more than sense. um, SO you

462
00:29:11.699 --> 00:29:14.599
perform divination and then you perform an exorcist ritual

463
00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:18.170
to expel, to get rid of the ghost. Um,

464
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.890
WHICH is very, we don't do that anymore, right?

465
00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:23.339
By and large, we don't do that. The vast

466
00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:26.589
majority of people in contemporary societies would go to

467
00:29:26.589 --> 00:29:29.660
the hospital, see a doctor, right? We, we have

468
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.589
the germ theory of illness. That does not require,

469
00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:37.119
right, uh spirit possession, um. Um, IT just, it,

470
00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:41.770
it does not allow that, right, um, metaphysically. So

471
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.290
that's the difference, uh, and I think it's that

472
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:50.400
difference is real, um. That we possess a, I'm

473
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.520
speaking about averages. In general, people in contemporary modern

474
00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.619
societies have a mechanistic or materialistic worldview that would

475
00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:09.400
make certain Claims about causality. Um, SUSPICIOUS and we

476
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.160
don't need any evidence. We just that just doesn't

477
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.010
feel right to us. Um, SO that's the difference.

478
00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:17.750
Now I want to emphasize the, uh, the similarity.

479
00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:23.420
There's still the um. Cognitive and cultural transmission biases

480
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.920
going on. So confirmation bias and the reporting of

481
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.260
uh predictive uh magical failures. And, um, so those

482
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.260
are some factors that contribute to the fact that

483
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.890
a minority of um population in contemporary modern societies

484
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:46.079
still um Believe, but not entirely, right? They might,

485
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.900
they might have some partial belief about the efficacy

486
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.500
of, of these practices, or plausibility of these practices.

487
00:30:54.349 --> 00:30:57.560
So, some of these similarities um are due to

488
00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.239
common psychological and cultural transmission biases, but at the

489
00:31:01.239 --> 00:31:05.380
same time, I think we should um we should

490
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.500
face the reality that there is a very sharp

491
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.079
difference between the, the worldview that we have, um,

492
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.260
that's very different from the traditional worldview.

493
00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:19.989
Mhm. So, uh, let me ask you now, what

494
00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:25.349
is chance and where do chance-based explanations stem from?

495
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.390
Um, CHANCE, OK, so now we're talking about something,

496
00:31:29.469 --> 00:31:32.239
um, different. So in my work, I, I define

497
00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:39.959
chance, um, In particular, um, In the context of

498
00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:45.560
using chance in explanations, explaining uh events that's already

499
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:53.500
happened. By invoking the intrinsic randomness or unpredictability, which

500
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.900
is inherent to the system, inherent to the uncertain

501
00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.949
phenomena, and this is referred to as aliatory or

502
00:32:00.949 --> 00:32:05.790
antic randomness. It's something about the process, process itself

503
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.140
that's random, that's unpredictable, and there's nothing we can

504
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.660
do about it, right? And we accept that as

505
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.989
a fact of the universe. OK. And this, this

506
00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:18.189
is kind of uncertainty is fundamentally different from another

507
00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:23.750
form of uncertainty which is called epistemic or subjective

508
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.380
uncertainty in the literature, uh, which refers to, uh,

509
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.630
the, the lack of knowledge of us human beings

510
00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:33.510
because of uh the fact that we are finite,

511
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.939
cognitively finite creatures, we can't know. Things all that

512
00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:41.319
well. Um, SO the fact that there are uncertainties

513
00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:43.709
in the world is because of our own ignorance,

514
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.939
right? So, but that's different from, again, from the

515
00:32:46.939 --> 00:32:52.550
intrinsic randomness. Stochasticity in the process or event itself.

516
00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:56.640
Right. So, so, uh, that's the distinction and I,

517
00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.680
the argument that I make, uh, in some of

518
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:06.979
my recent work is that um Human individuals. To

519
00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:11.800
not have. The concept of chance in the former

520
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.949
sense, which is the, the aliatory, right, the intrinsic

521
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:20.000
sense. And that has interesting and then significant consequences

522
00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:23.290
for how they understand their own cultural practices, um.

523
00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:27.560
So that's what what are some of those?

524
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.869
Uh, SO in the case of gambling, for example.

525
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.260
Um, IF you think that there's no intrinsic randomness

526
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.229
and when you throw a dye, so let me,

527
00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:43.270
let me start from the, from the opposite, right?

528
00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:50.380
For us, people with Um, knowledge in probability, um.

529
00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:54.500
We would view probably we would view the outcome

530
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.989
of the throw of a die, a fair die,

531
00:33:57.219 --> 00:34:02.079
six-sided die as. Prob mistake in the sense that

532
00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:06.849
it's 1/6, right, for any um. Any given number.

533
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.168
And that's just it, right? It's 1 or 6,

534
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.219
it's, it's a number, uh, and we can use

535
00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:15.478
it to do computations. But, but we, there's, there's

536
00:34:15.478 --> 00:34:18.958
nothing beyond that 1/6 that we can know more

537
00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:22.049
about the process. If you don't have the concept

538
00:34:22.049 --> 00:34:25.217
of uh uh aliatory chance, then you might think

539
00:34:25.217 --> 00:34:28.560
that it's not. That you probably don't know that

540
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.010
it's just 1 or 6 thing, you think that

541
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.770
there's some method in which you could uh you

542
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.649
could uh resort to in order to get more

543
00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:40.819
information about what's going to happen. So you would

544
00:34:40.819 --> 00:34:43.259
do divination, right? You would perform divination rituals to

545
00:34:43.259 --> 00:34:47.018
get um to you know hoping to know what's

546
00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:51.708
going to happen uh in a uh in a

547
00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:54.018
lottery, for example, you purchase ticket, you hope that

548
00:34:54.018 --> 00:34:55.549
you're gonna win and you need to pick a

549
00:34:55.549 --> 00:34:58.898
number out of 26, 36, um, so they would,

550
00:34:58.979 --> 00:35:02.128
they would do divination rituals in order to, yeah,

551
00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:07.448
to, to win. That's pretty significant, um, and, uh.

552
00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.899
In another consequence that I talked about in my

553
00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:14.709
other paper is, is that. If you don't think

554
00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:20.219
it's possible that things can just happen for. Reason

555
00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:24.439
for the reason that there exist these objective probabilities

556
00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:26.689
in the world, then you always want to know

557
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:30.139
why, right? You want to You want to know

558
00:35:30.139 --> 00:35:36.060
what's causing um this misfortune, right, happening seemingly for

559
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.370
no reason to this person. So there would be

560
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:46.270
this very uh potent. Psychological motivation for you to.

561
00:35:47.169 --> 00:35:49.479
Really try to come up with some sort of

562
00:35:49.479 --> 00:35:52.850
sort of explanation, and oftentimes those explanations are are

563
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:58.090
incorrect. Right, so and that that contribute to the,

564
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:06.120
the um. The prevalence, prevalence of uh. False beliefs,

565
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.979
um. Which includes taboos, which I talked about in

566
00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:11.489
my other work.

567
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.659
Yes, we're going to talk about taboos later on

568
00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:18.580
in our conversation. So, so let me ask you

569
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.860
now about some of the work you've done in

570
00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.209
cultural evolution. I mean, tell us about transmission biases.

571
00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:29.659
What are they and what are the different types

572
00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:31.330
of transmission biases?

573
00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:35.129
OK, uh, so again, this is a different topic,

574
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.919
um, and I should say that I I no

575
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:43.110
longer My, I don't focus, I don't spend much

576
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.350
of my time working on that, uh, my research

577
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.989
anymore. So, so this is my past work. Um,

578
00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:53.320
I did some theoretical modeling, simulation modeling, modeling of

579
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.479
the evolution of cultural transmission. And um, so in

580
00:36:57.479 --> 00:37:00.159
this work, uh, in this type of life work,

581
00:37:00.199 --> 00:37:05.189
I study transmission biases which refer to the systematic

582
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.800
psychological or social tendencies, uh, influencing which ideas, behaviors,

583
00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:13.439
practices, values are more likely to, to be passed

584
00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:16.399
on within a society to be copied from one

585
00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:21.389
person to another. Um, AND, uh, these transmission biases

586
00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:28.610
shape cultural evolution by selectively promoting, facilitating, uh. The

587
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:33.010
transmission of certain cultural variants, cultural information, broadly speaking

588
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.689
over others, um, sometimes independent of their actual adaptive

589
00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:39.770
value or truthfulness if I we're talking about um

590
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.899
beliefs. So it would be a sim uh in,

591
00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:49.320
in a typical simulation um model, I would define

592
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.290
assumptions first. Individuals tend to Um, that there are

593
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.500
these different types of cultural information in the population,

594
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.090
excuse me, and then I set up some, some

595
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.479
of the very basic forms of information transmission dynamics

596
00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:08.810
and then I evaluate, um, Alternative possibilities for individuals

597
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.169
to be, uh, for, for, for information to be

598
00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:15.330
transmitted and then observe the uh equilibrium outcome at

599
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.250
the population level and say something about this is

600
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:22.060
the condition that favors the evolution of This bias,

601
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.979
right, conformance transmission bias or this is a condition

602
00:38:24.979 --> 00:38:28.780
that would favor the evolution of uh payoff transmission

603
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.719
bias. Um, SO, so, so that's the, uh, so

604
00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:36.800
that's what I do, um, yeah, for this.

605
00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:40.459
Mhm BUT uh I mean, what are the different

606
00:38:40.459 --> 00:38:42.969
types of transmission biases?

607
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.449
Um, YEAH, so, so in this literature, um, there

608
00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:51.479
are generally 3 types of different transmission bias biases.

609
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:56.570
There are content-based. So, so these are, these biases

610
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.340
refer to the tendency for us to preferentially copy

611
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.899
some piece of information based on the content and

612
00:39:03.899 --> 00:39:08.709
the examples would include. Uh, NEGATIVITY or threat bias,

613
00:39:08.919 --> 00:39:13.350
we tend to preferentially copy information that's uh negative,

614
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:18.760
perceived as negative, or threatening or dangerous. Um, uh,

615
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:24.169
OR the tendency to preferentially copy transmit information that

616
00:39:24.169 --> 00:39:32.580
is fear-inducing or morally charged, um. Compared to uh

617
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.949
the information that does not have this um property.

618
00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:40.010
So that's a content-based uh and then there is

619
00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:45.909
model-based uh bias, um, so. Uh, THE most famous,

620
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.199
uh, model-based bias is probably, uh, prestige bias or

621
00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:54.129
cultural information from the more prestigious individual, high status

622
00:39:54.129 --> 00:39:58.620
individual, respected individuals, uh, tend to get, uh, copied

623
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:04.050
or adopted more than uh information possessed by mediocre

624
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:10.500
average, uh, individuals. Um, AND then there's uh similarity

625
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.899
bias, so people also have a tendency to preferentially

626
00:40:13.899 --> 00:40:17.739
copy information from those who are similar to themselves

627
00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:23.479
in some aspect. Like sex or gender, um, or

628
00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:28.199
age or ethnic group. Where people who speak the

629
00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:34.709
same language as themselves. Um. Uh, SO that's success,

630
00:40:34.909 --> 00:40:39.389
uh, sorry, similarity-based bias, uh, and then there's success

631
00:40:39.389 --> 00:40:43.679
based based payoff bias. So this is a situation

632
00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:48.399
where individuals can observe, uh, visibly the payoff of

633
00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:52.860
some. Uh, CULTURAL practice and then they're basing their

634
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.179
decision on the observed success. The idea is that

635
00:40:57.179 --> 00:41:02.760
they're gonna preferentially copy. Uh, CULTURAL practice, cultural variants

636
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:09.469
and that, uh, results in more success. So that's

637
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:12.909
the uh the second type. Uh AND the 3rd

638
00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:17.790
type of transmission bias is frequency dependent bias. So

639
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.330
this would include conformity bias, which um I studied

640
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.070
uh a little bit, um, and also the opposite

641
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.510
of conformity bias would be rarity bias. People for

642
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.709
some reason and their conditions uh for this to

643
00:41:30.709 --> 00:41:37.350
happen, um, would preferentially copy the, the rare variant.

644
00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:40.560
Uh, IN the population, it's the opposite of conformance

645
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.129
bias. Um, AND then there is so-called unbiased frequency

646
00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:50.679
dependent, which means that the probability for individual to

647
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.850
copy, um, cultural variants in the population is the

648
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.929
same as the proportion of that cultural variant in

649
00:41:59.929 --> 00:42:03.949
the population. So, say the cultural variant A has

650
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:12.080
um 0 95% presence in the population and the

651
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.879
individual is having um a 95% probability of copy

652
00:42:16.879 --> 00:42:19.729
that variant, that would be a case where there's

653
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:23.500
no bias. And the consequence of having no bias

654
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.520
in frequency dependent transmission is that the frequency of

655
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.699
different cultural variants. Will not change over time. It

656
00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:33.820
will remain at 95%.

657
00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:41.120
Right. So do these different biases operate alone or

658
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.949
can they be combined?

659
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.360
Uh, THEY They can be combined, and I think

660
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.060
in reality, um, they are almost always combined, um,

661
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:59.419
and this is because. We There are almost always

662
00:42:59.419 --> 00:43:05.370
multiple cues, right? um THAT exist. Simultaneously, um, that

663
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.729
we need to take into consideration when we make

664
00:43:07.729 --> 00:43:15.449
a decision regarding what to copy. Um, And I

665
00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:17.370
think this is, uh, this is obviously true, OK,

666
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.929
um, and in my research, I would, I emphasize

667
00:43:20.929 --> 00:43:25.770
that, uh, transmission biases in cultural evolution rarely operate

668
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.919
in isolation and the, the fact that, uh, most

669
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:33.689
research tend to focus on one, tend to focus

670
00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:37.889
on individual transmission biases is because they uh prefer

671
00:43:37.889 --> 00:43:41.929
analytic clarity, right? It's easier to analyze the consequence

672
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:45.580
or the evolution of Um, biases when you focus

673
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:51.600
on what. Um, INDIVIDUALLY or these transmission mices individually.

674
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.929
uh, BUT it's possible to come up with some

675
00:43:53.929 --> 00:43:57.939
ways to combine that individuals use to combine different

676
00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:05.149
Ques, for example, frequency and payoff. So in the

677
00:44:05.149 --> 00:44:06.780
paper that I published a couple of years ago,

678
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.580
I, I would, um. Um, I came up with

679
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.159
a model, uh, where individual agents combine, so they

680
00:44:15.159 --> 00:44:19.540
take, which means taking into consideration, right, both factors

681
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.229
when they're making the decision. Uh, SO payoff they

682
00:44:23.229 --> 00:44:26.550
have payoff information about this particular, this particular cultural

683
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.479
variants, but they also have, they sample, um, some,

684
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.090
some individuals from the. Population and then they compute

685
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:38.209
the frequency and they use that frequency information in

686
00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:41.129
their decision making as well. Um, AND here we

687
00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:43.729
have to, I have to make some assumptions about

688
00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:49.409
how individual agents. Uh, COMBINE this, and that's, um,

689
00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:52.770
and I have to justify why I make those

690
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.929
assumptions, um. Um, SO, so, so, yeah, so I

691
00:44:56.929 --> 00:45:01.090
think in reality people almost always um combine different

692
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.530
biases to make their decisions, but this presents a

693
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:09.639
challenge for scholars to, to, to, to analyze these

694
00:45:10.149 --> 00:45:15.800
uh transmission biases and um. And, and that can

695
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.120
be, can be difficult.

696
00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:23.050
Mhm. So in regards to com combining different kinds

697
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:27.399
of biases, transmission biases, tell us about the specific

698
00:45:27.399 --> 00:45:31.290
example of the combination of the conformity or the

699
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:36.409
conformist bias and the payoff bias in decision making.

700
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:43.300
Um, OK, so an example would be Suppose, um,

701
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.739
a, a newcomer to the technical term for this

702
00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:52.030
is um naive, culturally naive person, individual, um, is

703
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.790
faced with this, with a decision of either adopting.

704
00:45:55.879 --> 00:46:01.770
Cultural variant A or B. TO say that, um.

705
00:46:03.129 --> 00:46:05.909
So, so, in, um, but let me make that

706
00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:08.250
a bit concrete. So let's say this is a

707
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:13.379
person who is deciding between two different farming practices,

708
00:46:13.629 --> 00:46:16.719
um, very important choice and let's say for the

709
00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:19.300
sake of argument that there are only two options

710
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.879
either A or B. And then um the naive

711
00:46:22.879 --> 00:46:27.790
person observe. It can can observe uh what others

712
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.679
are doing in the community. And um frequency information

713
00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:35.909
in this case would just be the proportion of

714
00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:42.840
um the. Observed sample, the models that that he

715
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:48.429
or she samples from, from the population. Yeah Uh,

716
00:46:48.469 --> 00:46:53.300
practicing a particular, uh, um. Um, SORRY, engaging in

717
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.979
a particular farming practice. And let's say, uh, practice

718
00:46:56.979 --> 00:47:02.860
A is. Is being adopted by 75% of the

719
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:07.989
population. Practice B is, is used by 25%. That's

720
00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:12.409
frequency information, and the agent is going to consider

721
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:15.889
that. Another type of information would be payoff. So

722
00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:18.050
in this case, it could, it would refer to

723
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:24.250
the uh uh agricultural productivity associated with uh practice

724
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.290
A or practice B. And let's say this naive

725
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:33.340
person has access to such payoff information. OK. Now

726
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.419
he or she has two types of cues, 2

727
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:42.290
types of information, and A decision needs to be

728
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:47.290
made. So that person has to mentally weigh the

729
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.689
relative importance of these two types of information. It

730
00:47:50.689 --> 00:47:53.449
could be the case that uh the vast majority

731
00:47:53.449 --> 00:47:57.239
of the population is practicing A for some reason,

732
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.649
I say, but he observes that uh uh the

733
00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:06.149
productivity is actually higher for B. Now, right, he

734
00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:08.229
has to make a decision and it's gonna depend

735
00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:13.870
on uh how we formally model the decision-making process.

736
00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:18.280
If he or she weighs on frequency information more

737
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:23.280
heavily than that, then, then, um, then that person

738
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:28.179
is more likely to adopt agricultural practice A. On

739
00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:32.100
the other hand, if that person weighs payoff information

740
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.620
more heavily then um then he's gonna adopt practice

741
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.189
B. And same logic would apply to other, um,

742
00:48:41.199 --> 00:48:43.100
the adoption of other cultural practices.

743
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:48.550
Uh, I mean, and do we understand why in

744
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:55.239
combining different kinds of biases, some people would, uh,

745
00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.300
care more about the information coming from one bias

746
00:49:00.709 --> 00:49:03.429
than the other and why they would weigh them

747
00:49:03.429 --> 00:49:07.350
differently, uh, and, and pick one over the other.

748
00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:10.350
I mean, do, do we understand why and how

749
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:11.189
that happens?

750
00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:15.030
We actually do not understand the um the empirical

751
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.590
reality of this very well. Um, WHAT I've been

752
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:22.489
talking about is for theoretical modelers. THIS is how,

753
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.239
how they do their work, how, how I used

754
00:49:24.239 --> 00:49:26.080
to do this type of work. Uh YOU make

755
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.510
assumptions and then you analyze the Evolutionary trajectory of

756
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:32.540
how different, um, so you can set up a

757
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.729
stimulation study where agents um have different weights. Yeah,

758
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.929
OK. And then you have them interact or we

759
00:49:39.929 --> 00:49:43.290
have them engage in this uh copying uh game,

760
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:46.280
this process, and then you run the simulation for

761
00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:49.129
a large number of generations and you observe the

762
00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:53.250
equilibrium outcome. If it turns out that there's a

763
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:58.760
particular weight that seems to um Uh, to be

764
00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.780
stable after you run the stimulation for 100, 200

765
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.959
generations, then you can make an argument that this

766
00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:09.290
is, uh, this, this particular combination, this particular weight

767
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:14.600
of payoff cues and frequency cues can evolve and

768
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.629
you justify that, that by, uh, in your work.

769
00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:21.239
I don't think there's any work um so far

770
00:50:21.239 --> 00:50:26.030
in psychology that examines empirically how people Do this

771
00:50:26.479 --> 00:50:29.590
and you can imagine why this is difficult, right?

772
00:50:30.889 --> 00:50:35.889
Because Um, we don't. It's not always easy to

773
00:50:35.889 --> 00:50:39.449
measure this, and we have to assume, so the

774
00:50:39.449 --> 00:50:43.520
decision making process is, is. Um, AND is, is

775
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.280
not transparent, uh, and researchers have to make inferences

776
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.020
based on the observed action. So it's not well

777
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.060
understood empirically, but we can build theoretical models.

778
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.790
Mhm. I understand. So, the last topic I would

779
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:02.520
like to ask you about is taboos. So where

780
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.760
do taboos stem from? I mean, where do they

781
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.830
come from exactly?

782
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.729
Yeah, so taboos, um, There are a couple of

783
00:51:13.729 --> 00:51:18.159
different sources, um. Let me, let me define taboos,

784
00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:22.239
um, first of all. OK, so, um, I define

785
00:51:22.239 --> 00:51:27.790
it as Cultural prohibitions, this is a thing, something

786
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.590
that you you're not supposed to do and there

787
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:33.959
might be punishment. Uh, IF you violate, if you

788
00:51:33.959 --> 00:51:37.520
transgress, um, a taboo, OK, and this is a

789
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.260
very general, um, definition. And as such, there are

790
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.070
a couple different sources where taboos can emerge in

791
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:53.510
human societies, and I focus on uh one particular.

792
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.060
Uh, PATHWAY for the emergence of taboos, and that

793
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.179
is the cognitive pathway, um, and what or what

794
00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:08.270
I call uh retrospective causal attribution. In human societies.

795
00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:12.469
And this refers to the idea that misfortunes are

796
00:52:12.469 --> 00:52:17.350
gonna happen. In human societies, right? Um, AND because

797
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.110
human individuals in traditional societies do not have, um,

798
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.280
a ready concept of aliatory or ontic. Intrinsic chance,

799
00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:30.449
they're gonna want to find out. They're gonna want

800
00:52:30.449 --> 00:52:34.010
to know what caused the misfortune. So they will

801
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:38.479
engage in a process where they speculate on possible

802
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:42.889
uh possible reasons for that mis misfortune causes for

803
00:52:42.889 --> 00:52:45.810
that misfortune to happen, and they identify, let's say

804
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:50.060
they tend toly decide that it, it's. Some cultural

805
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.770
practice that that led to some actions that the,

806
00:52:53.139 --> 00:52:56.649
the uh the agents uh performed in the past

807
00:52:56.649 --> 00:53:01.739
that caused his or her misfortune. Other people observes

808
00:53:01.739 --> 00:53:06.030
this attribution. It has the potential to become a

809
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:10.169
taboo. In human society in in any human society.

810
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:17.520
OK. So, for example, um, A failed pregnancy? Um,

811
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:22.040
WHICH is uh very common in traditional societies. Um,

812
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:26.449
COULD, uh, compel people to identify causes of that

813
00:53:26.449 --> 00:53:31.959
failed pregnancy and they might uh. Uh REMIND themselves

814
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:37.050
that uh the pregnant woman, women, female, uh, consumed

815
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:41.699
some meat. In the past, um, rabbit meat, for

816
00:53:41.699 --> 00:53:44.540
example, and then, OK, so now we've got a

817
00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.649
taboo against the consumption of rabbit meat, uh, when

818
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:54.270
the women are, uh, pregnant. Mhm. Right. And then

819
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:58.750
this process can repeat itself. Because oftentimes this cause

820
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:03.750
of retribution is incorrect, right? The same misfortune can

821
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.340
happen again, through pregnancy and then people are gonna

822
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.679
try to find the causes again, um. So this

823
00:54:11.679 --> 00:54:13.320
time it's gonna be something else, right? So it's

824
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.479
not about rabbit meat, it's, it could be about

825
00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:17.919
some other things that that people did in the

826
00:54:17.919 --> 00:54:21.280
past that caused the misfortune, and we have another

827
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.939
taboo. And you can see how this this process

828
00:54:25.939 --> 00:54:29.820
serves as a socio cognitive engine that just pumps

829
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.989
taboos into society. And I think this nicely explains

830
00:54:33.989 --> 00:54:37.879
why traditional societies have so many taboos. Right, they're

831
00:54:37.879 --> 00:54:43.120
just numerous, there's uh culturally sanctioned prohibitions. You can't

832
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.320
do this, you can do that, um, and the

833
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:51.129
belief, uh, Uh, regarding what the, the negative consequences

834
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:52.810
if you violate these taboos.

835
00:54:55.149 --> 00:54:58.389
So are there, uh, is there a higher number

836
00:54:58.389 --> 00:55:03.639
of taboos in traditional societies than in industrial, industrial

837
00:55:03.639 --> 00:55:06.310
and post-industrial societies, for example?

838
00:55:06.689 --> 00:55:08.709
I think so. I think there is a difference,

839
00:55:08.879 --> 00:55:13.120
uh, and I referenced some of the qualitative uh

840
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.239
ethnographic work in in my paper. Um, I don't

841
00:55:17.239 --> 00:55:22.530
think there's any systematic quantitative comparisons yet. Um, BUT

842
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:26.229
the the impression, my impression is, is that. Yes,

843
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.439
there there's do seem to be, um, there does

844
00:55:29.439 --> 00:55:32.000
seem to be a difference between contemporary societies, because

845
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.439
if you think about um What When we say

846
00:55:38.439 --> 00:55:45.300
the word taboo, we tend to associate. Um, There's

847
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.379
something negative about the word, um, as if we're

848
00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:53.370
saying we're accusing that this is an irrational prohibition,

849
00:55:53.419 --> 00:55:56.939
right? This is taboo in some society because there

850
00:55:56.939 --> 00:55:59.649
is this cultural belief in a society which we

851
00:55:59.649 --> 00:56:01.739
don't consider as valid, right? So so we call

852
00:56:01.739 --> 00:56:05.550
that a taboo. Um, And we, and, and I

853
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.669
think it is um. It means that we we

854
00:56:09.669 --> 00:56:13.489
don't have as many taboos in our societies. And

855
00:56:13.489 --> 00:56:15.689
then we observe a lot more taboos, and in

856
00:56:15.689 --> 00:56:19.540
particular more food taboos. This is intriguing, um, that

857
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.889
there are these items that you're not supposed to

858
00:56:21.889 --> 00:56:26.550
eat. Um, AND, and, and all the, the beliefs

859
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:30.030
about the negative consequences if you eat these foods.

860
00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.860
Which are not written from a scientific perspective are

861
00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:37.649
not really sensical. They are just avoiding these very

862
00:56:37.649 --> 00:56:43.090
nutritious food sources. And there's more of that um

863
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.909
in in traditional societies.

864
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.879
Right, but, but is there any explanation as to

865
00:56:49.879 --> 00:56:54.290
why then there would be more taboos in traditional

866
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:58.479
societies than in industrialized than post-industrial societies?

867
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:01.399
Oh right, so my explanation is this is based

868
00:57:01.399 --> 00:57:03.790
on my work on chance again because we have

869
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:08.520
the concept of objective chance, um, misfortunes can be

870
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:14.500
just attributed to The intrinsic unpredictability of nature that

871
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:19.389
we're just, we accept um. That misfortunes can happen

872
00:57:19.389 --> 00:57:22.600
for no apparent reason, and we, that begs no

873
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.899
further questions. OK, there's a small probability that some

874
00:57:26.899 --> 00:57:30.889
people are gonna get cancer. And right as bad

875
00:57:30.889 --> 00:57:33.520
luck or genetic mutations that we can do nothing

876
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:40.010
about as opposed to persistently seeking an answer. Right,

877
00:57:40.169 --> 00:57:42.030
that's gonna if you try hard enough, you're gonna

878
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:46.389
find something, uh, which is. Most likely incorrect, um,

879
00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.689
and that can. That could contribute to the formation

880
00:57:49.689 --> 00:57:54.050
of taboo, which happens more in traditional societies, uh,

881
00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:56.889
and uh does not happen as much in, in

882
00:57:56.889 --> 00:58:00.800
contemporary modern societies. So that's, that's one explanation, sorry,

883
00:58:00.929 --> 00:58:03.760
one reason, and the other reason I think is,

884
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.939
is again because of the work. That, that we

885
00:58:06.939 --> 00:58:11.419
have a very mechanistic, uh, again, relatively speaking, more

886
00:58:11.419 --> 00:58:15.669
mechanistic and materialistic worldview about what can happen. So

887
00:58:15.669 --> 00:58:18.830
some taboos are just uh um wouldn't make very

888
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:20.550
much sense in our societies.

889
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.479
Mhm. So, anything else about taboos that we should

890
00:58:27.479 --> 00:58:31.080
know or can we wrap up our conversation?

891
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:37.199
Anything else about taboos, uh, they are, they are,

892
00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:40.810
um, they're very common as an ethnographic and historical

893
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:46.639
fact. Um, SOMETIMES they are oftentimes they're untrue, right?

894
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:54.330
So the taboos against uh. CONSUMPTION of certain items

895
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.689
during pregnancy or when you're sick are untrue, and

896
00:58:57.689 --> 00:59:01.409
they are in Tyler's words, the survival of the

897
00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:04.909
past. Um ONCE now we have the much better

898
00:59:04.909 --> 00:59:08.449
understanding of the causal structure of causal structures of

899
00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:12.919
the world, we know better, right? Um, SO. So

900
00:59:12.919 --> 00:59:14.639
I think that's, that would be the most important

901
00:59:14.639 --> 00:59:19.840
lesson for um relevant for, for people uh in

902
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.120
contemporary societies.

903
00:59:21.889 --> 00:59:26.260
Mhm. Great. So, uh, just before we go, would

904
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.010
you like to tell people where they can find

905
00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:30.659
