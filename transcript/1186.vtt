00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.539
Dissenter, and today I'm here with Alice Little. She's

3
00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.090
best known as America's most successful legal sex worker.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.729
OK, we have to talk about what that means,

5
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.569
and an intimate companionship expert, and she's also an

6
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:19.780
advocate for the adult industry. So Alice, welcome to

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.620
the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.649
Thank you, thank you so much for having me.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.860
That's, that's a big intro.

10
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.340
Well, I mean, I read that somewhere. I can't

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.459
remember exactly if it's, if it was on Ollie

12
00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:39.430
Randall's podcast or something like that. So I used

13
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.130
it for my introduction. Anyway, uh tell us a

14
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.540
little bit about yourself. I mean, what kind of

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.299
sex work do you do and how did you

16
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.220
get into it?

17
00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:52.139
Well, for the past 10 years, I have been

18
00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:56.580
working within the Nevada legal brothel system. Now, a

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.419
lot of people don't even realize that there are

20
00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:04.580
legal brothels in America. They're only in Nevada, only

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.139
within certain locations, and I happen to work at

22
00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.099
the Chicken Ranch, which is just outside of Las

23
00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.879
Vegas.

24
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.169
Yeah, but, but I mean, what kinds of, uh,

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.900
um, uh, uh, what kinds of clients do you

26
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
get? What kind of cli clientele, I mean, what

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.940
kinds of, I, I think I've asked this question

28
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.540
to, to another guest on the show, but people

29
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.449
have this common idea that Oh no, it's only,

30
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.449
you know, losers who pay for sex. It's only

31
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.160
men who are desperate. It's only, I, I mean,

32
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.209
it's, it's only good for nothing men, basically. So,

33
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.739
but what is your experience with that?

34
00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:51.089
Um, THE opposite of that. Pretty much everything you

35
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:57.389
said is. A common negative stereotype about people who

36
00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.750
see intimacy professionals, and that just comes from a

37
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.870
place of judgment, not from actual reality. I see

38
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.750
men of all ages. I see women. Of all

39
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.910
ages, 21 and up at the chicken ranch. Legal

40
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.800
disclaimer, big star there, you know, 21 and up

41
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.059
of all ages, but 21 all the way through.

42
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:26.440
I see married couples. I see polyamorous people. I

43
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.070
see every, everyone, everybody. And it comes from folks

44
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.070
of all walks of life. I see folks who

45
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.550
are doctors, I see folks who work in the

46
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.160
medical profession. I see people who have their own

47
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.039
businesses. I see people who are retired, like there's,

48
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.460
there's no one. Who comes to the ranch, it's

49
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.440
so many different people.

50
00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.020
Well, that bit about the married couples, I bet

51
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.940
that's very controversial to most conservatively minded people because

52
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.139
many of them would say, oh, that's not real

53
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.520
marriage, come on.

54
00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.699
Oh, OK, so cheating on each other is that's

55
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.220
real marriage. I'm sorry, if you want authentic, terrible

56
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.490
relationship drama. In which you get STD risk. I

57
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.050
mean, be my guest, sleep around. And you know

58
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.770
what, some couples just wanna have a threesome, and

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.690
that's OK, and they wanna do it with each

60
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
other, even better. I am tested for literally everything

61
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.410
under the sun every 7 days. Everything is done

62
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.929
with protection. I'm a professional. I know what I'm

63
00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:42.610
doing. What's the judge? Come on, let people have

64
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.000
fun.

65
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.750
Yeah, we're going to get into some of those

66
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.649
other myths that people have about sex work and

67
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.089
assumptions they make about sex workers, because some of

68
00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:57.160
them are just, uh, funny, I guess. So, uh,

69
00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.330
and but I, I mean, just to be on

70
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.050
a more serious note here, what do you think

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.630
are the pros and cons of sex work?

72
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.619
Oh, goodness. Cons, let's start there. Stigma. We've already

73
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.329
mentioned it. There's a lot of stigma and misconception

74
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.649
that comes with being an intimacy professional. Right now

75
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:25.769
on X, an adult performer, Riley Reed is going

76
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:29.790
around. And people are tying together photos of her

77
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.190
family with photos of her professional work, which is

78
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.989
absolutely disgusting, should not be happening. That's, who does

79
00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:43.209
that? That, that's not normal. But people make this

80
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.730
stereotype that, oh, you can't be in a happy

81
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.839
relationship and have a baby if you work in

82
00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:54.720
the intimacy industry. Uh, NEWSFLASH, we're real human people.

83
00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.929
We get to have families and relationships. Like I

84
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.730
have a whole goat farm. I've got like horses

85
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.209
and goats. It's a, it's a whole thing.

86
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.089
Yeah, and OK, and the pros.

87
00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.940
Well, there's still more cons. Uh, THERE'S banking discrimination.

88
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:15.760
Like, let's be real, there's a lot of cons

89
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.320
to being an intimacy professional. Uh, BANKING discrimination, even

90
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.049
when you work in a legal industry, your finances

91
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:29.244
aren't. Necessarily protected, a banking institution could choose to

92
00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:32.404
cancel your accounts at pretty much any time they

93
00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:36.125
feel like it. That's a tremendous risk. That's a

94
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.045
risk that most small businesses are not required to

95
00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:46.040
take on, yeah. Another con. Of this industry, hmm,

96
00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.079
let's see. There's a medical judgment. It can be

97
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.250
very difficult to find medical professionals that don't judge

98
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.890
or stigmatize you for what you do. I know

99
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.529
I personally have been on the receiving end of

100
00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.010
medical discrimination. They almost missed appendicitis thinking that it

101
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.420
could have been an STD or STI. When I

102
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.470
had just been tested literally the day before and

103
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.709
the results had already come back, everything was fine.

104
00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:14.190
I, I just had like appendicitis. They had to

105
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.739
take my appendix out and they,

106
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.350
so basically doctors tend to assume that you must

107
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.890
have some STI.

108
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.850
Yeah, ridiculous, absolutely problematic, but that is a reality

109
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.000
and people should be aware of these things if

110
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.779
they're considering getting into this industry. But there's lots

111
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.799
of pros to this as well. If you enjoy

112
00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:42.700
intimacy and connection, you're gonna have a really good

113
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.440
time because so much of the job is getting

114
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.859
to connect with people. Regardless what type of intimacy

115
00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:54.339
professional you are, you are going to be interacting

116
00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.160
with people, your colleagues, you're gonna be interacting with

117
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.799
your guests, you're gonna be interacting with your co-performers.

118
00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.690
You're gonna be having these very beautiful. Intimate relationships

119
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.649
with these people, and that's a really positive thing.

120
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.790
You get the opportunity to meet some of the

121
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.910
most interesting, fascinating, and wonderful people from all sorts

122
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.869
of walks of life. You will have the opportunity

123
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.859
to expand your horizons to whole new levels based

124
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.709
off of the conversations that you get to have

125
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.950
with other people. You learn so much more about

126
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.769
yourself and the world around you and how people

127
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:39.880
love and interact and connect, and it's It's incredible.

128
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:44.269
I mean, there is no other industry that allows

129
00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:46.750
you to see people for who they are so

130
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.769
clearly, and for me, that's a huge, huge pro.

131
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.059
And of course, there is a financial benefit, like,

132
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.100
I am the most successful person to come out

133
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.950
of the Nevada brothel industry. I've made 7 figures

134
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.339
of income in one single calendar year. That's, that's

135
00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.299
something I did and it certainly has allowed me

136
00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:11.820
to live my dreams and it makes me incredibly

137
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.200
grateful for what I do.

138
00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:16.880
Yeah, that's awesome. So let me ask you, because

139
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.079
uh not only did I listen to some episodes

140
00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:24.619
of your, I guess, unless I missed something, your

141
00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:28.559
old podcast, because the last episode I, I found

142
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:30.799
was from 2019 and I was like, oh come

143
00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:33.520
on, there have to be more episodes here. And,

144
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.200
but people also told me that you are interested

145
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.308
in the history of Sex work. So how old

146
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:41.750
is sex work? I mean, how long has it

147
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.109
been around in human societies? And I guess the

148
00:08:44.109 --> 00:08:46.469
short answer is forever, right? But

149
00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:50.109
anyway, how old is it? It is the accurate

150
00:08:50.109 --> 00:08:55.429
answer forever. When we look at the first written

151
00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:59.510
examples of law, we see evidence of language describing

152
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.039
sex workers. And how sex workers should be treated

153
00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:06.179
by the rest of society. Well, clearly there were

154
00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:10.280
sex workers. When we go to Pompeii, we can

155
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.679
see graffiti on the walls of follow. Me to

156
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:21.510
a good time, essentially like. Written ads on the

157
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.679
wall like some hilarious ones. There's some really lewd

158
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:29.409
ones like you probably have to censor those. I

159
00:09:29.409 --> 00:09:35.270
mean paintings and like tile like we found brothels

160
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.150
we know where the brothels were it was a

161
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.940
thing we see them we have evidence of them,

162
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.299
they exist. And they exist all over the states

163
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:47.929
like they exist in New Orleans, they exist in

164
00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:54.169
Texas and Alaska, and all throughout the gold rush

165
00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:58.150
era. There's brothels, brothels, brothels, brothels, brothels. I mean,

166
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:02.880
all across the westward expansion, brothels, brothels, brothels, brothels,

167
00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:08.679
brothels, like. They are everywhere here and globally. It's

168
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:10.929
just that we since have legislated them down to

169
00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:14.520
this very, very small narrow area of it's legal,

170
00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.719
but only here and here and here and here.

171
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.359
There's only like 19 places left that still have

172
00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:21.380
licenses.

173
00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:25.059
Oh my God. I mean, which is actually funny

174
00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:27.700
because it's a profession that it's, it's been around

175
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.820
forever, but, uh, uh, something that's also been around

176
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.380
forever is stigma against sex workers, even though all

177
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.419
every uh all kinds of men, uh, I mean,

178
00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.330
pay for sex work, and also, uh, there was,

179
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:46.419
I'm not sure if there still is, but at

180
00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:49.174
least until very recently. Recently in history, there was

181
00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:54.715
um a tradition of uh men taking their sons

182
00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:58.864
to sex workers to lose their virginity and stuff

183
00:10:58.864 --> 00:11:01.395
like that, so I mean it's sort of funny

184
00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.544
because it's like hypocritical,

185
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:07.114
right? Yeah, so that, that last one as far

186
00:11:07.114 --> 00:11:11.515
as men taking their now 21 year old sons

187
00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:15.700
to a brothel. It that that happens. That is

188
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.299
a real thing that still happens today. It's, it's

189
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.119
still a thing. No, it totally is a thing

190
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.710
like, OK, let's be realistic. Unless you come from

191
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.570
a particularly successful, very young business early on, or

192
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.369
you have a trust fund or some other access

193
00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:38.929
to financial means and savings, you probably do not

194
00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:43.690
have enough casual disposable income to really be able

195
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.929
to treat yourself to a multi-hour pleasure experience in

196
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:55.229
a Nevada. Brothel. Like, so a lot of times,

197
00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:02.020
dad or uncle or grandpa, sometimes everybody comes together

198
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.739
and it's a, it's a little family bonding thing

199
00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.520
and everyone just goes their own little separate ways.

200
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.280
It's, it's actually quite wholesome. It's really cute.

201
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.520
Oh my God, sex work is ruining the American

202
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.239
family. I mean,

203
00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:22.020
we're we're we're closer together, the family that. There's

204
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.650
some really bad jokes to be made there like,

205
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.570
oh no, the family that comes together stays together.

206
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:33.409
Uh, YEAH. Uh, BUT, but, but, you know, it's,

207
00:12:33.489 --> 00:12:37.250
it's really funny because it's not just that sex

208
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.969
work has been around forever in human societies, but

209
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:44.890
just earlier this year, I interviewed Nathan Lentz. He's

210
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.409
the author of an incredible book from this year

211
00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:51.450
called uh The Sexual Evolution, and at a certain

212
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.099
point there he, he's an evolutionary biologist and it

213
00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:58.919
Talks about transactional sex in other animal species. So

214
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:02.280
I mean birds also do it, penguins also do

215
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.520
it, chimpanzees also do it, and then a very

216
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.640
funny thing about chimpanzees is if you teach them

217
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.960
how to use money, one of the first things

218
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.960
they use the money for is to exchange it

219
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.679
for sex with the female, so.

220
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.979
It's a very, it, it's a very natural thing

221
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.559
because this happens so organically again and again and

222
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:30.359
again and again. It is by definition a natural

223
00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:36.119
biological occurrence within us, within animals at newsflash, we

224
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:39.960
are also animals. I think people have a tendency

225
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.159
to forget that sometimes that we have more in

226
00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:46.859
common than we think with the world around us.

227
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.780
And when we see these things happening naturally, yet

228
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.489
we try to suppress these urges, it's more important

229
00:13:56.489 --> 00:14:01.820
to ask where and who taught us to want

230
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.780
to push this down and to suppress this, and

231
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.679
the reality is, is it comes from religious morality.

232
00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:12.679
That is the origin point for most stigma against

233
00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:17.669
sex, against deviant sex, anything that goes against husband

234
00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:23.900
on top, woman on bottom. For procreation purposes only.

235
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.729
Yeah. We have evolved as a society beyond that,

236
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.250
and yet we're still holding on to some of

237
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:43.520
these religious-based moralities that don't really match with the

238
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.049
moralities that somebody personally has. Like people are all

239
00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:55.020
for. Women empowerment and supporting women except sex work.

240
00:14:55.109 --> 00:14:57.590
No, not that, no, boo, that can't be consensual.

241
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.989
No, not that, no. Anything but that, no. And

242
00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:04.510
like, come on, it's a job like any other

243
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.270
job. How are you gonna say that we sell

244
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.030
our bodies any more than Anybody else does. Like,

245
00:15:10.229 --> 00:15:12.469
I grew up with a dental hygienist in my

246
00:15:12.469 --> 00:15:16.030
family. Her fingers are so arthritic that by the

247
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.750
time she was like 40 years old, she was

248
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:23.150
practically disabled from her job. Her hands were literally

249
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.400
sold for her job. Um, I'm sorry, is that

250
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.710
not selling your body?

251
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.049
Uh, uh, NO, no, I, I mean that, that's

252
00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:36.890
really a, a rich one because interestingly enough, and

253
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.239
we're going to get also into that later, but,

254
00:15:39.549 --> 00:15:45.010
uh, when people talk about, uh, trafficking in sex

255
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.010
work, I mean, the, their solution is always, oh,

256
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.729
we, we have to abolish sex work. I mean,

257
00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:52.844
the solution is to abolish sex. Sex work. But

258
00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:56.354
then there is also human trafficking for construction, for

259
00:15:56.354 --> 00:16:01.405
agriculture, for other areas, and nobody ever says that

260
00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:05.525
we should abolish construction or agriculture because of that.

261
00:16:05.645 --> 00:16:08.724
They have other sorts of solutions, but when it

262
00:16:08.724 --> 00:16:11.284
comes to sex work, then suddenly, oh no, it

263
00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:13.724
has to go away. Just it, it entirely has

264
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.434
to go away and it's, it's sort of funny,

265
00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:20.119
right? Because it, it, it doesn't have to do

266
00:16:20.119 --> 00:16:22.760
with the trafficking itself. It has to do with

267
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.219
your morality,

268
00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:29.510
right? Yes, and when you legalize and legislate this,

269
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.559
the reality is it prevents people who are minors

270
00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.080
from working within the system. There are so many

271
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.929
hoops that I have to jump through to work

272
00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:43.440
within the legal location. I have to give my

273
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.760
fingerprints. I have to have my business license, I

274
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.890
have to do my STD and STI testing. And

275
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.049
I do this paperwork, the license, 4 times a

276
00:16:55.049 --> 00:16:57.450
year. They don't even have gun owners come in

277
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.929
to register that frequently. But here I am, literally

278
00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:03.969
every single quarter and all of this is processed

279
00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:07.608
at the sheriff's office. You don't think the sheriff's

280
00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:12.670
office knows how to verify somebody's ID? Like, Nobody

281
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:17.280
underage is working within the legal brothel system. With

282
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.030
that said, It is a problem that we only

283
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.390
have like 19 of these locations. That means there's

284
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.390
only 19 places which are able to jump through

285
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.030
the hoops and legally make this service available in

286
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.709
the safest way possible. That means in the 49

287
00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.030
other states we are pushing people to the more

288
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.430
marginalized and dangerous options because we do not have

289
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.849
any protections in place. So for all that I

290
00:17:45.849 --> 00:17:50.329
work within a legal system. The legal system really

291
00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:54.359
doesn't protect anybody outside of those other 19 locations.

292
00:17:54.969 --> 00:17:59.410
We need something that protects everybody, which is decriminalization,

293
00:17:59.609 --> 00:18:03.969
which is removing all of the penalties and legal

294
00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:08.609
problems for offering this service. Once we remove those

295
00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:10.989
penalties, then we are able to do so in

296
00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:14.319
a way that is significantly safer. When we look

297
00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:17.920
at other industries that were previously stigmatized and then

298
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.040
regulated, we see the increases in safety standards. Why

299
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.680
in the world are we not going to put

300
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.119
it towards something that we have already had within

301
00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:28.939
our society since forever?

302
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.989
Yeah, I mean, so you think that between legalization

303
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:37.209
and decriminalization, decriminalization is better.

304
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.609
I absolutely think so because decriminalization is protection for

305
00:18:42.609 --> 00:18:46.869
everybody. Legalization is protection only for the people that

306
00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:51.829
work within those limited privileged locations. Not everybody can

307
00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:54.439
travel out to Nevada away from their families, their

308
00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:58.199
children, their farm, their responsibilities, and go and work

309
00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:01.800
within a very specific location in Nevada. That just

310
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.959
isn't a reality for most people, and as a

311
00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:08.839
result, most people are not actually being protected by

312
00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:14.270
legalization. That's a very limited protection. Decriminalization, it's, it's

313
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.060
far more broad and therefore a lot more impactful.

314
00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:23.040
Yeah, you know, earlier when you mentioned religious morality,

315
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.010
one thing that immediately came to mind because I've

316
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.930
already had this conversation on the show with Nicole

317
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.530
Prosi, um, is, uh, the idea of porn eviction.

318
00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:37.250
I mean, I, I know you're, uh, a different

319
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.369
kind of sex worker, but, uh, what people found

320
00:19:40.369 --> 00:19:44.130
out is that uh people are not actually addicted

321
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.079
to porn. The thing is, is that people who

322
00:19:47.199 --> 00:19:52.290
have some sort of morality against porn, pornography, like

323
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.329
if they are religious or if they have any

324
00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:58.839
other sort of uh similar kind of morality that

325
00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:03.209
uh uh condemns porn or you watching porn, then

326
00:20:03.209 --> 00:20:05.599
even if you just do it a little bit,

327
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.569
then you, some of those people identify as porn

328
00:20:09.569 --> 00:20:14.449
addicts, even though, I mean, there's nothing wrong with

329
00:20:14.449 --> 00:20:16.449
watching a little bit of porn, right?

330
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:24.270
No, nothing wrong with it, perfectly natural porn. Porn

331
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.790
is not a problem. Porn is good. Porn is

332
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.829
great. I love porn. Some of my favorite people

333
00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:34.479
are porn stars. They're super cool people. You are

334
00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:37.469
watching people do a performance. We love to watch

335
00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:41.989
people perform. We love to watch movies and documentaries

336
00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:46.670
and reality TV, and oftentimes porn is the intersection

337
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.150
between entertainment, reality TV, documentary, like those are real

338
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:58.540
people. Having sex within oftentimes very highly fantasy scenarios.

339
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.130
What's not to love about that? I mean, great,

340
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.750
enjoy it. You're not going to become addicted to

341
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.670
that any more than you could become addicted to

342
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.989
watching The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, like, No,

343
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.969
be so for real.

344
00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:17.390
I mean, another one that I find really funny

345
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.390
is when people link sex work with social decadence,

346
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.949
and even er the end of empires. It's like,

347
00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:28.750
oh, sex workers appear and then suddenly the Roman

348
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.109
Empire is collapsing. And I'm like, what? I mean,

349
00:21:33.189 --> 00:21:36.660
have you read any history or any science on

350
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.650
why societies collapse? I mean, there's climate change, there's

351
00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:45.272
er Recall, uh, uh, there's, uh, crop failure. There's

352
00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:49.093
political corruption, but sex work, really,

353
00:21:49.473 --> 00:21:51.953
that's a new one. That's a new one for

354
00:21:51.953 --> 00:21:55.272
me. Yeah, no, that's not a thing in history.

355
00:21:55.483 --> 00:21:58.032
Like, please find your citations if you think that

356
00:21:58.032 --> 00:22:00.713
is a thing. I want, I want to see

357
00:22:00.713 --> 00:22:05.473
your resources. Thank you. Like, if anything, we see

358
00:22:05.473 --> 00:22:10.515
sex work at the forefront of thriving. Civilizations. When

359
00:22:10.515 --> 00:22:16.296
Virginia City was the richest city in America during

360
00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:19.696
the height of the gold rush, there were so

361
00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:25.235
many brothels. There were so many brothels. Like it

362
00:22:25.235 --> 00:22:30.595
was like brothels on brothels on brothels. Unbelievable. Anytime

363
00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:34.115
we see an incredible amount of wealth within our

364
00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:38.560
society. We see brothels. If anything, it's evidence of

365
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.359
a society that is thriving, evidence of a society

366
00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:45.880
that is able to indulge in the highest form

367
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.030
of expression and entertainment and connection, like how. Privileged

368
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.339
a society are we that we are able to

369
00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:59.109
exchange one of the most special things with each

370
00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:01.869
other in a way that is safe and sane

371
00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:05.739
and consensual, that's beneficial to everybody involved in it.

372
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.469
Like that's really cool.

373
00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:10.479
No, I mean, it's funny because for these people

374
00:23:10.479 --> 00:23:15.280
it's not any other factor, it's always feminism, women's

375
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.520
rights, sex work, trans people. I mean, it's one

376
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.319
of those things that leads to the collapse of

377
00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:22.680
society.

378
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.170
The trans panic thing is so dumb. Again, look

379
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.839
at history. Trans people have been here forever. Get

380
00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.219
over yourselves. This isn't anything new. When we look

381
00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:40.619
at societies that have never been colonized, they already

382
00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:45.130
have multiple, multiple expressions of gender, not even 12

383
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.219
or 3. I mean, we're talking like 56 different

384
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:53.219
historical expressions of gender, like, again, Be so for

385
00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:57.660
real. I raise animals for a living. You better

386
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.459
believe I see animals that are somewhere on a

387
00:24:01.459 --> 00:24:05.300
gender spectrum that isn't male or female. That just

388
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.699
happens. It just happens in nature. It happens for

389
00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:13.130
people. I have a girl goat that acts more

390
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.140
like a boy goat. I don't know what's going

391
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.130
on. I don't care. It's a goat. What do

392
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.209
you care what's going on with somebody else? It's

393
00:24:22.209 --> 00:24:26.359
their body. Get over yourself. Like, again, one of

394
00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:31.099
those stupid morality things that wasn't a problem until

395
00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:33.650
religion decided to make it one.

396
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.000
Yeah, uh, religion again, uh, you know, another funny

397
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.640
one is that sex work is one of the

398
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.640
reasons behind declining fertility rates. I mean, I really

399
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.270
love that one. I mean, are you, are you,

400
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.680
Alice, are, are you contributing to people having fewer

401
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.920
children? Come on, admit that one at least.

402
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.829
Come on. No, if anything, I'm actually really pro-natal.

403
00:24:58.989 --> 00:25:01.150
Like I have a lot of couples that have

404
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.989
come to see me and now have like new

405
00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:06.949
babies because they were having more sex after seeing

406
00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:09.310
me because I helped them have better sex. So

407
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.109
like, no, I'm here for people having babies that

408
00:25:13.109 --> 00:25:16.630
wanna have babies. Like, let me help you have

409
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.619
better sex so you can go and find a

410
00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:22.219
girlfriend and Get married and go have a baby

411
00:25:22.219 --> 00:25:24.300
if that's what you wanna do. If you wanna

412
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.520
have babies, good. Babies are cute. Good for you.

413
00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:33.569
Yeah, you know what's never the cause behind declining

414
00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:36.849
fertility rates, the economy. That can never be the

415
00:25:36.849 --> 00:25:40.689
cause. It's always sex workers, feminists, or something like

416
00:25:40.689 --> 00:25:41.209
that. Oh no,

417
00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:44.130
people having sex is leading to people having less

418
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:50.410
sex. Do they even hear themselves, come on.

419
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.199
OK, so another one, and this one again, the

420
00:25:55.199 --> 00:25:59.260
data is just the opposite of the accusation people

421
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.219
make. I mean, that pornography and sex work cause

422
00:26:02.219 --> 00:26:07.339
sexual violence, and I mean, it's like porn consumption

423
00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:10.800
goes like this and sexual violence goes like this.

424
00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:15.170
So over time, so I mean, if anything, if

425
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.180
you watch more porn, you commit less sexual violence.

426
00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:24.010
So pretty much, yeah, like you are more intimately

427
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.770
fulfilled when you are having sex, masturbating, taking care

428
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.170
of those intimate urges, which are normal and natural,

429
00:26:32.209 --> 00:26:34.849
and we see all throughout nature, we're not the

430
00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:39.109
only thing that masturbates, my God. When you take

431
00:26:39.109 --> 00:26:42.430
care of yourself in that fashion, you are not

432
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.130
suppressing things that can later fester and become something

433
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:51.540
negative. That's, there's just no correlation there. I want

434
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.989
to see evidence. I want to see citations that

435
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:59.030
are peer-reviewed studies show me something that has been

436
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.670
published in a scientific paper, a real one, damn

437
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.410
it, a credible source. And then let's have a

438
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.670
conversation.

439
00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:10.469
Yeah, this is just part of our long history

440
00:27:10.469 --> 00:27:14.130
of moral panics. It's like the one about how

441
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.989
Marilyn Manson supposedly caused the Columbine massacre, so, you

442
00:27:18.989 --> 00:27:19.449
know.

443
00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:25.030
No, no, that's dumb. That is a dumb conspiracy

444
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.569
theory.

445
00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:30.449
Yeah, but look, I've been referring to feminism a

446
00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:33.189
lot here, but do you identify as a feminist?

447
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.199
Oh, it's a, that's a tough one for me

448
00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:41.560
right there because feminist is such a broad umbrella

449
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.640
and there are so many different types of feminists

450
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.880
within that umbrella that I don't necessarily want to

451
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.084
say I identify with the whole umbrella of. Feminism,

452
00:27:54.734 --> 00:27:57.375
I, I don't think I do because there's many

453
00:27:57.375 --> 00:28:02.074
opinions within feminism that I disagree with. The trans

454
00:28:02.074 --> 00:28:06.135
exclusionary radical feminism, I don't agree with that. The

455
00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:10.854
sex work exclusionary radical feminism, sure don't agree with

456
00:28:10.854 --> 00:28:14.719
that. Both of those types of extreme feminism also

457
00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:17.859
tend to fall under other forms of extreme belief

458
00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:21.579
that I don't necessarily agree with. So I can't

459
00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:25.819
necessarily say that I am a feminist umbrella term,

460
00:28:26.069 --> 00:28:29.219
but there are certainly aspects of feminism that I

461
00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:30.959
think are incredibly accurate.

462
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.689
Yeah, I mean, definitely the radical feminists tend to

463
00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:38.469
be the most annoying. I mean, it, it's like

464
00:28:38.469 --> 00:28:43.430
they, they, they're almost, um, they're almost allies with

465
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.589
conservatives many times. So

466
00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:49.150
yes, and you can have your opinion. I can

467
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.810
have my opinion. Don't try to use your opinion

468
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.010
to become law. Particularly if you do not have

469
00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.310
any sort of research into whom you are harming

470
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:04.050
by putting that law into place, whereas I have

471
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:08.010
statistics on who you are helping by decriminalizing sex

472
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.199
work. I can show you exactly who is going

473
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:15.479
to benefit. Women. Overall, majority of sex workers are

474
00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:18.640
women, are going to benefit because they are going

475
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.520
to have new protections in place to report any

476
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.800
sort of violence or harassment or problems that are

477
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.699
happening within their line of business.

478
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.650
Yeah, but I, I, I mean, just on that

479
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:35.689
topic, uh, and talking about the more sex negative

480
00:29:35.689 --> 00:29:39.719
sort of feminists, uh, they have some arguments here.

481
00:29:39.849 --> 00:29:43.150
One of them is that sex work is never

482
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.849
a choice, that women only do it under coercion.

483
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.569
I mean, what do you think about that?

484
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.270
Yeah, I mean, I work under duress 100%. If

485
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.050
I had my $10 million in the bank account,

486
00:29:59.349 --> 00:30:03.390
I would probably just be like vacationing all the

487
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:07.670
time. Like, yeah, uh, personally, I would love to

488
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.989
just be on vacation 24/7. 0 woe is me.

489
00:30:12.109 --> 00:30:16.540
I am not on vacation 24/7 with $10 million

490
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.709
in the bank. Um, The That is so stupid.

491
00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:25.229
It, it, sex work is work. All work is

492
00:30:25.229 --> 00:30:27.670
work. There is no work that is more morally

493
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.829
superior than any other sort of work. Most people,

494
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.339
if they had the option to financially retire, would

495
00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:39.550
choose the option to retire. I would 100% cherry-pick

496
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.750
my favorite parts of what I do, and I

497
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.109
would exclusively do my favorite things or my favorite

498
00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:50.729
people if we're being honest. And like, Yeah, that's

499
00:30:50.729 --> 00:30:54.180
what I would choose to do is like. I,

500
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.410
I would just be like, cool, let me do

501
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.880
all my favorite things and like we're gonna go

502
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.660
and travel to cool vacation places and like. Do

503
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.780
cool things, yeah, like, yeah,

504
00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:10.900
and guess what, as if most people do not

505
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.339
work under coercion, I mean, as if most people

506
00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:16.939
have any choice when it comes to the kind

507
00:31:16.939 --> 00:31:18.479
of work they do, right?

508
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.650
It's work. I mean, I absolutely can do something

509
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.489
else if I want to. With the big umbrella

510
00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:31.209
of being an intimacy professional. I get to do

511
00:31:31.209 --> 00:31:33.930
podcasts. I get to do education. I get to

512
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.770
do social media. Media, I'm on OnlyFans, I'm on

513
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.810
YouTube, I'm on Instagram. I have my own farm.

514
00:31:41.089 --> 00:31:44.109
I get to do all of these different things

515
00:31:44.329 --> 00:31:46.609
and the more successful I am, the more I

516
00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:48.969
get to cherry-pick all my favorite things that I

517
00:31:48.969 --> 00:31:49.650
get to do.

518
00:31:51.069 --> 00:31:55.829
OK, another one, they say that sex workers of

519
00:31:55.829 --> 00:32:00.829
any kind are are always objectified by their fans

520
00:32:00.829 --> 00:32:03.979
or clients. I mean, do you feel objectified or,

521
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:04.750
or not?

522
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.479
I mean, in a positive way, sure, like, oh,

523
00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:13.079
tell me I'm beautiful. How horrible. No, don't, no,

524
00:32:13.199 --> 00:32:16.359
please don't compliment me. No. Oh, I hate it.

525
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.550
Don't tell me how attractive I am. Definitely, mm,

526
00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:21.839
no, don't buy me presents and dress me up

527
00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.719
in gorgeous clothing and tell me how beautiful I

528
00:32:24.719 --> 00:32:28.219
look. Oh no, save me from my horrible life.

529
00:32:28.569 --> 00:32:34.280
Uh, I think objectification can actually be quite Beautiful

530
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.760
when it's done in a healthy way. When it's

531
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.219
done from a place of admiration and respect and

532
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.540
care for the other person, that's, that's really hot.

533
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.780
I like that. That's, that's not a bad thing.

534
00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:52.400
Like, desiring the person that you are with is

535
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.569
not a bad thing. That's actually probably a good

536
00:32:56.569 --> 00:32:58.560
thing when it, when it comes to who you're

537
00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.319
gonna be having sex with. You want them to

538
00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:06.170
arouse your interest. So yeah, I don't mind being

539
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.250
objectified in a positive way. Like, yeah, go for

540
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.650
it, please. What

541
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.770
are you saying? There are positive ways of objectifying

542
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.369
people? Come

543
00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:21.589
on. Yeah, 100%. 0, 100%. Come on. Absolutely so.

544
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.869
I personally love to be admired. I love it.

545
00:33:24.949 --> 00:33:26.910
I think it's really cool when people tell me

546
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.430
how pretty I am. I like it, compliment me.

547
00:33:30.449 --> 00:33:33.010
You know, I've already told this story on the

548
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.010
show once, but I'm going to tell it again

549
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.250
because this is really, really funny. Like there was

550
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.569
a feminist group here in Portugal, like 10 years

551
00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:44.209
ago or so, and they had a website and

552
00:33:44.209 --> 00:33:48.130
they wrote posts there, and one of them once

553
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:53.369
wrote a post saying that women shouldn't have sex

554
00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:57.170
with the lights on because otherwise the man objectifies

555
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.310
them. And I'm

556
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:03.819
like, what the hell? This isn't the dark ages.

557
00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:06.890
We do not have to have sex by candlelight

558
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.820
anymore. We have evolved beyond that point. Again, be

559
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.350
so for real. You don't wanna see your partner.

560
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.540
I know I like looking at my partner. I

561
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.379
think that's, I think it's hot. Yeah, I wanna

562
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:20.120
see what they're doing.

563
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.770
Yeah, no, that, that, that one, I mean, it's

564
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.409
uh it's really funny, but, uh, but look, how

565
00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.370
should a sex trafficking be combated? I mean, do

566
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.649
you think that decriminalization can also help with that?

567
00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:40.620
0, 100%, because once we decriminalize it, we allow

568
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.860
people to consensually participate in it without having to

569
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.580
fear about things like trafficking. Why? Because if harm

570
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.050
is coming to them, they can report it to

571
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.179
the police. Right now, if a woman is being

572
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.978
harmed through sex work, she is just as likely

573
00:34:56.978 --> 00:35:00.979
to be arrested for the crime of prostitution as

574
00:35:00.979 --> 00:35:03.100
she is to actually be helped.

575
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.439
Mm, OK, but, but, uh, I mean, do you

576
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.790
think, because there, there's that argument, I guess we've

577
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.040
already touched on it a little bit, but there's

578
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.479
that argument from sex negative feminists who say that,

579
00:35:18.689 --> 00:35:23.520
oh, sex work promotes sex trafficking. I mean, do

580
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.399
you think there's any evidence to support that?

581
00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:30.479
No, I don't believe there's any quality evidence that

582
00:35:30.479 --> 00:35:33.189
supports that because we have evidence quite to the

583
00:35:33.189 --> 00:35:37.379
contrary of that. We are able to see statistically.

584
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.659
That in areas that have decriminalized sex work, places

585
00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:45.899
like Australia and New Zealand, instances of sexual violence

586
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:49.780
and human trafficking decrease because once you have legal

587
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.979
availability, people are going to choose to participate in

588
00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:57.540
that versus going and participating in the more unregulated

589
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.590
part of the system.

590
00:35:59.729 --> 00:36:02.050
Yeah, you, you know, it's interesting because I've had

591
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.929
a conversation on the show with Gerald Mosley, who

592
00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:07.739
wrote a very interesting book, Sex Workers and Their

593
00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:11.250
Clients in their own words. Oh, just imagine going

594
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.629
out and talking with sex workers instead of assuming

595
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.090
what they want and what they like and so

596
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.449
on. Just imagine that. I mean, it's just mind

597
00:36:19.449 --> 00:36:22.050
blowing, right? But I mean, one of the things

598
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:27.209
he talks about there is that actually most male

599
00:36:27.209 --> 00:36:31.929
clients uh. Not like if they learn that a

600
00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:36.570
particular sex worker is doing it under coercion or

601
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.729
if she's been sex trafficked. So I mean, most

602
00:36:40.729 --> 00:36:44.310
clients are actually decent people, you know.

603
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.570
Yeah, I would certainly say so. Somebody does not

604
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.649
come to spend thousands to tens of thousands of

605
00:36:52.649 --> 00:36:55.530
dollars if he does not truly want what is

606
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.659
best for that woman. That is like the The

607
00:36:57.659 --> 00:37:01.969
deepest level of appreciation and admiration for women is

608
00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:04.770
to value and prize them so highly that you're

609
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.489
willing to do this sort of an exchange. That's

610
00:37:07.489 --> 00:37:10.689
incredible, frankly speaking, and people who are willing to

611
00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:14.520
participate in that type of relationship, oftentimes are the

612
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.290
exact sort of people that I want to be

613
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.719
in relationships with. They are kind, they are friendly,

614
00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:24.250
they're wonderful, they are intelligent, they know what they

615
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.209
want out of life and aren't afraid to have

616
00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:26.510
it.

617
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.379
Yeah, no, you know, I was making sort of

618
00:37:30.379 --> 00:37:32.840
a joke about, oh my God, going and talking

619
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.899
to actually talking to sex workers because this is

620
00:37:35.899 --> 00:37:40.060
something that many sex negative feminists, if not all

621
00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.179
of them, never do. They just come up with

622
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:48.100
their own moral BS and try to imply that

623
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.419
every woman out there must think about sex work

624
00:37:52.419 --> 00:37:54.620
the same way as they do, right.

625
00:37:54.989 --> 00:37:57.989
Yes, it is very difficult to sit and have

626
00:37:57.989 --> 00:38:01.169
a rational conversation with a lot of the sex

627
00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:04.320
negative camps because they are not interested in talking

628
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.229
to sex workers because we are not real people

629
00:38:07.229 --> 00:38:10.590
to them. We are an idea. We are the

630
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:15.554
personification of all of their negative personal. Ideas that

631
00:38:15.554 --> 00:38:18.995
they have about sex and intimacy and sexuality. We're

632
00:38:18.995 --> 00:38:22.715
the personification of all of those beliefs. They can't

633
00:38:22.715 --> 00:38:25.235
talk to just a single sex worker because it

634
00:38:25.235 --> 00:38:28.354
breaks the illusion. Oh no, we're actual real people

635
00:38:28.354 --> 00:38:31.294
that they are now causing harm to. They can't

636
00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:34.435
break that illusion, so they can't have a conversa,

637
00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:36.635
a conversation with us.

638
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.959
Oh my God, there are actually women out there

639
00:38:39.959 --> 00:38:42.010
who like sex work. Oh my God,

640
00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:46.500
no, don't say that. No, boo, boo, cancel, cancel

641
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.639
the show. Cancel you boo. You can't say that.

642
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.800
How terrible. No, no.

643
00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:58.889
OK, OK, but. OK, but look, there, there's still

644
00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:03.610
definitely a stigma against sex workers out there in

645
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.449
society. So, what do you think are the best

646
00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:09.969
ways of trying to uh combat that stigma?

647
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.280
Conversations exactly like this one go a long way

648
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.879
towards making that happen. Listening to sex workers intentionally

649
00:39:20.879 --> 00:39:25.080
going out of your way to find intimacy professionals

650
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.239
and consume the media that they produce. Oftentimes, right

651
00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:32.439
now, social media is suppressing and hiding a lot.

652
00:39:32.534 --> 00:39:35.375
Of the sex worker voices. I know I'm shadow

653
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:38.935
band almost everywhere. It's almost impossible for people to

654
00:39:38.935 --> 00:39:42.205
be able to organically find me unless they are

655
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:46.554
organically looking for the genuine voice of sex workers.

656
00:39:46.975 --> 00:39:48.715
I try to make it very easy to find

657
00:39:48.715 --> 00:39:52.254
me. Alice Little, same name all over the internet.

658
00:39:52.334 --> 00:39:55.949
I've got my own website. And it's, it is

659
00:39:55.949 --> 00:39:59.550
always a challenge to find and interact with the

660
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.120
genuine firsthand people if you're curious in learning more

661
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.860
about the thing.

662
00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:08.699
Yeah. So, look, I, I can't resist asking you

663
00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:11.800
these couple of questions because as I said, I

664
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.719
listened to some of the pod uh some of

665
00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:17.840
the episodes from your podcast and uh this is

666
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.280
the first time I'm actually asking on the show

667
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.070
a sex worker about this, so Uh, how can

668
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:28.669
people, particularly men, be better lovers? I mean, come

669
00:40:28.669 --> 00:40:31.790
on, uh, we have to learn something from a,

670
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.379
a professional here.

671
00:40:33.669 --> 00:40:36.469
So, oh yeah, I've got some skills. I have

672
00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:39.669
got some real, real things that you can do

673
00:40:39.669 --> 00:40:43.070
very simply right away that will make you better

674
00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:48.550
lovers. First thing you do is you slow down.

675
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.419
Don't just hit the bedroom and start stripping yourself

676
00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:56.419
and expect her to get herself naked. Start with

677
00:40:56.419 --> 00:41:01.580
a little bit of foreplay, OK? Women, like warm-up,

678
00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:05.459
like 15 minutes of foreplay is what it really

679
00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:08.520
takes for a woman's body to be fully aroused.

680
00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:11.659
Like, I'm aware, you are hard, you are ready

681
00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:14.699
to go, like, bing, let's, you know, let's get

682
00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:18.100
to it. Sorry, two different engines here. You're gonna

683
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.699
need to give this engine a little bit more

684
00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:22.360
time to get warmed up. So warm her up,

685
00:41:22.699 --> 00:41:25.939
get her naked, you do the work, strip her,

686
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.260
kiss her, touch her, play with her body. Bring

687
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.540
your body closer to hers and invite her to

688
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.260
touch and connect with your body. Initiate foreplay. If

689
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.604
you're the man and you You want to be

690
00:41:37.604 --> 00:41:40.564
like, I'm the dominant man. I'm in control of

691
00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:44.804
this situation. Lead her, encourage her to like engage

692
00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:47.564
in the foreplay too, and you will find that

693
00:41:47.564 --> 00:41:52.445
most women are very responsive to this. And this

694
00:41:52.455 --> 00:41:57.324
naturally leads to arousal, you end up slowly making

695
00:41:57.324 --> 00:42:00.649
your way to the bed. The first thing you

696
00:42:00.649 --> 00:42:05.669
do before you try to have sex, get her

697
00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:11.530
off. Let her come first. Seriously, if you do

698
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.439
this first, you are like an S-tier legendary lover.

699
00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:19.820
It means that you prioritize her pleasure, even above

700
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.290
your pleasure. And trust me, you are going to

701
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:26.669
have better sex after she already comes once. Like,

702
00:42:26.689 --> 00:42:30.489
she's ready, she's ready, ready, ready, and then go

703
00:42:30.489 --> 00:42:35.719
for it. Like, That's, that's like. The double hitter

704
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:39.080
combo right there. Take your time, let her come

705
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.919
first, do those two things, you will instantly be

706
00:42:42.919 --> 00:42:43.879
a better lover.

707
00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:49.729
Oh, OK, so wait a minute, because religious people

708
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.239
are going to listen to this and think. Are

709
00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:57.560
you promoting sodomy here? I mean, are you promoting

710
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.629
oral sex?

711
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.020
Yeah, I am. Burn the witch. I don't care.

712
00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:06.280
Yeah, yes, I am. Those are good things. Those

713
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.360
are natural things. Get over it.

714
00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:15.169
Yeah, uh, you know, I've heard conservative people, particularly

715
00:43:15.169 --> 00:43:20.729
conservative men, saying that, uh, If you as a

716
00:43:20.729 --> 00:43:24.250
man perform oral sex on a woman, you are

717
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.330
like less of a man, so.

718
00:43:28.139 --> 00:43:31.139
No, it means that you're probably going to get

719
00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:35.239
more enthusiastic blowjobs in return. Guess what? When there's

720
00:43:35.239 --> 00:43:40.340
equivalent exchange within relationships, you, you tend to give

721
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.610
and receive more. It goes both ways. Oftentimes it

722
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.229
ends up being, uh, beneficial to both participants.

723
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.360
Oh my God, you're, you're also saying that we

724
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.040
should care about the female orgasm. This, this is,

725
00:43:56.199 --> 00:43:58.879
I mean, this is just too much, this is

726
00:43:58.879 --> 00:44:02.280
just too much anti-religiosity here, uh.

727
00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:06.070
Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty sure we are so deeply

728
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:09.290
canceled now by like the deeply religious conservative folks.

729
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.189
And I mean, love you guys. Y'all are great.

730
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.199
Get over your problems and you will have much

731
00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:17.280
better sex lives. And like, even if you don't

732
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.320
wanna do these things, fine, do something else, be

733
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.449
good to each other, care about each other. Come

734
00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:25.080
on, OK,

735
00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:29.260
OK, caring about women, that's another controversial one, right?

736
00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:33.199
Like, OK, OK, that's mm, you're not wrong. I

737
00:44:33.199 --> 00:44:35.300
wish you were wrong, but you're not wrong.

738
00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:40.379
Yeah, But I mean, uh, OK, but let's try

739
00:44:40.379 --> 00:44:43.300
to be a little bit more specific here. I

740
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.159
want more details. So, what should men know about

741
00:44:47.219 --> 00:44:49.979
how to please a woman sexually?

742
00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:56.669
Pull up an anatomy chart, look at the female

743
00:44:56.669 --> 00:44:59.870
anatomy, and you're gonna look for a little, little

744
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.469
thing that's called the clitoris. Look at that. Look

745
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:05.790
at where that is in relationship to the body.

746
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.790
It is not on the inner thigh. It is

747
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.360
not up near our belly buttons. It is not

748
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.060
down near our butt holes. Find the location. And

749
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.659
be gentle, communicate with your partner and see how

750
00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:23.860
she likes to be touched. Start very gently and

751
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.620
then go from there. Good technique, little Boy Scout

752
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.979
fingers, little small circles, just like this. Just like

753
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:33.020
this is a really good place to start for

754
00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.590
most girls. We're not like trying to DJ, none

755
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.239
of that. Stop that. That's, that's not the thing.

756
00:45:39.989 --> 00:45:42.669
We're gonna be real gentle, OK? Look up the

757
00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:47.949
chart, find the spot. Gentle circles, that will help,

758
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.379
that will help you a lot.

759
00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:52.250
Yeah, and, and you guess what? I don't know

760
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.610
if you will, if you will agree with me,

761
00:45:54.689 --> 00:45:58.689
but I expect, uh, I hope so. Uh, ONE

762
00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:00.610
thing that can get you a long way is

763
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.149
also to ask her what she likes,

764
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:09.770
right? Yes, communication goes an incredibly long way. Using

765
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.570
your words to get what you desire is the

766
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.649
easiest way to have a better time in the

767
00:46:14.649 --> 00:46:15.050
bed.

768
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.620
OK, so, OK, so another question, and this one

769
00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:24.469
is for the, um, the red pillars and the

770
00:46:24.469 --> 00:46:28.159
black pillars and the manosphere type of guys. Come

771
00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:31.879
on, you just, what do women really want? Come

772
00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:35.840
on, you have to admit that you're just hypergamous

773
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.040
and you just want a high status male, or

774
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.800
high value male or something like that. I mean,

775
00:46:42.159 --> 00:46:44.479
is that really what you want or, or not?

776
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.250
Maybe some girls want that. I don't know. I

777
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:51.219
don't speak for the women. I'm not the goddamn

778
00:46:51.219 --> 00:46:55.510
Lorax. Like every woman wants something different. We are

779
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:59.760
all individuals, much like men are all individuals. Sure,

780
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.770
some men are hypermanosphere guys and maybe some girls

781
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:08.925
actually really want manosphere. Cool. There's probably someone for

782
00:47:08.925 --> 00:47:11.405
everybody out there. There's a lot of fish in

783
00:47:11.405 --> 00:47:14.875
the sea, like, find your fish, make your happiness.

784
00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:17.885
I mean, don't say there's just one way or

785
00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:21.784
one person that's worthy of love or able to

786
00:47:21.995 --> 00:47:27.320
have love. I mean, that's accessible to everyone. Everyone

787
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.719
gets to enjoy that. You don't get to limit

788
00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:32.360
or dictate who gets to have that if they're

789
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.479
an alpha beta, Delta Kappa male, I don't know,

790
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.919
whatever their. Whatever their thing is, I don't consume

791
00:47:39.919 --> 00:47:42.679
enough of that media to know the things.

792
00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.620
Uh, YEAH, I, I mean, I just consume it

793
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.219
out of rage because I really hate those guys.

794
00:47:52.889 --> 00:47:56.159
It's like, uh, I, I'm, I mean, it's, uh,

795
00:47:56.169 --> 00:47:59.810
for me it's like, come on, uh, can't you

796
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:04.429
just learn that if you are a decent guy,

797
00:48:04.889 --> 00:48:07.489
you also can get a long way. I mean,

798
00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:10.300
you don't have to be a asshole, right, to,

799
00:48:10.689 --> 00:48:12.169
to get women, so.

800
00:48:13.159 --> 00:48:14.689
Very real, very real.

801
00:48:15.469 --> 00:48:18.949
Yeah. OK, so I, I have 22 more questions.

802
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.570
The first one, I mean, you said that you,

803
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.350
there are certain kinds of feminism that, that you

804
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.909
like. I, I also do like certain kinds of

805
00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:30.510
certain types of feminism, and one thing that I

806
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:35.489
really find funny is that conservative people, when they

807
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:42.575
demonize the 1960s, 1970s sexual revolution, they say. That,

808
00:48:42.815 --> 00:48:46.496
oh, the sexual revolution was just a way of

809
00:48:46.496 --> 00:48:51.256
feminists to promote promiscuity and casual sex and so

810
00:48:51.256 --> 00:48:54.895
on and so forth, and I'm like, no, I

811
00:48:54.895 --> 00:48:56.736
mean that was not the point of the sexual

812
00:48:56.736 --> 00:48:59.555
revolution. The point of the sexual revolution was for

813
00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:02.335
women to be able to have their own agency

814
00:49:02.335 --> 00:49:04.775
and be able to choose with whom they have

815
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.095
sex, when they have sex, if they have sex

816
00:49:07.095 --> 00:49:11.441
out of marriage or not. TO get access to

817
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:15.201
contraception, to get access to sexual education, to get

818
00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:18.552
access to Planned Parenthood and those kinds of things,

819
00:49:18.602 --> 00:49:22.721
I mean, I guess that promiscuity didn't come on

820
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:23.922
the menu there,

821
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:27.681
right? No, that was not the point. The point

822
00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:31.761
was equality for women, which historically is something that

823
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:36.800
a lot of conservative people have problems with. There

824
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.600
has always been an unspoken desire for inequality where

825
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.080
man leads woman follows, and anything that challenges that

826
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.320
and puts a woman potentially in the driver's seat

827
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.399
or a position of power ends up being problematic

828
00:49:49.399 --> 00:49:53.419
for people who hold those conservative beliefs. The problem

829
00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:56.719
with trying to debate people with those beliefs is

830
00:49:56.719 --> 00:49:59.260
that they're doing everything based off of their Bible,

831
00:49:59.439 --> 00:50:02.669
off of religious morality, and we're operating from a

832
00:50:02.669 --> 00:50:06.620
place of facts and statistics and Honest to goodness

833
00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.419
research. I am sorry, but I cannot use this

834
00:50:09.419 --> 00:50:13.419
statistic to combat Moses. These things do not exist

835
00:50:13.419 --> 00:50:18.300
in the same universe. One of these things I

836
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.379
can prove, one of these things requires belief. And

837
00:50:21.379 --> 00:50:24.340
if that's not my belief, you're now requiring me

838
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:28.179
to assume someone else's religious beliefs, which I think

839
00:50:28.179 --> 00:50:31.520
goes against the whole religious freedom of this country.

840
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.820
So I feel like it's very inauthentic to make

841
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.649
laws that are based off of religious beliefs and

842
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:42.030
want to then conceptualize a religious belief into a

843
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.870
law and use it for jurisdiction against people who

844
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.110
do not hold the same beliefs. If anything, I'd

845
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.620
argue that it is religious oppression that they are

846
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.629
doing, the very thing that they fear so much

847
00:50:53.629 --> 00:50:56.870
and claim that is being done to them. That's

848
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:59.790
what they're actually doing to others because in my

849
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:03.530
religious beliefs, of which I really don't have any.

850
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.820
I am my own free will. I have agency

851
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.270
over myself and my body, and if I wanna

852
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.229
do sex work, I get to do sex work.

853
00:51:12.659 --> 00:51:15.550
Uh, I, I mean, please don't hurt their feelings

854
00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:19.530
because, uh, obviously America or the US is a

855
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:22.070
Christian nation, right? Come on, come on.

856
00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:26.030
It shouldn't be, but realistically it is. We have

857
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:28.709
failed to divide the church and the state like

858
00:51:28.709 --> 00:51:29.790
we are supposed to.

859
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.959
Yeah, yeah, no, that, that, that's really interesting, and,

860
00:51:33.969 --> 00:51:36.370
you know, another thing that I find funny about

861
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:41.169
this accusation about, oh, feminists promote promiscuity and sex

862
00:51:41.169 --> 00:51:43.600
workers promote promiscuity and so on and so forth,

863
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.729
is that actually, at least for the younger generations,

864
00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:51.915
particularly, particularly Gen Z. Uh, IF you look at

865
00:51:51.915 --> 00:51:56.094
the data, people are starting their sex lives, uh,

866
00:51:56.284 --> 00:51:59.294
later. There, for, uh, when you look at data,

867
00:51:59.334 --> 00:52:02.175
uh, when you ask people whether they had sex

868
00:52:02.175 --> 00:52:04.705
the past year or not, there's an increasing number

869
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:07.854
of people who had no sex, uh, the, the

870
00:52:07.854 --> 00:52:11.399
last year. And uh I mean, even I talked

871
00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:15.199
also recently on the show with the sexologist, Justin

872
00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:18.800
LeMiller, and we talked about they, they collected about

873
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.760
the average number of partners of uh lifetime partners.

874
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:30.530
People have and it's like around 6789, 11% or

875
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:35.250
10% of people have 15 plus sexual partners. So

876
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.770
I mean, where's the promiscuity? I don't see it.

877
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.280
Very accurate, very accurate. Again, when we're using facts

878
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.239
rather than fiction, you get very different answers to

879
00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:48.290
these questions.

880
00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:52.840
Yeah. OK, so 11 final question, and I mean,

881
00:52:52.979 --> 00:52:57.219
I sort of turned this question into uh the

882
00:52:57.219 --> 00:53:00.820
final question of every single interview with sex workers

883
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.659
I've been doing on the show, just because it

884
00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:05.570
came to my mind when I was interviewing Marcela

885
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:08.929
Alonso. And I mean, I just found it fun.

886
00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:13.159
You said earlier that uh you have some uh

887
00:53:13.169 --> 00:53:17.370
porn stars that you admire. I'm imagining female porn

888
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.489
stars. So, I mean, tell us, give us some

889
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:23.270
names. Who are the ones you admire the most?

890
00:53:24.379 --> 00:53:27.080
Oh God, everyone, I, I don't like to name

891
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:32.639
names because people always try to exceptionalize specific people

892
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:36.000
within the porn industry, and I admire the industry

893
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.500
overall. I admire the ladies overall. It's hard to

894
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.699
say one specific person gets a shout out above

895
00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:47.139
everybody else because there are so many that are

896
00:53:47.139 --> 00:53:50.254
doing. Incredible work and there's work being done that

897
00:53:50.254 --> 00:53:53.294
I don't even know about. Like, I just recently

898
00:53:53.294 --> 00:53:56.135
learned of a new organization that was started by

899
00:53:56.135 --> 00:53:59.554
a sex worker. I'd never heard it before. Like,

900
00:53:59.975 --> 00:54:02.534
that's incredible work she's doing. So I would say

901
00:54:02.534 --> 00:54:05.574
yes, everybody, they're all great. They're all incredible. They're

902
00:54:05.574 --> 00:54:10.094
all talented, wonderful individuals who deserve to be respected

903
00:54:10.094 --> 00:54:12.375
in their own right. Yay, everybody.

904
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:15.000
Yeah, OK, so I'm just going to give you

905
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.689
one name. I mean, the person I want to

906
00:54:17.689 --> 00:54:20.290
interview the most also because she's a feminist and

907
00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.610
she's an intellectual, I mean, and she's awesome, and

908
00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:25.409
for me, she's the goat, and, and please come

909
00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:27.729
on, if you watch this interview, please come on

910
00:54:27.729 --> 00:54:30.689
the show. It's Nina Hartley. I mean, I really

911
00:54:30.689 --> 00:54:32.040
love Nina Hartley. I

912
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.530
love Nina Hartley. Nina Hartley is in fact the

913
00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:34.929
goat.

914
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:36.590
Yeah,

915
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.290
OK,

916
00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:38.719
OK, so

917
00:54:38.719 --> 00:54:39.280
Alice,

918
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.310
yeah, yeah, yeah, no, she, she's great, she's awesome.

919
00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:45.719
So Alice, uh, where can people find you on

920
00:54:45.719 --> 00:54:46.459
