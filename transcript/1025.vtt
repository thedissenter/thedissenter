00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.659
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Labs. And today

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.229
I'm joined by Doctor Katie Rose Hitman. She's professor

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.949
in the Department of Anthropology and the Children and

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.030
Youth Studies Program at Brooklyn College kni and she's

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.340
coed toor of a book. We're going to talk

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.059
about today, gender and power in strength sports. Strong

8
00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.250
as feminists. So Katie, welcome to the show. It's

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.309
a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.319
Thank you, Ricardo. I'm very excited to be here.

11
00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.700
So tell us first, what is the premise of

12
00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.540
this book? Exactly.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.950
So the book is um in a sort of

14
00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.000
an investigation of strength sports, which is a particular

15
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.900
kind of sport uh based on uh power and

16
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.369
brute force. So strength, the the premise of the

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.909
book is to move weight. Um And to, because

18
00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:57.689
I kind of investigate that from a feminist perspective,

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.479
a couple of friends and I got together to,

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.740
we were all some sort of strength athlete and

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.110
we decided to, we only see a certain kind

22
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.910
of people. There's all these interesting things happening in

23
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:10.970
our gyms. And so we decided to see if

24
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.480
there was an interest to put something together um

25
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.519
on the concept of strength sports from an interdisciplinary

26
00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:20.559
but really a kind of pointed feminist perspective.

27
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.839
We're going to get into that interdisciplinary bit about

28
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:28.650
the book in a second. But in what ways

29
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.650
would you say, generally speaking that sports would intersect

30
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.980
with politics since we're going to get into that

31
00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:39.260
in and feminism specifically?

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.760
Yeah. Excellent question. Um So for me, I'm a

33
00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:48.120
cultural anthropologist by training. Um AND my main focus

34
00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:51.769
in my strength sports research is crossfit. Um And

35
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:55.379
as someone who kind of studies, culture and societies,

36
00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.870
there's, I would say that there's really nothing about

37
00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.470
sports that isn't political. So you can actually any

38
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.870
question you would say like, how is like, you

39
00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.069
know that, yeah, just a, a political part of

40
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.580
the, of the activity, the human activity. But a

41
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.759
really general question that uh or a general example

42
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.429
that can be used to understand that is we're

43
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.949
having the Olympics coming up uh the Summer Olympics

44
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.759
2024 in Paris. And that is a geopolitical event,

45
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.059
right? So athletes have to represent a country, you're

46
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.820
not representing yourself sure your name is, but when

47
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.520
you win, you are and you compete, you display

48
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.360
your Nation State in your uniform and then your

49
00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.949
flag and your national anthem is presented and, and

50
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.830
played if you win. Um And then tallies yours,

51
00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.720
all the, the different medals are tallied according to

52
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.160
nation state. Um And then there are some nation

53
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.190
states that aren't invited because they, the country has

54
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.179
been uh has not participated by what's called the

55
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.490
Olympic truce, which is linked to uh to war.

56
00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:01.479
And so Russian and Belarusian uh athletes don't get

57
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.679
to compete under the Russian flag or nation state.

58
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.440
So even just something like as simple as like

59
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.029
the, the Olympics, all of that is geopolitical and

60
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.360
then there's economic issues that are always involved. Um

61
00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.119
There's transnational, we look at, you know, the legacy

62
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.919
of like, what are the most popular sports in

63
00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.300
the world. They often have the legacy of colonialism,

64
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.759
like football or cricket. And so there's really interesting,

65
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.210
you know, we can talk about all kinds of

66
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.570
things of sport and there's probably some element of

67
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.770
it that has some of a political uh component.

68
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.639
So we would say um as a cultural anthropologist,

69
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.940
like lots of things you can kind of think

70
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.100
about all aspects of sport and probably kind of

71
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.139
come up with something that um even if it

72
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.160
doesn't feel like it in the moment, you can

73
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.250
sort of analyze it from a political perspective and

74
00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.610
by political, we mean kind of power. So it's

75
00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.369
not just about like a nation state or a

76
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.279
state, but you know, the way power works too.

77
00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.690
So even, you know, other like non uh Olympic

78
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.610
events, like local events are kind of based on

79
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.505
municipalities or states or districts and countries. And so

80
00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.645
you're kind of pitting people based on their geopolitical,

81
00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:14.464
uh, location even on, you know, local fandom. So

82
00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:17.475
it's really a kind of an interesting element about

83
00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:20.994
something is like, as like fun and, and a

84
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.505
leisure is like sports or, uh, or even fitness.

85
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:25.125
So,

86
00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:29.809
would you, would you include something like what happened?

87
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.000
Uh, I, in the 2022 World Cup, the soccer

88
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.089
or football, world Cup, depending on where you come

89
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.420
from. Uh, WHEN, uh, we knew that or we

90
00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:47.299
learn that uh uh in Qatar, uh slaves were

91
00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:51.679
used to construct uh or to build the stadiums

92
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.070
there. I mean, would that also be included that

93
00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:59.010
the rubric of the intersection between sports and politics

94
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:02.049
also because not only that happened, but there are

95
00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.769
also people, for example, from the, from Norway, Ling

96
00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:11.769
Holland uh declared a condemned that and then uh

97
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.000
Norway as a team was banned from competing in

98
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.519
the World Cup. So I, I would imagine that

99
00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.980
would be another example of that,

100
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.019
right? Yeah, that's an excellent example. And you will

101
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.320
see that there's moments that every kind of, there's

102
00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:29.399
all that kind of underbelly of sport all the

103
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.609
time, right? Um Different kinds of ways in which

104
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.420
uh oppressed peoples are kind of exploited for sports.

105
00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:38.399
Uh THE slave labor to build the stadiums in

106
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.420
Qatar is an excellent example. And then sports are

107
00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.540
always used as a political realm to protest. Um

108
00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:48.690
The, the teams that, that wore ban like arm

109
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.540
bands or said something or got kicked out or

110
00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:55.790
got uh they got penalized, right? Or even uh

111
00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.809
one of our famous examples in the United States

112
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.609
is the um the gold medalists in track and

113
00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.260
field who um uh held up a fist during

114
00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:06.950
the civil rights movement in the United States because

115
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.549
they didn't want to, they were, had a complicated

116
00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.790
relationship with the, with the flag. So, absolutely, there's

117
00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:15.304
always the Qatar in example, is a, is a

118
00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:18.225
great example of one and just the fact that

119
00:06:18.234 --> 00:06:20.244
like Qatar, the whole, the whole politics of like

120
00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:23.084
how Qatar got the the the uh World Cup

121
00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:25.005
in the first place, right? There was a question

122
00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:28.704
of bribery and, and like cultivating these relationships with

123
00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:32.244
the voting members of FIFA. So all of that

124
00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.665
is, is like the political element of it.

125
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.269
Mhm And also you mentioned the Olympic Games earlier

126
00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.429
and I heard that in France, they are planning

127
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.829
on basically removing the homeless people from view because

128
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.079
I mean, you know, it gives always a bad

129
00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.750
image or a bad rap about the country. If

130
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.170
people go there, all the eyes around the globe

131
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:02.890
are uh looking at that particular place and then

132
00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.619
there's homeless people on the street, of course, removing

133
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.859
homeless people from the street. Uh I mean, I'm

134
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:13.980
not sure politically uh and practically what that translates

135
00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.640
into exactly, but I wouldn't imagine that it would

136
00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:21.480
be in uh it, it would translate into positive

137
00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:23.640
things for the homeless.

138
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.725
Right. Absolutely. That's an excellent example. Right. Where it's

139
00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:30.505
not just the country coming to compete, but this

140
00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:34.404
image that France has to display as their, you

141
00:07:34.415 --> 00:07:38.415
know, their own motto of Liberty and Fraternity that

142
00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:41.065
they are. Right. They don't have homeless, we don't

143
00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:45.364
see them. Right. And they're probably just moved for

144
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:49.244
the time, not necessarily placed in, in stable housing.

145
00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.540
Yeah, that, that was, I, what I was alluding

146
00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:55.019
to when I said that it probably doesn't relate

147
00:07:55.029 --> 00:08:00.350
into positive outcomes for the homeless people themselves. So

148
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.920
uh tell us then about the interdisciplinary sort of

149
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:08.700
framework that you and your co-author bring into the

150
00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:12.019
book in what ways is it interdisciplinary?

151
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.959
So there are 13 of us who participated in

152
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.399
this book. So it's an edited volume um which

153
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.929
means, you know, we kind of got participation from

154
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.869
different kinds of people. And then the three of

155
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.299
us, I did it as well as uh Melissa

156
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:28.549
Forbis who is also a cultural anthropologist at Brooklyn

157
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:32.669
College. And uh Noel Brigden who's a political scientist

158
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.369
at uh Marquette University, but we wanted to have

159
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.808
different voices. So we have cultural anthropology perspectives. We

160
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.330
have political science, we have human biology, we have

161
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.440
r uh rhetoric, we have media studies, people, we

162
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.020
have gender and sexuality studies, uh folks and we

163
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.849
have journalists, we have a person who is um

164
00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:57.400
less in a scholar and more of a, a

165
00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:00.890
gym owner in El Salvador who has an interest,

166
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.950
you know, like a very different background than some

167
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.900
of us, you know, academic types. And so we

168
00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:08.210
have his a historian as well. So we sort

169
00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:11.369
of tried to bring all different kinds of not

170
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.789
only ways of thinking about the body, from human

171
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.929
biology to his history to political science, but then

172
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.099
also like different elements of like evidence. So some

173
00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:23.750
of us use participant observation, like I participate in

174
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.700
crossfit. I put my body on the line. I

175
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.085
did the workouts where other people looked at images

176
00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:35.075
from competitions or Instagram and social media or historical

177
00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:38.645
documents um in the in the past or official

178
00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:43.539
policies from like the International Powerlifting Federation. So there's

179
00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.909
all different kinds of um of evidence that is

180
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.969
also used that helps the interdisciplinary nature of um

181
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:53.239
of our project. Um All of those different kinds

182
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.260
of divergent tracks are, are sort of we all

183
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.390
the, the, the the thing that kind of com

184
00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:02.460
um you know, keeps us cohesive is this interesting?

185
00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:05.020
We want to focus on the a feminist perspective

186
00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:08.650
and the feminist perspective is not necessarily about women,

187
00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:10.859
not just actually we're all women who are part

188
00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:13.979
uh participated in this even though we tried really

189
00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:17.489
hard to get more men involved. Um It's there

190
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.289
we can talk about kind of the reasons why

191
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:23.770
they didn't participate, which is political in itself. Um

192
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.270
But we also, we wanted to look at the

193
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.429
hierarchy of gender and how power works in gender

194
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.739
identity. And that's what feminism means. It doesn't mean

195
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.590
women's sports, it means looking at sports and the

196
00:10:35.599 --> 00:10:39.320
way gender is used or mobilized, gendered bodies, gender

197
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:45.500
hierarchies, gender representations are sort of used strategically manipulatively

198
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.159
um uh to kind of convey or perform or

199
00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:54.940
elicit certain kinds of gendered experience. Um So that's

200
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.909
where the the the overarching cohesiveness is is that

201
00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:59.919
we all looked at something gender related

202
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.340
And when it comes to the feminist side of

203
00:11:03.349 --> 00:11:09.059
it here, you also include a trans women, right?

204
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.619
Because I mean, I'm asking you that because as

205
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.989
you are aware, uh there's at least one branch

206
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.219
of feminist, of feminism out there that tends to

207
00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:25.559
be sort of exclusionary toward uh trans women or

208
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.159
at least looks at them in a negative light,

209
00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:30.840
let's say,

210
00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:34.169
yeah, no. So our sort of uh we're trying

211
00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.960
to take a decolonial or intersectional feminist approach, which

212
00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:42.150
is based on um black women, uh literature and

213
00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.799
black women scholars sort of created that and we

214
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.880
sort of our, we're, we're not like, we don't,

215
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.299
are not just interested in like the binary of

216
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:52.080
man and woman, but like the whole continuum of

217
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.690
not only human experience but also the ways in

218
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.719
which people think about gender. Um So the experience

219
00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:03.250
of transgender women and men um is part of

220
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.099
our story, but it also is like how transgender

221
00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:09.950
identity is weaponized in strength sports and why strength

222
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.200
sports in particular is it such a big deal?

223
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.000
Um So we are, we are interested in gender

224
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.349
and sexuality in, you know, but gender like up

225
00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:22.869
in all different kind of complicated ways. So my,

226
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.799
my paper in the, in the book is about

227
00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:28.869
um the masculinity of crossfit. And so it's not

228
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.690
just about men and women's bodies, but the way

229
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.330
in which crossfit kind of like kind of cultivates

230
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:41.030
a kind of violent, intense, really aggressive, militaristic tone,

231
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.710
which is interpreted as a masculine approach for both

232
00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:45.349
men and women.

233
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.770
One very interesting thing is that you divide the

234
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.460
book into three main parts and you label them

235
00:12:53.469 --> 00:12:58.320
the public body, the disciplined, the disciplined body and

236
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.619
the social body. So why do you establish these

237
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.369
three different dimensions of the body? And what are

238
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.559
you trying to capture with them?

239
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.580
So the book, we put a call out, which

240
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.140
is kind of just a academic term of like

241
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.520
asking if anybody wants to participate, we use list

242
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.780
serves and our own uh networks. And so we

243
00:13:20.789 --> 00:13:22.580
didn't know what kind of other research we were

244
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.659
gonna get. Um And so part of what is,

245
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:27.919
is sort of analytically trying to think about the

246
00:13:27.929 --> 00:13:31.179
different kinds of papers and arguments that are being

247
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.469
made in each of these chapters. And we found

248
00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.200
that they actually kind of, they were different enough

249
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.752
that we needed to sort of, you know, aggregate

250
00:13:39.763 --> 00:13:44.143
them into little groupings. And so the first uh

251
00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:48.862
the first uh section, uh The public body is

252
00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:52.232
about the way women, the way bodies are represented

253
00:13:52.242 --> 00:13:56.982
and gendered in like representation in representational, like either

254
00:13:56.992 --> 00:14:01.572
images or documents. And so in the three chapters

255
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:05.302
in that section are one about crossfit and femininity

256
00:14:05.442 --> 00:14:07.773
um for women who are in the elite uh

257
00:14:07.783 --> 00:14:10.585
cross competition called the Games. And the way in

258
00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:13.825
which even if they're performing, sort of it is

259
00:14:13.835 --> 00:14:17.505
better than the men. Um THE commentators and the

260
00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:20.315
imagery of the crossfit games still really focuses on

261
00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:23.286
feminizing them. So they wear pearl earrings, they have

262
00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:26.056
their hair done, right? They have makeup on, they're

263
00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:28.546
like trying to be as feminine as possible, even

264
00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:31.986
though their bodies maybe are very muscular, they may

265
00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:34.106
be very strong and they may be actually beating

266
00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:38.130
the men in head on head competitions, which even

267
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.799
the commentators can't imagine that ever happening. It's not

268
00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.840
a good thing even that it, you know, for

269
00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:46.599
them, for the commentators. And so the the um

270
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.619
the researchers analyzed how that's the case, like how

271
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.299
women both kind of uh resist these markers of

272
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.179
femininity, but then also use them so that they

273
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.429
are considered women still. Uh THERE'S also a um

274
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.440
uh an examination of the fit of fit motherhood

275
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.130
of like strength athletes who are performing motherhood while

276
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.510
they are pregnant. And this is using social media

277
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.799
imagery and social media comments from people about that

278
00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:18.309
about a uh you know, a pregnant woman, strength

279
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.400
training or competing or a recently postpartum uh woman

280
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.109
competing in a strength sport. And then the final

281
00:15:26.119 --> 00:15:29.929
chapter in that section is on the transgender policies.

282
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.119
So it's actually analyzing the, the way the policy

283
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.989
is framed. So the discourse of the policy and

284
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.969
then we in each, in each section, we have

285
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.669
what's called an interlude, which is just a personal

286
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:45.534
story from one of scholars or participants who sort

287
00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:48.375
of tells their own. It's like less researchy and

288
00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:51.195
more just a personal anecdote of what it means

289
00:15:51.205 --> 00:15:52.934
to be a woman in the space in these

290
00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:56.195
gym spaces, doing new strength sports. Um AND how

291
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:59.554
it kind of changes their own experience of themselves

292
00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:02.299
and of their world. So that we, there's an

293
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:04.580
interlude in that chapter, the bo the discipline body

294
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.609
is really about the way this sort of gender

295
00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:09.979
and power gets kind of into our bodies, into

296
00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:12.760
our muscles, into ourselves, the way we understand the

297
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.250
way we understand our fitness. Um And so in

298
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.320
that there's two chapters, one on the history of

299
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.219
German Turners in the United States. And then mine,

300
00:16:21.229 --> 00:16:24.280
which is on crossfit hero workouts and the way

301
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:27.460
in which those are used to build a community

302
00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:30.859
predicated on death, which is called a necros sociality.

303
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.409
And then finally, our last section, we had chapters

304
00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:36.609
that were really interested in kind of pushing back,

305
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:38.710
doing a little bit more than just research or

306
00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:42.109
analysis and kind of thinking about what ways can

307
00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:45.710
string sports find, you know, be AAA method of

308
00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:50.250
solidarity building or resistance or collective action. Um And

309
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.479
in those, we have AAA co edited vol uh

310
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.469
chapter by Araceli and Noel, which is about a

311
00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:00.340
Jim and El Salvador and they co-author that piece

312
00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:03.729
together. Um AND thinking about the difference in their

313
00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:07.739
own positions um as authors, then there's a chapter

314
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.890
on the way in which crossfit can be a

315
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.618
method of healing for women who have experienced some

316
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.819
sort of in intimate partner violence. And, um, you

317
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.780
know, what, what that looks like and how that

318
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.770
actually can be used to do as a healing

319
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.989
intervention. And then I co-authored a piece with my

320
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.530
colleague, Kara Aach, we did a survey during the

321
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.079
pandemic to look at how fitness and stay at

322
00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:33.560
home orders, uh how people were using those or

323
00:17:33.569 --> 00:17:37.369
not using those their fitness regimens to have some

324
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.630
sort of health practice or think about their own

325
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.040
health and well being during the stay at home

326
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.609
orders during the, during COVID. And we found that

327
00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:47.560
women knew how to work out and, and strength

328
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:51.530
train in partnership in groups and they mobilized those

329
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.479
networks and they actually were much more resilient um,

330
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:57.319
and had better outcomes than, than men because they

331
00:17:57.329 --> 00:18:02.660
knew how to collectively um uh train together. So

332
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.500
that was kind of the, the over a different

333
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.959
three different parts of this sort of book.

334
00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:12.030
Mhm. So, since we're talking about strength sports here,

335
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.729
I guess that uh very important question and that

336
00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:18.630
you also explore in the book is what strength

337
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.040
means because of course, when we uh commonly think

338
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.819
about it, uh we associate with it with just

339
00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:30.170
the physical component of it. I mean, how much

340
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.250
you can lift? Uh HOW hard can you punch

341
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.219
stuff like that? But you argue in the book

342
00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:41.689
that uh the concept of strength uh also from

343
00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:46.300
a political perspective goes beyond that. So what other

344
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.819
uh aspects does it include?

345
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.030
Yeah. Um So we really struggled with this and

346
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.469
this is actually part of the reason that we

347
00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:58.020
did the project to begin with because strength sports,

348
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.589
the definition of strength sports is a sport that

349
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.619
is about the uh oh as heavy as one

350
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.150
can do one kind of event like the, the

351
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.910
sheer movement of force. And we didn't include like

352
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.290
sports that you strength to, to help them be

353
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.250
better at something else like rugby or American football,

354
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.050
um or combat sports such as boxing or um

355
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.130
M ma we were, we were just interested in

356
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.060
or even bodybuilding. Bodybuilding is about performance and posing

357
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.170
where the strength sports we looked at powerlifting, crossfit,

358
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.339
weightlifting, strong man, highland games tournament. We're about how

359
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:40.699
heavy can you go? How much strength and brute

360
00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:43.660
force do you have? And brute force has always

361
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.040
kind of been around kind of a very masculine

362
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.979
domain, domain. The idea of like lifting as much

363
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.900
as possible, a car truck, right. We think about

364
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.050
that with the strong man, um, uh, uh, a

365
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.760
sport and that's very, a very masculine domain. And

366
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.319
so women, there has become, it's become more popular

367
00:20:02.329 --> 00:20:05.239
for women to get in, involved in that. Um,

368
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.339
AND so in that there was like, because there

369
00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:12.170
was like a, it kind of more women participating,

370
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.579
kind of troubled, you know, kind of shook up

371
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.569
a little bit about what is, what is strength,

372
00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:18.579
how do we think about that? And so we

373
00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:20.869
wanted to push past just this brute force sort

374
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.410
of understanding to think about what are the things

375
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.939
are necessary to be good at these sports? They

376
00:20:25.949 --> 00:20:30.849
include race and like flexibility and mobility and agility

377
00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:36.199
and technique and like self-confidence and coordinating and collective

378
00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:40.930
action and solidarity and the social elements. And so

379
00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.170
we kind of added those to this idea of

380
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.349
strength because when you go and you participate in

381
00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.459
these sports and you try to perform a one

382
00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:51.390
time really heavy lift, there's so much more that

383
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.199
goes into that, whether it's team building, whether it's

384
00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:57.550
proper nutrition, whether it's having a coach, whether it's

385
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.849
psychological uh capacities to be able to do that.

386
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.530
Um And so we were, we sort of wanted

387
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.510
to think about it as instead of just that

388
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.979
one time performance, what is it like to sort

389
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:13.400
of do this regularly as a practice? Um And

390
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.709
we weren't even just interested in like elite athletes,

391
00:21:15.719 --> 00:21:18.329
we're looking at like everyday men and women who

392
00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:20.160
have to kind of do this over and over

393
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.420
again. Um And so we we were interested in

394
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.699
kind of really just troubling that definition, that strength

395
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:29.890
is just about kind of physical capacity to lift

396
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.369
something really heavy, takes so much more than that.

397
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.510
So in this particular case, I mean, according to

398
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.530
the view you bring into the book, it intersects

399
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.540
with gender constructs as well,

400
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.569
right? Yeah, absolutely. Because oftentimes almost, you know, so

401
00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:53.469
many times just strength is linked to masculinity, right?

402
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.579
And you know, just on everyday levels, a woman

403
00:21:55.589 --> 00:21:57.310
will lift up something heavy and a man will

404
00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:58.670
come in and be like, I got it, don't

405
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.989
worry, and they'll try to do it for that

406
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.829
person. Um And then in, in an embodied form.

407
00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:06.979
So in not only just the moving strength, but

408
00:22:06.989 --> 00:22:10.180
also strength is also linked to muscularity, kind of

409
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:12.239
the embodied form of it. If you see somebody

410
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.280
very muscular, there's often assumptions about, oh, that person

411
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.709
must be really strong. And um and women are

412
00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:22.000
really have historically and con temporarily there's problems with

413
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.329
having a lot of muscle. Your question, your femininity

414
00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:27.839
is questioned. And so we were really interested in

415
00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:31.699
kind of how, how gender those elements were, how

416
00:22:31.709 --> 00:22:34.819
like lifting heavy weight was a man's job or

417
00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:37.079
having muscles is a man's thing. And if you

418
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.829
were a woman who had muscles you might be

419
00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.750
a man. And so they all of that kind

420
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.199
of really highlights um the sort of nature of

421
00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:48.219
the gender element and also just in general, with,

422
00:22:48.229 --> 00:22:51.319
even like before we get to string sports sports

423
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:54.589
are one of the last places that we separate

424
00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:57.329
men and women, right, in our workplaces, we don't

425
00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:02.130
separate men and women, churches, religious institutions, social gatherings,

426
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.750
like, you know, some places are still gender, but

427
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.189
really sports is one of the last domains where

428
00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:15.339
like you're only allowed to participate in your gender

429
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.079
group. So um and that, so that's always interesting,

430
00:23:19.089 --> 00:23:21.369
like, so when it the, you know, even our

431
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.650
like in historically, in the United States, we had

432
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.229
segregation of sports based on race and that ended

433
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.390
right 40 years ago, 50 years ago, but we

434
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.449
still have very important demarcated um men's and women's

435
00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:37.640
sports. And so, you know, kind of like, is

436
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.380
it even possible to think about what it would

437
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.810
be like if we actually just pick the best

438
00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:44.020
people regardless of their gender?

439
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:47.520
Yeah, I guess that will come to that question

440
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.430
when we talk a little bit later about trans

441
00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:54.030
women in strength sports and also sports in general

442
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.170
because there's a huge debate right now about trans

443
00:23:58.189 --> 00:24:02.209
women in sports. I mean, mo it, it's mostly

444
00:24:02.219 --> 00:24:05.839
unfortunate but we're going to get into that. But

445
00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:08.880
when it's very interesting that you talk about how

446
00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:15.219
in human societies, we tend to associate muscularity with

447
00:24:15.229 --> 00:24:20.979
masculinity. Because also sometimes if, for example, uh a

448
00:24:20.989 --> 00:24:24.599
straight man and I guess that that is one

449
00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:28.479
aspect of feminism that uh if we explore here,

450
00:24:28.489 --> 00:24:31.510
people will see that it can also apply to

451
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.530
men and all men themselves can sometimes be discriminated

452
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.680
in certain ways. If a strength, if a straight

453
00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:43.689
man uh says that he is attracted to a

454
00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:49.800
woman who is particularly muscular, sometimes people find that

455
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.719
a little bit weird and sometimes they even uh

456
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.849
question his own sexual orientation.

457
00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:04.349
Right. Yep. Absolutely. The link to, to muscularity as

458
00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:08.819
a gender domain is really entrenched. It's very hard

459
00:25:08.829 --> 00:25:11.680
to overcome that even like, you know, men will

460
00:25:11.689 --> 00:25:13.599
go into the gyms and only want to build

461
00:25:13.609 --> 00:25:16.310
muscle and they'll do all these extra kinds of

462
00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:18.900
like performance enhancing drugs and put that in their

463
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.790
body in order to be more muscular and women

464
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.770
will go in and, and not wanna lift weights

465
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.599
because they don't wanna get bulky, they only wanna

466
00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:29.579
tone. Um And where the, the thing is is

467
00:25:29.589 --> 00:25:31.619
as a, I'm an, an anthropologist. So we do

468
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.219
a, you know, part of our perspective is evolutionary

469
00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:38.140
and as Homo sapiens, you know, humans are not,

470
00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:41.619
there's like the uh sexual dimorphism which means like

471
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.385
vast differences between, between sexes in terms of size.

472
00:25:46.635 --> 00:25:49.425
Um GORILLAS are a very good example of, of

473
00:25:49.435 --> 00:25:53.145
like really strong sexual dimorphism. The males are much

474
00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:55.305
bigger than the females. Humans are not like that.

475
00:25:55.314 --> 00:25:57.875
We actually, there's a lot of women who are

476
00:25:57.885 --> 00:25:59.515
as big and tall as men and there are

477
00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.685
a lot of men who are on the smaller

478
00:26:01.694 --> 00:26:05.285
side. And so the range of like, you know,

479
00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:07.864
of what is a typical size for a man

480
00:26:07.875 --> 00:26:11.584
and a woman is very much a similar capacity.

481
00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:14.310
And so, and that's interesting. So it's like, so

482
00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:17.709
even biologically, we're not meant to be that big,

483
00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:22.719
you know, that different physiologically. Um And you know,

484
00:26:22.729 --> 00:26:26.069
there's, there's, and women, there's like a been a

485
00:26:26.079 --> 00:26:28.770
new uh article from one of our contributors, Kara

486
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:33.310
Aach wrote an article in Scientific American where she

487
00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:36.989
looked at kind of the historical, the archaeological, the

488
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.150
paleolithic evidence of humans. Um And they capacities, there

489
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.060
are different kinds of hormones as well as their

490
00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:48.640
musculature um in their bones, right? In the evidence

491
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.199
of the bones that men and women were both

492
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.709
hunting, men and women were both making clothes like

493
00:26:54.719 --> 00:26:57.000
their skeletons. Have we've all been men and women

494
00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.069
um in the historical and archaeological and pale record

495
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.189
have, you know, there's no evidence that men were

496
00:27:04.199 --> 00:27:08.030
much stronger or bigger than women or even that

497
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.290
they were using their muscles more um more so

498
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.280
than women. And so it's just kind of been

499
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.949
more recently where we sort of separated. Um THIS,

500
00:27:17.959 --> 00:27:21.939
having this understanding that women don't have the capacity.

501
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:24.030
And there's a joke on the internet where it's

502
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.489
funny because men will say you'll never hear a

503
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.390
man say, oh that's a lady shark. I'm not

504
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.270
scared of her to this idea of like female

505
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.760
sharks versus male sharks being kind of both very

506
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.390
dangerous. But we say that about women like, oh

507
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.094
females, female human are not supposed to be strong

508
00:27:40.104 --> 00:27:44.165
or muscular or big or, you know, um and

509
00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:47.155
we would never do that for another, another species.

510
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.525
So it, it comes, it comes much more or

511
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:53.175
less from biology and more from, you know, cultural

512
00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:57.834
uh and, and power dynamics um in our societies.

513
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.599
Uh But since there's also at least to some

514
00:28:00.609 --> 00:28:05.050
extent that biological element here when it comes to,

515
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.939
and of course, we're talking about averages here, but

516
00:28:07.949 --> 00:28:11.439
on average, I guess that we could say that

517
00:28:11.729 --> 00:28:16.900
men tend to be a little bit more muscular

518
00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:20.359
than women on average again, and a little bit

519
00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:23.550
stronger than women. But do you think that perhaps

520
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.640
some of these social expectations or uh gender constructs

521
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.750
also derive at least in part from those average

522
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.709
biological differences that, that average sexual dimorphism, let's say.

523
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.020
So there is, there are obvious biological differences between

524
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.920
males and females, no question. Um But I think

525
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.380
really a lot of our science on that is

526
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.579
actually because we haven't really looked at a lot

527
00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:54.339
about women, we've just kind of focused on men.

528
00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:57.339
So there's a recent study and recent information um

529
00:28:57.349 --> 00:29:00.209
by Joseph Thornton um out of the University of

530
00:29:00.219 --> 00:29:05.770
Chicago that argues and illustrates that um estrogen as

531
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.640
an anabolic hormone, which is muscle building hormone is

532
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.359
like twice as old as testosterone. And so this

533
00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:15.079
idea that estrogen is not something that is about

534
00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:19.359
muscle building or muscle endurance or muscle maintaining is

535
00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:23.550
actually not true. But our science, there's so much

536
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.000
inherent about science that like, oh men were hunters,

537
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.160
there was a book that came out in the

538
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.430
sixties that said that and it was like scientific

539
00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:32.609
and so people believed it. So I think what

540
00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:35.560
we're, what we're seeing now is there's a lot

541
00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:38.729
of push to do more research with women on

542
00:29:38.739 --> 00:29:42.630
biolog of women, on female athletes, on questions about

543
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.300
human biology from a, a feminist perspective or just

544
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.959
looking at the difference between men and women. Um,

545
00:29:48.969 --> 00:29:51.030
AND sort of looking at that we don't a,

546
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.869
we don't really know as much as we think

547
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.339
we do right now. And what are some of

548
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:57.680
the things that we actually, um, some of the

549
00:29:57.689 --> 00:30:01.459
things we're learning is that it's not as separated

550
00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:02.689
by the sexes as we thought?

551
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.849
Mhm. And also, I guess that another thing to

552
00:30:06.859 --> 00:30:10.689
consider here is that even though there are those

553
00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:17.459
biological differences, it's not that they can't be changed

554
00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:21.050
by certain habits that people might have. So, for

555
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.354
example, if a man does not do any physical

556
00:30:25.364 --> 00:30:29.724
exercise at all, it can be, uh, weak or

557
00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:34.155
weaker than, let's say, average man and the woman,

558
00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:38.244
if she's into, I don't know, weightlifting powerlifting if

559
00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:41.125
she goes to the gym and lifts weights, uh,

560
00:30:41.135 --> 00:30:44.515
I mean, she can become actually quite strong.

561
00:30:44.525 --> 00:30:48.214
Right. Mhm. Absolutely. And that's part of it. Every,

562
00:30:48.224 --> 00:30:51.464
so this idea that we have innate genetic ability

563
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.750
is really, you know, I mean, there's very little

564
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.319
there that you have to cultivate, that you have

565
00:30:57.329 --> 00:31:00.689
to practice. So you have to, you know, um,

566
00:31:00.699 --> 00:31:02.969
and so that's part of it and it's, you

567
00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:05.300
know, this assumption that all men are better than

568
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.050
all women is really wrong. In fact, you will

569
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.530
find right? There are some women who are genetically

570
00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.920
better capa have better capacities to do certain things.

571
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.400
And then if they cultivate it, they're gonna be

572
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.199
better than, you know, then lots of men and,

573
00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:22.880
you know, maybe 95% of other, of men in

574
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.109
the world. Like if you look at, we have

575
00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:29.300
this young female, uh Olympic weightlifter named Olivia Reeves.

576
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.920
She's like 21 years old. She's the 71 kg

577
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.829
lifter and she is, she's, you know, she's one

578
00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:38.699
of the, she's won the, this world cup. She's

579
00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:40.880
the strongest woman at that weight in, you know,

580
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.540
the world and has world records. Um But men

581
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.510
in her gym will still try to compete with

582
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.030
her and she like, if she competed, you know,

583
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.260
like more, she can just, you know, easily, front

584
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:57.310
squat 330 pounds, easily, back squat 440 pounds and

585
00:31:57.319 --> 00:31:59.829
she's like 100 and 50 pounds. And so it's

586
00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:03.400
like this understanding that she, she has genetic capacity

587
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.630
to be an amazing, strong, she's like built to

588
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.630
be strong and then she cultivates it. Um But

589
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.390
men will go into her gym and think that

590
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.969
they just should automatically be stronger than her because

591
00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:16.099
they're men and that's where we really need to

592
00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:18.800
push back on that. Like the, the average is

593
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.109
so like we are so like overlapping our Venn

594
00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:25.469
diagrams of men and women in terms of abilities

595
00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:29.219
and sizes are really overlapped. The outliers might be,

596
00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:30.829
you know, kind of where you see it, but

597
00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:33.439
it's, you know, for the most part, you know,

598
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.849
you, you can, you know, and men have more,

599
00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:40.250
have more home like testosterone and are built to

600
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.780
be more, you know, one time heavy, really heavy,

601
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.699
do it really fast where women have more estrogen,

602
00:32:46.709 --> 00:32:49.709
which is an anabolic steroid or anabolic hormone, muscle

603
00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:51.920
building that actually has a lot more to do

604
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.709
with, you know, sort of strength endurance. So they

605
00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:56.560
can do a lot of heavy lifting for a

606
00:32:56.569 --> 00:32:59.670
lot longer. Um And so it's, you know, it's

607
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.959
kind of like, what exactly are we testing or

608
00:33:01.969 --> 00:33:06.369
competing against? And, um, and that, you know, there's

609
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.030
actually a lot more overlap than we like to

610
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.540
think from both a training perspective and even a

611
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.949
hormonal perspective,

612
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.189
right? Uh So w would you like to tell

613
00:33:17.199 --> 00:33:20.829
us a little bit about, uh, I mean, sort

614
00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:25.569
of the history of strength sports, particularly, uh, how

615
00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:30.510
women first got into strength sports. How old you

616
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.329
are? Strength sports, basically, uh, uh, uh, I mean,

617
00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:37.989
basically give us a, an overview, a brief overview

618
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.810
of, uh, women in strength sports, I guess historically.

619
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.069
So, um, string sports, like the ones that I

620
00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:51.449
listed, um, some, you know, the idea of moving

621
00:33:51.459 --> 00:33:53.439
a one object that's really heavy. There's like all

622
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:55.660
kinds of, like in the basque region, there's like

623
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.579
these large stones that people will lift and move

624
00:33:58.589 --> 00:34:00.880
and those have a large, like a much longer

625
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:06.439
history than like official organized, like associations or federations

626
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.958
and who knows what men and if women were

627
00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:12.000
participating in that, um, before, but I'll give an

628
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.120
example using the sport of Olympic weightlifting since we've

629
00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:17.840
got the Olympics coming up. Um, AND that's the

630
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.120
sport that's in the Olympics. It's a strength sport.

631
00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:23.949
It's, it's, uh, there's two events, the snatch and

632
00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:26.639
the clean and jerk. It's with the barbell. Um

633
00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:28.399
And so if you watch the Olympics and seen

634
00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.000
the sport, it's kind of like known and it

635
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.938
was the o the, you know, contemporary Olympics were

636
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:36.228
started again back again, even though they're from antiquity

637
00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.580
in Greece, they started the, the modern ones in

638
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:43.909
like 18 nineties and Olympic weightlifting was in the

639
00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:47.810
first Olympics. It was, but only for men. Um,

640
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.830
AND then there were a number of other Olympics

641
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.260
and, but it was only until 1920 so 100

642
00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:00.389
years ago that weightlifting was a regular sport in

643
00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:04.570
the Olympics. And so, uh, but that was only

644
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.209
for men. It was only until 2000, the Sydney

645
00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:13.379
Olympics. So that this century that women were allowed

646
00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:18.199
to compete in Olympic weightlifting. And the question is,

647
00:35:18.209 --> 00:35:21.280
did they not want to lift or like, what

648
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.280
was, what was that? There had been women in

649
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.590
the Olympics much earlier that in, in many other

650
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.280
sports, right? Um But the idea that a strength

651
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.590
sport, this idea of brute strength and moving as

652
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.080
much weight from the ground to overhead, which is

653
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.679
essentially what weightlifting is, didn't let women participate for

654
00:35:38.689 --> 00:35:42.959
80 years. Um And currently in the, in the

655
00:35:42.969 --> 00:35:47.280
United States, uh Olympic, weightlifting is a predominantly female

656
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:51.120
sport. There's like 60% at various competitions that are

657
00:35:51.129 --> 00:35:55.989
women than men. Um And so it's, it, the,

658
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.830
you know, part of the argument is, you know,

659
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.149
why weren't women supposed to participate in that? And

660
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:03.689
then, but also looking at how recently they have

661
00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:06.600
allowed women at like the most elite levels to

662
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.639
participate in that. And women, you know, depends on

663
00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:13.360
different parts of the world. Um Eastern European European

664
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:19.389
countries, Russia, China, Central uh Asian countries and um

665
00:36:19.399 --> 00:36:25.149
Iran, Iraq, Georgia, Armenia, uh have all long histories

666
00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:27.939
um of weight lifting and are some of the

667
00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:32.110
best teams, best nation states in the world. Um

668
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.610
And sometimes they, they have very few women still

669
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.110
participate in those countries in the sport. Um, AND

670
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.649
they are, even though these men, the men in

671
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:45.010
these countries dominate the men's weight classes. Um, THE

672
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.540
women actually are, you know, more Chinese, some Colombians,

673
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:53.250
Americans. Um, AND, um, you know, there's a handful

674
00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.389
of other, of other, uh elite countries as well,

675
00:36:56.399 --> 00:36:58.760
but it's interesting that a lot of the places

676
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.000
that even the men have always dominated in weightlifting,

677
00:37:02.169 --> 00:37:06.570
um, don't have a strong female cohort. So it's

678
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.610
almost like we're seeing it unfold in real time

679
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.989
where, um, women, there was a focus in the

680
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.530
United States, at least to include more women in

681
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.489
all kinds of sports. In the 19 seventies, there

682
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.790
was a law passed, women used to be able

683
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.520
to play just tennis and maybe a little bit

684
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.159
of golf, but mostly it was tennis and then,

685
00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:26.080
so it's only in the last 50 years that

686
00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.254
women in general were kind of a allowed to

687
00:37:29.264 --> 00:37:32.844
participate or encourage. And um, there was money and

688
00:37:32.854 --> 00:37:35.435
focus to get them to participate in sports and

689
00:37:35.445 --> 00:37:37.995
strength sports are because it's about power and brute

690
00:37:38.004 --> 00:37:43.114
strength. Um, IN general are like lagging behind in

691
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:46.074
terms of because they, they're thought of as male

692
00:37:46.084 --> 00:37:49.745
dominated and masculine sports more than, more than others

693
00:37:49.754 --> 00:37:52.425
say gymnastics, correct. So,

694
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.879
a and where do you think that this sort

695
00:37:55.889 --> 00:37:59.979
of exclusion for such a long time stemmed from,

696
00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:06.610
was it again societal expectations, gender roles or what?

697
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.260
Exactly?

698
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.810
I mean, I think that part of it is

699
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.010
just gender roles, like it starts out that way,

700
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.389
the idea, you know, a lot of times in

701
00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:19.189
contemporary, in a lot of contemporary American societies, there's

702
00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:21.679
a lot of, there's like a public uh realm

703
00:38:21.689 --> 00:38:23.919
which is sort of the masculine or male dominated

704
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:26.719
realm and then the domestic realm, which is, um,

705
00:38:26.729 --> 00:38:30.939
the women's realm and something like even fitness, like

706
00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:33.620
exercise used to in the United States. The, on

707
00:38:33.629 --> 00:38:36.709
the main way that women could exercise was through

708
00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:39.530
the television, through Jack LaLanne and his television show.

709
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.600
So they didn't necessarily even get fitness out in

710
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.750
the gym, they got fitness in their home because

711
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.520
that's where they were and men were in gyms

712
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.020
or doing sports or like part, you know, playing

713
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.810
out there on the courts or the pit is,

714
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.310
um, out there in the public realm. And so

715
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.790
a part of it is that, is just that

716
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.889
basic understanding of like where men and women can

717
00:38:59.899 --> 00:39:02.179
be in the working world or in the domestic

718
00:39:02.189 --> 00:39:06.229
world. And then this idea of sports is entertainment

719
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.689
is also a really important element. Um, THAT'S used

720
00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:11.129
a lot of times still to be like, oh,

721
00:39:11.139 --> 00:39:14.620
well, women's sports isn't that entertaining or in order

722
00:39:14.629 --> 00:39:16.439
for it to be entertaining, they have to wear

723
00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:19.379
really skimpy clothing and be very, it's kind of

724
00:39:19.389 --> 00:39:22.219
sexualized. And so there's still a lot of this

725
00:39:22.229 --> 00:39:25.540
kind of like, prejudice about a women's sports isn't

726
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:29.739
interesting. It's not entertaining and, you know, men don't

727
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.959
want to watch it. And so therefore we're not

728
00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:34.949
gonna, you know, we're not gonna have it on

729
00:39:34.959 --> 00:39:38.409
television or fund it. Um, BUT I, you know,

730
00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:42.790
there's a good example. That's interesting. This year is,

731
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.889
there was this young woman named Caitlin Clark, um,

732
00:39:45.899 --> 00:39:48.760
who is a basketball player for the University of

733
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:53.729
Iowa, which has never been a dominant basketball college.

734
00:39:53.989 --> 00:39:57.459
And, um, you know, men's men's basketball is very,

735
00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:59.100
very popular in the United States and it's also

736
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.699
very popular worldwide, but women's basketball is not. And

737
00:40:02.709 --> 00:40:05.489
there is, even though we have a professional women's

738
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.379
league in the United States, the W NBA. Um,

739
00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:12.459
BUT this Caitlin Clark, more, more men and women

740
00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:17.340
watched her college games this year than any other

741
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.889
basketball game in like 10 years, men or women.

742
00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:23.469
And so this understanding that women are, you know,

743
00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:25.780
kind of pushing a little bit using this young

744
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.854
woman who's, you know, capac cities are, are extraordinary,

745
00:40:29.905 --> 00:40:32.635
kind of actually troubled a little bit, you know,

746
00:40:32.645 --> 00:40:35.764
the assumption that women's basketball or other women's sports

747
00:40:35.774 --> 00:40:38.655
aren't interesting or fun or entertaining to watch. And

748
00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:40.625
so that has changed the act, she has changed

749
00:40:40.635 --> 00:40:44.635
the economics of the W NBA by just being

750
00:40:44.645 --> 00:40:47.689
like, like she just got drafted, um, and being

751
00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:49.639
in college. So I think we're, you know, we're

752
00:40:49.649 --> 00:40:51.479
kind of trying to trouble that a little bit,

753
00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:54.310
you know, but it's, it's still really lagging behind

754
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.780
because of just basic assumptions and prejudices about, about

755
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.389
men and women and what's fun to watch and

756
00:41:00.399 --> 00:41:01.459
what's interesting.

757
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.679
Mhm. You know, I, I'm really fascinated by this

758
00:41:05.689 --> 00:41:08.649
because, uh, as I told you before we started

759
00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:14.370
recording, I follow American wrestling, like wweaew stuff like

760
00:41:14.379 --> 00:41:18.000
that. And, uh, I've been following it since the

761
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.129
early two thousands, so, almost 20 years now. And,

762
00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:26.310
uh, I've seen lots of, uh, transformation evolution in

763
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.300
terms of how women were presented in the early

764
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.219
two thousands versus how they are presented. I mean,

765
00:41:32.229 --> 00:41:35.159
in the early two thousands, they were basically eye

766
00:41:35.169 --> 00:41:39.550
candy and now they are actual athletes and they

767
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.889
compete in actual uh fights. Uh uh And uh

768
00:41:43.899 --> 00:41:49.590
it's, and even right now, uh wrestling fans whenever

769
00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:53.669
they do not give the women good storylines or

770
00:41:53.679 --> 00:41:57.909
good fights, they get mad. So even the expectations

771
00:41:57.919 --> 00:42:01.610
of wrestling fans changed over time just because at

772
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.750
a certain point in WW for example, it was

773
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.939
the mid 20 tens, they started pushing more and

774
00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:13.370
more for women's wrestling and they have an entire

775
00:42:13.379 --> 00:42:16.939
pay per view just with women in 2018. So

776
00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:24.189
sometimes even just you marketing more women sports also

777
00:42:24.199 --> 00:42:27.590
changes people's expectations and they get exposed to it

778
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.300
and then they notice that, oh, wait a minute,

779
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:36.340
perhaps women are just as athletic as men. So

780
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:41.010
and entertaining. That is an excellent example. It's like,

781
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.760
oh, it turns out men also do want to

782
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.419
watch women in the WWE like, that's that assumption

783
00:42:46.429 --> 00:42:49.050
is that they didn't, is, you know, is often

784
00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.510
an assumption. So, and also like, people assume it

785
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.500
themselves, they're like, well, I've never watched a woman

786
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.239
and they have these terrible storylines but give them

787
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.800
good storylines, give them like kind of some cool

788
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.810
stuff and have them be athletic and compete and

789
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.239
you're like, I'm rooting for the woman. So, yeah,

790
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.989
I think it's also, you know, and we've also

791
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.280
just kind of, there's been a lot more social

792
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.919
media has really helped with this as, you know,

793
00:43:12.929 --> 00:43:15.909
media exposure can, is, is become a little bit

794
00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:18.600
more democratic. So even if you weren't on ESPN

795
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.550
or on, you know, their own channels, you know,

796
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.199
people were sports and fitness used Instagram um to

797
00:43:27.209 --> 00:43:30.560
push out different notions and to get like really

798
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:35.040
interesting examples of people kind of embodying different sorts

799
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.530
of, you know, kind of pushing against some of

800
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.760
these gendered embodiment of prejudices and notions and people

801
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.000
are like, 00 wow, women can be strong. And

802
00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.219
so I think that really helped then it becomes

803
00:43:47.229 --> 00:43:50.399
a lot more mainstream, you know, and WWE and

804
00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:56.020
crossfit are really good examples of one recognizing and

805
00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.750
respecting the capacity of women and have them kind

806
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.500
of competing against men head on rather than just

807
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.800
themselves. And that's, you know, that's really, that's a

808
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.219
really great and interesting thing just to kind of,

809
00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:11.679
you know, shake it up a little bit and

810
00:44:11.689 --> 00:44:12.729
see what falls out.

811
00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:16.149
I mean, actually, it's interesting that you mentioned that

812
00:44:16.159 --> 00:44:20.389
sometimes women compete against men, uh, in wrestling as

813
00:44:20.399 --> 00:44:24.570
well because actually in wrestling, there's a long tradition

814
00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.360
even though it's not that common of inter g

815
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.020
wrestling. And I mean, the wrestling fan do not

816
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:36.969
care at all about, uh, uh, if women compete

817
00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:40.080
with men or vice versa, as long as the

818
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.649
fight is good enough and the storyline is also

819
00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:46.800
good enough. I mean, we don't care at all

820
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.169
about gender categories there.

821
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.830
And I think that's a really good example like,

822
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.070
you know, that, that some of this stuff we

823
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.870
think is really entrenched or even biological, actually may

824
00:44:59.879 --> 00:45:03.270
not be that entrenched. And maybe, right, let's see

825
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.739
how it goes. And I think that's a really

826
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.360
good example, like I don't care who it is.

827
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.409
I want, you know, that woman and that woman

828
00:45:08.419 --> 00:45:10.860
on my team, if I'm, you know, that's who

829
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.229
I like and I'm gonna show up to watch

830
00:45:12.239 --> 00:45:14.020
him. So that's great.

831
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.669
So uh let's talk a little bit now about,

832
00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:22.229
of course, a very contagious issue that people in

833
00:45:22.239 --> 00:45:27.300
politics generally, particularly in the US have been discussing

834
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.719
a lot in recent years. Uh Let's talk a

835
00:45:29.729 --> 00:45:34.139
little bit about trans women in just sports and

836
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:37.800
also sports more generally because the argument they make

837
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:42.330
here is about sports as a broad category. So

838
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.239
what do you think is the main issue here?

839
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.969
Why do you think that people have been reacting

840
00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:51.679
so aggressively to trans women in sports.

841
00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:55.330
I think a lot of it has to do

842
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.770
with the just how gendered sports are, period, right?

843
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.399
So we, you know, in say the Olympics just

844
00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:04.760
because it's coming up and it's a really good

845
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.629
example. Um BUT everywhere it's like you have the

846
00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:09.889
men's teams and the women's teams or the men's

847
00:46:09.899 --> 00:46:13.139
swimming and the women's swimming. And so because instead

848
00:46:13.149 --> 00:46:17.000
of just, you know, the Portuguese and the Americans,

849
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.800
and then we're gonna have mixed gender kind of

850
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.550
like wrestling, you know, so part of it is

851
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.510
just that we still separate men and women and

852
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.389
we do that because we have these inherent understandings

853
00:46:27.399 --> 00:46:30.500
about biology. Um And that is, and a lot

854
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.850
of the gender stuff is based on the, the

855
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.070
understanding of biological sex that there's two sexes and

856
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.979
that's it. And there's all kinds of, you know,

857
00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:43.610
science uh that argue, right? There's a continuum um

858
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.429
of, of human homo SAPIEN sort of gender um

859
00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:51.489
aspects and sexual aspects. Like we can't, not everybody

860
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.949
nice and neatly fits into just male or female.

861
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.780
And we categorize that based on like reproductive systems

862
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:02.340
or hormones or like chromosomes, X and Y. But

863
00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.300
we know that there's so many humans with like

864
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:09.879
XXY and XYY and bearing hormone, you know, uh

865
00:47:09.969 --> 00:47:13.959
ranges and then also there's, there's uh men and

866
00:47:13.969 --> 00:47:18.879
women who have both sexual reproductive organs. Um And

867
00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:20.989
so those aren't, you know, those are not, these

868
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
are not outside of the norm of human experience.

869
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.750
Um, BUT we don't, you know, are a lot

870
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.600
of times our, we have kind of work sort

871
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.629
of solidified in this as male and female. Um,

872
00:47:31.639 --> 00:47:33.919
SO I think that's part of it is just

873
00:47:33.929 --> 00:47:37.530
that we aren't as like we've so, so quickly.

874
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.330
So, and so, uh, historically just had to decide

875
00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.239
if somebody was a male or female at, you

876
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.280
know, at birth based on looking at, you know,

877
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.790
their, their genitalia when they come out. And um

878
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.199
and then, but really, that's much more complicated than

879
00:47:52.209 --> 00:47:54.830
that. And um we're just starting to see how

880
00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.040
that's the case, but that has really prevented. So,

881
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:02.189
and, and transgender men and women is, is about

882
00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:06.320
experiences of themselves in a particular body and maybe

883
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.340
that doesn't who they experience themselves to be. It

884
00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.229
does not match with sort of the biological body

885
00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:14.459
that they have. And so part of it is

886
00:48:14.469 --> 00:48:17.260
like, so then there's this disjuncture of like, can

887
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.760
you then ma can you then as a transgender

888
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.330
woman say, if you were assigned male at birth,

889
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.219
become a woman, like, do you do that biologically?

890
00:48:26.229 --> 00:48:28.919
And then how would you do that biologically? Is

891
00:48:28.929 --> 00:48:31.679
there? You know, and the only place that we

892
00:48:31.689 --> 00:48:36.449
have to like, prove that we're men and women

893
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.239
is in sport, right? You don't have to go

894
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.000
to work and prove you're a man, no one's

895
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.540
gonna ask you to write in and in women's

896
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.899
sports, historically, women have had to like, be examined

897
00:48:47.909 --> 00:48:51.229
by doctors or sh the private parts to, you

898
00:48:51.239 --> 00:48:54.290
know, representatives, they've had like, they've had, you know,

899
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.570
elements of themselves, like measured in order to prove

900
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.679
that they're women. And so that's really, you know,

901
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.840
a violation of your own personal space. And the

902
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.580
only place that we demand that is in sport.

903
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:10.000
So it's really important to kind of like think

904
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.889
about that. But women have been policed for, for

905
00:49:12.899 --> 00:49:15.429
a really long time to make sure that they

906
00:49:15.439 --> 00:49:19.350
are actual women. Um And this has, you know,

907
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.909
a good example of that is uh Semenya who

908
00:49:21.919 --> 00:49:25.439
is the um the 800 m runner out of

909
00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:30.080
South Africa. And she uh has, she's a um

910
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.489
uh athletics, she competes in athletics and she has

911
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:38.479
been um in constant battle with the International Association

912
00:49:38.489 --> 00:49:40.870
for Athletics and the, and the Olympic Committee that

913
00:49:40.879 --> 00:49:45.250
she experiences herself as a woman. She has, she

914
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.620
has been, she has a particular kind of hormone

915
00:49:47.629 --> 00:49:51.030
that is associated with men. So her ranges um

916
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.340
of and it's not testosterone. Um AND she turns

917
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:57.020
out she has both reproductive organs. So instead of

918
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.820
ovaries, she has testes and she doesn't have maybe

919
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.389
a uterus, but she, she is a different kind

920
00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:06.050
of woman, that's how she understands herself. Um But

921
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.520
because there might be some sort of, she might

922
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.330
have a capacities, inherent biological capacities based on those

923
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.929
things to make her better. They don't let her

924
00:50:15.939 --> 00:50:18.860
compete in the sport. And that's where it gets

925
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:24.040
interesting because there are all kinds of biological advantages

926
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.360
that people are automatically born with that make them

927
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.500
better at a sport. So if you are born

928
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.030
7 ft tall, you are gonna be really good

929
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.149
at basketball. You might be really good at basketball.

930
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:35.879
People are gonna think you're good at basketball and

931
00:50:35.889 --> 00:50:37.919
they may spend all this money to get you

932
00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:40.040
a coach and for you to practice and then

933
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.320
you can make millions of dollars in, you know,

934
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.820
basketball leagues. That is never considered unfair. That is

935
00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.899
never police, no one is ever kicked out of

936
00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:51.879
basketball because they're too tall or even too short.

937
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.679
But it's this idea that people can be born

938
00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:58.649
with biological advantages and the only ones that are

939
00:50:58.659 --> 00:51:01.489
policed are gender aspects. And so part of it

940
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.610
is just we really need to kind of like,

941
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.699
kind of really be critical about some of those

942
00:51:05.709 --> 00:51:09.419
assumptions that we have, um, about what is, what

943
00:51:09.429 --> 00:51:10.969
is a man or a woman period, but then

944
00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:13.570
also what parts of our biology are considered fair

945
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.139
and unfair? And why is it always about gender

946
00:51:16.149 --> 00:51:18.830
and why is it always about women? And why

947
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.570
have we always police women and those women who

948
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.820
were like, really good, we questioned whether they were

949
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.439
really women and that has a long history in

950
00:51:28.449 --> 00:51:31.169
all kinds of sports and part of it is

951
00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:33.679
that, you know, being really athletic and a having

952
00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:37.409
athletic prowess has been considered a male domain. And

953
00:51:37.419 --> 00:51:39.570
so if you're a woman who's really good or

954
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.530
really muscular or really fast, they don't think you're

955
00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.770
a woman. And so that's where we just need

956
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.959
to kind of really think about the historical and

957
00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:51.600
cultural legacies of those kinds of things. And then,

958
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.679
and to say, like, you know, I do people

959
00:51:54.689 --> 00:51:57.639
who are transgender really have a lot of unfair

960
00:51:57.649 --> 00:52:01.760
advantage. Is that really possible? And first of all,

961
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.239
how many transgender women and men are there out

962
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.719
there trying to compete? And then second of all,

963
00:52:06.729 --> 00:52:09.100
like, do they win every time they go out

964
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.830
there? That's the, that's the fears that they're gonna

965
00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.459
always win. And that's not the case. There's a

966
00:52:13.469 --> 00:52:16.760
Laurel Laurel Hubbard who uh who is a weightlifter

967
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:20.419
strength sport athlete in 2020 the Tokyo Games. Um

968
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:23.219
SHE competed and she was born a male, born,

969
00:52:23.229 --> 00:52:27.020
assigned male at birth and then ran uh transitioned

970
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.620
and she got seven. She didn't win. So yes,

971
00:52:29.629 --> 00:52:32.370
she's really good, but she's also been doing weightlifting

972
00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:35.169
for like most of her life. So, is it

973
00:52:35.179 --> 00:52:37.979
because she's a transgender woman that she's really good?

974
00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:41.070
She's seven. She didn't win all the women in

975
00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.469
her category who were not transgender, beat her, you

976
00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:47.090
know, so those are the kinds of things where

977
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.290
we need to actually see examples. We need to

978
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.229
like let inclusion to really see if like they're

979
00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:55.360
always gonna win. Um And you know, to kind

980
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.340
of understand some of some of our own kind

981
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.439
of shackles of why we think these, the way

982
00:52:59.449 --> 00:53:01.909
we think. And there's a really, I think there's

983
00:53:01.919 --> 00:53:04.270
part of this idea that and this, this is,

984
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.500
has been a fear for a long time is

985
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.340
that men are gonna dress up as women and

986
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.739
compete right. There were his, there was like a

987
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.850
whole bunch of like rumors in the 19 eighties

988
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.659
at the Olympics that, that the Soviet unit had

989
00:53:19.669 --> 00:53:22.260
sent men disguised as women to compete in women's

990
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.899
activities. Um And so there's like a long history

991
00:53:25.909 --> 00:53:28.739
of sport and, and mediocre kind of men getting

992
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.040
to beat all the women. And I, again, that's

993
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.189
just this assumption that, you know, men are inherently

994
00:53:33.199 --> 00:53:36.350
better than women. Um AND that men are gonna

995
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.189
disguise themselves or even undergo a sexual transition or,

996
00:53:41.199 --> 00:53:43.989
and gender identity transition in order to compete in

997
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.899
a sport. And then that, that's like gonna change

998
00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:49.000
their whole identity. Like a lot of that stuff

999
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.969
is just fear mongering and like really kind of

1000
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:55.169
concerns about things that really are there. You know

1001
00:53:55.629 --> 00:53:58.949
that they're not, they're moral panics, right? They're kind

1002
00:53:58.959 --> 00:54:02.030
of like conjuring up this like fear when there's

1003
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.169
really no evidence of, right? It being a problem

1004
00:54:06.179 --> 00:54:09.860
and uh you know, whether participating, where men are

1005
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:13.250
not disguising themselves and transgender women aren't always winning.

1006
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.729
So, like what is really the issue, um, about,

1007
00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:20.020
you know, that kind of thing and, you know,

1008
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.389
that's sort of the, the, I think some of

1009
00:54:22.399 --> 00:54:25.600
the concern about it and why we shouldn't be

1010
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:27.100
as concerned, I think as we are.

1011
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.300
So, uh, I might be missing the mark here

1012
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.260
with what I'm about to say and if I'm

1013
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.560
wrong, please correct me. But, uh, I mean, what

1014
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:41.570
I hear mostly from conservative right wing people in

1015
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.580
the US, particularly when it comes to the issue

1016
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:49.290
of the issue of transwomen in sports is that

1017
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.020
they are trying to protect as they say, women

1018
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:56.689
sports. But one thing that I find really curious

1019
00:54:56.699 --> 00:55:02.729
about this is that so until very recently, uh

1020
00:55:03.429 --> 00:55:06.149
y you didn't care and by you, I mean,

1021
00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:10.750
they, they didn't care at all about women's sports.

1022
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.350
I mean, they even bash women's sports, they say

1023
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.050
that women are weaker than men. They say that

1024
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:20.965
soccer players, I mean, female soccer players are much

1025
00:55:20.975 --> 00:55:25.034
worse than men, soccer players or male soccer players

1026
00:55:25.044 --> 00:55:29.145
and all of that. And now suddenly, just because

1027
00:55:29.155 --> 00:55:33.485
there are, uh there is a tiny number of

1028
00:55:33.495 --> 00:55:37.774
trans women, trans people wanting to compete uh in

1029
00:55:37.854 --> 00:55:44.604
women's sports. You're worried about we're protecting women's sports.

1030
00:55:44.614 --> 00:55:46.645
I mean, it, it, I, I mean, as I

1031
00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:48.814
said, I might be missing the mark here but

1032
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.629
it seems to me extremely obvious that the issue

1033
00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:57.179
is that they are transphobic. It's not that they

1034
00:55:57.189 --> 00:56:01.179
care about protecting women's sports at all.

1035
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.699
Right. I would absolutely agree with you. And it's,

1036
00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:08.899
it's just kind of another turn. They're very much,

1037
00:56:08.909 --> 00:56:12.570
uh, there's a lot of like, uh, fear or

1038
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:16.969
hate against queer people in general, whether it's gay

1039
00:56:16.979 --> 00:56:22.179
lesbian marriage issues. Um, BUT so that's an inherent

1040
00:56:22.189 --> 00:56:26.719
kind of conservative, um, perspective. And then it's also

1041
00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:30.909
like, policing of women in general, right? Conservative politics,

1042
00:56:30.919 --> 00:56:33.949
especially in the United States is, is very much

1043
00:56:33.979 --> 00:56:37.370
about policing women, right? Um We see this now

1044
00:56:37.379 --> 00:56:40.270
in the sort of transformation of our abortion rights

1045
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.294
and act. Um AND, you know, penalizing people who

1046
00:56:44.304 --> 00:56:46.995
help women who, you know, get an abortion, not

1047
00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:50.635
allowing women to get abortion even in dire circumstances.

1048
00:56:50.814 --> 00:56:53.294
And so that's like the whole pro life situation,

1049
00:56:53.304 --> 00:56:56.054
but it's not, it's less about life again and

1050
00:56:56.064 --> 00:56:58.379
it's a lot about policing. Um So I think

1051
00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:00.739
there's less that's kind of the patriarchal of, there's

1052
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.479
a, it's a lot about control, it's a lot

1053
00:57:02.489 --> 00:57:05.149
about controlling women. It's a lot about controlling sport.

1054
00:57:05.159 --> 00:57:08.629
It's a lot about controlling politics. Um And these

1055
00:57:08.639 --> 00:57:11.550
are men making these decisions or they're women who

1056
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.120
are kind of patriarchal as well. And they're also,

1057
00:57:14.205 --> 00:57:17.245
they think that, you know, women, transgender women are

1058
00:57:17.254 --> 00:57:20.665
gonna take their daughters spot or their spot. And

1059
00:57:20.675 --> 00:57:24.145
there's just, you're right, like, it's just, it comes

1060
00:57:24.155 --> 00:57:27.975
from, you know, a perspective that is, you know,

1061
00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:30.715
a lot about hate and a lot about um

1062
00:57:30.925 --> 00:57:34.435
you know, policing women and having and continuing a

1063
00:57:34.445 --> 00:57:40.375
particular form of patriarchal um domination as an ideology

1064
00:57:40.385 --> 00:57:41.784
in the United States, for sure.

1065
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.810
Uh But taking into account that there are uh

1066
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:51.750
biological differences, differences in terms of genes, hormones across

1067
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.360
people. Uh AND some of these differences might bring

1068
00:57:56.370 --> 00:58:01.320
advantages to a few people out there. Uh In

1069
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:05.199
what ways do you think that sports should work

1070
00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:09.479
if they are not a gendered? I mean, in

1071
00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:13.600
what uh would there still be, should there still

1072
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:18.919
be categories? And if so what kinds of categories?

1073
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:22.260
I mean, I think this is an excellent question

1074
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.500
and it's even somebody who studies sports, this is

1075
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:27.780
such a like it's hard to even think outside

1076
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.870
of that gender box, right? Like, oh, I didn't

1077
00:58:30.879 --> 00:58:34.419
even know that was an option, right? And it

1078
00:58:34.429 --> 00:58:36.919
is an option when you have little kids, right?

1079
00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:38.899
Or WWE is a good example where you're like,

1080
00:58:38.909 --> 00:58:40.770
oh, look at him play and that girl is

1081
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.800
faster than that boy and that girl is stronger

1082
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.979
than that one and that boy is taller and

1083
00:58:44.989 --> 00:58:46.850
you know, like you look at like I have

1084
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.260
got two nieces and they are both the tallest

1085
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.659
people in their classes hands down. So will that

1086
00:58:52.669 --> 00:58:55.729
always be the case? Who knows? Like we, we

1087
00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:59.520
grow in different times and places? Um So I

1088
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.300
think that, you know, maybe it could be about

1089
00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:04.449
like ability, like levels of like, you know, kind

1090
00:59:04.459 --> 00:59:08.879
of novice, intermediate elite and kind of thinking about,

1091
00:59:08.889 --> 00:59:12.110
you know, not only just, you know, your genetic

1092
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.250
capacities but also like, how much training do you

1093
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.159
have, how much effort have you put into it?

1094
00:59:16.169 --> 00:59:17.979
How many, how many years have you been doing

1095
00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:20.270
this sport? And also like, you know, you're not

1096
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.909
gonna have a lot of people like doing ice

1097
00:59:21.919 --> 00:59:27.330
hockey and, you know, say Kenya, right, the whole,

1098
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:29.320
like, there was like that show about the like

1099
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:32.189
Jamaican bobsledders, right? This idea of like, you know,

1100
00:59:32.199 --> 00:59:36.379
there's all different kinds of reasons that people don't

1101
00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:40.139
do sports and people do sports, right? Some like,

1102
00:59:40.149 --> 00:59:43.020
I, I love the country of Georgia and there

1103
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:47.540
they have amazing weightlifters, but they're not necessarily playing

1104
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:50.659
baseball, but that's like to be, you know, but

1105
00:59:50.669 --> 00:59:52.649
they have like this long heritage of like this

1106
00:59:52.659 --> 00:59:56.489
being a strong weightlifter and so culturally nation, like

1107
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.939
we all, there's all different kinds of reasons why

1108
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.080
we go to different sports and participate in those

1109
01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:04.000
kinds of sports and have an identity based on

1110
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:05.889
that. So I think that we could think about

1111
01:00:05.899 --> 01:00:07.853
it, you know, in different kinds of ways could,

1112
01:00:07.863 --> 01:00:09.562
you know, we have all these leagues around the

1113
01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:13.252
world, like the, the American Basketball Association and then,

1114
01:00:13.472 --> 01:00:16.373
you know, the European one and like all, like,

1115
01:00:16.383 --> 01:00:18.462
what if we sort of like, thought about, you

1116
01:00:18.472 --> 01:00:21.343
know, different kinds of ways of like, you know,

1117
01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:23.673
including more people from different parts of the world

1118
01:00:23.683 --> 01:00:26.433
to do winter sports, if they don't have snow

1119
01:00:26.443 --> 01:00:28.686
or, you know, if there's like, the, the, the

1120
01:00:28.696 --> 01:00:31.486
possibility is actually endless of how we could think

1121
01:00:31.496 --> 01:00:34.575
about these things. Um, WE just really haven't tried

1122
01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:37.406
and I think that there's, you know, there's, there's

1123
01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:40.666
ways in which we could just, you know, like,

1124
01:00:40.676 --> 01:00:42.166
if we're gonna, if we're going to think about

1125
01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:44.615
competing, right, winning, which is a lot about what

1126
01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:47.325
sports is, right? Sports has this understanding that there's

1127
01:00:47.335 --> 01:00:50.000
a winner and a loser. Um It also has

1128
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:52.520
a, has a rhetoric and a, an ideology about

1129
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:55.350
being fair. Um Right, nowhere else are we sort

1130
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.919
of as concerned about fairness, um, as we are

1131
01:00:59.929 --> 01:01:03.820
in sport and uh very rarely and so kind

1132
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:06.209
of thinking about the ways in which we could,

1133
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.389
you know, get the best people, whatever they look

1134
01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:13.330
like whatever gender they are um to be on

1135
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:18.100
teams and how might we understand those teams. So,

1136
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.719
I think there's all different kinds of ways to

1137
01:01:19.729 --> 01:01:22.020
think about it and we just really haven't done

1138
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:24.639
a whole lot of it. So what if we,

1139
01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:25.439
what if we tried?

1140
01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:29.479
Uh, SO, but in the particular case of strength

1141
01:01:29.489 --> 01:01:33.600
sports and fight and many fight sports there are,

1142
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.300
for example, weight categories. Do you think that at

1143
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:41.649
least those we should keep or not? So,

1144
01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:43.800
I think that's a right, that's a good way

1145
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.110
to do it where, you know, we could because

1146
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.370
that's part like lifting strong, heavy weight. It's depending

1147
01:01:49.379 --> 01:01:51.409
on how big you are perhaps. I mean, that's

1148
01:01:51.419 --> 01:01:53.689
an, that's an assumption about it. Right. A small

1149
01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:57.014
person, 55 kg is not gonna lift as much

1150
01:01:57.024 --> 01:01:59.725
as a super heavyweight who could be as heavy

1151
01:01:59.735 --> 01:02:03.014
as, you know, 100 and 80 kg. So, very

1152
01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:05.504
different. Um, SO maybe, yeah, maybe we do weight

1153
01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:09.375
classes or we do, you know, the class is

1154
01:02:09.385 --> 01:02:13.364
based on experience or classes based on a test

1155
01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.435
in a level, like if you run a certain

1156
01:02:15.445 --> 01:02:17.245
weight or run a certain time or lift a

1157
01:02:17.254 --> 01:02:18.995
certain weight, no matter what gender you are, you

1158
01:02:19.004 --> 01:02:21.354
get to be in the, in the top group.

1159
01:02:21.364 --> 01:02:24.114
And so then you can can, you know, compete.

1160
01:02:24.379 --> 01:02:26.540
Um So I think there's all different kinds of

1161
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:28.320
ways, you know, those are still even a little

1162
01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:33.510
gendered. Um The women's heavyweight is, you know, 87

1163
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.729
in weightlifting is 87 kg plus which is not

1164
01:02:36.739 --> 01:02:39.750
a very big person, right? That's not a, you

1165
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.020
know, a, a heavy person really in terms of

1166
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:45.909
like, but everybody over that weight is considered a

1167
01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:48.280
super heavyweight. And so I think we just need

1168
01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:51.659
to think about like humans of all of all

1169
01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:54.939
ilks are getting bigger. And so like, let's think

1170
01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:57.989
about kind of the range of human um um

1171
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.179
bodies rather than just that women should be smaller

1172
01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:04.739
than, you know, men's men's super heavyweight is 109.

1173
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.939
And so you know, that's like that can be

1174
01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:12.489
a considerable difference. So I, yeah, like weight classes,

1175
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:17.100
uh abilities, ages, um you know, length of doing

1176
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:19.639
it, uh all different tests, you know, if you

1177
01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:22.209
have like things that are timed or weighted, you

1178
01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.649
know, having a test to get into the super

1179
01:03:24.659 --> 01:03:30.100
lead or the intermediate categories. So, and even have

1180
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.580
your best men and women on the basketball court,

1181
01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.209
say like a team sport or in a, in

1182
01:03:34.219 --> 01:03:36.850
a relay or, you know, kind of to be

1183
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.500
the fastest people out there because you have a

1184
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:42.149
lot of women, like the 100 m dash, you

1185
01:03:42.159 --> 01:03:44.429
know, who are competing at the Olympics, they are

1186
01:03:44.439 --> 01:03:48.649
faster than 99% of the male population, right? So

1187
01:03:49.129 --> 01:03:52.219
kind of thinking about it, you know, pushing ourselves

1188
01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.439
and it's hard, I think for sport to think

1189
01:03:54.449 --> 01:03:56.629
about it that way. But WWE is a good,

1190
01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:59.510
is a good way to, is a good, you

1191
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.320
know, I'm glad I'm glad you have that experience

1192
01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.320
because that's like, yeah, like who would have thought

1193
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:07.179
they'd be so progressive? You know, they're pushing us

1194
01:04:07.189 --> 01:04:09.520
to think about it and that's great. Yeah,

1195
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.590
I, I guess that they found out that there's

1196
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.699
good money for them to make.

1197
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:19.040
Well, exactly when you like limit women's participation, you're

1198
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:22.540
alienating half of the population and their income. Like,

1199
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.320
what are you doing? Get them to the floor,

1200
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.139
get him into the ring, get him into the

1201
01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:28.979
stands, you know, get them onto the couch to

1202
01:04:28.989 --> 01:04:31.949
watch it and you, it's surprising. It's like, amazing.

1203
01:04:31.959 --> 01:04:32.159
Yeah.

1204
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.620
Yeah. No, you, you know, it's very interesting. I

1205
01:04:34.629 --> 01:04:37.699
never thought about things like this but since I

1206
01:04:37.709 --> 01:04:42.010
also follow soccer and different soccer leagues in Europe,

1207
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.199
uh, one thing that never crossed my mind was

1208
01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:49.040
that you mentioned, for example, age there in terms

1209
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:52.350
of a category we could use. But in soccer,

1210
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.320
for example, people do not care about age at

1211
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:58.290
all. I mean, you have 30 year olds competing

1212
01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.409
with even 16 year olds, sometimes 18 year olds

1213
01:05:02.419 --> 01:05:05.379
and, uh, the 30 year olds are much more

1214
01:05:05.389 --> 01:05:09.590
experienced and, uh, I, I mean, they are older,

1215
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.669
of course, uh, and people do not care about

1216
01:05:12.679 --> 01:05:15.669
that at all. So that's just another example of

1217
01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.560
how perhaps we have to look at things on

1218
01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:22.929
a case by case basis. And what I is

1219
01:05:22.939 --> 01:05:26.550
common in a particular sport is what people find

1220
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.669
normal because no one questions that role in soccer,

1221
01:05:30.679 --> 01:05:31.389
for example.

1222
01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:35.159
Exactly. And think about how much different you are

1223
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:38.909
at 30 than, than you were at 16 and

1224
01:05:38.919 --> 01:05:42.439
like what parts are actually better, right. So you're

1225
01:05:42.449 --> 01:05:44.889
much more calm, you're much more strategic. You might

1226
01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.330
know that you've had longer to do it. You

1227
01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:50.260
like can read the field better. You like have

1228
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:54.449
this intelligence and this maybe psychological like, you know,

1229
01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:58.540
calm to, to, like, take a, you know, a,

1230
01:05:58.879 --> 01:06:02.550
you know, a, a penalty kick when the 16

1231
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.510
year olds are like, all nerves and they may

1232
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.570
have these great skills but they don't have that,

1233
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.580
like, and so is that unfair? We would never

1234
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.439
say that would be unfair. We just think that,

1235
01:06:11.449 --> 01:06:14.870
oh, that element of it just makes them better,

1236
01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:16.820
um, in that kind of way. So, I think,

1237
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.100
like, that's the kind of stuff we just, you

1238
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.949
know, we really need to think about, like, so

1239
01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:24.510
many things make somebody good at a sport that

1240
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.790
are beyond and above the genetic and biological. And

1241
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.100
so, and if we want to talk about fairness,

1242
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.669
we've got to talk about all that kind of

1243
01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:35.889
stuff. And when do we decide that's not fair,

1244
01:06:35.919 --> 01:06:38.189
it's very rare, like somebody born with a genetic

1245
01:06:38.199 --> 01:06:41.600
component that makes them really tall or have in

1246
01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.600
weightlifting, the idea is to have a long torso

1247
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.560
and short arms and legs. So somebody born like

1248
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.429
that is, could possibly be an amazing Olympic champion,

1249
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.389
but that would never be considered like unfair. So,

1250
01:06:55.429 --> 01:07:00.860
you know, but economics funding training, history, like maturity,

1251
01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:03.729
you know, support all of those kinds of things.

1252
01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:07.260
Also come into the idea of like all of

1253
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:11.350
that also shapes the fairness of it, you know.

1254
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.040
So there's also a, a very interesting topic that

1255
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:19.979
uh you explore in the book, uh related to

1256
01:07:19.989 --> 01:07:24.239
pregnancy in sport. So this is of course a

1257
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.489
very uh female issue in this particular case. So

1258
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:34.489
what are the challenges that pregnant strength athletes face.

1259
01:07:36.179 --> 01:07:40.419
So by first of all, biologically, the idea that

1260
01:07:40.429 --> 01:07:43.639
you a pregnant woman and then a postpartum woman,

1261
01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:48.760
you are build pregnancy, you're building another human being

1262
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.639
in your body. So that takes a lot of

1263
01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:54.399
extra calories, lots of extra rest, lots of all

1264
01:07:54.409 --> 01:07:58.260
kinds of things in order to just be, you

1265
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.479
know, a, a person in the world let alone

1266
01:08:00.489 --> 01:08:02.370
to compete in a sport or continue to be

1267
01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:06.810
fit and then post uh post birth. Um A

1268
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.219
lot of women breastfeed and so their bodies are

1269
01:08:09.229 --> 01:08:12.070
the soul are still for another number of months,

1270
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.620
still. The pri the only way in which a

1271
01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:18.720
baby gets any kind of nutrition and grows. So,

1272
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.169
first of all, it's just biologically this idea that

1273
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:25.379
you are building a human being and creating a

1274
01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:27.399
human building, you know, being for at least a

1275
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:29.759
year, right? For, for a lot of women, if

1276
01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:32.509
not more. Um AND then there's all the different

1277
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.250
kinds of changes that happen. A lot of, you

1278
01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:36.290
know, there's different kinds of hormones that make your

1279
01:08:36.299 --> 01:08:40.359
joints relax or, you know, have uh you know,

1280
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.689
different kinds of like less, less aggression and more

1281
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.529
sort of loving um notions. Um And so that

1282
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.899
can change whether or not you can do strength

1283
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.799
sports, like lift really heavy. If your joints are

1284
01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:54.700
really lax, you may be, you may hurt yourself.

1285
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:58.080
Um So there's all kinds of biological issues that

1286
01:08:58.089 --> 01:09:00.160
sort of prevent it. But they're also like you,

1287
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.870
there's a lot of evidence that, uh, my, again,

1288
01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:06.870
my friend, uh, Ka Aach is a biological anthropologist.

1289
01:09:07.259 --> 01:09:10.629
And, um, you know, there's just, there's, you know,

1290
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.319
evidence in the, um, in fossil, there's fossil evidence

1291
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.259
that women while pregnant were still doing all the

1292
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:19.419
things that they can do. And this is the

1293
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:22.279
case women can continue, you know, a lot of

1294
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:25.209
women can continue to do a lot of normal

1295
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.589
things while being pregnant. And if you're used to

1296
01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.520
training and you're used to pushing yourself, um doing

1297
01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:34.939
a strength sport before you get pregnant, you know,

1298
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.870
there's a lot of evidence that you can continue

1299
01:09:36.879 --> 01:09:39.339
to do that even, even as you get, you

1300
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:42.689
know, get, um, get bigger with a belly or

1301
01:09:42.765 --> 01:09:46.115
the um get closer to, to birth. And there's

1302
01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:48.075
like tons of examples of women who have been

1303
01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:50.524
elite athletes who continue to do their sport for

1304
01:09:50.535 --> 01:09:53.625
long into their pregnancy and then shortly after they

1305
01:09:53.634 --> 01:09:56.595
give birth, they'll, you know, they'll um, continue to

1306
01:09:56.604 --> 01:10:00.080
train or compete. Um, SO there's, and that's not

1307
01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:03.160
all women. Some women have complications in their pregnancies,

1308
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:06.759
obviously. Um, BUT this idea that women aren't supposed

1309
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:09.950
to do things like that, lift heavy or run

1310
01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:12.919
fast or run far is I think is, is

1311
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:16.810
kind of a misunderstanding and just assumptions about kind

1312
01:10:16.819 --> 01:10:20.799
of policing women and their participation anyway. Um, YOU

1313
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:23.319
know, biological evidence is that women can continue to

1314
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:24.850
do a lot of that stuff and a are

1315
01:10:24.859 --> 01:10:30.220
actually like estrogen is like an inherent muscular endurance,

1316
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:33.220
anabolic that helps them do that. We actually have

1317
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.149
been kind of evolved to, to be able to

1318
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.450
like build humans and continue to like, be in

1319
01:10:39.459 --> 01:10:42.569
the world in a very physical way. Um As

1320
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.370
you know, there's evidence of that. So it's not

1321
01:10:44.379 --> 01:10:46.580
that we, we shouldn't just, you know, kind of

1322
01:10:46.589 --> 01:10:49.250
not do anything. Um So I think that's part

1323
01:10:49.259 --> 01:10:51.950
of it is like, is there's a misconception about

1324
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.140
what women should be able to do and that's

1325
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.779
kind of because of the medical field there, but

1326
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.589
there isn't a lot of, you know, that some

1327
01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.140
of the science in, in medicine um is lacking

1328
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:05.120
about uh you know, menstruation for women as well

1329
01:11:05.129 --> 01:11:07.549
as pregnancies for women and as well as post

1330
01:11:07.879 --> 01:11:11.859
partum. Um And so we're starting to rectify that

1331
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:14.450
there's a lot more research on, on that kind

1332
01:11:14.459 --> 01:11:18.500
of uh on that, on experiences and biological evidence

1333
01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:21.839
of these kinds of things. Um But there's understandings

1334
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:24.899
about what makes a good mother and including during

1335
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.270
pregnancy and post pregnancy. And I think that is

1336
01:11:27.279 --> 01:11:31.700
what kind of polices women more than anything. So

1337
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:33.680
the article in the book or the chapter in

1338
01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.299
the book that looks at that looks at like

1339
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:39.279
posts uh Instagram um and social media posts that

1340
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:41.700
women who are strength athletes who are continuing to

1341
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:44.790
lift really heavy, you know, with maybe their outfits

1342
01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:47.609
on their video or sports bra, little and little

1343
01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.470
shorts and then their belly is sticking out and

1344
01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:51.379
they're lifting a big barbell and it looks like

1345
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.290
it's a lot of weight and it's heavy, maybe

1346
01:11:53.299 --> 01:11:55.270
less weight than what they have been able to

1347
01:11:55.279 --> 01:11:57.629
do. Maybe they have taken weight off the barbell

1348
01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.299
because they're not feeling as strong, but they're still

1349
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:04.549
doing their sport. And the comments in those in

1350
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.680
those videos are really about, you know, kind of

1351
01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:11.740
challenging this woman's good motherhood and that's how they

1352
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:13.600
frame it. Like you're not a good mother because

1353
01:12:13.609 --> 01:12:16.350
you're doing this. And so, and in the United

1354
01:12:16.359 --> 01:12:17.879
States, we see this a lot of time where

1355
01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:22.140
the priority of the child in utero and, and

1356
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:25.899
out of utero um is really kind of the

1357
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:31.810
focus and women's joy health like well being is

1358
01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:34.009
really kind of put on the back burner once

1359
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:38.189
they become um pregnant or become a mother. And

1360
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.569
so I think that's part of that is like

1361
01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:42.259
thinking about, you know, why do we not care

1362
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:46.259
about women's mental health, physical health ability to perform

1363
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:48.620
their sports and their activities, especially if it's like

1364
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:50.759
an income generation thing. Like if you're a pro

1365
01:12:50.859 --> 01:12:53.649
pro athlete and you are, you know, and, and

1366
01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.370
Alex and Felix is a good, is a good

1367
01:12:55.379 --> 01:12:58.689
example of this. She is this, you know, uh

1368
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:02.490
most, you know, gold medal athlete in the world

1369
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.319
in, in track and field and Nike who was,

1370
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.020
her sponsor was like, well, we're not gonna pay

1371
01:13:07.029 --> 01:13:10.569
for you while you're pregnant. And she couldn't believe

1372
01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.580
it. Like, all of a sudden, you know, this

1373
01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:15.279
was like, and so they weren't committed to her

1374
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:17.299
as a person they were committed to, you know,

1375
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.479
so she, like, dropped them and went with a

1376
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:23.100
women owned, um, athletic company and she came in,

1377
01:13:23.109 --> 01:13:26.250
you know, postpartum, like a 10 months postpartum after

1378
01:13:26.259 --> 01:13:28.939
ac section, which is a major surgery and she

1379
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:32.850
won her 12th Olympic gold medal after she was

1380
01:13:32.859 --> 01:13:36.189
pregnant after surgery. And, and Nike didn't want, didn't

1381
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.490
want to support her during her pregnancy during a

1382
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.169
very short window where she didn't train. So she

1383
01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.220
was training so much of that time and Nike

1384
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:46.770
didn't. So I think Nike now has changed their

1385
01:13:46.779 --> 01:13:50.529
policies. Um But that's because someone as elite as

1386
01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.850
Alex and Felix had to push back on that.

1387
01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.950
So, and that's recent, she was an Olympian, you

1388
01:13:55.959 --> 01:14:00.500
know, like in the 2000 tens. So it's just

1389
01:14:00.509 --> 01:14:03.450
now that we're even thinking about like by a

1390
01:14:03.459 --> 01:14:05.220
lot, you know, like what can women do while

1391
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:08.939
pregnant? Um And then letting them decide and not

1392
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:13.399
policing them based on some kind of misunderstandings from

1393
01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:17.859
the medical field or patriarchal assumptions about where, what's,

1394
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.100
where is the woman's place. Um And just what

1395
01:14:21.109 --> 01:14:23.020
you can, you know, biologically do might be an

1396
01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:26.274
individual basis if you never strength trained before you

1397
01:14:26.285 --> 01:14:28.055
do it, you start it while pregnant. Probably not

1398
01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.185
a good idea. But if you're an athlete who's

1399
01:14:30.194 --> 01:14:33.524
been doing this sport and of, of, uh, crossfit

1400
01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:36.895
or powerlifting or weightlifting for years and then do

1401
01:14:36.904 --> 01:14:39.765
that while you're pregnant and then shortly after you,

1402
01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:41.935
you give birth, that's probably not as big of

1403
01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:42.884
a deal as we think.

1404
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.359
Mhm. Uh, I mean, I guess that, uh, all

1405
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:48.979
of what you said there connects to the fact

1406
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:52.060
that because women are the ones who can get

1407
01:14:52.069 --> 01:14:55.250
pregnant and the ones who give birth, unfortunately, in

1408
01:14:55.259 --> 01:15:00.660
human societies there's this very strong tendency to police

1409
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:06.180
women's, uh, pregnancies, sexual behavior if they ever have

1410
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:08.839
kids or not. I mean, and sometimes it even

1411
01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:14.040
gets contradictory because, uh, people are always trying to,

1412
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:19.200
uh, socially enforce this idea that people should have

1413
01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:22.850
kids and particularly women should have kids. But at

1414
01:15:22.859 --> 01:15:26.740
the same time you mentioned an example there, sometimes

1415
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.459
women, if they want to have a ca a

1416
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:33.620
career in whatever kind of domain they get penalized

1417
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:37.620
for getting pregnant and having Children. So, I mean,

1418
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:39.700
it's really, it's a mess.

1419
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:43.490
Yeah. And there's a lot of assumption about like

1420
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:46.169
that they're never gonna be fast again or strong

1421
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.259
like that. Something about that giving birth is going

1422
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:52.220
to change their, their bodies and, you know, I

1423
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:55.490
think it's pretty, biologically incredible that a woman can

1424
01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.649
build a human being and feed a human being

1425
01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.689
and still perform high levels of activity, you know.

1426
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:05.490
That's an incredible strength capacity of strength. That is

1427
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.839
not part of our current definition. Um But what

1428
01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.620
if it was, you know, what if, you know,

1429
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:15.290
like that's a, that's an above and beyond like

1430
01:16:15.359 --> 01:16:18.870
a, you know, strength and endurance thing for a

1431
01:16:18.879 --> 01:16:21.020
person to be able to be, do a sport,

1432
01:16:21.029 --> 01:16:23.220
train for a sport and build a human being

1433
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.979
in their body.

1434
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:29.770
Yeah. So, yeah, since we're also talking about feminism

1435
01:16:29.779 --> 01:16:33.750
here, do you think that is a strength sport

1436
01:16:33.759 --> 01:16:39.060
specifically can link to women empowerment in any way?

1437
01:16:40.839 --> 01:16:43.310
So that was part of our, our focus for

1438
01:16:43.319 --> 01:16:45.129
the whole book to begin with. We really wanted

1439
01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.370
to kind, we sort of the people who do

1440
01:16:47.379 --> 01:16:49.770
it kind of feel like it's an element that's

1441
01:16:49.779 --> 01:16:52.330
empowering. We are all of a sudden strong, we

1442
01:16:52.339 --> 01:16:54.399
can lift our own stuff, we can move our

1443
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.850
own beds, we can do these kind, we can

1444
01:16:56.859 --> 01:17:00.330
slip our own groceries. Um And then that has

1445
01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:03.160
also makes us more confident in ourselves. So a

1446
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:05.109
lot of women in the research I do on

1447
01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.200
crossfit, they talk about how they use the new

1448
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:10.283
things they're able to do in the gym to

1449
01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.382
like, be more confident in work. And so things

1450
01:17:13.393 --> 01:17:15.623
that like empower them in the gym, empower them

1451
01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:17.263
to speak up for themselves at work or to

1452
01:17:17.272 --> 01:17:20.373
ask for a raise or to, you know, not

1453
01:17:20.382 --> 01:17:22.362
take a lot of flak from men. And it's

1454
01:17:22.373 --> 01:17:25.902
really an interesting element this idea of a physical

1455
01:17:25.913 --> 01:17:29.612
kind of strength gets sort of transmuted into um

1456
01:17:29.623 --> 01:17:34.103
a psychological, a spiritual, a social kind of strength.

1457
01:17:34.513 --> 01:17:38.556
Um But there's also oftentimes we have, we found

1458
01:17:38.565 --> 01:17:41.476
in our research is that oftentimes women had to

1459
01:17:41.485 --> 01:17:44.315
like many other things adapt to the more masculine

1460
01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:47.235
or male dominant way of doing things. And so

1461
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:50.105
is there, you know, in, or one of our

1462
01:17:50.116 --> 01:17:54.166
interludes, talks about this where one of our Kabak

1463
01:17:54.175 --> 01:17:57.116
uh was, you know, started doing some powerlifting and

1464
01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:58.516
she felt like she kind of took on a

1465
01:17:58.525 --> 01:18:03.215
lot more of an aggressive, dominating, domineering kind of

1466
01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:06.120
persona and felt like she had to do that

1467
01:18:06.129 --> 01:18:07.950
and she didn't like that about herself. She's like,

1468
01:18:07.959 --> 01:18:09.410
is that, that's not what I, how I want

1469
01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:12.229
to be. And so thinking about like, how can,

1470
01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.560
how can we sort of trouble again, this idea

1471
01:18:14.569 --> 01:18:18.689
of strength so that it's not just masculine strength

1472
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.950
that we think about, but it's like collective strength.

1473
01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:23.959
It's about solidarity. One of the big things in

1474
01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:26.160
um a lot of neo liberal societies is this

1475
01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:29.970
idea that it's about like health and then therefore

1476
01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:33.620
strength or even your economic status is all about

1477
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:37.799
your own personal abilities. Um And so strength oftentimes

1478
01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:41.390
is about, oh my own capacities and that's less

1479
01:18:41.399 --> 01:18:43.695
empowering, that's maybe empowering for one person, but that

1480
01:18:43.706 --> 01:18:46.655
becomes also a very just you on your own.

1481
01:18:46.666 --> 01:18:50.045
Like, what about community solidarity? What about um that's

1482
01:18:50.056 --> 01:18:52.895
what that the gym in El Salvador was this

1483
01:18:52.905 --> 01:18:54.666
idea of like, it's not just about me getting

1484
01:18:54.675 --> 01:18:56.666
stronger but how can we get our community stronger?

1485
01:18:56.675 --> 01:19:00.096
How can we use the gym space to, you

1486
01:19:00.105 --> 01:19:02.795
know, break down barrier gender barriers? But what also

1487
01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:05.295
can we use it as a like education space?

1488
01:19:05.306 --> 01:19:07.525
Can we teach people to read there? Can we

1489
01:19:07.536 --> 01:19:09.671
have it as a as a space where we

1490
01:19:09.682 --> 01:19:12.591
have different kinds of organizing happen, whether it's political

1491
01:19:12.602 --> 01:19:15.222
or religious or what are the kinds of things

1492
01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:17.702
that we can use? Not only our gym spaces,

1493
01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:21.492
but our mo our move to be stronger, that's

1494
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:24.501
less about the individual body as stronger and competitive

1495
01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:27.392
and more about kind of bringing more people up

1496
01:19:27.401 --> 01:19:30.082
and, and encouraging other people to sort of be

1497
01:19:30.091 --> 01:19:32.932
a part of this in both the physical strength

1498
01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:34.722
as well as like that psychological strength that we

1499
01:19:34.731 --> 01:19:35.392
talked about.

1500
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.089
You know, earlier, I've alluded to the fact that

1501
01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.950
some of these, particularly the aspects that have to

1502
01:19:42.959 --> 01:19:46.890
do with the gender construct, gender expectation, gender roles

1503
01:19:46.899 --> 01:19:51.529
also affect men themselves because just to give you

1504
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.654
an example and again, since I follow w we,

1505
01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:59.435
there's a massive man there, Bronze Roman and he

1506
01:19:59.444 --> 01:20:02.435
is like 6 ft seven or eight. I don't

1507
01:20:02.444 --> 01:20:07.544
know, he's extremely tall and he's like 150 kg

1508
01:20:07.555 --> 01:20:10.915
160 kg, something like that. I mean, he's really

1509
01:20:10.924 --> 01:20:15.169
a massive uh person and sometimes in interviews he's

1510
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:19.100
talking about how his uncle passed away, how he

1511
01:20:19.109 --> 01:20:22.250
was given an opportunity in WWE to pursue his

1512
01:20:22.259 --> 01:20:25.410
dream and so on and he cries a little

1513
01:20:25.419 --> 01:20:28.549
bit and sometimes even for a massive man like

1514
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.334
that because people have expectations of him being really

1515
01:20:32.345 --> 01:20:36.234
an aggressive person, AAA tough man and stuff like

1516
01:20:36.245 --> 01:20:38.825
that. Sometimes people call him a cry baby and

1517
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.464
I'm like, really, I mean, come on, let just

1518
01:20:42.475 --> 01:20:45.575
the men cry if he feels like doing that,

1519
01:20:45.584 --> 01:20:47.725
right? I mean, what's the problem with that?

1520
01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.750
Absolutely. Um I mean, you uh h men are

1521
01:20:53.759 --> 01:20:56.180
human, women are human. This idea that men, they

1522
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:59.279
don't have the range of all the human capacities

1523
01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:02.089
uh in uh because of their gender is just

1524
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.169
a fallacy, right? I mean, if you have little

1525
01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.859
Children, a boy is gonna cry just as much

1526
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:07.939
as a little girl and in vice and one's

1527
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.750
gonna be tougher than the other. Um But we

1528
01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:14.379
do then becomes, you know, quickly we sort of

1529
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:17.569
take this human being and we make it into

1530
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.220
a gender person and there's so many kind of

1531
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:23.930
regulations about how to be a man or a

1532
01:21:23.939 --> 01:21:25.990
woman and a good man or a good woman

1533
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.419
or a do the dominant narrative of what a

1534
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:32.109
good man is. Um And that is like so

1535
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.810
narrow, right? You have to be strong all the

1536
01:21:34.819 --> 01:21:36.709
time. You don't get to have any kind of

1537
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:40.020
weakness. Like that's the number one like way of

1538
01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.839
thinking about the dominant way to be a man.

1539
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:45.470
And that's just, that's impossible. Like that is literally

1540
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:49.479
humanly impossible. You are gonna either stuff it down

1541
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:52.589
and then, you know, hurt yourself or other people,

1542
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:54.870
you know, or you're gonna like, or you have,

1543
01:21:54.879 --> 01:21:59.419
like, because that's just not how humans like operate.

1544
01:21:59.859 --> 01:22:02.870
Um And so feminism is like, really about just

1545
01:22:02.879 --> 01:22:04.939
kind of liberating men as well as women like

1546
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:07.009
this idea that men get to be all kinds

1547
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.299
of things. And in fact, one of the like

1548
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:11.569
the age thing, right, you'll get as older, the

1549
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.919
older men get, the more comfortable they are with

1550
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.910
a ra you know, if they mature, they get

1551
01:22:16.919 --> 01:22:19.540
more comfortable with the range of like being more

1552
01:22:19.549 --> 01:22:22.470
emotional or being, you know, so that, and they

1553
01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:24.470
don't see that as a sign of weakness, I

1554
01:22:24.479 --> 01:22:26.589
think we really need to kind of think about

1555
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.020
that. It would be amazing if we could argue

1556
01:22:29.029 --> 01:22:31.359
and make the point that like in order to

1557
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:34.649
actually be that vulnerable and to be that kind

1558
01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:38.430
of transparent and honest and open with people in

1559
01:22:38.439 --> 01:22:41.390
the world that he, that takes a lot of

1560
01:22:41.399 --> 01:22:44.529
strength, takes a lot of confidence, right? And so

1561
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.890
I think we really need that. This is a

1562
01:22:45.899 --> 01:22:47.490
me a moment of where we really need to

1563
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.259
think about like what is our definition of strength

1564
01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.910
and how does it not include actually experiencing joy

1565
01:22:54.919 --> 01:22:58.759
and sorrow and anger and love and all of

1566
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:02.200
the different kinds of human experiences that both men

1567
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:04.560
and women and humans of all kinds, you know,

1568
01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:08.080
have. Um, AND I think because sport is so

1569
01:23:08.089 --> 01:23:11.330
gendered and because we like link so much of

1570
01:23:11.339 --> 01:23:13.450
it to men being the best at all kinds

1571
01:23:13.459 --> 01:23:15.339
of sports because we, as we've talked about this

1572
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:18.600
whole session, um that, you know, men kind of

1573
01:23:18.609 --> 01:23:24.049
giving any sort of like having any give to

1574
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.069
that kind of like stoic strength kind of thing

1575
01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.779
is, you know, is, is sort of understood as

1576
01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:32.390
a weakness. And, you know, I don't think that's

1577
01:23:32.399 --> 01:23:34.810
true. I think that actually takes a lot of

1578
01:23:34.819 --> 01:23:38.990
strength and courage and confidence to, you know, to

1579
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.910
be your full self um in the world for

1580
01:23:41.919 --> 01:23:42.790
both men and women.

1581
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.560
Mhm I mean, on the confident uh uh thing

1582
01:23:47.569 --> 01:23:50.600
about it, I, I guess that people don't take

1583
01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:55.189
seriously enough how uh in many situations you really

1584
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.720
have to be confident to cry in front of

1585
01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:02.819
other people because you know how people, how most

1586
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.589
people will judge you. And you're basically saying, I

1587
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.359
don't even care about it. I mean, I feel

1588
01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:10.459
like crying so I'm going to cry and I

1589
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:12.399
don't give a crap about it.

1590
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:17.509
Exactly. A and amazing. Absolutely amazing.

1591
01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.479
So, uh let me ask you then and this

1592
01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:25.220
will be my final couple of questions. So since

1593
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:29.000
your book is also about uh exposing people to

1594
01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:34.069
some personal stories, some personal experiences, I want to

1595
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.990
ask you about your own personal experience as a

1596
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.870
weightlifter. So, uh what would you say are perhaps

1597
01:24:40.879 --> 01:24:45.160
some of the biggest challenges that you yourself experienced

1598
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:47.560
as a female weightlifter?

1599
01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:54.250
Um I, so um I think it's I have

1600
01:24:54.259 --> 01:24:56.720
been an athlete my whole life since I was

1601
01:24:56.729 --> 01:24:58.799
young and then in the middle of my life

1602
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:00.959
when I was at my prime, as they say,

1603
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.979
I had a back surgery and back injury. And

1604
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:06.439
so for about 10 years from like 16 to,

1605
01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:08.990
well, actually it was about like 16 years, 16

1606
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.160
to like 32. I didn't really do anything athletic

1607
01:25:13.169 --> 01:25:15.000
even though I was like state champion and really

1608
01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:17.350
fast and just did all kinds of sports as

1609
01:25:17.359 --> 01:25:20.100
a, as a child. Um, AND I had a,

1610
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:22.490
I had a feminist father. So my father brought

1611
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.370
me to the gym, um, as with my brother,

1612
01:25:25.379 --> 01:25:27.379
he encouraged me to lift weights, he encouraged me

1613
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:29.540
to climb the rope, he encouraged me to do

1614
01:25:29.549 --> 01:25:31.930
pull ups. Um, AND he had been an athlete

1615
01:25:31.939 --> 01:25:33.850
and he never thought that I couldn't do that

1616
01:25:33.859 --> 01:25:35.939
kind of stuff even though I was a girl.

1617
01:25:35.979 --> 01:25:39.540
Um, AND so, you know, I have always sort

1618
01:25:39.549 --> 01:25:41.560
of felt like I've been in my body. And

1619
01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.500
so I kind of always had that perspective too,

1620
01:25:43.509 --> 01:25:44.970
that someone is important to me who is a

1621
01:25:44.979 --> 01:25:48.339
man. Like my father didn't think of me any

1622
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:52.209
less as a female athlete. Um, BUT, you know,

1623
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.359
I now weightlift, I had, I started when I

1624
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:57.569
was 41 because it hasn't been a sport that

1625
01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.850
women have been able to participate in. Right. The

1626
01:25:59.859 --> 01:26:02.740
first women in the Olympics was 2000. And in

1627
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.200
the United States weightlifting isn't like our best sport

1628
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:06.970
isn't our dominant sport. And so it had to

1629
01:26:06.979 --> 01:26:09.750
be through crossfit that it became popular. So it

1630
01:26:09.759 --> 01:26:11.580
was only in like the 20 tens that it

1631
01:26:11.589 --> 01:26:14.930
even became something that was in gyms or something

1632
01:26:14.939 --> 01:26:17.040
that we would do. So part of it is

1633
01:26:17.049 --> 01:26:20.080
just like exposure to things and like, you know,

1634
01:26:20.089 --> 01:26:22.009
that I didn't as, as well as a biological

1635
01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.569
injury. Um And so thinking about like, so I

1636
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.109
had entered into a sport when you're at as,

1637
01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.560
as an old lady and that was something that,

1638
01:26:31.569 --> 01:26:33.180
you know, but I'm, I'm one of the best

1639
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:35.600
in my gym. I'm a world champion in my

1640
01:26:35.609 --> 01:26:37.850
age and weight class. I'm a national champion in

1641
01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.299
my age and weight class. I hold all of

1642
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:42.500
the American records in my age and weight class,

1643
01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:45.040
even though I started only four years ago. And

1644
01:26:45.049 --> 01:26:48.379
so I'm be there's like elements about like, even

1645
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:50.160
as an, I'm one of the oldest in my

1646
01:26:50.169 --> 01:26:52.169
gym and I lift the heaviest, one of the

1647
01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.600
heaviest. And I'm also one of the most meddled

1648
01:26:55.609 --> 01:26:58.129
as you would say. And I'm a woman and

1649
01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.180
I'm an old woman. And so that's like a

1650
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:03.200
really interesting place to be um in terms of

1651
01:27:03.209 --> 01:27:06.009
like younger men come in, there's like young, you

1652
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.200
know, man who I know who's 22 and he,

1653
01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.359
he is, you know, he like, still kind of

1654
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:14.160
thinks about the gym and weightlifting is a very

1655
01:27:14.169 --> 01:27:17.330
masculine space, but our best lifters are all women

1656
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.620
and I am sort of, they call me in

1657
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:22.899
the gym, the matriarch. Um BECAUSE the coach has

1658
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:26.140
kind of granted me this almost like a lioness,

1659
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:29.459
lioness role where like, I'm the oldest, even though

1660
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:31.459
I'm a woman, I'm in charge. And so I

1661
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:36.549
can tell men to do things that they would

1662
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.069
never hear from a woman. Um And so it's

1663
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.229
like kind of this interesting space where my coach

1664
01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.430
is a feminist as well. And so it's like

1665
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:45.609
in this sort, and I'm a professor. So I'm

1666
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.620
used to kind of, you know, talking to 20

1667
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:51.049
year olds, um and telling them what to do

1668
01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:54.140
or lecturing them. Um And so it's like this

1669
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.839
and I study it. So not only do I

1670
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.080
participate, but then I'm also doing, I have a,

1671
01:27:58.089 --> 01:28:00.509
you know, I did this whole research project on

1672
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.529
it. And so it's really interesting to kind of

1673
01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.290
think about these younger generation of, of both men

1674
01:28:05.299 --> 01:28:07.140
and women who are coming into sports who are

1675
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:09.910
just, you know, born in the two thousands, who

1676
01:28:09.919 --> 01:28:14.399
are, who are learning to respect women as maybe

1677
01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:17.450
their superiors in the gym who lift heavier than

1678
01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:20.740
them or who are like more metal than them.

1679
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.419
Um, AND so I think that, that my experience

1680
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.569
kind of coming into weightlifting late and being kind

1681
01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.120
of biologically good, even though I'm old and a

1682
01:28:29.129 --> 01:28:32.439
woman, um, I'm kind of built for this biologically

1683
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:34.560
is, you know, kind of in a unfair, in

1684
01:28:34.569 --> 01:28:38.220
an unfair sort of way. Um, AND I think

1685
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:39.899
that that's kind of, it really has sort of

1686
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:42.040
troubled me and made me think about these kinds

1687
01:28:42.049 --> 01:28:45.979
of things and how I have been able to

1688
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:47.899
do the sorts of things that I've been able

1689
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:49.979
to do because of the people I'm with have

1690
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:52.990
really have also been more inclusive, have taken a

1691
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.209
more feminist perspective. Um And really encourage, like, my

1692
01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.390
coach has mostly women athletes, um, and that weightlifting

1693
01:29:01.399 --> 01:29:03.319
because of crossfit is now something I get to

1694
01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:04.930
do where I didn't get, I didn't even, it,

1695
01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:07.379
there was never even, never on my radar or

1696
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.600
something. And if I had started doing it when

1697
01:29:09.609 --> 01:29:12.109
I like, started doing gymnastics at like five or

1698
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.479
six, you know, how, you know, like what could

1699
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.490
have happened, who knows? Those are, you know, that

1700
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.229
we never know those kinds of things. But, um,

1701
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.990
you know, we kind of thinking about like getting

1702
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.750
our younger women and now because of our title

1703
01:29:26.759 --> 01:29:30.169
nine and more capacities and this Caitlin Clark phenomenon

1704
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:34.500
and more inclusion and this idea that more girls

1705
01:29:34.509 --> 01:29:38.419
are participating and they're understanding themselves as they could

1706
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:41.200
be athletes. Um And so there's this whole wide

1707
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:44.299
opportunity and then at the same time because I

1708
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:48.029
studied crossfit and fitness, right. There's still this really

1709
01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:51.629
narrow realm of like what a fit woman looks

1710
01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.089
like and she doesn't want to get bulky, she

1711
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.109
wants to get toned and she's really trim and

1712
01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.379
she's on the elliptical, she's not lifting heavyweight, there's

1713
01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:00.490
some pushback against that, but really, that's sort of

1714
01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:04.379
still a lot of our media representation. And Ozempic

1715
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:07.459
is kind of also added to that um to

1716
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:09.950
that narrative. And so I think it's, it's, you

1717
01:30:09.959 --> 01:30:12.830
know, I'm constantly in conversation with it. Um Both

1718
01:30:12.839 --> 01:30:15.850
pushing boundaries as a weightlifter as well as like

1719
01:30:15.859 --> 01:30:17.919
and trying to break it down as a cultural

1720
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:20.379
anthropologist that, you know, we're not as advanced as

1721
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:22.810
we think we are because we still really police

1722
01:30:22.819 --> 01:30:26.390
men and women in sports um in very, very

1723
01:30:26.399 --> 01:30:27.350
narrow ways.

1724
01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:31.709
And uh what reactions do you tend to get

1725
01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:36.180
from people as a female weightlifter? I mean, particularly

1726
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:38.669
from men, but people in general,

1727
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:42.250
they will always want to compete with me. So

1728
01:30:42.259 --> 01:30:43.629
we'll be at the gym and I'll be lifting

1729
01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.859
if I go to a mainstream gym and not

1730
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:48.529
my weightlifting gym and I'll be lifting squatting or

1731
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.899
something heavy. Um And I can squat 100 and

1732
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.970
30 kg. Um BUT I'll be squatting maybe 100

1733
01:30:55.979 --> 01:30:58.669
kg for reps and I will have men kind

1734
01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.350
of get next to me and they'll try to

1735
01:31:00.359 --> 01:31:04.569
compete. Um, AND they have injured themselves, like every

1736
01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.649
single man who I have, who has wanted to

1737
01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:12.020
compete with me, who isn't train, who doesn't train

1738
01:31:12.029 --> 01:31:15.500
in, like, that sport has injured themselves where they

1739
01:31:15.509 --> 01:31:18.209
just pulled a hamstring or hurt their back. And

1740
01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.399
so it's just like their understanding that just because

1741
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:23.799
I'm a woman that they should be better than

1742
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:27.209
me, makes them compete with me because they're like,

1743
01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.060
oh, she's lifting kind of heavy and then they

1744
01:31:29.069 --> 01:31:32.560
earth hurt themselves. So, I, there's a lot of

1745
01:31:32.569 --> 01:31:35.330
men hurting themselves and they just shouldn't hurt themselves

1746
01:31:35.339 --> 01:31:37.029
if they really would think about that. They're just

1747
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.390
not going to necessarily be stronger than every woman

1748
01:31:39.399 --> 01:31:42.580
that they see. Um, SO it's, it's a lot

1749
01:31:42.589 --> 01:31:47.700
of like initial disrespect, um, and a lot of

1750
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:52.220
bro behavior and then they might also kind of

1751
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:56.020
think, 00, ok. Well, maybe not. Um, AND I

1752
01:31:56.029 --> 01:31:59.319
have seen more and more women lifting heavy and

1753
01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:01.060
I've seen more and more, I've been at regular

1754
01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:02.500
gyms where women will come up to me and

1755
01:32:02.509 --> 01:32:04.939
ask me for a spot even though they don't

1756
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:07.669
know me. Um, BECAUSE there's so there is this

1757
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.270
sort of female solidarity about, I see you, I

1758
01:32:11.279 --> 01:32:13.310
see you doing this thing that's usually a male

1759
01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:15.600
dominated thing and I'm gonna support you and I'm

1760
01:32:15.609 --> 01:32:17.279
gonna ask you for help and we're gonna support

1761
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:20.100
each other in this process and there's very rarely

1762
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:22.629
competition between those of us women who are doing

1763
01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.220
it. It's always the men who want to compete

1764
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:28.120
with us. And I really, really like that too.

1765
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:30.439
I really push back and I, and I encourage

1766
01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:32.029
it because then I like have to teach them

1767
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:38.209
a lesson in my class professor role. It's always,

1768
01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.259
there's always a lesson to be learned.

1769
01:32:42.299 --> 01:32:48.120
So the book is again, gender empowering, strength, sports,

1770
01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:52.600
strong as feminist. There it is. So uh I'm

1771
01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.729
leaving the link to it in the description box

1772
01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.790
of the interview and Katie, uh apart from the

1773
01:32:57.799 --> 01:33:00.080
book, would you like to tell people where they

1774

1775
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:06.049
Yeah. Um In addition to this book, I have
