00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.450
Hello everyone. Welcome back to a new episode of

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.559
The Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops,

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.890
and today I'm joined by a fellow YouTuber, Anna

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.479
Boke. She's been doing great videos on neo-liberalism and

5
00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.040
many aspects related to. Neo neoliberalism we're going to

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.280
talk about today. So Anna, welcome to the show.

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.079
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.680
Hi, thank you for having me. I'm really excited.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.479
It's like the first time I've ever been on

10
00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.000
someone else's show, so kind of excited about it.

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.229
Yeah, great. So let me start by asking you,

12
00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.080
I mean, because I, I've talked about this on

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.040
the channel with a few economists, but sometimes I

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.509
hear, and I've heard this also from uh liberal

15
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:57.400
people in Portugal, that neo-liberalism, the term doesn't mean

16
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.919
anything, it's just a vague term used by the

17
00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:04.550
left, uh, I mean. How would you define a

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.150
neoliberalism more characterize it?

19
00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:10.190
Yeah, I mean, it definitely like I've heard that

20
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.790
critique as well, um, about like it not existing

21
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.709
and just being invented by the left, but actually

22
00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.790
I do think, um, it's very much a thing

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.790
and obviously, um, more economically conservative people don't like

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.430
to be called out on it, um, because they

25
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.069
obviously say, no, our policy is like totally sensible

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.099
and. But, um, it it's just like the rebrand

27
00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.360
of like liberalism because I feel like not many

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.480
conservatives would say they're like economically like total liberals.

29
00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.980
Um, BUT essentially what neoliberalism is in the most

30
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.120
broken down sense, it's just like this political economic

31
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.129
project that does lean on like, um, These, um,

32
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:04.480
Tenets of liberalism, uh, like markets over states, but,

33
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.139
um, I feel like they go even like a

34
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.800
step further embedding it even more in culture and

35
00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.330
claiming that like human well-being comes from free markets,

36
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.940
private property and limited government intervention are important, but

37
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.309
also, um, Having like it being like less this

38
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.320
utopia of um freedom but more of a like

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.240
a project to like, restore elite class power by

40
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.440
like not only like being like, OK, free market

41
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.979
for everything, but also like there's people um that

42
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.460
profit a lot from government contracts and um while

43
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.639
all at the same time under like um like,

44
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.199
Call it or or like being all for these

45
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:55.250
um for these very, Liberal things like deregulation, privatization

46
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.029
and shrinking welfare, but at the same time, government

47
00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.179
spending has never been higher, just like, not for

48
00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:06.070
um welfare, but more for like, um, stuff that

49
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.610
serves some elites.

50
00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.160
Yeah, I mean, I always found it a bit

51
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.259
weird that some people make this claim that neoliberalism

52
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.259
just isn't a thing or it's something invented by

53
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:25.100
The left just to bash uh right wingers are

54
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.029
being just against capitalism in general because I mean,

55
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:34.539
the IMF itself uses the term neoliberalism and not

56
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.580
just that, but I think that, I mean just

57
00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:45.039
saying that neoliberalism favor favors deregulation, privatization, it is

58
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.475
against the welfare state, against. It, it undermines workers'

59
00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:52.434
rights, workers' unions, and stuff like that. I mean,

60
00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:55.794
I guess that's already defining the term,

61
00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:59.434
right? Yeah, 100%, especially like the IMF being one

62
00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:03.115
of the most neoliberal institutions there is. Um, IT

63
00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:05.434
is kind of telling that they even use the

64
00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:06.134
word.

65
00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:10.195
Yeah, so I, I mean, and this is something

66
00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:13.035
that you talk about in your, I, I think

67
00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:18.058
it's the latest video, um. Because you talk a

68
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:22.338
lot about Naomi Oreske's book, The Big Myth, what

69
00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:26.009
is the idea of market fundamentalism?

70
00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:28.699
Um, YES, I was very inspired by her book.

71
00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.898
It is, uh, and hers, and, um, uh, Michael

72
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.338
Conway, I think, yeah. Yeah,

73
00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.459
I never remember

74
00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:38.720
the name of the second book. I mean, she's

75
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720
like first on the book, but then like it's

76
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.880
also him, I think. So, um, but it's like

77
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000
written by both of them. But yeah, I feel

78
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.790
like um um I feel like neoliberalism and market

79
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.714
fundamentalism aren't exactly the same thing. Um, I feel

80
00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:58.445
like market fundamentalism like focuses just on the market

81
00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:03.755
aspect, um, that neoliberals claim that neoliberalism is. So

82
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:06.654
like as the market, it's like more of like

83
00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:10.584
comparable to like liberalism, um, as like having the

84
00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:14.385
market as like the all knowing God, um, having

85
00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:18.334
deregulation, privatization and like that the individual is like

86
00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.994
an entrepreneur that is responsible for his own successes

87
00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:28.299
and failures and. Um Yeah, I feel like. That

88
00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:31.260
is that those are like the big points of

89
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.859
like market fundamentalism, but I feel like that term

90
00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:38.059
disregards that like we have like these big government

91
00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.940
contracts, um, revolving door effects uh for leads and

92
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.559
stuff like that. So I feel like market fundamentalism

93
00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.859
is really, um, that myth that the market is

94
00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:56.609
infallible and almost mystically all knowing and um. Yeah,

95
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480
and it's used to like the legitimate like the

96
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.000
legitimize um government action for welfare, for example, like,

97
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.399
or like for when markets fail, like for example,

98
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.839
child labor, which obviously is a market failure or

99
00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.279
pollution and stuff like that, um, it is used

100
00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.880
to like kind of sweep it under the rug

101
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.760
and be like, oh no, the market knows what

102
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.200
it's doing, like that's just so it will resolve

103
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.079
itself, which obviously it doesn't.

104
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:24.600
It's just externalities, right?

105
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.859
Yeah, those are externalities definitely are like they're very

106
00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:34.500
negative externalities and markets fundamentalism says um that those

107
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.420
will resolve those will resolve themselves and it's not

108
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.540
going to be a problem long term.

109
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.260
Yeah, so I, I mean, but neoliberalism, how far

110
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.339
back would you go to place its origins? I

111
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:56.059
mean, because it, some people say that it developed

112
00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:02.750
mainly during the 1960s, 1970s, but then, I mean,

113
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.989
I guess we can go back a little bit

114
00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:09.809
more and talk about the work of Lud Ludwig

115
00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.950
von Mises and uh I, I mean people from

116
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.980
the Uh, Austrian school, but, uh, I mean, where

117
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.850
would you place its origins?

118
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.160
I would even like to go even further back.

119
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.339
I think, um, if we like start looking at

120
00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:29.440
like the first roots of it spreading in the

121
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.019
1920s, but, but before that there was like liberalism

122
00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:36.549
and um, but it's sort of like after the

123
00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:43.190
Great Depression, um, it kind of, yeah, like, Went

124
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.959
like or like it became unpopular, um to um

125
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.390
because like, John Maynard Keynes was like a big

126
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.399
person and um there was more government involvement to

127
00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.019
like, get the US government er or like the

128
00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:02.309
US as a country out of the Great Depression,

129
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.790
and um, I feel like, So after World War

130
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.589
I and in the 1920s, I feel like business

131
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:14.109
propaganda started evolving. Like there were like these think

132
00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:18.309
tanks that formed by very big industrialists, um, like

133
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:21.940
the National Association of Manufacturers or the National Electric

134
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.429
Lights Association. Um, WHICH actually worked fun even earlier,

135
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.549
but back then they were like for government involvement

136
00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:32.469
in the marketplace, like they were like for protectionism,

137
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.789
uh, building the Panama Canal and stuff like that.

138
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:41.429
But, um, yeah, after like the whole, um, New

139
00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.989
Deal, uh, became a thing, um, they kind of,

140
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:49.380
Yeah, they kind of just, uh, started fearing for,

141
00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:54.440
um, their profits. So, uh, they like these big

142
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.799
industrialists came together at these think tanks and started

143
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:03.200
investing insane amount of money into like propaganda to

144
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.099
stop government involvement in the marketplace, to stop, um,

145
00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:12.150
The formation of unions to stop the strengthening of

146
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.940
the welfare state, um, because that was obviously eating

147
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.799
into their profits.

148
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.520
Yeah, it's really interesting to contrast, I don't know

149
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.919
if you read this book by the economist Clara

150
00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:27.280
Mattei, The Capital Order, because she makes a connection

151
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.580
there between uh liberal policies like austerity measures and

152
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.200
the rise of fascism in Italy, for example, and

153
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.289
it's really interesting to contrast what happened in the

154
00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:43.679
US with FDR and the New Deal, uh, how

155
00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:49.215
they dealt with things. There in terms of creating

156
00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:53.034
social security, for example, and how they dealt with

157
00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:57.775
things in Italy which created even more social uprising

158
00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:03.114
and led to people favoring the rise of fascism.

159
00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:06.400
I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with

160
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.500
that part of history or

161
00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:13.559
I'm not particularly like familiar with like um Italian

162
00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:17.599
history to be completely honest, um, I need to

163
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:20.239
definitely like read more on that, um, I would

164
00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:25.280
feel like, um. It does. I feel like we're

165
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.150
seeing it now in the US like, um. The

166
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.590
rise of like, but like not in response to

167
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.450
like the strengthening of uh government policies for workers,

168
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:41.780
but like, In response to the opposite actually, um,

169
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.820
but yeah, no, feel free to educate me on

170
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.809
what happened in Italy because I have not read

171
00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:46.359
that book.

172
00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:48.859
Uh, I, I mean, I, I of course I

173
00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:51.599
will not get into details here because I have

174
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.780
done that interview with Clara Matte back in late

175
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.565
2022 and there are many things. That I don't

176
00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:00.604
remember anymore, but I mean it's, she basically makes

177
00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:06.395
an argument as to how back in the 1920s

178
00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:10.965
and after the Great Depression in Italy, for example,

179
00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:14.625
she also talks about England, but in Italy particularly

180
00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:19.565
uh because they applied austerity measures. I mean, things

181
00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:23.640
got even worse for the average person. And then

182
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.679
I mean as we've seen as we have been

183
00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:30.479
seeing across Europe and even in the US as

184
00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:35.559
well, I mean, uh with uh austerity measures after

185
00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:39.900
the 2008 economic crisis, whenever that happens it seems

186
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.780
that people, uh, the average voter tends to. For

187
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.770
like authoritarian leaders, particularly from the right, and so

188
00:11:50.989 --> 00:11:57.390
she establishes that link between favoring liberal policies in

189
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.909
that particular case, austerity measures and the rise of

190
00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:05.099
fascism, and I mean I was mentioning that just

191
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.880
to try to establish. A contrast between what happened

192
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.559
in the US with FDR's policies versus what happened

193
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.719
uh in Italy and in other countries in Europe

194
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:23.659
after the Great Depression in terms of how people

195
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:27.479
of how you can deal with the same issue.

196
00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:32.400
Uh, WITH, uh, through different kinds of, uh, policies

197
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.250
that lead to different results because we hear frequently

198
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.960
from, uh, neoliberals that, uh, I mean, the best

199
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.479
way or even the only way as we've seen

200
00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:47.080
after the 2008 economic crisis to deal with a

201
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.599
crisis like that is to apply, uh, uh, austerity

202
00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:55.440
measures and I mean that's not the only alternative

203
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.520
out there, I guess.

204
00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:00.109
Yeah, 100%, um, but I feel like it's not

205
00:13:00.109 --> 00:13:01.869
even that much of a contrast. I mean, like,

206
00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:04.869
was it like, I feel like we're seeing. In

207
00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:09.950
every case, when we apply austerity and like um,

208
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.000
take away workers' rights and the the means for

209
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.859
workers to just like have, That have like a

210
00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:24.239
a nice life or just like a livable, have

211
00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:28.000
a livable wage. Um, IF we take that away,

212
00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:30.479
fascism rises like we're seeing it in the US

213
00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:32.739
now, we're seeing it in the UK, we're seeing

214
00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:36.159
it in Germany, we're seeing it everywhere. Um, BASICALLY

215
00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:39.340
everywhere this is happening, um, instead of just like,

216
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.039
uh, we're like. Yeah, we're creating more and more

217
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:47.940
wealth inequality and we're seeing the rise of fascism

218
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.599
or like right wing policies or just like blaming.

219
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.950
Marginalized groups like immigrants, like, um, that is what

220
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:02.070
is rising, um, if we like keep, taking money

221
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.229
away from workers and um instead of just like

222
00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:06.809
taxing billionaires.

223
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.820
Yeah, we'll get, we'll get into taxing billionaires later.

224
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:15.200
But I mean, another interesting thing is that how

225
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.280
the US economy boomed during the 50s and 60s

226
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.979
with very high marginal tax rates. I mean, I

227
00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:26.380
think if I remember correctly, I think it was

228
00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:33.669
over 300,000 or $400,000. I mean, People would be

229
00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:38.090
taxed at a 90% tax rate. So I mean

230
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.809
for people who think that taxing the rich doesn't

231
00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:47.580
work and it doesn't lead to economic growth, that's

232
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.909
a very good example of the opposite,

233
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.809
right? 100%, 100%. It just proves that high taxes

234
00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.929
didn't kill capitalism because I feel like that is

235
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:59.830
always the argument. Um, HIGH taxes will kill capitalism

236
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.390
and everyone will be super unmotivated and nothing will

237
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.909
work anymore. Uh, BUT that's not true. In the

238
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:08.469
50s and 60s, business still um boomed. And but

239
00:15:08.469 --> 00:15:11.390
the good thing was that people could afford housing

240
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.549
and um even though taxes on the rich were

241
00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:17.429
like 90%, um, we did have high growth. We

242
00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:21.659
had strong unions and all of that. Um, BUT

243
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:24.859
yeah, but then like, obviously like big industrialists didn't

244
00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.539
want to pay 90% taxes, so they started all

245
00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:30.580
these propaganda channels and um, yeah.

246
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:33.539
Yeah, yeah, I'm, I was just going to ask

247
00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:36.179
you about propaganda, but just before let, let me,

248
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.179
let me just make this comment and then you

249
00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:40.179
can comment on it. I mean, it's very interesting

250
00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:45.580
how we frequently hear from, uh, capitalists, particularly, and

251
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.940
also, I mean, not just the neoliberals, but particularly

252
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.000
the neo. Liberals and here in Portugal we have

253
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.950
a neo-liberal party, the Liberal Initiative, and they make

254
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.200
the same sort of arguments about how if you

255
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.280
just let the market uh the uh the uh

256
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.340
the market without any kind of regulation. Work itself

257
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:15.460
out. I mean, uh, wages will rise, uh, workers'

258
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.659
rights will magically appear. I mean, it's a very

259
00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:23.739
interesting narrative because if you look back in history,

260
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.929
the fact is that workers since. The very dawn

261
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:35.000
of capitalism and the industrialization had to organize themselves

262
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and fight for every single right that they were

263
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.640
able to get and force the government to create

264
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.039
labor rights, right, because otherwise they wouldn't have got

265
00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:47.200
them.

266
00:16:47.869 --> 00:16:50.710
Yeah, 100%. Like labor rights were fought for by

267
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.190
unions and there were, there were like strikes. There

268
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.469
were fierce fights for the rights we have today,

269
00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.030
like the 40 hour work week. It just happened

270
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.549
because like unions fought for it. It's not just

271
00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:03.780
like that. It appeared out of thin air because

272
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.530
I feel like a lot of like um anti-regulation

273
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.348
advocates will be like, oh no, Ford were introduced.

274
00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:13.667
That just because he saw workers would be more

275
00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:19.188
profitable, but like, um, I mean, all of workers'

276
00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:22.098
rights were fought for by unions and Ford was

277
00:17:22.098 --> 00:17:25.628
like brutal against unions. Like he's like praised at

278
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.509
this as this like, oh yeah, he like, um,

279
00:17:28.629 --> 00:17:31.318
helped the workers even though he didn't have to,

280
00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:33.909
um, just like for profit, but that's actually not

281
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:35.109
the case historically.

282
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.270
Yeah, which is also very interesting because we also

283
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:44.550
hear very frequently that whenever someone accepts a new

284
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.810
job, whenever someone is hired, I mean, they have

285
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.949
the same power of negotiation that the boss has

286
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:59.310
that that that basically the owners of the company

287
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.020
have, but that's not. Actually true, I mean, because

288
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.640
we're talking about one single individual against one entire

289
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:14.160
corporation and that's why workers have actually to organize

290
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:20.380
to demand or to demand pay raises and rights

291
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.239
and so on,

292
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.810
100%, especially because like I mean. The leverage which

293
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.430
a corporation or like an employer has over an

294
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.709
employee is basically their whole livelihood, like their ability

295
00:18:32.709 --> 00:18:34.469
to pay rent and not live on the street

296
00:18:34.469 --> 00:18:36.829
and like feed their family. So that's like a

297
00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:41.069
huge leverage compared to, oh, if I quit, then

298
00:18:41.229 --> 00:18:43.829
I don't know, my coworker will have to do

299
00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:46.229
a little bit more work. I mean, that's the

300
00:18:46.229 --> 00:18:50.130
leverage you have over the company, realistically. And, um,

301
00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:53.949
Yeah, the company will survive regardless. If you survive

302
00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:56.449
regardless, that's, that's the big question.

303
00:18:58.189 --> 00:19:01.390
Yeah, OK, so let's get into propaganda then, and

304
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.630
an interesting aspect of neoliberalism is that it just

305
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.550
doesn't try to convince people on the basis of

306
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.969
the merits of its arguments. I mean, throughout history,

307
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:20.500
it's been pushed, pushed through newspapers, even the education

308
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.829
system, TV programs, and other kinds of different propaganda

309
00:19:25.829 --> 00:19:26.989
mediums, right?

310
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.040
100%, so, um, I don't think like that, um,

311
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.989
neoliberalism like is the best idea and I feel

312
00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:40.069
like for a long time academics and so, didn't

313
00:19:40.069 --> 00:19:42.930
think that either, but um it was just like,

314
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.670
Framed as an actual viable theory by um those

315
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.770
big think tanks we're talking about from the National

316
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.719
Association, National Association of Manufacturers to the National Electric

317
00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:59.199
Lights Association to the Liberty League, Um, they all

318
00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.959
like spent massive amounts of money to push this

319
00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:07.160
ideology into schools. They like rewrote school books, they

320
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.920
pushed it onto TV, um, they pushed it into

321
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.859
even churches and Hollywood just with money, but, and

322
00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:18.020
I mean it's no coincidence that up until today,

323
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.319
um, The richest people in the world all own

324
00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:28.520
media companies, so Mark Zuckerberg owns Meta, Elon Musk

325
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:34.239
owns Twitter, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Murdoch

326
00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:40.739
owns everything basically. So it is um. It is

327
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.420
really important, I feel like, to look at who

328
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:48.040
owns the media and who shapes the narrative and

329
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.130
If we look at who. Ended up shaping the

330
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.660
narrative. It is definitely the money that was poured

331
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:02.060
into by into, um, media, Hollywood, TV, churches, and

332
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.339
even schools by, um, corporate interests and like that

333
00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:08.520
framed it as the American way.

334
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.939
Wait a minute, have you just said that X

335
00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:17.500
slash Twitter is a media company? I thought it

336
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.560
was just a far right cesspool, no.

337
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.310
Very true, but it has become that because, um,

338
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.829
essentially, I mean, I mean, Twitter has changed quite

339
00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:32.430
a bit since Elon took it over.

340
00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:35.619
So just just a bit, just a bit. Yeah,

341
00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:40.910
just a bit. Um, BUT yeah, I mean. It

342
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.609
is what it is, and um. Yeah, right wing

343
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:48.989
or like not even right wing, but like economically

344
00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:52.729
conservative people have historically just been very, very good

345
00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:56.000
at shaping the narrative. Also because shaping the narrative

346
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.729
costs money, like making educational videos costs money. I

347
00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:02.719
mean, you know that. I know that running a

348
00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:06.489
YouTube channel costs time and money. Um, RUNNING a

349
00:22:06.489 --> 00:22:09.410
newspaper probably costs a little way, way more time

350
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.609
and money, um, or. Um, ANYTHING you need to

351
00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:16.540
do. And most people are just like busy, um,

352
00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:19.650
having to like work a normal job and don't

353
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.430
really have time or energy or money to spend

354
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.540
on shaping the narrative. Um, SO the people who

355
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:31.250
get to shape the narrative are mostly people who

356
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.810
already have the means. And usually if you have

357
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.750
the means and don't have to like spend your

358
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.810
time pursuing a normal job where you put work

359
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.939
in. Um, Yeah, you usually employ people to do

360
00:22:45.939 --> 00:22:49.520
that for you and, um, can spend the time

361
00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:55.920
shaping the narrative. So, um. That's only possible if

362
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.119
you exploit people a little bit, but, um, yeah.

363
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:07.280
So obviously people like who like who are who

364
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.290
own businesses have been more able to do that

365
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.089
than just like normal workers.

366
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:17.630
Yeah, tell us about this fellow named Edward L.

367
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:22.030
Bernays and uh his ideas about propaganda because he,

368
00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:25.550
he, he seemed like a very interesting guy who

369
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:32.130
had a very low opinion of the general public's

370
00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:33.969
intelligence, I guess.

371
00:23:35.449 --> 00:23:38.079
Yeah, I, I, I, I wouldn't even say it,

372
00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:40.280
put it that way. I feel like he was

373
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:47.069
actually quite even very smart at um. Reading the

374
00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:51.390
um general population or at least how to like

375
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.020
shape their views and how to shape the narrative,

376
00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:59.510
and I wouldn't necessarily even say that like he

377
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.819
was one of like, The people who came up

378
00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:07.459
with this ideology, but he was like more of

379
00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:10.140
like the father of propaganda, and he would use

380
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.599
it for like whoever would pay him the most.

381
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.579
Um, SO basically he was employed by big cigarette

382
00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:21.140
companies who obviously had a lot of money to

383
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.619
spend on propaganda, so he helped them frame cigarettes

384
00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:30.140
as women's liberation, as tortures of freedom. Um, AND

385
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.709
in politics, he got like hired by the National

386
00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:39.790
Electric Lights Association to, um, help shape the narrative

387
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:45.189
that the American way and, um, low taxes for

388
00:24:45.189 --> 00:24:49.050
corporations is in the best interest for everyone because,

389
00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:54.349
um, growth will just trickle down. And, um, so

390
00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:57.530
yeah, he, um, I feel like whoever paid him

391
00:24:58.069 --> 00:25:02.030
would. We'll get his help or like we'll, yeah,

392
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.380
we'll be able to buy his services um and.

393
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.650
Yeah, he helped a lot of, like, a lot

394
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.130
of companies to like push a narrative that is

395
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.229
in many cases untrue, but also had very devastating

396
00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:18.630
effects. For example, like in Guatemala, he was hired

397
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.709
by the United Fruit Company, which is the banana

398
00:25:21.709 --> 00:25:24.910
company Chiquita, which we all know. I don't know,

399
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.989
are there Chiquita bananas in

400
00:25:26.989 --> 00:25:28.939
Portugal? Yes, there are.

401
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:35.369
Yeah, same here. So, um. They're everywhere and uh

402
00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:41.000
United Fruit Company had this big, um, had huge

403
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.729
banana plantations in Guatemala and was basically exploiting the

404
00:25:45.729 --> 00:25:50.209
Guatemalan population and this American company wanted to obviously

405
00:25:50.209 --> 00:25:54.250
continue exploiting the Guatemalan people who then eventually like

406
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:59.680
elected a Democratic socialist government and who were like,

407
00:25:59.719 --> 00:26:02.180
oh no, we're gonna like enforce labor laws now

408
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.439
and um, we're not gonna let this American company

409
00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:10.290
exploit our workers anymore. And essentially what United Fruit

410
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.780
then did was hire Eduard Bernays, who shaped this

411
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.310
narrative before Congress and before the American people that

412
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.810
Guatemala was a communist dictatorship now and a threat

413
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.589
and that it needed to be invaded by the

414
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:29.709
CIA. So yeah, the CIA planned a coup and

415
00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:33.719
Guatemala was invaded and the government was overthrown. And

416
00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:37.180
it plunged the country into decades of violence and

417
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:43.800
um, so yeah, definitely devastating um consequences, all in

418
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.290
the name to protect United Fruit's profits. Yeah.

419
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.410
Uh, uh, YEAH, yeah, I mean, the US has

420
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.310
a very rich history of invading or supporting coups

421
00:26:57.729 --> 00:27:02.770
or, um, putting, uh, putting on economic embargoes on

422
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:09.290
countries that are more socialistic than they like and

423
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:15.025
then saying that socialism never works, but. When it's

424
00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:21.744
to support their neoliberal ideology, they are willing to

425
00:27:21.744 --> 00:27:27.375
give a lifeline to uh Ravier Mille in Argentina

426
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:33.665
because socialism never works, but of course neoliberal capitalism

427
00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:38.545
or even libertarianism always works, right.

428
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:44.280
100%, 100%. Um, IT is, uh, it's pretty insane

429
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.030
how many countries they've invaded, um, in their backyard,

430
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:54.050
um, Latin America, uh, which is absolutely brutal. Also

431
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.859
how, how like I feel like. Sometimes even like

432
00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:02.699
they have like this hatred towards like Latin America

433
00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:05.140
if they decide to like do their own thing

434
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.020
or for example, like, um, yeah, back in the

435
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.920
70s, Chile was invaded. They invaded like Nicaragua, El

436
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.819
Salvador, like literally so many countries were cooped by

437
00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:20.619
the US and I feel like even now how

438
00:28:20.619 --> 00:28:24.630
they've shaped this narrative about like, Latin Americans or

439
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.109
like Mexicans wanting to go into the US. This

440
00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:31.500
is obviously a bit off topic, but like, um,

441
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:35.709
calling them the immigrants, while they're like the Europeans

442
00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:40.189
that like colonize the US are the original immigrants.

443
00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:43.869
That's kind of wild how like in a few

444
00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:47.410
100 years they've like managed to shape this narrative

445
00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:52.400
and um. And yeah, also asserted this right to

446
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.839
intervene in other countries' economies economies and, um, push

447
00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:00.400
this libertarian or neoliberal agenda.

448
00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:04.839
Yeah, I mean, it's just very interesting. I, I

449
00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:08.000
mean, I guess that uh that also plays into

450
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.640
what I was saying earlier when I mentioned Italian

451
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:18.479
fascism because very interestingly, Uh, even though the US

452
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.869
calls itself the, for example, when they invade countries

453
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:26.270
in the Middle East, freedom fighters, they tend to

454
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:32.800
be very big fans of right-wing dictators like Nohe

455
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.339
in Chile and other people like that, right? So

456
00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:42.920
it's, it's a very interesting way of approaching international

457
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.670
politics.

458
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.819
100% and uh very worrying as well, like, um,

459
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.500
yeah, how Allende was overthrown by Pinochet just uh

460
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.500
by the year or like by uh supported coup

461
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.469
by uh. And then Pinochet was put in power.

462
00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:04.709
Um, IT is actually very scary that the US

463
00:30:04.709 --> 00:30:07.969
can just meddle that much.

464
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.510
Yeah, I, I guess if you haven't watched, you

465
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.910
should watch a video that's on YouTube from the

466
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.910
university. I want to say Cambridge. I'm not sure

467
00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.589
if it was Oxford, but I think it was

468
00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:26.949
Cambridge. Uh, THERE'S a student there who actually debated

469
00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:31.180
Charlie Kirk a few months ago, and she put,

470
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.119
uh, the title of the video is something like

471
00:30:34.119 --> 00:30:40.550
this house supports the decline of America. So I,

472
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.920
I think you should watch that check it out.

473
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.469
Yeah, I think that the name of the, uh,

474
00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:51.109
girl is Tilly Middlehurst or something like that. So,

475
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.030
but yeah, you should definitely watch that because it's

476
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.719
a very interesting argument that she makes there. So,

477
00:30:58.069 --> 00:30:59.989
I mean, uh, I, this is something that I

478
00:30:59.989 --> 00:31:05.079
also talked about with Naomi Oreskes two years ago.

479
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.035
This tripod of Rhythm or what she calls in

480
00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:11.244
the book the tripod of rhythm. I mean it's

481
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:14.925
a very interesting thing because when you start looking

482
00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:19.285
at it, it sounds fine. I mean representative democracy,

483
00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:23.744
why not civil and religious liberty, yeah, fine, but

484
00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:29.685
then free enterprise, I mean free enterprise is supposedly

485
00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:36.165
one of the three main tenets of American freedom.

486
00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:36.609
Right.

487
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.880
Yeah, I feel like that's like they like um

488
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.839
in or like the National Association of Manufacturers like

489
00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:46.670
invented this job for freedom as the centerpiece um

490
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.589
of their propaganda. Um, AND it basically is like

491
00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:54.099
fabricated history. They kind of, I mean, obviously the,

492
00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:59.469
um, Constitution in America features, um, democracy and freedom

493
00:31:59.469 --> 00:32:02.910
of or like civil and religious liberty, but they

494
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.310
then they just like snuck in the free enterprise,

495
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.310
which is kind of hilarious, pretending that's what the

496
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.390
founding fathers wanted, um, which obviously is totally wrong.

497
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:18.510
They never really mentioned free enterprise and um. Yeah,

498
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.359
it's just a funny tool they invented, but that

499
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:25.619
really caught on because they literally like they spent

500
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:32.040
millions on a billboard campaign framing these three things

501
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.160
as the American way, and a lot of people

502
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.800
ended up believing it, that free enterprise is the

503
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.979
American way, which obviously it kind of isn't.

504
00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:44.510
I, I mean, I guess that uh uh the

505
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.270
American right also loves to bring to the table

506
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.790
the founding fathers whenever they want to do some

507
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:56.939
revisionist history about what they supposedly supported, and they

508
00:32:56.939 --> 00:33:00.829
do the same with some historical economists like Adam

509
00:33:00.829 --> 00:33:06.270
Smith who actually together with Marx was very much

510
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:13.010
against the. REINDEERS or the reindeer class, but, but

511
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.810
they, they actually try to sort of whitewash what

512
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.130
Adam Smith said to make it a little bit

513
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.890
more neoliberal. So yeah,

514
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.109
they totally like cherry pick Adam Smith. It's like

515
00:33:26.109 --> 00:33:29.810
wild. So they basically turned Adam Smith into like

516
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.599
this free market cheerleader. Um, AND like, I mean,

517
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.119
if you actually read The Wealth of Nations, um,

518
00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:41.489
there's so many parts that are about like, um,

519
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:49.589
banking regulation, um, about, um, Monopolies about living wages

520
00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:53.790
and um, for example, Amar T Yen, um, he's

521
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.589
uh he's quoted, uh, Adam Smith as actually being

522
00:33:57.589 --> 00:33:59.750
a friend of the poor, because like if you

523
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.790
read Adam Smith uh like the Wealth of the

524
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.670
Nation, which I actually did go through a lot

525
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.550
of like, uh, this book, and he really is

526
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.030
a friend of the poor, they are like passages

527
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.790
in there that are like, um, very worker friendly,

528
00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:18.530
very, um, very about like, Workers definitely deserve to

529
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.168
have a fair share of their work. Um, WE

530
00:34:22.168 --> 00:34:27.590
need to like adequately house, clothe and uh feed

531
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.889
everyone because no society can flourish, to actually quote

532
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:37.929
him, um, in a way like uh workers are

533
00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:43.388
treated poorly. Um. So yeah, but neoliberals and libertarians

534
00:34:43.388 --> 00:34:47.908
obviously like to cherry pick Adam Smith and um.

535
00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:54.349
Yeah, they basically totally ignore Smith's warnings on monopolies

536
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:57.398
and everything that is that might be not as

537
00:34:57.398 --> 00:35:00.448
libertarian or liberal.

538
00:35:01.128 --> 00:35:04.829
I mean, look, Anna, they would definitely say that

539
00:35:04.908 --> 00:35:10.590
your Economic diet is very unbalanced because you're definitely

540
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:16.389
a radical lefty who just reads uh Marx and

541
00:35:16.389 --> 00:35:19.110
people like that. I mean, you definitely need more

542
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:24.510
of von Mises, Hayek, Friedman, and even a little

543
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:28.520
bit of, of Thomas Sowell in your diet because

544
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:33.879
uh I mean, otherwise you're just. Very biased, right.

545
00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:34.500
Yeah,

546
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.250
the funny thing is that I haven't even read

547
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.129
Marx, to be honest, also because it's really long,

548
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.820
so I'm like, hm yeah, thanks but no thanks,

549
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.060
but I feel like just reading Adam Smith is

550
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.860
enough to like kind of support left wing politics

551
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.179
if you actually read him carefully and not for

552
00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:54.620
example like George Stigler's edited version because that's what

553
00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:00.159
happened, that like um corporate think tanks um. Decided

554
00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:05.639
to fund, um, economists at the Chicago school, um,

555
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.179
so Chicago University, and they funded George Stigler and

556
00:36:09.179 --> 00:36:13.360
Mises and Hayek to write these books, um, and

557
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.800
in the case of George Stigler, um, basically editing

558
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.479
Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nation into like some

559
00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:26.399
sort of like, Free market, um, bible, but yeah,

560
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.969
by the, by the way, just before we get

561
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:34.679
into the um. What happened after the so-called post-war

562
00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:40.000
consensus and the rise of neoliberal capitalism. Uh, LET'S

563
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.159
talk a little bit about, uh, Keynesianism. I mean,

564
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.199
uh, in your understanding, why do you think that

565
00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:52.840
Keynesianism was so popular after World War II and

566
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.159
there was this sort of post-war consensus around it?

567
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.790
Well, because like it obviously pulled, um, the American

568
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.310
economy and like general economy out of the Great

569
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.989
Depression, which, um, just like liberate like Hoover, which

570
00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:13.709
was like the president, um, before FDR had obviously

571
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:15.830
failed to do because he was quite a market

572
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.709
fundamentalist and was like, oh, the free market, we'll

573
00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:21.229
just sort it out. Obviously it didn't. And, um,

574
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.979
then FDR was super beloved, um, he was re-elected

575
00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:29.159
many times and um. And just proved that like

576
00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:33.179
state intervention stabilized these boom and bust business cycles.

577
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.070
Um, ALSO, people could afford houses in the 50s,

578
00:37:37.399 --> 00:37:41.399
so normal workers could completely afford to buy a

579
00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:44.489
house after working for two or three years. Um,

580
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.389
AND afford the down payment, which looking at today's

581
00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:51.989
economy is just not possible in my generation. Almost

582
00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:56.669
no one buys a house. Um, SO unless they

583
00:37:56.669 --> 00:37:58.679
it's the same here, I have to

584
00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:01.229
tell you, yeah, unless they inherit money from their

585
00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:04.310
parents. So, um, I mean, there's obviously a couple

586
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.510
of exceptions, um, those people working in banking or

587
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.729
stuff like that, but as like a normal nurse.

588
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.020
You or teacher or just like a normal job,

589
00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:15.560
you can't really afford a house. But back then,

590
00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:18.290
that was not the case. Back then, nurses, teachers,

591
00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:25.139
postmen could afford houses, which obviously, um, proves the

592
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:29.850
success of Keynesianism and the post-war consensus and, um,

593
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.520
also because government made it possible. For example, in,

594
00:38:32.699 --> 00:38:38.820
uh, the UK, um, people were supported to, um.

595
00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:43.050
Buy uh houses, they could like buy these cheap,

596
00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:47.669
um, what were they called again, um. In London,

597
00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:52.909
these. Of the, of the, in the bor, I

598
00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:54.429
don't remember the exact word, but

599
00:38:54.429 --> 00:38:57.750
they but but there, there was more social housing

600
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.070
in the UK in

601
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.429
the and people wanted to buy these social houses,

602
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.120
so um. Yeah, the council houses, that's the name.

603
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:11.949
Yeah, um, so they would buy, um, these up,

604
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:16.659
um. And yeah, that that that was killed by

605
00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:17.290
Thatcher.

606
00:39:17.909 --> 00:39:21.209
Uh I, I mean, I guess, I guess that

607
00:39:21.209 --> 00:39:25.120
the only time you hear right wing people uh

608
00:39:25.899 --> 00:39:31.250
talking good about the 50s is when they say

609
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.489
or they claim that women have better lives in

610
00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:39.129
the 50s because I, I, I, I mean, of

611
00:39:39.129 --> 00:39:45.149
course, of course. Uh, WHEN they were at home

612
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.149
and when there were no laws against marital rape

613
00:39:50.149 --> 00:39:53.449
and when they couldn't have their own credit card

614
00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:56.770
and when they couldn't go to university, of course,

615
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.129
just because they were their only purpose was to

616
00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:06.209
have children and raise them and take care of

617
00:40:06.209 --> 00:40:09.790
their husbands, uh, they were happier, of course.

618
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.139
Yeah, I mean, I feel like that is like

619
00:40:12.139 --> 00:40:15.340
a really interesting actually point to talk about because

620
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.850
um, Back then it was possible for a family

621
00:40:20.229 --> 00:40:24.389
to survive on a single income. And now obviously

622
00:40:24.389 --> 00:40:27.229
like there's still a lot of housework or like

623
00:40:27.229 --> 00:40:30.139
household chores, uh, is still being done by women,

624
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.250
only that women now also work full time. So

625
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.489
one does have to say it is a lot

626
00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:38.610
more stressful, um, because you just like need to

627
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.870
um. Incomes and I feel like what conservatives like

628
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.790
to simplify this argument by like being like, oh

629
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.350
yeah, women had better back then because they didn't

630
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.909
have to like hold a job and like all

631
00:40:50.909 --> 00:40:52.110
they had to do is like take care of

632
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:56.040
the kids, disregarding obviously all of the facts that

633
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.429
women have no rights and stuff like that. And

634
00:40:58.429 --> 00:41:02.669
obviously it was more chill as a whole family

635
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:04.590
to be able to survive on a single income.

636
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.270
Um, BECAUSE obviously household chores do take up a

637
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.280
lot of time, like, um, I'm single, I have

638
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.110
to make money. I have to kind of like

639
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.070
make my own laundry, I have to like do

640
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.989
everything and I don't even have kids. Um, SO

641
00:41:18.989 --> 00:41:21.550
just having like a second person around to take

642
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.909
care of all of the housework would be fucking

643
00:41:23.909 --> 00:41:28.479
amazing. Um, OR also if I didn't have to

644
00:41:28.479 --> 00:41:31.510
make money and just like, um, take care of

645
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:36.330
the house. In, in a world like I think

646
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.969
that could be chill, but, um, obviously I still

647
00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:43.750
want all the rights, um, that, um, women have

648
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.550
in. Uh, THE 21st century and um I feel

649
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:53.409
like conservatives like to conflate, um, this women had

650
00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:55.389
it better back then because they didn't have to

651
00:41:55.389 --> 00:42:00.790
work, um. Yeah, with just like the economic reality

652
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.489
of like women today have to do both, kind

653
00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:03.870
of.

654
00:42:04.979 --> 00:42:07.560
Yeah, I, I, I guess we can go back

655
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.239
to that when we talk about your first video

656
00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:15.080
on neoliberalism, but I mean, what happened then in

657
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.560
the 70s because the 70s was a very interesting

658
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.040
period in terms of the developments, the political and

659
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.479
economic developments that happened there because suddenly, the, I

660
00:42:27.479 --> 00:42:32.780
mean Keynesianism was not, was no longer a consensual

661
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.540
and then there was the rise of Uh, very

662
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.689
nice political figures like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher,

663
00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:44.610
and I mean, people that we all love, right?

664
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.459
So, uh, I mean, what happened then?

665
00:42:48.229 --> 00:42:50.669
Yeah, I mean, I feel like all of the

666
00:42:50.669 --> 00:42:56.949
propaganda before opened the door for neoliberal alternatives, but

667
00:42:56.949 --> 00:43:01.959
one does have to say that um. It took

668
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.780
two big economic shocks or like um problems um

669
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.580
that um essentially really opened the door for these

670
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.020
neoliberal alternatives and the people that were groomed to

671
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.719
take over them like Thatcher and Reagan. Um, ONE

672
00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:23.239
is like stagflation, which was like high inflation plus

673
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:29.629
high unemployment, um, while also having a stagnating, uh,

674
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.520
like stagnating economic growth. Um, SO that was obviously

675
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.260
bad. And um that happened because of, for example,

676
00:43:37.379 --> 00:43:40.810
the oil shocks in the Middle East, um, the

677
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:45.060
fiscal crisis of the state, and, um, that kind

678
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.860
of opened the door for, um, for, yeah, economically

679
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.715
right wing people to be like, We told you

680
00:43:51.715 --> 00:43:54.395
all along this doesn't work. Here's Margaret Thatcher and

681
00:43:54.395 --> 00:43:56.594
Ronald Reagan, who are going to fix it now

682
00:43:56.594 --> 00:44:01.294
and proving that it's about like the individual entrepreneur.

683
00:44:01.594 --> 00:44:05.314
Um, IF you, um, don't hustle hard enough, you

684
00:44:05.314 --> 00:44:09.830
don't deserve to eat, basically. So, um, Yeah, just

685
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.469
kind of blaming it on individuals and obviously big

686
00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:16.399
economic shocks like the oil crisis should definitely not

687
00:44:16.399 --> 00:44:18.620
be blamed on individuals.

688
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.590
Of course not. And I mean, do you think

689
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.669
that there's any evidence at all to support the

690
00:44:25.669 --> 00:44:32.149
argument the neoliberals make that the economic crisis that

691
00:44:32.149 --> 00:44:38.360
happened in the 70s were due to Uh, Keynesian

692
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.120
or left wing economic policy.

693
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.300
No, I, I don't think anything supports that if

694
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.340
you actually look at the facts, um, what the

695
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:56.000
spending, um, of things was, um, so welfare historically,

696
00:44:56.459 --> 00:44:58.649
like the amount we have spent on welfare has

697
00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:01.020
never been that high that we could say this,

698
00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:05.580
this was like, The problem or because that's the

699
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.379
argument that right wing people like to make. Oh,

700
00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:12.979
financing healthcare and welfare for the weaker parts of

701
00:45:12.979 --> 00:45:16.620
the population is what is like hurting the economy.

702
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.870
Actually, it's like insane government contracts. Like military contracts,

703
00:45:20.949 --> 00:45:24.870
the amount of like, um, we're spending on fucking

704
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:31.149
weapons, um, fighting wars, um, that don't actually need

705
00:45:31.149 --> 00:45:33.709
to be fought like just like looking at the

706
00:45:33.709 --> 00:45:36.570
amount of money that is being sent to Israel,

707
00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:41.030
um, by all kinds of like Western nations, but

708
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.070
mostly by America and then under their pressure by

709
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.250
all of the other, um. Western countries, um, is

710
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.739
mind boggling and, um, there's also some really interesting

711
00:45:51.739 --> 00:45:55.979
like analysis about like which politicians in the US

712
00:45:55.979 --> 00:46:02.080
own stocks to which weapons manufacturers and in like

713
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.699
how much money from like, um, stock gains they've

714
00:46:05.699 --> 00:46:09.439
made on that. So, um, I don't think ever

715
00:46:09.439 --> 00:46:11.979
that the argument that oh, if we spent less

716
00:46:11.979 --> 00:46:14.560
on welfare. We'd be like in a better state.

717
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.399
No, if we spent less on foreign wars that

718
00:46:18.399 --> 00:46:21.000
we literally shouldn't be fighting and also that probably

719
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.719
shouldn't even exist because like looking at all the

720
00:46:22.719 --> 00:46:25.659
wars that happened in like the last 50 years,

721
00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:31.739
um, they like Iraq, Iran, what like Israel, um.

722
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.270
Kind of all, um, proxy wars that the US

723
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.709
or the West should have nothing, uh, to do

724
00:46:38.709 --> 00:46:40.689
with it and that did more harm than good

725
00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:42.310
for everyone everywhere.

726
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.699
Yeah, it's like war spending and then the neoliberals

727
00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:49.610
also do not tend to see, uh, do not

728
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.959
tend to be very much against subsidies for or

729
00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:57.860
or corporate subsidies and subsidies for the rich because

730
00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.399
I mean it's kind of like they don't tend,

731
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.449
they say they don't like socialism, but they like

732
00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:10.034
socialism for the rich. And and capitalism slash neoliberalism

733
00:47:10.034 --> 00:47:11.314
for the poor. Yeah,

734
00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:13.554
100%. It's socialism for the rich and that's like

735
00:47:13.554 --> 00:47:16.415
what I was saying earlier on, um, about like

736
00:47:16.594 --> 00:47:22.715
elites just like handing out super big government contracts

737
00:47:22.715 --> 00:47:24.955
to their homies essentially or like they're being like

738
00:47:24.955 --> 00:47:29.584
a revolving door effect of people in power, like

739
00:47:30.635 --> 00:47:34.635
switching between political power and like corporate power and

740
00:47:34.635 --> 00:47:38.600
um. Yeah, just like there's like this one circle,

741
00:47:38.919 --> 00:47:42.719
kind of, um, where it's very easy to stay

742
00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:46.879
rich because like, because you have all these connections

743
00:47:46.879 --> 00:47:51.060
and that network that is very socialist amongst themselves,

744
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.510
um, but yeah, capitalism for the poor, socialism for

745
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.080
the rich is a very nice way to put

746
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.379
it.

747
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.090
Yeah, so tell us about this guy. I mean,

748
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:06.370
we've, I've only alluded to him, but let's talk

749
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.570
about him directly now. Tell us about Milton Friedman.

750
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.149
I mean, what does he represent in the history

751
00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:19.959
of neoliberalism and was he a real academic or,

752
00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:23.290
I mean, how did he come up with his

753
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.159
ideas and spread them?

754
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.929
Mhm, I would say he's definitely like the PR

755
00:48:28.929 --> 00:48:34.209
face of neoliberalism, um, so his academic, like he

756
00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:36.850
likes to paint himself as an academic, but the

757
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:41.919
fact is that, um, Universities and um like he

758
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:46.199
was like, fed by um think tanks like the

759
00:48:46.199 --> 00:48:50.770
National Asstitution of Manufacturers or um, and all of

760
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:54.489
these other uh corporate think tanks because they needed

761
00:48:54.489 --> 00:49:00.919
like, A book that would, um. Explain to the

762
00:49:00.919 --> 00:49:06.379
um. Normal man, um, that capitalism and freedom are

763
00:49:06.379 --> 00:49:11.439
inextricably linked because obviously they had Hayek, um, which,

764
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.580
um, he had written the book, uh, The Road

765
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.620
to Serfdom, but it was like a little bit

766
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.610
more nuanced and it was quite an academic book

767
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:25.399
as well, um, about, um, yeah, market, market freedom

768
00:49:25.399 --> 00:49:29.669
and, uh, democracy being linked. Um, BUT it was

769
00:49:29.669 --> 00:49:32.909
kind of hard for like the common man to

770
00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:35.830
understand. So obviously like these think tanks, um, who

771
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:40.020
were headed by people like Pew or Luno, um,

772
00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.870
they needed a book that would be like more

773
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.455
straight to the point and like. Kind of a

774
00:49:44.455 --> 00:49:50.014
bestseller. So, um, they essentially, um, poured loads of

775
00:49:50.014 --> 00:49:53.895
money into the University of Chicago, where Milton Friedman

776
00:49:53.895 --> 00:49:58.094
got then hired and, uh, he was funded to

777
00:49:58.094 --> 00:50:01.774
write Capitalism and Freedom, um, which is a book

778
00:50:01.774 --> 00:50:04.774
that he based on his lectures that were also

779
00:50:04.774 --> 00:50:09.375
funded by these think tanks. Um, AND yeah, he

780
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:11.675
went on, he was like less of an academic,

781
00:50:11.945 --> 00:50:14.729
like he liked to like. Talk in like catchy

782
00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:17.969
one-liners um and was like kind of a showman,

783
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:21.290
he liked going on TV and like on podcasts

784
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.929
and, um, he basically wherever he went, he would

785
00:50:24.929 --> 00:50:29.129
er advocate for deregulation, small government and how like

786
00:50:29.129 --> 00:50:31.689
capitalism and freedom were linked and that we needed

787
00:50:31.689 --> 00:50:32.149
them.

788
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.649
He, he, he liked to go on TV and

789
00:50:35.649 --> 00:50:38.239
podcasts. Oh my God, are you talking about the

790
00:50:38.239 --> 00:50:40.209
20 twenties or?

791
00:50:41.949 --> 00:50:44.449
No, but like on radio shows, not podcasts, probably

792
00:50:44.449 --> 00:50:44.739
they were.

793
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.659
Yeah, no, no, I, I mean, I was just

794
00:50:47.659 --> 00:50:50.550
kidding, but, but I, I was, I, I, I

795
00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.590
mean my joke, uh, I mean it was, uh,

796
00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:57.030
like I, I meant two different kinds of things.

797
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.780
Uh, IT was a joke because of course podcasts

798
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.629
didn't exist back then, but also because that's what

799
00:51:03.629 --> 00:51:06.909
some people do nowadays of the same kind of

800
00:51:06.909 --> 00:51:07.709
ideology.

801
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.540
Yeah, 100%. I mean, um, not like, um, there's

802
00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.459
many people like, um, what, what, what's his name,

803
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.560
like, for example, Charlie Kye, but also, um, What

804
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.770
what are the names of this, this right wing

805
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.030
psychologist,

806
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:25.830
Jordan Peterson.

807
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.489
Yeah, those, for example, or like who who basically

808
00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:34.050
are kind of kind of the same, he like

809
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.699
paints himself as an academic, but um, obviously it's

810
00:51:38.699 --> 00:51:41.760
more of a showman, and yeah, Milton Friedman was

811
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.969
like kind of like the earlier version of it,

812
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:47.989
but like a bit more. Even academic, I mean,

813
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:52.290
um, and yeah, he er would go on TV

814
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:55.199
shows and say that the world runs on greed.

815
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.750
Um, THERE'S actually this clip you can watch on

816
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.830
YouTube where he like says that on the, um,

817
00:52:00.919 --> 00:52:03.949
Donahue show, er, which was like a very big

818
00:52:03.949 --> 00:52:07.860
TV show back in the day. Um, BUT yeah,

819
00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:14.179
he basically totally ignores, um, the comparative and public

820
00:52:14.179 --> 00:52:17.800
achievements, um, like NAS like NASA, for example, or

821
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.320
the invention of the internet, or literally every, every

822
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.659
invention was funded by public money going to universities.

823
00:52:24.699 --> 00:52:28.739
Like this iPhone would not be possible without, um,

824
00:52:30.129 --> 00:52:34.939
So much public state money going into universities to

825
00:52:34.939 --> 00:52:39.090
fund actual academic research, but then capitalists like to

826
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.959
be like to paint less. This iPhone wouldn't exist

827
00:52:42.399 --> 00:52:45.860
without capitalism, um, which is just not. Yeah,

828
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.919
yeah, I was just going to say that that's

829
00:52:47.919 --> 00:52:51.340
really outrageous of you. So you are against neoliberal

830
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.379
capitalism and you want an iPhone. You're a hypocrite.

831
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.070
So some people, like I feel like someone commented

832
00:52:58.070 --> 00:52:59.989
that on the like one of my videos about

833
00:52:59.989 --> 00:53:05.429
like owning a MacBook but like being anti-capitalist and

834
00:53:05.429 --> 00:53:09.110
um, I mean we all need tools and if

835
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.850
I buy a Microsoft computer, it's gonna be probably

836
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.929
manufactured in the same way as an Apple computer

837
00:53:15.929 --> 00:53:20.919
and that is. Something that conservatives love to point

838
00:53:20.919 --> 00:53:21.280
out.

839
00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:25.500
No, you know, one of the funniest memories I

840
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.899
have from university is that this one time I

841
00:53:28.899 --> 00:53:32.280
was watching on my computer a Che Guevara movie

842
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.570
and one of my friends who was very much

843
00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.100
against. Communism, Marxism, socialism, and so on, uh, said,

844
00:53:42.189 --> 00:53:46.169
oh, you're watching that. DO you know that, uh,

845
00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:49.540
if, if it wasn't for capitalism, you wouldn't have

846
00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.510
that computer.

847
00:53:51.929 --> 00:53:59.080
A classic, a classic. But yeah, um. But yeah,

848
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.340
that's just the very simple kind of argument that

849
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.510
Friedman would probably also have made.

850
00:54:05.679 --> 00:54:09.239
Yeah, but that's when I like to reply, yeah,

851
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.120
but if it wasn't for the state, he wouldn't

852
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.340
have the internet.

853
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.879
100%, 100%.

854
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.860
Um, OK, so I, I, I mean this several

855
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.219
things that I want to talk about there in

856
00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:28.800
regards to Milton Friedman. I mean, one very interesting

857
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:35.479
thing is that these guys, I mean, neo-liberals, right-wing

858
00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:39.979
conservatives, and so on are always talking about because

859
00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:44.139
they like to turn everything into a market, they

860
00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:48.310
like to talk about the Marketplace of ideas, but,

861
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:53.159
uh, interestingly enough, it doesn't seem that Milton Friedman

862
00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:57.310
was very interested in, uh, putting his ideas out

863
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.590
in the marketplace of ideas and see which ideas

864
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:04.149
would win because it was funded by think tanks

865
00:55:04.149 --> 00:55:07.860
and rich people and they didn't seem very interested

866
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:13.030
in, uh, publishing academically and being peer reviewed, so.

867
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.889
Yeah, 100%, like, uh, in the actual marketplace of

868
00:55:17.889 --> 00:55:21.229
ideas, um, which is also like a very, a

869
00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.719
big euphemism, I think, but like we use it

870
00:55:24.719 --> 00:55:31.969
nowadays, so, um. Yeah, um, His, his book and

871
00:55:31.969 --> 00:55:35.250
like the economists that came before him like Hayek,

872
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:40.350
um, and Van Mises, their, their ideas failed in

873
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:43.669
the marketplace of ideas. They only gained traction once

874
00:55:43.669 --> 00:55:49.330
they like had access, um, to this immense amount

875
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:54.129
of, uh, funding provided by big industrialists, so. Without

876
00:55:54.129 --> 00:55:57.129
the industrialists, their ideas would probably have never prevailed.

877
00:55:57.449 --> 00:56:01.689
And, um, if they hadn't bought the whole faculty

878
00:56:01.689 --> 00:56:05.570
at like, um, the University of Chicago, all of

879
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:10.209
these ideas probably wouldn't really have been published because

880
00:56:10.209 --> 00:56:14.729
they wouldn't have gotten any funding. Um, AND yeah,

881
00:56:14.879 --> 00:56:20.780
Friedman kind of forgets to mention, um. That but

882
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.000
or like that that his ideas did not win

883
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.679
because they were the best, but because they were

884
00:56:25.679 --> 00:56:30.139
like their promotion and marketing marketing was funded by,

885
00:56:30.159 --> 00:56:33.919
uh, these, uh, big industrialists. But yeah, he, I

886
00:56:33.919 --> 00:56:37.360
mean, even in his book, he acknowledges, um, how

887
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.120
much support and funding he got from them, but

888
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.050
he kind of does not. Get like you can't

889
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.780
like see how that could be problematic, which is

890
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.649
wild to me.

891
00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.669
Yeah, it's very interesting and also the other thing

892
00:56:53.669 --> 00:56:57.370
you mentioned, this idea of greed as the primary

893
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.510
human motivation. I mean, it's always interesting. Just the

894
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:03.780
other day I was talking with and I released

895
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.790
an interview with Richard Wolff. I don't know if

896
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.790
you're aware of him, he's a Marxist economist from

897
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.449
the US and Uh, we were talking about how,

898
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:17.989
uh, it's very interesting that many times we hear

899
00:57:17.989 --> 00:57:24.379
from capitalists that capitalism. Um, GOES, um, I mean,

900
00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:29.060
capitalism is in accordance with our human nature, but

901
00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:33.459
then you look back and capitalism is like 300

902
00:57:33.459 --> 00:57:37.689
years old and we as Homo sapiens are like

903
00:57:37.689 --> 00:57:42.820
200,000, 300,000. I mean, a study came out recently

904
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.439
that perhaps we are 1 million years old, so

905
00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:52.669
I mean, it's, it's a very It, it, it's

906
00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:57.949
like an extraordinary claim to make that what's been

907
00:57:57.949 --> 00:58:01.629
around for the past 300 years is more in

908
00:58:01.629 --> 00:58:05.870
accordance to human nature than other systems that we

909
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:07.270
have, right?

910
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:10.629
Yeah, I mean, uh, there's actually two points I

911
00:58:10.629 --> 00:58:12.949
want to touch upon, uh, from what you said

912
00:58:12.949 --> 00:58:16.080
right now. One is like, Um, OK, so we

913
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.659
like for a very long time we did feudalism,

914
00:58:18.959 --> 00:58:22.560
um, which basically is not very different from capitalism

915
00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.780
except that it's not about land, but about like

916
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.919
the means of production just like with as time

917
00:58:27.919 --> 00:58:31.959
has gone on, like machines and like working capital

918
00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:35.439
has just like become as important as owning the

919
00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:37.709
land. So I feel like capitalism is just like

920
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:41.820
feudalism 2.00 at this point. And also about like,

921
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:46.469
um, talking about capitalism is human nature. I will

922
00:58:46.469 --> 00:58:49.270
like greed is human nature in that sense. Um,

923
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.709
I don't think, uh, that at all. Actually, um,

924
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:57.750
I I did a psychology, um, in my bachelor's

925
00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:00.669
degree and I was actually like I I never

926
00:59:00.669 --> 00:59:02.350
went into the field because then I focused on

927
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:06.459
like statistics and um going into finance. But um,

928
00:59:06.469 --> 00:59:10.024
what I really like. Then was developmental psychology, which

929
00:59:10.024 --> 00:59:12.425
is like the, which is like far off from

930
00:59:12.425 --> 00:59:14.225
what I'm doing today, but it's about like the

931
00:59:14.225 --> 00:59:19.014
psychology of babies. And, um, what, what like just

932
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:22.225
like doing experiments on babies, and there's like so

933
00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:27.104
many experiments where, um, literally a couple months old

934
00:59:27.104 --> 00:59:33.169
babies, um, Are like tested on altruism uh and

935
00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:36.350
um for example, there's one experiment where like uh,

936
00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:39.729
I feel like the scientists, like the the baby

937
00:59:39.729 --> 00:59:42.969
sees how a door works, but it would have

938
00:59:42.969 --> 00:59:45.850
to like make an effort to like go to

939
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:49.129
the door. Um, SO going to the door would

940
00:59:49.129 --> 00:59:51.969
be, or if it didn't need to, would obviously

941
00:59:51.969 --> 00:59:55.159
be like altruistic. And then like the baby gets

942
00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:58.429
shown how the door works, and then, um, it

943
00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:00.169
it will just sit in a room and then

944
01:00:00.169 --> 01:00:02.850
like a a scientist will just like try to

945
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:04.850
get through the door and fail all the time,

946
01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:06.850
just like walking the door and just like not

947
01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.000
being able to go through the door. Uh, THE

948
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.770
baby will always get up and like help him

949
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.502
open the door. So, um,

950
01:00:15.752 --> 01:00:19.393
yeah, and there's also that experiment where they show

951
01:00:19.393 --> 01:00:23.712
babies, uh, different geometric figures, and there's, for example,

952
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:27.552
a triangle, a square, and a rectangle, and one

953
01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:30.552
of the figures is going up a hill and

954
01:00:30.552 --> 01:00:34.552
one of them, uh, uh, helps it go up

955
01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:38.913
the hill and the other blocks his its progress

956
01:00:38.913 --> 01:00:43.355
and the baby. Tend to prefer the more prosocial,

957
01:00:43.946 --> 01:00:47.456
uh, geometric figure. I mean, the one that helps

958
01:00:47.456 --> 01:00:50.936
instead of hindering the, the progress.

959
01:00:51.256 --> 01:00:54.216
100% and there's like even more like I feel

960
01:00:54.216 --> 01:00:58.085
like a lot of human psychologists or like, especially

961
01:00:58.085 --> 01:01:01.456
like from the humanitarian psychology branch. I, to be

962
01:01:01.456 --> 01:01:03.696
honest, I'm a big critique of psychology at this

963
01:01:03.696 --> 01:01:05.295
point because I feel like there's a lot of

964
01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:09.530
like, um, Fundamental statistics that are or like the

965
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.129
statistical fundamentals behind a lot of experiments are kind

966
01:01:12.129 --> 01:01:16.429
of skewed. But, um, I do very much believe

967
01:01:16.429 --> 01:01:22.000
in, uh, the sentiments of like, um, Abraham Maslow

968
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.530
or Carl Rogers who say that deep down, humans

969
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.570
want to be good. I mean, no one wakes

970
01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:30.389
up and is like, I want to be evil.

971
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.290
Like we all want to be good people like.

972
01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:36.120
I just know it for myself like when I

973
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.199
when I feel like I've done something wrong, I,

974
01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:41.360
I feel horrible but like when I like I

975
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.649
cos I want to do like something right or

976
01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:46.080
like I want to be a good person and

977
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.800
I feel like we all want to be a

978
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.800
good person, but at the same time we we

979
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.449
get like socialized in a way that says like,

980
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.800
no, you have to fight for yourself. You, you

981
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.639
have to look out for yourself because no one

982
01:01:58.639 --> 01:02:01.360
else will. Bullshit, if we all looked at looked

983
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.340
out more for like. The people that surround us,

984
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.949
instead of being like so focused, like being taught

985
01:02:07.949 --> 01:02:11.889
to be so focused on our individual well-being, um,

986
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.489
I feel like that would change society a lot

987
01:02:14.489 --> 01:02:16.149
and I feel like that's a narrative that we

988
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.330
need to like break up.

989
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.399
Uh, I mean, there's just so many sources of

990
01:02:21.399 --> 01:02:26.389
evidence even from anthropology that, uh, that, uh, that

991
01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:30.760
debunk the idea that greed is our primary motivation

992
01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.669
as humans. I mean, even in traditional societies like

993
01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:40.399
hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, I mean, uh, in general, not all

994
01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:43.074
of those societies it. Depends a little bit on

995
01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:47.294
their ecological context, and I talked about this with

996
01:02:47.354 --> 01:02:51.514
anthropologists on the show already, but, mm, most of

997
01:02:51.514 --> 01:02:57.645
them tend to be more egalitarian, even gender egalitarian.

998
01:02:57.969 --> 01:03:03.610
And they share the meat they get when they

999
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:07.489
go out hunting, and I mean they don't tend

1000
01:03:07.489 --> 01:03:11.770
to like people who are leaders and become very

1001
01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:16.689
authoritarian and stuff like that, and there's cooperative breeding,

1002
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:21.800
for example, the idea that the nuclear family. IS

1003
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:27.939
the traditional sort of social organization and it's like

1004
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.760
an ancient thing. I mean, it's not in more

1005
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.159
traditional societies, people have cooperative breeding and there's also

1006
01:03:36.159 --> 01:03:40.919
evidence of that, uh, uh, in, in archaeology, for

1007
01:03:40.919 --> 01:03:43.879
example. So, I, I mean, I don't think they're.

1008
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.110
That this argument of greed being the primary human

1009
01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:53.469
motivation holds much water unless you're like, uh, a

1010
01:03:53.469 --> 01:03:56.949
fan of Ayn Rand or something like that.

1011
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:02.030
Yeah, Ayn Rand, she's a fucking broken theory, man,

1012
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.110
what she's got going on. But yeah, no, I

1013
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.350
totally agree with you, like us humans would have

1014
01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:10.129
never like. Um, GOTTEN as far as like we

1015
01:04:10.129 --> 01:04:13.409
got like from an evolutionary perspective, if we hadn't

1016
01:04:13.409 --> 01:04:17.969
like lived in groups and being like and worked

1017
01:04:17.969 --> 01:04:21.370
as a collective, I mean like a single human

1018
01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:24.050
just like out in nature will die, but like

1019
01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:26.479
as a group, we survive. Um, WE'RE not like,

1020
01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:30.929
for example, like there's animals like. Um, OCTOPI, octopi,

1021
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.729
octopuses, octo

1022
01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:35.580
octopi, octopi, maybe, I don't know.

1023
01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:39.129
I don't know, but the plural of octopuses, the

1024
01:04:39.129 --> 01:04:43.500
plural of octopus, um, anyways. They can live on

1025
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.129
their own, they like learn everything on their own.

1026
01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:47.149
Actually the other day I saw like this cool

1027
01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:50.100
movie of like an octopus and um basically they

1028
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:54.179
like have everything like programmed into them and they

1029
01:04:54.179 --> 01:04:57.659
just, they like the the mom octopus dies and

1030
01:04:57.659 --> 01:05:00.780
then like the while laying the eggs and then

1031
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.439
like. Uh, A couple of weeks later, the, the

1032
01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:07.000
octopus egg hatches and, uh, it has to learn

1033
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.120
everything themselves, uh, um, like for itself basically. While

1034
01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.360
we as a human species, a baby doesn't learn

1035
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.780
shit for itself. Like we need like at least

1036
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.709
15. 15 years of upbringing, um, or like, and

1037
01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:22.739
like for at least the 1st 5 years, we

1038
01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:26.570
need to be like fed, um, by someone else,

1039
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.689
um, because we're just like not able to like

1040
01:05:30.229 --> 01:05:32.270
find our own food for the first couple of

1041
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:36.429
years. Um, LET alone everything, all the other challenges

1042
01:05:36.429 --> 01:05:40.179
that human life poses, so we're definitely like, we'd

1043
01:05:40.179 --> 01:05:43.540
be nowhere, um, if everyone just looked out for

1044
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.139
themselves.

1045
01:05:44.939 --> 01:05:48.620
But aren't aren't we just like lobsters or I've

1046
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.149
heard that from someone.

1047
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.780
I, I don't know how lobsters, do lobsters live

1048
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.219
in fat?

1049
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.860
Uh OH, I thought you had heard that thing

1050
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:04.100
from Jordan Peterson. Comparing lobsters to humans and how

1051
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:09.209
lobsters are very hierarchical and then he makes he

1052
01:06:09.209 --> 01:06:12.419
makes a point of saying that lobsters, I mean

1053
01:06:12.419 --> 01:06:18.199
in terms of, um, like evolutionary history, lobsters are

1054
01:06:18.199 --> 01:06:22.860
very ancient and so hierarchy is very ancient and

1055
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.620
so hierarchy is natural also in human society.

1056
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.649
Do lobsters even live in groups?

1057
01:06:29.689 --> 01:06:34.330
Uh, LOOK, I, I don't know. I, I, I

1058
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.770
don't know. The, the only thing I know is

1059
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:40.409
that kind of BS argument. I, I, I, I

1060
01:06:40.409 --> 01:06:42.969
think, I think it was debunked by people who

1061
01:06:42.969 --> 01:06:48.189
actually study lobsters, but, but I don't, I don't

1062
01:06:48.199 --> 01:06:52.475
remember exactly. What they replied to Jordan Peterson's argument.

1063
01:06:52.534 --> 01:06:53.925
I just find it funny,

1064
01:06:54.175 --> 01:06:57.034
hilarious, and I'll definitely be looking up this lobster

1065
01:06:57.034 --> 01:06:59.294
theory because I just feel like it's great just

1066
01:06:59.294 --> 01:07:03.135
like having that for a conversation. Just um, you've

1067
01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:05.514
definitely piqued my interest there.

1068
01:07:06.534 --> 01:07:09.834
Yeah, I mean, and look, if we're going for

1069
01:07:10.415 --> 01:07:17.770
like a human, uh, animal predecessors and justifying. Uh,

1070
01:07:17.929 --> 01:07:22.510
SO, uh, different kinds of social organization based on

1071
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.610
the behavior of non-human animals, then I mean we

1072
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:30.780
could cite, uh, bonobos,

1073
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.149
monkeys.

1074
01:07:33.469 --> 01:07:37.810
I mean, bonobos tend to be a very fun

1075
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.989
bunch, of course they are also a little bit

1076
01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:43.350
violent, but they try to, uh, they tend to

1077
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:43.659
solve.

1078
01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:46.929
These are the violent ones and bonobos are like

1079
01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.649
the, the caring ones.

1080
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:52.760
Uh, YES, that, that, that's not exactly. True, uh,

1081
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.290
but I had that conversation, I think 2 years

1082
01:07:56.290 --> 01:08:00.409
ago with an anthropologist that, that, uh, that strict

1083
01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:03.689
division is not, is not exactly true, but for

1084
01:08:03.689 --> 01:08:08.969
example, bonobos tend to solve many social conflicts with

1085
01:08:08.969 --> 01:08:10.570
sex, so.

1086
01:08:10.889 --> 01:08:14.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I've heard too. Like,

1087
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:18.540
and chimpanzees fight it out, like. I, I'm not

1088
01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:18.569
sure, but,

1089
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.430
uh, but yeah, I, I mean, just to say

1090
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:27.290
that if you want to go for non-human animals,

1091
01:08:27.629 --> 01:08:32.719
uh, uh, sources of evidence, then. You can make

1092
01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:36.917
many different kinds of arguments with different animals or

1093
01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:37.599
different species.

1094
01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:39.349
I feel like we should stick to monkeys, like

1095
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.358
if,

1096
01:08:41.778 --> 01:08:44.158
if, at least, at least they're, at least they're

1097
01:08:44.158 --> 01:08:45.568
closer to us, right?

1098
01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:47.578
Yeah, closer than lobsters.

1099
01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:52.290
OK, so, OK, so I, I mean, you're from

1100
01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:57.649
the United Kingdom. Uh, WHAT do you think about

1101
01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:02.417
Margaret Thatcher? I mean, What were the sort of

1102
01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:06.578
political, economic, and social consequences of the adoption of

1103
01:09:06.578 --> 01:09:13.599
neoliberal policies and some of her very uh eloquent,

1104
01:09:14.139 --> 01:09:17.938
um, takes, like, for example, saying that there's no

1105
01:09:17.938 --> 01:09:21.538
such a thing as society, there's only individuals, so

1106
01:09:21.538 --> 01:09:22.698
what do you make of that?

1107
01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:26.390
Um, SO, um, first of all, I'm half German,

1108
01:09:26.509 --> 01:09:29.500
half English. So, um, but we can see both,

1109
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.390
we can see both, um, in both countries, we

1110
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:36.750
can, we can, um, see, um, that massive growth

1111
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.709
of individualism, but I'll stick with Margaret Thatcher about

1112
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:43.129
her point about like, um, Being that there's no

1113
01:09:43.339 --> 01:09:46.979
there's no society, there's just family, basically like hammering

1114
01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.859
down that nuclear family as like, oh yeah, we

1115
01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.899
just need to make sure the survival of the

1116
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.450
family and greed is good as like for the

1117
01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:58.879
family and um. Yeah, that that's just wild, but

1118
01:09:58.879 --> 01:10:00.839
then I feel like Margaret Thatcher is like this

1119
01:10:00.839 --> 01:10:08.390
really interesting persona, um. So basically like she, how

1120
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:11.089
she was like put in place um or like

1121
01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.709
a lot of people think of Margaret because like

1122
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.979
Margaret Thatcher was like the daughter of a grocer,

1123
01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:18.620
so like her her dad owned like a um

1124
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.080
very small little supermarket, um, I think. So, um,

1125
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.259
it might be some other kind of shop. I'm

1126
01:10:26.259 --> 01:10:28.100
unsure about the kind of shop her dad owned,

1127
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.220
but a shopkeeper, like, and it was not a

1128
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:35.500
big chain, so, um, so, so there's like, she

1129
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.259
was like part of that petit bourgeois class where

1130
01:10:39.259 --> 01:10:41.410
like uh not like a normal worker cos I

1131
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:45.470
feel like that's really interesting, um. Like the petite

1132
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.580
bourgeois class is like definitely very different from like

1133
01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:55.529
the big capitalist class. um, BUT they always like,

1134
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:59.490
they don't want to identify with like normal workers,

1135
01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:02.189
um, even though the the amount of money they

1136
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:05.609
earn is obviously like a lot nearer the to

1137
01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:09.270
like normal worker than like, for example, the owner

1138
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:15.240
of Tesco or whatnot, um. But, um, yeah, I

1139
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.359
feel like she was like. A lot of people

1140
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:23.189
from working class or from like that petty bourgeois

1141
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:26.049
background who are like shopkeepers or like just like

1142
01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:30.069
middle like lower middle class people identified with her.

1143
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:32.279
So I feel like that was like a very

1144
01:11:32.509 --> 01:11:35.319
very smart move. By conservatives back in the day

1145
01:11:35.319 --> 01:11:37.600
to like put someone like her, not like a

1146
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.600
Tesco owner, um, in charge or like not like

1147
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.200
for example, Rishi Sunak, um, who comes from a

1148
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.759
super wealthy background, um, but like Margaret Thatcher, so

1149
01:11:46.759 --> 01:11:52.259
she was able to like convince. People from like

1150
01:11:52.259 --> 01:11:55.859
lower classes to be like oh yeah, entrepreneurship and

1151
01:11:55.859 --> 01:12:00.419
like the individual and um, just like the market's

1152
01:12:00.419 --> 01:12:02.660
not going to solve shit for you, er sorry,

1153
01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.580
government's not gonna solve shit for you, it's all

1154
01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.259
about like the market because like, she came from

1155
01:12:07.259 --> 01:12:09.819
that background of her father being like a shopkeeper

1156
01:12:09.819 --> 01:12:11.979
and she had like, helped like her all of

1157
01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:13.540
her teenage years she had helped her in the

1158
01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.709
shops so she kind of like, knew what it

1159
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:21.140
was about, um, but could also very much assimilate

1160
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.109
to that worker background and, uh, kind of made

1161
01:12:25.109 --> 01:12:27.509
it a lot more credible for like ordinary people

1162
01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.779
to like identify with her, while at the same

1163
01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:32.169
time pushing this corporate agenda.

1164
01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:36.740
Yeah, uh, and I mean one interesting thing and

1165
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:42.129
we, you mentioned briefly earlier, the trickle-down economics. One

1166
01:12:42.129 --> 01:12:46.089
very interesting thing is that we hear from neoliberals

1167
01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:50.089
that trickle-down economics actually works, but then we look

1168
01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:53.810
at actual data from, for example, the US and

1169
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:59.209
the past 40, 50 years and uh wages seem

1170
01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:03.509
to be stagnant. Um, AND I mean when you

1171
01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:10.069
compare the wages for CEOs versus the average worker,

1172
01:13:10.589 --> 01:13:14.649
they are, the difference is much bigger now, much,

1173
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.959
much bigger now than it was in, for example,

1174
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:20.709
the 50s and the 60s. So, I mean, do

1175
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:23.109
you think that there's good enough evidence for us

1176
01:13:23.109 --> 01:13:30.049
to say that neoliberalism causes wealth inequality or?

1177
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:34.310
I would definitely um I mean trickle down economics

1178
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:38.649
or like um how like right or like conservative

1179
01:13:38.649 --> 01:13:43.250
um like to call it supply side economics. um,

1180
01:13:44.029 --> 01:13:46.740
THAT'S what they like to call it. Um, I

1181
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.709
definitely like there's been loads of research, for example,

1182
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:51.950
like uh there's like these really famous researchers that

1183
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:54.830
were like really famous, like as famous as you

1184
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.709
can get as like an academic, but like, um.

1185
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.189
Like Hopper and Lindbergh and they like did a

1186
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:03.589
lot of like empirical work on like, um, how

1187
01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:07.080
actually trickle-down economics doesn't work and uh it's just

1188
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.109
like uh like, it doesn't even grow the economy

1189
01:14:10.109 --> 01:14:12.390
like it it like all it does is just

1190
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:16.189
like benefit the rich. um, BUT obviously the rich

1191
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:18.149
have a lot more money to like spend on

1192
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:22.279
propaganda that like supply side economics work. Um, AND

1193
01:14:22.279 --> 01:14:24.120
yeah, all that has happened just like the rise

1194
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.770
of, of inequality where like, for example, CEO pay,

1195
01:14:27.879 --> 01:14:31.279
um, or like, um, people in very high positions

1196
01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:34.160
or like shareholders, like, it's like, let's look at

1197
01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.359
CEOs as like an example. Their pay went like

1198
01:14:37.359 --> 01:14:40.080
from 20 times the amount of like a worker

1199
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.879
would earn a year, uh, in 1965, which is

1200
01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:45.299
20 times, uh, the amount of like. From a

1201
01:14:45.299 --> 01:14:49.790
worker, like it's still a lot more like, um,

1202
01:14:50.109 --> 01:14:55.029
but now in 2022, like CEOs make 344 times

1203
01:14:55.029 --> 01:14:58.750
as much as, um, workers, which is just like

1204
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.169
you can't even like. Imagine the amount of how

1205
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:06.290
much richer that is, um, and we are seeing

1206
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:07.970
that wealth is getting more and more and more

1207
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:12.520
concentrated, uh, in the top 1%, um. And probably

1208
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.319
like in in smaller percent, um, while everyone else

1209
01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:18.600
is getting squeezed out. There's so many people or

1210
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.959
like, um, where it like renting, uh, you're like

1211
01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:25.120
not even buying a house, but renting, like it's

1212
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.959
it's getting so expensive. The like the cost of

1213
01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:30.629
living crisis is happening in every country from the

1214
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:33.520
US to the UK to Germany to probably also

1215
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.459
in Portugal. Um, SO, um. Everyone is experiencing this,

1216
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.759
this, um, cost of living crisis, while at the

1217
01:15:43.759 --> 01:15:46.839
same time, like we're probably gonna like see the

1218
01:15:46.839 --> 01:15:50.200
1st 1 trillionaire being made, um, in the next

1219
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.459
couple of years. So that is just crazy.

1220
01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.419
Well, I mean, perhaps that will be humanity's biggest

1221
01:15:59.419 --> 01:16:03.680
achievement in the 21st century. I don't know, creating

1222
01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.259
the first trillionaire,

1223
01:16:05.319 --> 01:16:10.339
a trillionaire. Also the big issue like just like

1224
01:16:10.339 --> 01:16:13.660
a complete asshole will like become the first trillionaire

1225
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.319
like.

1226
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:20.009
Yeah, I guess so because I think we, we

1227
01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:23.529
both, we both know who's the person that's most

1228
01:16:23.529 --> 01:16:26.209
likely to become the first trillionaire and he's very

1229
01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:27.430
much an asshole.

1230
01:16:27.799 --> 01:16:30.819
Yeah, even like, I mean, either Elon Musk or

1231
01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:35.370
Jeff Bezos like have like a great moral track

1232
01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:36.069
record.

1233
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:40.870
Yeah, but, but it, it's interesting because er as

1234
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.910
you said briefly there, it's not like in the

1235
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:48.870
50s and 60s, particularly in the US, rich people

1236
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:53.060
being taxed at 90%, they were poor. I mean,

1237
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:57.080
they still had lots. Of money, lots and lots

1238
01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:03.080
of money, because, for example, uh, if someone from

1239
01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.560
the left, I don't know, in the US, let's

1240
01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.319
say someone like Sam Seder, who actually makes that

1241
01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:13.399
kind of argument goes on the right-wing podcast. And

1242
01:17:13.399 --> 01:17:16.120
suggests that we should go back to taxing the

1243
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.000
rich at 90%. The, uh, I, I mean the

1244
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.680
right wingers go crazy. It's like, oh my God,

1245
01:17:22.799 --> 01:17:28.319
communism, socialism, fascism. I mean, words don't mean anything

1246
01:17:28.319 --> 01:17:30.799
anymore because I mean I'm making this. Joke because

1247
01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:34.319
there's actually a compilation video of Donald Trump calling

1248
01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:39.040
the Democrats and Kamala Harris Nazi, Nazis, Marxists, fascists,

1249
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.220
socialists, communists, so I guess that words don't have

1250
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.540
any meaning anymore. But, but I, but I mean,

1251
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:49.419
but I mean my point is if people are

1252
01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:52.060
still fucking rich, right?

1253
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:54.299
Yeah, people would still be fucking rich, like take

1254
01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:58.720
away 90% of like uh Elon Musk's wealth, um.

1255
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.930
Yeah, he would still completely be able to afford

1256
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:05.680
all of this crazy lifestyle and everything that he

1257
01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:12.660
wanted to do. And um, yeah, just. And that's

1258
01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.609
not, it's just like, that would be like a

1259
01:18:14.609 --> 01:18:18.450
90% wealth tax, and you would still be completely

1260
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:18.819
fine.

1261
01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.470
Yeah, I, I mean, but don't you think that,

1262
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:27.169
I mean, we should care about meritocracy and obviously

1263
01:18:28.259 --> 01:18:33.459
CEOs. Company owners and other people like that, of

1264
01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:38.319
course, they work much harder than the average worker

1265
01:18:38.459 --> 01:18:45.120
and they deserve to earn 1 million% more than

1266
01:18:45.299 --> 01:18:47.740
the average worker and stuff like that. I mean,

1267
01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:49.859
don't you think that we should be a little

1268
01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:56.500
more, a little bit more empathetic towards the hardworking.

1269
01:18:57.029 --> 01:19:01.339
Uh, BILLIONAIRES, CEOs, and other people like that.

1270
01:19:01.879 --> 01:19:05.279
Yeah, I feel like if meritocracy actually worked, but

1271
01:19:05.279 --> 01:19:08.640
the truth is that most like people inherit their

1272
01:19:08.649 --> 01:19:12.839
their companies and um, the like the percentage of

1273
01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:17.000
people who like actually like come from a poor

1274
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.919
background and like sort of make it for themselves

1275
01:19:20.919 --> 01:19:26.580
is is abysmal and um. All of the richest

1276
01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.109
men that we were just talking about, like come

1277
01:19:29.109 --> 01:19:32.830
from quite rich backgrounds, got the capital from their

1278
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:37.609
parents, and, um, yeah, I mean, the thing is,

1279
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:40.229
meritocracy, like if we really would want to do.

1280
01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.464
THAT like everyone would have to start from zero

1281
01:19:43.765 --> 01:19:47.145
and we'd have to like introduce, uh, inheritance tax,

1282
01:19:47.645 --> 01:19:51.185
taxing all inheritance so everyone could start from zero.

1283
01:19:52.325 --> 01:19:56.390
BUT that's just not the case. So, um. I

1284
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:59.500
feel like we just shouldn't be talking about meritocracy

1285
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.870
unless we like if we wanted meritocracy, we'd first

1286
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:04.330
have to do that and then we could like

1287
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.830
talk about like if it would be fair that

1288
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:11.229
like people who like found companies um and while

1289
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:15.509
exploiting people's labor somehow, um, because they own means

1290
01:20:15.509 --> 01:20:19.149
of production, um, should be able to earn more.

1291
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:22.310
We can have that conversation, um, yeah, as soon

1292
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:23.810
as everyone starts from zero.

1293
01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:27.830
Beyond the means of production, you're clearly a Marxist,

1294
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:32.399
come on. Only only Marxists stock like.

1295
01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.220
Um, NO, but I feel like it, it, it

1296
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.819
doesn't totally make sense. Like, I mean, You don't

1297
01:20:41.819 --> 01:20:46.060
have to be a Marxist to like understand that

1298
01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:49.560
like that owning the means of production is, um,

1299
01:20:50.259 --> 01:20:52.850
is the way to like exploit people nowadays and

1300
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:57.140
the only way to actually become wealthy. You cannot

1301
01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.339
become wealthy without owning either stocks by being a

1302
01:21:01.339 --> 01:21:06.100
CEO or um. Owning your own company, you can't

1303
01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.250
buy like hard work in the bakery without owning

1304
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.410
the bakery, you cannot become rich.

1305
01:21:13.959 --> 01:21:17.680
Uh, RIGHT, so let's talk about your first video

1306
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.600
on neoliberalism where you focus on the topic of

1307
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.080
self-improvement. So, what, in your understanding, what is the

1308
01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:32.200
link between neoliberalism and the promotion of self-improvement?

1309
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.069
Um, SO yeah, I feel like a lot of

1310
01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:37.979
time when we talk about neoliberalism, we just like

1311
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.830
talk about economics and like, but I feel like

1312
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.549
it was for me, it was very important and

1313
01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:44.830
like it's very unaccessible as well to people to

1314
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:47.149
only talk about economics and the broader economy and

1315
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:50.830
whatnot, um, because that's actually, I mean, while we

1316
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:53.540
experience it and while we experience its its effects,

1317
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:57.509
it's not something that we think, Or like that

1318
01:21:57.509 --> 01:22:00.859
way it it's that easy to think about and

1319
01:22:00.859 --> 01:22:03.620
doesn't like apply to ourselves so much but I

1320
01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:07.470
feel like probably most people who like live nowadays

1321
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:10.560
or especially like for example like um people that

1322
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.350
are you're my age um, will always like hear

1323
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:18.549
about that like about self improvement and I feel

1324
01:22:18.549 --> 01:22:21.779
like a lot of like, People don't read fiction

1325
01:22:21.779 --> 01:22:23.850
anymore. People always like, or like a lot of

1326
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:27.319
people read like nonfiction books like Atomic Habits or,

1327
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:32.290
um, productivity productivity books or whatnot, like these are

1328
01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:38.399
like, Had a huge like impact because people have

1329
01:22:39.529 --> 01:22:43.910
realized that like, Or like not because people have

1330
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:45.990
realized but because like this narrative is sold that

1331
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:47.149
like if you want to make it in the

1332
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:48.830
world you have to like be your best self

1333
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.629
and like a lot like it's all about you

1334
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:53.620
as an individual. So we've obviously all become like,

1335
01:22:54.029 --> 01:22:56.629
kind of obsessed with this like um notion of

1336
01:22:56.629 --> 01:23:00.450
self improvement and kind of like, Made ourselves into

1337
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:04.509
like a little entrepreneur of the self. That's what

1338
01:23:04.609 --> 01:23:07.689
the philosopher Byung Chouhan calls it. Um, HE writes

1339
01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:10.790
a lot about like neoliberalism and like neoliberal philosophy,

1340
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:14.240
like because it it's not just about economic life.

1341
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.950
So, um, It what what has happened is that

1342
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:24.299
people more and more feel. Um, PERSONALLY responsible for

1343
01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:29.140
actual systemic issues, um, and put that pressure of

1344
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.700
the market logic to itself. And that market logic

1345
01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.770
has expanded into all areas of life. Um, SO,

1346
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:39.379
uh, we now think of, uh, the marketplace of

1347
01:23:39.379 --> 01:23:42.100
ideas, but not even just that, like we, it

1348
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.580
has applied to dating, um, like, uh, the dating

1349
01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:51.160
market or, um, to friendships, to identity. Um, WE'VE

1350
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.020
all become like, including myself, like becoming obsessed with

1351
01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.830
like the gym and our appearance and how, um,

1352
01:23:58.319 --> 01:24:01.000
like with, with status and we more and more

1353
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.060
think of, for example, like friendships is like we're,

1354
01:24:05.029 --> 01:24:08.779
As commodities, I feel like we've commodified everything. Um,

1355
01:24:09.069 --> 01:24:12.350
PEOPLE like now pick their friend circle of like,

1356
01:24:12.549 --> 01:24:15.069
oh, if I hang out with these people, um,

1357
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:17.790
or like if I network, like that will help

1358
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:20.870
my career or stuff like that. People like socialize

1359
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:24.220
at networking events nowadays and not necessarily just like

1360
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:27.870
hang out with their friends, um, which I personally

1361
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:31.270
feel is a lot healthier. Um, BUT yeah, I

1362
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:34.410
feel like this market logic is like. Apply it

1363
01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:37.450
is being applied to everything and that's actually really

1364
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:41.290
sad and also, it makes us feel lonely if

1365
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:45.120
like we constantly have to like strive. To be

1366
01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.160
better, um, we kind of lose touch with like.

1367
01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:56.080
Just like not being so self-improvement or re-entered, like

1368
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.370
we we like this self-improvement orientation kind of like

1369
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:02.689
takes over and and, yeah, it it it makes

1370
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:07.359
us like all into like individuals and chasing individual

1371
01:25:07.359 --> 01:25:10.180
success and I feel like it it's a big

1372
01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.759
part of um what is fueling the loneliness crisis

1373
01:25:14.759 --> 01:25:16.500
that we're experiencing right now.

1374
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:20.290
Yeah, I, I mean, I would like to run

1375
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.169
through you a theory that I have. I, I

1376
01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:26.430
actually someday I have to run this through, um,

1377
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:31.609
also an economist to hear their ideas, but I

1378
01:25:31.609 --> 01:25:36.319
mean it doesn't seem coincidental to me that. Uh,

1379
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:41.029
THE rise of the hustle, uh, the rise of

1380
01:25:41.029 --> 01:25:44.899
hustle culture, the rise of hustle bros on the

1381
01:25:44.899 --> 01:25:48.350
internet, and then, because, I mean, you mentioned there

1382
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:53.259
briefly, briefly the How they try to turn everything

1383
01:25:53.259 --> 01:25:56.259
into a market, even dating and mating, and so

1384
01:25:56.259 --> 01:25:59.490
I would also include the rise of things like

1385
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:02.979
the manosphere there. Uh, I, I don't think, uh,

1386
01:26:03.009 --> 01:26:08.810
it's coincidental that that happened. It Through, through the

1387
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:13.859
2010s and now in the 2020s after the 2008

1388
01:26:13.859 --> 01:26:17.339
economic crisis and the fallout of that because, I

1389
01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:20.500
mean, it seems to me that those sort of

1390
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.500
ideas, oh you can make it yourself, you can

1391
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.339
become an entrepreneur, take these 21 steps, and you

1392
01:26:27.339 --> 01:26:30.009
will become rich in 90 days would be very

1393
01:26:30.009 --> 01:26:36.750
appealing. To a generation of people and even particularly

1394
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:41.629
more so young men, uh, who tend to isolate

1395
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:46.209
themselves more than women, I guess, um, who have

1396
01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:52.729
been economically and politically disenfranchised. I mean, people have

1397
01:26:53.129 --> 01:26:58.529
fewer econo uh fewer job opportunities, fewer economic opportunities.

1398
01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:02.470
I mean, the job market is a complete mess

1399
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:07.910
with the gig economy and, uh, precarious jobs and

1400
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:10.700
stuff like that and the fact that people can

1401
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:14.959
no longer buyer. Buy a house and many people

1402
01:27:14.959 --> 01:27:18.160
are still living in their late 20s and 30s

1403
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.720
with their parents and so on. So, I mean,

1404
01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.399
if people, uh, I guess that what made those

1405
01:27:24.399 --> 01:27:29.520
kinds of ideas very appealing were the economic and

1406
01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:34.370
so uh and particularly more so the economic circumstances

1407
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:38.799
that very many young people found themselves in. I

1408
01:27:38.799 --> 01:27:40.120
mean, what do you think about that?

1409
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:46.629
100%, um, I feel like we're, um, We're seeing

1410
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:51.069
that in every aspect actually of, of culture, um,

1411
01:27:51.089 --> 01:27:56.029
um, so the, um, Obvious Obviously like people are

1412
01:27:56.029 --> 01:27:58.750
becoming desperate and for example I feel like uh

1413
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:03.029
for example especially like, men who still have like

1414
01:28:03.029 --> 01:28:07.810
um like have forgotten this um, Or grew up

1415
01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:10.410
with this notion of like, yeah, we need to

1416
01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:13.290
provide for a family one time but like, one

1417
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:16.089
day, but like it it's obviously impossible at this

1418
01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:19.250
point um to provide for a family with a

1419
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:23.189
single income. So basically what's been happening is like,

1420
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:26.689
and that it's always um been a thing that

1421
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:31.609
people become fiscally more irresponsible, the more desperate they

1422
01:28:31.609 --> 01:28:34.569
are. For example, it's like, if it's impossible to

1423
01:28:34.569 --> 01:28:39.240
buy a house, um. Or like every time that

1424
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.040
like an economic recession has happened, people have gambled

1425
01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.549
more. Um, OR people have also there's like this

1426
01:28:46.549 --> 01:28:51.399
famous lipstick tax that like, um, expensive lipsticks have

1427
01:28:51.399 --> 01:28:54.819
all like their sales have always gone up, like

1428
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.919
during a recession. So, um, and we're seeing that

1429
01:28:57.919 --> 01:29:02.520
for example, with labubus, um, or day trading, which

1430
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.584
is like gambling. Lap is also a form of

1431
01:29:05.584 --> 01:29:08.745
gambling at this point, like you're buying something and

1432
01:29:08.745 --> 01:29:11.104
hoping like you pull something with value.

1433
01:29:12.165 --> 01:29:13.984
By the way, sorry for interrupting, but I have

1434
01:29:13.984 --> 01:29:17.564
to say this here in Portugal, uh, until recently,

1435
01:29:17.745 --> 01:29:20.845
and it's still sort of an ongoing problem, we,

1436
01:29:21.104 --> 01:29:26.370
we've been having such a Bad problem with older

1437
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:30.870
people, people who are already retired, spending tons of

1438
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:35.549
their money on gambling, that the government is now

1439
01:29:35.549 --> 01:29:38.640
regulating that activity, so,

1440
01:29:39.069 --> 01:29:41.589
yeah, but that that's, that's important that like gambling

1441
01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:43.390
gets regulated, but I feel like the more and

1442
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:49.149
more, um like, Kind of bleak the economic situation

1443
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:52.250
becomes, the more people feel like, oh, like, or

1444
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:55.810
like go to like desperate measures like, Day trading,

1445
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:58.069
like if we like look at like Google uh

1446
01:29:58.069 --> 01:30:01.169
analytics, if we like type in day trading, how

1447
01:30:01.169 --> 01:30:03.790
many people nowadays want to learn day trading and

1448
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:08.209
become rich quick, um, has gone up like by

1449
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:10.839
an insane amount. Um, ALSO, for example, like my

1450
01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:14.009
um friend Gary Stevenson, he's like sort of a

1451
01:30:14.009 --> 01:30:17.330
big YouTuber, um, but he like tells me that

1452
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:19.609
like all people asking that the question he gets

1453
01:30:19.609 --> 01:30:21.930
the most is like how to trade, even though

1454
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:23.810
he talks about like wealth inequality on this channel.

1455
01:30:24.345 --> 01:30:24.595
But like,

1456
01:30:24.944 --> 01:30:27.825
oh, Gary Stevenson, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah,

1457
01:30:28.024 --> 01:30:29.785
yeah, I follow his channel, yeah.

1458
01:30:30.104 --> 01:30:36.424
Yeah, um, so basically all he like what we're

1459
01:30:36.424 --> 01:30:39.625
seeing is that like people are becoming more and

1460
01:30:39.625 --> 01:30:42.669
more desperate and also like, I don't feel like

1461
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:48.890
just like this. This economic desperation is like leading

1462
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:51.490
the manosphere or also like women with labu boos,

1463
01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.810
it's just like soft gambling. It's not like day

1464
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:56.430
trading, but it's like soft gambling with labu boos.

1465
01:30:56.689 --> 01:31:01.209
Um, IT'S, um, that has happened and also what

1466
01:31:01.209 --> 01:31:03.060
has happened, people are like looking for someone to

1467
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:08.629
blame. And obviously, um, conservative elites would don't want

1468
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:11.229
the finger pointed at them. So they're kind of

1469
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:15.549
like funneling um the hate towards immigrants, for example,

1470
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:19.959
or um marginalized groups like, oh, we're only in

1471
01:31:19.959 --> 01:31:23.629
this economic situation because disabled people are getting too

1472
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:29.294
much welfare, um. It's crazy, obviously, um, and also

1473
01:31:29.294 --> 01:31:32.294
our country would probably not work without immigration. Um,

1474
01:31:32.694 --> 01:31:34.575
IN the UK like the UK is entirely based

1475
01:31:34.575 --> 01:31:37.535
on immigration. Like London is like an extremely diverse

1476
01:31:37.535 --> 01:31:41.854
country. Um, Germany also wouldn't work without immigration because

1477
01:31:41.854 --> 01:31:45.910
like. That like that it's the amount that has

1478
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:48.459
like gone to immigrant work, like the amount of

1479
01:31:48.459 --> 01:31:51.410
work and actual important work like nursing work and

1480
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:55.149
like um it's all being like held up by

1481
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:59.709
immigrants, while people from Germany usually like get these

1482
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:03.850
bullshit corporate jobs that end up not really doing

1483
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.810
anything. Um, SO it's actually really important to have

1484
01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:10.450
immigration, um, also because like birth rates have plummeted

1485
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:12.390
and like the country just like wouldn't work without.

1486
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:17.890
Um, IMMIGRATION, but yeah, um, I feel like that

1487
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:20.890
is happening, like the blame on like external things

1488
01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:24.290
or like women have become too woke, like that's

1489
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:26.410
why the economy is crumbling because I have to

1490
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:30.879
do the laundry myself now, um. So, yeah, I

1491
01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:34.459
feel like. The manosphere and like all of these

1492
01:32:34.459 --> 01:32:39.279
cultural phenomena that we're seeing is a direct outcome

1493
01:32:39.279 --> 01:32:42.020
of um the state of the economy.

1494
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:45.950
And you know, I also find it interesting because

1495
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:50.850
this sort of narratives and these sorts of um

1496
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:56.669
political ideologies and economic ideologies make people feel responsible

1497
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:59.850
for their own economic situation or it's on you

1498
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:05.009
to improve your own economic situation, but I mean.

1499
01:33:06.339 --> 01:33:12.379
When, when capitalists, when, want to, uh, I mean

1500
01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.680
how should I put it, when they want to

1501
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:19.899
make an argument for capitalism being the better economic

1502
01:33:19.899 --> 01:33:25.290
system, then. It's the system, it's not the people,

1503
01:33:25.459 --> 01:33:29.080
because if they're talking about, oh, we freed you

1504
01:33:29.339 --> 01:33:32.680
from feudalism, of course I mean freed from feudalism,

1505
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.970
we could discuss that because immediately after feudalism, people

1506
01:33:36.979 --> 01:33:41.819
were working their asses off in factories to death,

1507
01:33:41.939 --> 01:33:45.290
were working to death in fact. But anyway, anyway,

1508
01:33:45.439 --> 01:33:47.589
er let's leave that aside for now. But I

1509
01:33:47.589 --> 01:33:50.910
mean, whenever they want to make an argument as

1510
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:56.220
for why capitalism is better than socialism, for example,

1511
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:59.830
oh then it's the system, and when they want

1512
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:04.069
to blame socialism for its supposed failings, then it's

1513
01:34:04.069 --> 01:34:12.439
systemic. But when within neoliberal capitalism there's social. And

1514
01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:16.319
economic failings and it fails for a majority of

1515
01:34:16.319 --> 01:34:20.080
people on, oh, then it's on the individuals. Yeah,

1516
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.879
yeah, 100%. Like the the successes of capitalism get

1517
01:34:23.879 --> 01:34:26.839
like put in the system, not like Elon Musk

1518
01:34:26.839 --> 01:34:28.830
is so great, that's why capitalism is great. No,

1519
01:34:28.879 --> 01:34:31.830
it's like the system has like brought up innovation,

1520
01:34:31.879 --> 01:34:34.000
but the failures is just like, oh, you as

1521
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.879
an individual, you're too lazy, 100%.

1522
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.779
So, um, I mean, I, I'm not sure if

1523
01:34:40.779 --> 01:34:44.419
you're interested in ethics or moral philosophy, but do

1524
01:34:44.419 --> 01:34:48.850
you, would you say that neoliberalism, because of the

1525
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.939
effects it has had on society, would you say

1526
01:34:52.939 --> 01:34:55.899
it's morally wrong or not?

1527
01:34:56.990 --> 01:35:02.009
Um, I mean, no, that's It's a hard question,

1528
01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:06.560
obviously I, I personally think it is morally wrong

1529
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.459
to want to pursue greed or like to um,

1530
01:35:10.439 --> 01:35:16.120
Continue to support this. Sort of ethically dubious framework

1531
01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.100
of having freedom for elites and misery for the

1532
01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:26.100
majority. Um, I do think that's, yeah, questionable to

1533
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:31.089
say the least, um. And yeah, I just don't,

1534
01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.410
I just don't think that it's for society like

1535
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:35.609
it's for the greater good. Like I feel like

1536
01:35:35.609 --> 01:35:38.299
the structural effects of like, um, that have led

1537
01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:41.810
us to inequality, loneliness, environmental collapse. I feel like

1538
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:44.529
it's a lose-lose situation, except for like the very,

1539
01:35:44.649 --> 01:35:49.544
very, very few, um, of Uh, elites having the

1540
01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:53.645
freedom of doing whatever they want, um, shaping policy,

1541
01:35:54.145 --> 01:35:57.944
um, polluting the environment as much as they want,

1542
01:35:58.024 --> 01:36:01.145
um, exploiting workers, not just like in the country

1543
01:36:01.145 --> 01:36:03.584
like where they live, um, but like even worse,

1544
01:36:03.665 --> 01:36:09.055
like, uh, in, um, the global south, um, completely,

1545
01:36:09.214 --> 01:36:14.140
yeah. Taking advantage of like people in, for example,

1546
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:20.270
Congo or um, For, uh, yeah, mining er cobalt

1547
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:23.839
and whatnot, I feel like. There's a like the

1548
01:36:23.839 --> 01:36:27.939
grand majority of people are suffering under this framework

1549
01:36:27.939 --> 01:36:31.330
and I. I, I mean, I'm not an expert

1550
01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:35.049
on morality and I'm not an expert on ethics

1551
01:36:35.049 --> 01:36:39.149
or anything or ethical philosophy or whatnot, but um,

1552
01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:41.709
I'd just say it's a lose-lose situation.

1553
01:36:43.209 --> 01:36:45.049
By the way, on still on the topic of

1554
01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:51.029
self-improvement and since earlier I mentioned, uh, the madnesssphere

1555
01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:53.729
and the dating market, I, I just wanted to

1556
01:36:53.729 --> 01:36:58.520
hear your take on this because I, I've, I've

1557
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:04.470
come across and heard some people. Talking about things

1558
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:11.080
like high value men and high-value women. So, I

1559
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.410
mean, what, what do you make of that? And,

1560
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:18.450
and particularly as a woman, how do you feel

1561
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:24.450
about uh people saying that some women are high

1562
01:37:24.450 --> 01:37:29.049
value and other women are low value and Men

1563
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:34.740
should improve themselves to become attractive to high value

1564
01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:37.620
women because those are the ones worth pursuing. I

1565
01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.660
mean, uh, uh, in general, what do you make

1566
01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:46.870
of this sort of Uh, marketization of the, of

1567
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:48.290
mating and dating.

1568
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:51.529
I actually haven't thought a lot about like the

1569
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:55.790
marketization of dating that much, also because I'm like

1570
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:59.189
so disillusioned with like dating apps. I like generally

1571
01:37:59.189 --> 01:38:01.339
dating nowadays that I've just given up on it.

1572
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:03.790
I'm just like, just gonna focus on my channel,

1573
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:07.310
but um, all in all, yeah, that that's just

1574
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:14.270
um, crazy and um also usually like, From personal

1575
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:17.689
experience, I'd say people who focus on being like,

1576
01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.600
Perceived as societally higher value like, or like just

1577
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.379
I can just say like, in in men, like

1578
01:38:28.879 --> 01:38:32.000
people like men who strive for that usually are

1579
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
very boring personality wise. So I mean to each

1580
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.990
their own, maybe there's like I I bet there's

1581
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:40.680
like women who are like super into um, men

1582
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.879
chasing money and power, um, from personal experience I've

1583
01:38:44.879 --> 01:38:48.580
just like noticed that um, Those are usually not

1584
01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:53.020
the funniest people and I don't know, like, life

1585
01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:57.180
is sad enough, I want someone funny, so, um,

1586
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.060
yeah, I, I mean, but, but that that's definitely

1587
01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.529
like. Uh, I, I do feel like there's a

1588
01:39:03.529 --> 01:39:06.319
big development in, in the whole marketization of the

1589
01:39:06.319 --> 01:39:08.799
dating world, and I feel like especially with dating

1590
01:39:08.799 --> 01:39:14.520
apps like we've commodified, um, yeah, finding love and

1591
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.680
it was also obviously like made made us more

1592
01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.680
superficial. I mean I've been on dating apps and

1593
01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:22.520
like obviously I swipe for how people look because

1594
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.959
that's like all you can go off on like

1595
01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:30.419
on dating apps, um. And obviously I, I go

1596
01:39:30.419 --> 01:39:32.899
to the gym and try to self-improve because I'm

1597
01:39:32.899 --> 01:39:35.609
just so brainwashed by society to do that. And,

1598
01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.180
um, obviously and also because I've realized it's a

1599
01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:43.020
lot. Easier even to go through life, not just

1600
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.299
in in the dating context, but like in in

1601
01:39:45.299 --> 01:39:48.419
the general context, like I have like this this

1602
01:39:48.419 --> 01:39:52.290
crazy um, Or like not this crazy idea, I

1603
01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:53.890
don't even think it's crazy, but I feel like

1604
01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:55.770
I, it would have been a lot more or

1605
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:59.129
a lot less likely to land my er consulting

1606
01:39:59.129 --> 01:40:01.729
or banking job if I had been massively overweight.

1607
01:40:02.089 --> 01:40:08.040
Um, I feel like people judge appearance, um. And

1608
01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.890
that's definitely something we need to like work against

1609
01:40:10.899 --> 01:40:15.890
and and educate ourselves and um become more aware

1610
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:18.540
of like what this actually does and that it's

1611
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.549
actually not a meritocracy if like. You're like, you

1612
01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:25.580
get selected for jobs on appearance and um I

1613
01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:29.029
mean as for the dating market, um, Yeah, it's

1614
01:40:29.029 --> 01:40:30.709
sad. I feel like more more and more people

1615
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:34.750
are becoming lonely because um they're chasing these um

1616
01:40:35.509 --> 01:40:40.390
superficial ideals or like get brainwashed into like chasing

1617
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:43.470
these superficial ideals of high value men, high value

1618
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:47.790
women, but like, um, in the end, um, we

1619
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:52.600
all just end up alone. So, um, I feel

1620
01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.379
like it's kind of working against us as like.

1621
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:58.669
Humanity, which is sad.

1622
01:40:59.939 --> 01:41:02.419
Well, I mean, but then you have people like

1623
01:41:02.419 --> 01:41:07.220
Andrew Tit going on on Piers Morgan and and

1624
01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:11.180
saying, and he doesn't feel uh like shame of

1625
01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.540
doing this at all. He says, oh, I'm sexy,

1626
01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:18.930
I'm rich, I'm, I'm, I'm intelligent, yeah, I mean,

1627
01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:22.479
uh, what are you doing there, man? I mean

1628
01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:27.819
if you were such a A high value man,

1629
01:41:27.939 --> 01:41:30.979
why do you need to like, uh, market it?

1630
01:41:31.259 --> 01:41:34.319
Why do you need to say that, that out

1631
01:41:34.319 --> 01:41:37.500
loud and why do you think that, uh, people

1632
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.759
are attracted by that?

1633
01:41:40.379 --> 01:41:43.259
Yeah, no, 100%, and like, but the funny thing

1634
01:41:43.259 --> 01:41:46.620
is, I actually like, um, I think 2 years

1635
01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:50.479
ago or something, actually like, Date for a couple

1636
01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:53.319
of months I dated this guy who actually sometimes

1637
01:41:53.319 --> 01:41:55.640
would watch Andrew Tate videos. That was a time

1638
01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:59.200
where Andrew Tate was like, not like it's still

1639
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.279
a big red flag and I literally, I told

1640
01:42:01.279 --> 01:42:03.600
my friends a lot, bro he's like literally sometimes

1641
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.319
watching Andrew Tate videos, and we have this these

1642
01:42:06.319 --> 01:42:09.589
discussions but like in like, And like I obviously

1643
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:12.700
always made a lot of fun of it, um,

1644
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:16.169
and, and he eventually came to see the light,

1645
01:42:17.169 --> 01:42:21.259
um, Andrew Jay is just a massive, um, yeah,

1646
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:25.910
uh, uh scam also, um, he just like it

1647
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:28.149
makes like crypto pump and dump schemes and I

1648
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:32.209
don't know what and like also, um. Traffics women,

1649
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:34.930
I think. Um, BUT yeah, it

1650
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:36.959
it seems so. Yeah.

1651
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:39.129
But I feel like he like I was very

1652
01:42:39.129 --> 01:42:41.410
surprised to learn that someone that like because like

1653
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:43.689
the guy's name was a normal person and he

1654
01:42:43.689 --> 01:42:46.549
was like he was funny and a kind human

1655
01:42:46.549 --> 01:42:50.709
and um, but would get reeled into um this

1656
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:56.200
um this language and um, this ideology and I

1657
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:59.259
I was very shocked at how for like very

1658
01:42:59.259 --> 01:43:04.410
normal. Men, it, it, it was. And I I

1659
01:43:04.410 --> 01:43:06.850
even talked about my like to my male friends

1660
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:09.270
about it and somewhere like, yeah, but I mean

1661
01:43:09.509 --> 01:43:14.299
they do get. Get a bit of it because

1662
01:43:14.299 --> 01:43:19.189
like. Yeah, because they, they, they feel like they

1663
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:25.029
have to like make this, um. Be like this

1664
01:43:25.029 --> 01:43:28.830
to like, be perceived valuable on dating apps, but

1665
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:35.279
um. Yeah, I, I feel like. I'm mostly, I,

1666
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:39.240
I don't know how to solve that problem, but

1667
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.850
I feel like if we just have like a

1668
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:47.770
kinder economy overall and, um. Yeah, don't, and make

1669
01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:53.270
sure that everyone eats and um. Yeah, and has

1670
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:55.310
health insurance and stuff like that. I I feel

1671
01:43:55.310 --> 01:44:01.430
like that also, uh, that status driven dating would

1672
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:05.509
also become less, um, maybe people just chase that

1673
01:44:05.509 --> 01:44:07.629
because they feel like they're they're scared for the

1674
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:10.609
future and, um, need to do that in order

1675
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:14.009
to like secure an economically viable future for themselves,

1676
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:19.459
um. Yeah, but I don't really know how to

1677
01:44:19.459 --> 01:44:20.290
solve that problem.

1678
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:24.270
No, look, me neither, me neither. Uh, BUT I,

1679
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:26.189
I mean, it's funny that you mentioned that you

1680
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:30.020
dated the guy who, who looked or watched Andrew

1681
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.060
Retreat because, uh, I think a few years ago,

1682
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:35.709
last 1 or 2 years ago or something like

1683
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:40.250
that. People freaked out on Twitter, er, or guys

1684
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:43.169
specifically freaked out on Twitter because they found out

1685
01:44:43.169 --> 01:44:49.200
that, uh, women were, er, dumping them or, I

1686
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.970
mean, deciding just not to have, uh not to

1687
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:58.450
date them if they said they watched Joe Rogan.

1688
01:44:58.859 --> 01:44:59.640
So,

1689
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.979
yeah, I feel like that is also like, um,

1690
01:45:03.379 --> 01:45:05.129
actually I was talking to my again to my

1691
01:45:05.129 --> 01:45:07.939
friend Gary about this the other day, literally about

1692
01:45:07.939 --> 01:45:10.620
this and that's something that very much annoys me

1693
01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.100
about lefty culture is like this. Oh yeah, we

1694
01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.299
don't speak to people who have other opinions or

1695
01:45:16.299 --> 01:45:18.100
like, um, because I actually had a lot of

1696
01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.540
fun like discussing, um, if you ever watched this

1697
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.725
is. It really fun for the for him. But

1698
01:45:22.725 --> 01:45:27.015
like we literally discussed loads of um, we we

1699
01:45:27.015 --> 01:45:28.975
discussed this Andrew Tate narrative a lot and it

1700
01:45:28.975 --> 01:45:31.174
was really interesting and it was really interesting for

1701
01:45:31.174 --> 01:45:33.274
me to see like where he was coming from.

1702
01:45:33.575 --> 01:45:35.814
And he he listened to where I was coming

1703
01:45:35.814 --> 01:45:39.174
from and it was just all in all, like

1704
01:45:39.174 --> 01:45:43.615
an interesting conversation, uh, we're still friends and um,

1705
01:45:43.975 --> 01:45:47.359
I feel like, Yeah, it is really, really important

1706
01:45:47.359 --> 01:45:49.899
to like hear each other out, and I feel

1707
01:45:49.899 --> 01:45:52.540
like that really annoys me about like lefty culture

1708
01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.700
is about like, oh yeah, I don't speak to

1709
01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.580
anyone who like um listens to Andrew Tate or

1710
01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:59.220
even worse, like, oh no, right when people are

1711
01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:02.299
all fascists or right when people are like in

1712
01:46:02.299 --> 01:46:05.779
Germany, like especially like in Berlin, like where I

1713
01:46:05.779 --> 01:46:07.990
was living for a while now, um, people will

1714
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:11.080
be like, oh yeah, he's such a Nazi, where

1715
01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:16.350
I'm like, Kind of hard to like convince someone

1716
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:18.810
of your points if you call them a Nazi.

1717
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:21.790
And same thing goes for like, um, Andrew Tay.

1718
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:24.509
If like obviously Andrew Tay is a deeply problematic

1719
01:46:24.509 --> 01:46:28.069
figure, but I feel like, um, he obviously like

1720
01:46:28.069 --> 01:46:31.390
struck a struck a chord with young men and

1721
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:34.750
we need to talk to them and re-educate them

1722
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:36.740
instead of being like, oh no, not talking to

1723
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.189
you anymore and goodbye.

1724
01:46:39.529 --> 01:46:41.600
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you are

1725
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.040
aware of these statistics, but, um, they came out,

1726
01:46:45.169 --> 01:46:48.049
uh, or I got across them last year and

1727
01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:51.290
then they did the same here in Portugal and

1728
01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:54.410
the trend seems to be the same because across

1729
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:58.810
the world, it seems that among young people, women,

1730
01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:02.200
young women are moving further to the left and

1731
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.529
the young men are moving, moving further to the

1732
01:47:04.529 --> 01:47:07.910
right. So I'm not sure if in terms of

1733
01:47:08.509 --> 01:47:14.240
Uh, political, uh, uh, I mean political compatibility or

1734
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:17.109
uh, uh, I'm not sure if that would also

1735
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:22.129
have an effect in terms of being harder for

1736
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:25.529
people to find a partner. I mean, because usually

1737
01:47:25.529 --> 01:47:29.390
people like to be in relationships where their partner

1738
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:31.509
is politically aligned with them.

1739
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:35.750
Yeah, no, 100%. I mean, like, for, like, I

1740
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:38.330
don't think I could date someone who's like super

1741
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:41.410
economically right wing or like a libertarian or like

1742
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:44.100
someone who's like super neoliberal. I, I feel like

1743
01:47:44.339 --> 01:47:46.750
we'd have too hard of a time. And with,

1744
01:47:46.759 --> 01:47:48.910
with that guy, like the Andrew Tate thing was

1745
01:47:48.910 --> 01:47:50.430
like the only thing, but he was pretty left

1746
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:53.830
otherwise. So, we did get along like on like

1747
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:58.830
this economic, um, theory bit, but, um, yeah, that

1748
01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:03.020
probably also, um, makes things harder, um. In dating

1749
01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.799
and um. That's also really interesting, but I feel

1750
01:48:06.799 --> 01:48:10.080
like um that, um, I feel like it's, it's

1751
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.589
a lot of times because like women work a

1752
01:48:13.919 --> 01:48:17.439
a lot more in like, the care sector, like

1753
01:48:17.439 --> 01:48:21.520
as in teaching, nursing, um, even being doctors, just

1754
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:29.069
like the um, The The kind of professions where

1755
01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:32.990
you really see and feel inequality and where like

1756
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:37.430
um, the effects are coming out much stronger, whereas

1757
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:39.910
men a lot of time get pushed into jobs

1758
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:43.720
like finance and um where you just like sit

1759
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:46.910
in front of a spreadsheet and like, just like

1760
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:50.120
calculate the best ROI but you don't really see

1761
01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.979
the effects it actually has on like um, Real

1762
01:48:54.979 --> 01:48:59.450
humans, so, um, that might be a point why,

1763
01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:03.259
um, this is happening, um, but also I'm not

1764
01:49:03.259 --> 01:49:04.370
an expert, so.

1765
01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.160
No, that's fine. OK, so look, uh, we're getting

1766
01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.100
close to 2 hours here, so would you just

1767
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.290
like to tell people where, uh, uh, not where,

1768
01:49:15.339 --> 01:49:20.140
but what you're, what your next video and what

1769
01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:21.660
are you working on right now?

1770
01:49:22.450 --> 01:49:27.879
Um, SO right now, um, I'm definitely working on

1771
01:49:27.879 --> 01:49:30.750
finishing my neoliberalism series. So I'm gonna like make

1772
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.629
one more part that like talking about Thatcher and

1773
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:35.649
Reagan and also about like the impacts of like

1774
01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:40.165
self-esteem we're seeing because like self-esteem, uh, experience. Like

1775
01:49:40.165 --> 01:49:43.604
this, uh, it's like similar to like self like

1776
01:49:43.604 --> 01:49:46.924
the the self improvement obsession. We've also become like

1777
01:49:46.924 --> 01:49:50.845
very, very, um, into the whole notion of self

1778
01:49:50.845 --> 01:49:54.004
esteem and being confident no matter what and what

1779
01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:56.205
not. And that's actually something that happened in the

1780
01:49:56.205 --> 01:50:00.404
70s, um, with the rise of like corporate culture.

1781
01:50:00.524 --> 01:50:04.620
So like when, um, Yeah, a nation of like,

1782
01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:09.229
Mine workers or workers in general became like turned

1783
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:12.580
into like a nation of salesmen where like, jobs

1784
01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:14.939
nowadays, especially white collar jobs are all about like

1785
01:50:14.939 --> 01:50:17.779
selling stuff or like just like making a PowerPoint

1786
01:50:17.779 --> 01:50:22.060
presentation and just like, seeming confident helps you a

1787
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.129
lot more, so like people have become like obsessed

1788
01:50:24.129 --> 01:50:27.790
with like, um, self-esteem and also like in popular

1789
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:32.149
psychology that's like completely like um, Yeah, taken over

1790
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:34.419
that we all are supposed to love ourselves no

1791
01:50:34.419 --> 01:50:36.500
matter what. And it is also, I feel like

1792
01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:41.560
contributed a little bit to like narcissistic tendencies in,

1793
01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:46.520
um, at times, um. So, yeah, that's also something

1794
01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.490
I'm working on. And also after I finished the

1795
01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:51.359
whole neoliberalism series, um, I also kind of um,

1796
01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:53.890
um, yeah, I I kind of want to finish

1797
01:50:53.890 --> 01:50:55.930
it now. I feel like I've had enough of

1798
01:50:55.930 --> 01:50:58.439
it. And, um, I want to like go more

1799
01:50:58.439 --> 01:51:01.330
into like because my backgrounds, uh, I come from

1800
01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:03.970
finance. I feel like a lot of people don't

1801
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:07.450
really understand finance. I mean they will. Like if

1802
01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:09.609
things are well, they'll know what a stock is

1803
01:51:09.609 --> 01:51:11.930
and what a stock market is. But, um, I

1804
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:15.009
feel like a lot of people don't understand, for

1805
01:51:15.009 --> 01:51:18.529
example, how big the derivatives market in the market

1806
01:51:18.529 --> 01:51:22.290
is and, um, how the banking system actually works.

1807
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:24.250
I feel like my next video series will be

1808
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:28.950
on. Um, FINANCIALIZATION about the derivatives market and for

1809
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:31.819
example, like stock options that CEOs don't really get

1810
01:51:31.819 --> 01:51:33.990
paid in money, but like what lets them avoid

1811
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:36.240
taxes is that they get paid in stock options.

1812
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:41.350
So, um, I wanna expand my viewers' understanding on

1813
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:44.100
that in the next series. But yeah, so that's

1814
01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.540
it, but it's a lot of work and, um,

1815
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:48.589
I like to procrastinate, so.

1816
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:53.589
No, look, I really, really love your videos. They're

1817
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:58.589
apart from the uh actual informational content itself, they

1818
01:51:58.589 --> 01:52:03.259
are very, very well made, so, uh, and, uh,

1819
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:05.589
I mean, I'm going to tag you on my

1820
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:08.669
YouTube video and put your Instagram in the description,

1821
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:11.750
anyplace else on the internet where people can find

1822
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.950
you.

1823
01:52:12.799 --> 01:52:16.220
Um, NO, not really. I'm just on YouTube and,

1824
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:18.959
uh, I have a tiny Instagram account, but mainly

1825
01:52:18.959 --> 01:52:21.109
YouTube. Like I don't do much on Instagram. Uh,

1826
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:23.759
I mostly do YouTube and I wanna focus mainly

1827
01:52:23.759 --> 01:52:27.069
on YouTube. I much prefer long form to short

1828
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:30.910
form content, um, as you probably do too. It's

1829
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:36.520
just, yeah, nicer to go in depth. And, um,

1830
01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:41.100
yeah, no, that's, uh, all where I exist.

1831
01:52:42.049 --> 01:52:45.390
OK, great. So look, it's been really, really nice

1832
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:48.310
to have you on the show and the conversation

1833
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:51.270
was great and it was also great to finally

1834
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:53.109
meet you. So thank you so much for doing

1835
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.529
this.

1836
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:56.229
Thank you, sir, so much. I really enjoyed it

1837
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:58.629
and uh I thought it was really inspiring and

1838
01:52:58.629 --> 01:53:01.950
uh motivating as well for my next videos and

1839
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:03.569
it was really helpful for me too.
