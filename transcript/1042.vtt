00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.760
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.090
today I'm joined by Andrea Zagaria. He's a PhD

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.239
student at the University of Trento in Italy. And

5
00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.920
today, we're focusing mostly but not uh only on

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.579
one of his papers, is evolutionary Psychology, a scientific

7
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.680
revolution, a bibliomemetric response to bus 2020. So, basically,

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.000
we're going to discuss whether evolutionary psychology is actually

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.680
a scientific revolution and also talk about some other

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.939
subbranches in psychology and how they relate to one

11
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:40.560
another. So, Andrea, welcome to the show. It's a

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.830
big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.959
For me too, for me to thank you for

14
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:47.630
having invited, invited me here. Sure.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.669
So, before we get into To evolutionary psychology specifically,

16
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.090
I would like to ask you about one of

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.779
the papers where you analyzed trends and the prominence

18
00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:02.029
of four major schools of thought in scientific psychology,

19
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.610
which you call, or you identify as neuroscience, cognitivism,

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.239
behaviorism, and psychoanalysis, and also their intersections. And you

21
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:15.639
covered the period from 1979 to 2020. So could

22
00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.069
you tell us about that study? How did you

23
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.199
approach it? I mean, what sort of methodology you

24
00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.000
used and also the results you got there? Yeah,

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.160
yeah. So, so we, we were interested in tracking

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
the major subdisciplines in psychology from a bibliometric point

27
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
of view and there were some important papers on

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.760
this regard published, especially in the 90s. The first

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.839
paper, if I remember correctly, is um by Freeman,

30
00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.959
the, the, the leading author is Freeman and is

31
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.519
published in 1993 or something like it and uh

32
00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.279
because there was a debate um in the, in

33
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.400
the, in, in that year's speaking about a cognitive

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.309
revolution, you know. So there were some cognitivist, cognitivists,

35
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.230
scientists claiming that the cognitivism was a paradigm in

36
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.879
a Kunian sense and maybe we can talk about

37
00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.758
that later, but a paradigm is uh a set.

38
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.970
OF ontological and methodological assumption of a science which

39
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.479
for, for some time, uh, usually a long time

40
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.770
provides um the, all the scientists in that area,

41
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.779
uh, with the means and the kind of questions

42
00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.179
they uh have to, to answer to. OK, right.

43
00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.440
So, uh, and so the, of course, as always,

44
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.880
it happens in psychology, people from the cognitivism were

45
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.559
saying, oh, we are the most important guys in

46
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.639
the field and you know, the cognitivism is the

47
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.619
long-awaited paradigm in psychology. And so some, uh, you

48
00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.669
know, scholars, uh, like, uh, were, were interested in

49
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.679
trying to answer quantitatively that, that question because, of

50
00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.660
course, if you go to answer a certain scholar

51
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.449
about their uh uh preferred theory, they are going

52
00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.130
to tell that theory is the most important one

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.490
and the most beautiful one. And so they did

54
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.970
this very simple study which is different from ours,

55
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.250
but they try to track the trends during time.

56
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.320
And uh what they found is that cognitivism was

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.080
rising, but that the prevalence of cognitivism in scientific

58
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.720
psychology wasn't that high to, you know, um to,

59
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.550
to give it the status of a paradigm. And

60
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.759
so, um, after that seminal study, there was a

61
00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.919
special issue in the American Psychology, so it was

62
00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.779
kind of, you know, uh, I think it's a

63
00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.320
quite cited study and there was some debate about

64
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.880
it and then they did other studies in the

65
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.570
years later, uh like refining the methodology. Um, BUT

66
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.210
the last, um, study to date was published in

67
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:53.440
2007, like uh 2007, 2007 by Spare, and uh

68
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.910
the last years were untouched. And one thing, um,

69
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.190
uh, the scholars after Freeman did was to add

70
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.449
neuroscience into the equation. So they tried to investigate

71
00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.020
also neuroscience. And, but there were, you know, some

72
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.899
technicalities and some methodological problems and so we tried

73
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.490
to re-approach the, the issue like uh more than

74
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.738
10 years later, the the last study published and

75
00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:20.420
to, you know, to do a more fine grade

76
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.869
methodology. And what we did is that we expanded

77
00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.619
the set of keywords in order to, you know,

78
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.600
operationalize each of one of these sub-disciplines. And we

79
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320
use a sort of protocol to do that. So

80
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.920
we, uh, first, we identify the C term and

81
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.600
then we identify the potential of associated terms with

82
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.880
that C terms for each, you know, school of

83
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.839
thought and we run analysis on psyche info, which

84
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.899
is the official database of the APA, the American

85
00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:50.399
Psychological Association, to detect which of, which ones of

86
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.799
this indicator was, were in terms of frequent mostly

87
00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:58.859
associated with the seed terms. Um, FOR instance, you

88
00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:01.910
have, you know, um, the C term for, uh,

89
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.059
neuroscience, uh, um, was, uh, was, uh, newer, OK,

90
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.769
with the wildcard, and then we associate a list

91
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.220
of, um, of descriptors and we, we, at the

92
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.209
end, we got the, the, uh, the 10 indicator,

93
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.380
uh, which were most more um appropriate to investigate

94
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.209
neuroscience that where I'm just listing a few. Um,

95
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.410
uh, NEW, of course, the brain, nerve, and the

96
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.529
wildcard. The wildcard is an asterisk and it helps

97
00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.929
you retrieving all the words that end with different

98
00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:39.410
letters but that are associated with the, um, the

99
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.170
same route. For instance, when you have, um, you

100
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.570
know, um new asterisks, you can, you, you, you,

101
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.929
you can find uh neuroscience, uh, neural, and blah,

102
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.929
blah, blah, blah, blah. And so we, we, we,

103
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.809
we found for each one of this school of

104
00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.720
thought, a set of indicators and we inputed them

105
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.170
in specific field codes that these specific parts of

106
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.820
the document in order to be, for the analysis

107
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.309
to be easily replicable in the future. So we

108
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.725
investigated, uh, for instance, the title, the abstract. The

109
00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:14.825
keywords of the paper and the uh the um

110
00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:18.204
the APA keyboards were different from the keyboard, the

111
00:06:18.204 --> 00:06:21.024
keywords um selected by the authors and the, the

112
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:25.364
medical um subject headings, which are the keywords, um,

113
00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:28.679
the official keywords by department. And what we found,

114
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.089
and now we get to the most interesting part

115
00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.829
is that uh uh neuroscience, at least from the

116
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:39.450
1979 to 2020, which was the period we investigated

117
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.649
because of uh the um because some one indicator

118
00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.690
of the the influence of the journal was, you

119
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.369
know, um, available only for that uh kind of

120
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.809
period. Uh, IN that period, so from the 80s

121
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.209
to, to nowadays, the most important part of the,

122
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.170
um the most important subdiscipline in psychology is by

123
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.380
far neuroscience, by far. And that was kind of

124
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.220
underestimated by previous studies. And the second one is

125
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.220
cognitivism, of course, and we see that psychoanalysis and

126
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.700
behaviorism are in decline, especially, you know, especially psychoanalysis

127
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.149
but also behaviorism. And that is speaking of mainstream

128
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.839
psychology that is all, you know, peer reviewed journal

129
00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.329
indexed in psych info. Things get a little bit

130
00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.769
different when you uh focus just on highly influential

131
00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:35.970
journals. That is thanks to the social science journal

132
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.329
citation reports, which is, you know, official indexes of

133
00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:41.450
the impact factor on, on the journal. We were

134
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.929
able to detect for each one of your uh

135
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:47.769
investigated the most inf information journals in psychology. And

136
00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:51.429
we, uh, and we uh selected the, the 1st

137
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.660
4 of them. And we investigated the papers only

138
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.079
in that kind of journal. So representing, you know,

139
00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.140
very influent papers, which are different from the mainstream,

140
00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:04.230
uh, mainstream. And there, we found a similar but

141
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.390
kind of uh slightly different um scenarios, so in

142
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.029
which cognitivism is higher than neuroscience, and then we

143
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:13.670
have behaviorism and psych analysis. And then lastly but

144
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.630
not less importantly, we investigated non-English papers. That is

145
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.709
all, all papers, uh, which are published in non-English

146
00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:25.029
language, but of course, in order to have them

147
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.320
indexed inside info, you have to, to have, uh,

148
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.350
your original paper in your language, non-English language, but

149
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.130
also the title and the abstract and the keywords

150
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:37.109
in English. So you can investigate it through English

151
00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:39.140
keywords even though the paper is not in English.

152
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:42.308
And what we found in that specific source is

153
00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:47.630
that uh The, the, the psychoanalysis is still on

154
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.070
the, on the, on, you know, uh one of

155
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.270
the most important, uh, you know, uh school of

156
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.429
thought. And this is very, very interesting because this

157
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.489
is like a very different scenario from the scientific

158
00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:04.270
or my stream psychology. And some sanometric studies quite

159
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.359
robustly associate publishing in your, in your own language

160
00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:09.760
rather than English, if you're not an English speaker.

161
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.780
From the necessity to communicate with your local community

162
00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:16.090
and to have an impact on your local community

163
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.690
instead of, you know, having your career advanced if

164
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.010
you want to publish or super influential journals. And

165
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.770
so what we think is that psychoanalysis is still

166
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.090
very prevalent in clinical practice when, you know, clinicians

167
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.849
want to communicate the results to their uh niche,

168
00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:34.489
the, the, the, the, the social uh social niche.

169
00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:38.179
And, uh, but it is not important in terms

170
00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:41.929
of scientific, purely scientific endeavors. So it is still

171
00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:44.030
a, you know, common practice to help people in

172
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.030
their everyday lives, but it is not, you know,

173
00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:50.840
um, successful research program in the, in the scientific

174
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.900
landscape. And lastly, I want to notice that even

175
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.650
though we, I'm talking about percentage because of course,

176
00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:03.419
we, we computed relative frequencies, uh, what we found

177
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:08.460
is that the, uh, the majority of papers indexed

178
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.489
insideIfo are not tied to none of these theories.

179
00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:16.280
OK. Yeah, and that is very interesting because it

180
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.119
means maybe that the large part of psychology is

181
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.580
not tied to any specific grand theory about the

182
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.640
mind, but it's more like applied. And, and that

183
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.840
is psychology,

184
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:27.250
yeah,

185
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.049
and that points back to the non-paradigmatic issue, but

186
00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:31.570
maybe we have time to discuss about it.

187
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.570
Yeah, sure, sure. No, there are lots of interesting

188
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.760
things that you mentioned there. I mean one of

189
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.609
them. Uh, IS very, uh, I, I'm very curious

190
00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:42.929
about it because, of course, I don't know to

191
00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.250
what extent you could give us more information about

192
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.609
that, but when you mentioned that, for example, when

193
00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:54.159
you include the papers that were written in non-English

194
00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:58.739
languages, I mean, in other languages, that, that psychoanalysis

195
00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:01.609
was more prevalent at least when it comes to

196
00:11:01.609 --> 00:11:05.770
their, to its clinical applications. It's very interesting because

197
00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:10.455
I Is that this idea that outside of the

198
00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:14.445
English speaking world like the US, Canada, United Kingdom,

199
00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:20.335
in continental Europe, let's say even today psychoanalysis would

200
00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.046
have a very big presence.

201
00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:25.255
Yeah, definitely, yes, definitely, yes, especially if you, I

202
00:11:25.255 --> 00:11:28.606
mean, because there's a different aim, you know, in,

203
00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:31.216
in, of course, I, so I'm not a psychoanalysis,

204
00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:33.776
so I do respect psychoanalysis from a historical point

205
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.216
of view and I do think there are some.

206
00:11:35.322 --> 00:11:39.861
Interesting things still nowadays, if you think about intersubjective

207
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:42.572
psychoanalysis, if you think about scholars such as Fonagy

208
00:11:42.742 --> 00:11:45.502
in the UK and blah, blah, blah. But even

209
00:11:45.502 --> 00:11:47.541
though I respect some part of it, I, I,

210
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:50.021
I, I don't share at all, you know, the

211
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:53.062
theoretical assumptions about the mind from the psychoanalytic point

212
00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:54.861
of view because I don't think they're scientific. And

213
00:11:54.861 --> 00:11:57.341
so, you clearly see that at, at least, I

214
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.742
don't know if you're familiar with um Lakatos and

215
00:11:59.742 --> 00:12:02.841
his theory of um scientific progress, but it would,

216
00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:06.270
it would have said that. Seis is no longer

217
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:11.270
a generative progressive research program. So it doesn't have

218
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.400
any more some predictions, some new prediction to be

219
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.590
tested. And uh that leads, you know, is programmed

220
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.469
to advance and to be more competitive than other

221
00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:24.039
research programs. Because if you think, I don't know,

222
00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:26.659
if, if you have some insights about human behavior,

223
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.059
uh, and you can test them experimentally, I think

224
00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:34.150
that other subdisciplines would, would, uh, you know, outperform

225
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.309
psychlysis for sure. But still, in the clinical practice

226
00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:40.429
and as you mentioned in the Continental Europe, uh,

227
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.840
also academic clinical psychology scenario, also here in Italy,

228
00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:45.799
Psychology is still a big thing. When you go

229
00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.989
to the university, a lot of psychoanalysis is there

230
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.719
and you are trained, you know, many friends of

231
00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:54.760
mine still did a classical psychoanalytic training, which is

232
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.559
kind of problematic in my opinion, but still, it

233
00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:59.919
is uh it is something that is there and

234
00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:02.599
is real and alive, so we have to acknowledge

235
00:13:02.599 --> 00:13:03.239
it. Yeah.

236
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.140
Uh, NO, even here in Portugal, for example, I'm,

237
00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:10.369
I'm not sure if, uh, they still do that,

238
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.739
but at least up till 98 years ago, they

239
00:13:13.739 --> 00:13:18.340
were still teaching, uh, Freudian theory even in anthropology

240
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.770
courses. So, yeah.

241
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:23.500
And especially people from the humanities. And uh I

242
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.049
think there is uh uh the same study by

243
00:13:26.049 --> 00:13:30.179
uh Robin or Freeman also in the 90s. Demonstrative

244
00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.940
that psychoanalysis is still super popular among the humanists,

245
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.359
you know, so people from the, and also in,

246
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.099
in my personal life, when you talk with psychology,

247
00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:42.179
with someone who is coming from the humanities, such

248
00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.469
as philosophy, architecture, or even economics, but the Especially,

249
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.419
you know, that kind of, uh, you know, letters,

250
00:13:48.469 --> 00:13:52.190
that, that kind of, uh, uh, studies, and they

251
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.070
are all fascinated with, with psychoanalysis and that's kind

252
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.070
of, you know, annoying for me that they ah

253
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.590
do you know Freud, do you know Jung, especially

254
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.669
Laan. They love Laan. I hate Laan, you know.

255
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.510
I don't have anything personally with any Laanan, but

256
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.099
I, I, I, I really don't, can't stand Laan

257
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.630
as a, as a theorist. And so, yeah, but,

258
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.039
but it's still very, very, very popular and very,

259
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.989
because, because that is very catchy, you know, because

260
00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:20.190
I think that Freud did a wonderful job in

261
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.940
selling his ideas out, uh, his ideas to the,

262
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.469
to the, to the public because, you know, many

263
00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:29.229
ideas, I, I did a wonderful history of psychology

264
00:14:29.229 --> 00:14:32.729
course, uh, when I was graduate and my professor

265
00:14:32.729 --> 00:14:35.710
was kind of critic towards psychoanalysis and he showed

266
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.159
us how Freud took many ideas from the mainstream

267
00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:43.450
of the clinical psychology of the 19th century and

268
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.609
made them uh very palatable to the public. But,

269
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:50.770
you know, everyone, uh, already knew what the unconscious

270
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.729
was. Everyone already knew the importance of sexuality, and

271
00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:57.479
everyone already knew the importance of, um, you know,

272
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.320
uh, being in a In a kind of altered

273
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.000
state of consciousness during psychotherapy that is hypnosis to

274
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.229
get, uh, you know, your, your, your problems solved,

275
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.909
uh, and everyone knew, you know, and, uh, especially,

276
00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:14.960
for example, Pierre Janet, which is, uh, you know,

277
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.760
more on trend today. Uh, ALREADY knew the power

278
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.479
of distressing events that is traumatic events in determining

279
00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:24.320
your later adult life. So, you know, Freud did

280
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.710
something, of course, he was a genius, of course,

281
00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:30.440
but it was uh especially capable in selling his

282
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.640
ideas, I think. Yeah.

283
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.010
Yeah, I, I don't know what it is specifically

284
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.250
about psychoanalysis, but apparently it provides people with very

285
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.260
compelling psychological narratives. So, I mean, I

286
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.270
mean,

287
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.010
you even see it in Hitchcock movie. So, and

288
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.530
the narratives are actually very compelling, at least in

289
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.609
the movies. So when it comes to psychoanalysis more

290
00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:55.804
directly, I'm not so sure. But anyway, apparently. We

291
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:56.525
people love it.

292
00:15:56.604 --> 00:15:59.005
So, yeah, yeah, because, because they're very romantic, you

293
00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:00.965
know, and so it was very intelligent, you know,

294
00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:04.164
adopting these Greek names, so, you know, your Oedipus

295
00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:06.765
complex, your Elektra complex, and you have this very,

296
00:16:06.844 --> 00:16:08.575
you know, catchy things, you know, you, you, you

297
00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:11.354
feel like you're like almost a, a romantic hero,

298
00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:13.924
you know, in discovering your, your drives. And so

299
00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:16.955
it was, of course, I think that psychotherapy has

300
00:16:16.955 --> 00:16:22.265
to be somehow romantic, but uh I, not, not

301
00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:25.205
not necessary to that level, yes. Yeah.

302
00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.280
So, uh, another thing just before we get into

303
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.400
the paradigmatic bit, uh, uh, 11 comment that I

304
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.679
was going to make is that it's interesting how

305
00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:40.270
sometimes we carve up the different disciplines and how

306
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.830
we create different branches because I would imagine that

307
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:49.320
many people who identify as neuroscientists wouldn't identify themselves

308
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.460
as psychologists. Or of being part of a branch

309
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.130
of psychology. I mean, many times we look at

310
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.369
neuroscience as something separate from psychology,

311
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.460
right? Yeah, yeah, definitely, uh, well, it depends on

312
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.160
your assumptions about the nature of the mind. I,

313
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.390
I'm very passionate about the philosophy of mind, uh,

314
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.569
generally speaking, and, but, and I, I do, I,

315
00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:14.459
I, I have a materialist, so I don't think

316
00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:17.959
we have. You know, uh, you know, we, I,

317
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.810
I, I, I, I also think we, we have

318
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.729
a spirit, uh, but I'm, I'm a sort of,

319
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.939
of pine psychist, but still, I, I do spend

320
00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:29.099
some time in thinking about the very nature of

321
00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:33.140
the mind and, uh, as you mentioned, um, many

322
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:40.025
neuroscience. Don't identify themselves as a psychologist because they

323
00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:43.785
are kind of skeptical about psychology and they want

324
00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:45.224
to do, you know, hard science. We, we are

325
00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:47.984
doing the real stuff here, guys, no. So, and

326
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.545
they don't want to be, you know, uh, merged

327
00:17:50.545 --> 00:17:53.454
with someone that they see as something less scientific

328
00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:59.000
or or like softer. Um, PROBLEM is, uh, that,

329
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.530
yes, and yes, I, I think that, uh, some

330
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.410
neuroscientists do not identify themselves as a psychologists even

331
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.890
though the majority of them, uh, don't, never spend

332
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.935
properly uh their time in. Setting at least to

333
00:18:14.935 --> 00:18:18.535
themselves privately the question of what mind is because

334
00:18:18.535 --> 00:18:20.824
if you, if you, if you, if you try

335
00:18:20.824 --> 00:18:23.015
to answer that question, it's a very difficult question,

336
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:25.625
but it's very difficult that you see the brain

337
00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:28.984
as, as, as something completely detached from our mental

338
00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:31.074
life. So you are a psychologist in a sense.

339
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.449
And, but I, uh, I would also say, uh,

340
00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.359
this to be noted that, uh, I, I have

341
00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:41.359
a, a conversation with Andre Bittermann who, who is,

342
00:18:41.439 --> 00:18:44.079
uh, you know, a brilliant, um, uh, yeah, a

343
00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:48.119
brilliant, uh, scholar in meta-science, some science about science,

344
00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:50.439
this kind of study, and he said to me

345
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.439
that uh like Info as, um, you know, in

346
00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:57.510
the last years, it, it has incorporated more and

347
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.859
more uh journals, purely neuroscientific journals. And so maybe

348
00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:06.109
our results are slightly biased in a, um, you

349
00:19:06.109 --> 00:19:08.949
know, overestimation of neuroscience, but still I would say

350
00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:12.859
that it is undoubtedly the, the most prominent approach

351
00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:15.310
in uh in psychology as for now, yeah, yeah,

352
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.469
I,

353
00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:17.189
I mean it was just a comment. It was

354
00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:20.750
just that I think that many neuroscientists out there

355
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.630
would position themselves closer to something like biology than

356
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.739
psychology, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh,

357
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.319
and at a certain point in the same, I

358
00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:34.439
think it's in the same study, you say that

359
00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:38.979
the study supports the inference that scientific psychology is

360
00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:43.780
a non-paradigmatic or pre-paradigmatic discipline. So could you explain

361
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.030
that and also what a paradigm is exactly? Yeah,

362
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.619
yeah, definitely. So I, I would explain it through

363
00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:54.199
an example. So if you go to a physicist.

364
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.619
Even an undergraduate in physicists, in in physics and

365
00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:02.140
ask them, well, what is the force or what

366
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.780
is energy? It is very likely they will all

367
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.939
answer the same. So I have the definition here.

368
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.979
So a force is an influence that can cause

369
00:20:09.979 --> 00:20:13.939
an object to change its velocity unless counterbalanced by

370
00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:17.420
other forces, and there is a specific measure, you

371
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.780
know, to, um, to, uh, to, to measure the,

372
00:20:20.859 --> 00:20:22.699
the force which is the Newton and no one

373
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:24.380
is going to debate about it. And the Newton

374
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.579
is a specific formula. Which is kilogramx meter per

375
00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:32.099
squared second, and no one is going to discuss

376
00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:34.109
about it. And if you ask them what is

377
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:37.469
in an energy, they will likely answer energy is

378
00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.670
the capacity to, to do work and it has

379
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.630
a specific formula and no one is going to

380
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.030
debate about it. And if you go to a

381
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.939
biologist and you ask them what is a gene.

382
00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:48.959
No one is going like very, very few people,

383
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.689
maybe less than 1%. WILL be doubtful about the

384
00:20:52.689 --> 00:20:55.599
genus. So a gene is a sequence of nucleotide

385
00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:58.010
bases which are blah, blah blah blah blah. And

386
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.530
if you ask them what an inflammation is, everyone

387
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.420
is going to agree. Well, if you go to

388
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.170
a psychologist and uh ask them what emotion is

389
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.660
or intelligence is and not to speak about the

390
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.900
basic term of cognition, for instance, or mind or

391
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.500
consciousness. And, uh, and if you go, for instance,

392
00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.260
I have a background in clinical psychology and I

393
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.130
study clinical psychology. So if you go and ask

394
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.420
what is attachment, if you go to a, the,

395
00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:29.130
the developmental psychologist and ask what, what is attachment,

396
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.540
they will answer one thing. If you go to

397
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.780
a personality psychology and you ask them what is

398
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.170
attachment, they will ask another thing. Similar but different.

399
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.540
And you ask, you know, clinical psychology, what is

400
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.589
trauma? Uh, EVEN in the most recent APA and

401
00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:44.640
Book of trauma, there is no universal definition of

402
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.750
trauma, you know, there are, there is no events

403
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.349
in the world which is traumatic by definition. It's

404
00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:54.579
not speaking of mental disorder, depression, and, and whatever.

405
00:21:55.219 --> 00:21:58.589
And so, uh, this is very interesting because uh

406
00:21:58.589 --> 00:22:01.969
like trying to also uh addressing your question about

407
00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:04.339
the nature of the paradigm and the Thomas Kohn

408
00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:07.699
because, you know, the, the philosophy of science which

409
00:22:07.699 --> 00:22:09.780
is tied to the concept of paradigm was developed

410
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.819
by Thomas Kuhn in the 60s. And what is

411
00:22:12.819 --> 00:22:15.650
very, what like struck me when I uh read

412
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.209
again the structure of the scientific revolutions, which is

413
00:22:18.209 --> 00:22:21.250
the, the book that he published in 1962 about

414
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.650
this kind of theory. Uh, HE stated, like, I'm,

415
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.900
I'm, I'm citing him literally because in the preface

416
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.060
of the, of the, of the, of the book,

417
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.790
he said at page 9 and 10, some, uh,

418
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.510
so it was invited, so this is the, the,

419
00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:40.469
you know, the thing to know before a hearing

420
00:22:40.469 --> 00:22:43.069
to this, to the quote. It was invited at

421
00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:46.270
the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Science

422
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.810
at Stanford University. So he spent some time there

423
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.589
as a, as a, you know, um, visiting scholar.

424
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.630
And he said some, when he was there for

425
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.270
a, you know, for a for a uh a

426
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.270
period, then he said, somehow the practice of astronomy,

427
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.949
physics, chemistry or biology normally fails to evoke the

428
00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:12.949
controversies over fundamentals that today seem endemic among, say,

429
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:18.589
psychologists or sociologists, OK? Attempting to discover the source

430
00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:21.810
of that difference that is very important, led me

431
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.469
to recognize the role in scientific research of what

432
00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:28.329
I since called paradigm. And so this is, this

433
00:23:28.329 --> 00:23:32.089
is mind-blowing because Thomas Kuhn was prompt to uh

434
00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:36.290
create his, you know, super inf influential uh theory

435
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.849
when he discovered like personally, the chaos you, you,

436
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.410
you, you, you, you, you have as a, you

437
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.680
know, as a, as a training psychologist or even

438
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.079
as a, uh, you know, licensed psychology or a

439
00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:50.089
scholar in psychology which is chaos, pure chaos. And

440
00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:52.810
uh I also published a paper about it. We

441
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:58.040
compared In 12 introductory books to psychology and the

442
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.189
APA Dictionary of Psychology, um, uh, you know, uh,

443
00:24:02.199 --> 00:24:05.199
some definition of core constructs of, uh, of psychology,

444
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:08.079
you know, like mind, consciousness, intelligence, and all the

445
00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.880
definitions differ for, for, for, for, for, for the

446
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.599
major part. And so, There is a paradigm. A

447
00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:17.680
paradigm is in, there is also, you know, uh,

448
00:24:17.719 --> 00:24:20.030
a codebcoon in this regard, but I would say

449
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.260
that I would define it as a hardcore set

450
00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:29.630
of methodological and ontological assumptions uh about the subject

451
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.839
of studies, and that is we know we have

452
00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:37.160
to study this thing and we know how to

453
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.880
study this thing and no one is going to

454
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.560
debate over how to study it and what to

455
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.780
study. And uh Kuhn called it the, the, mm

456
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.660
m puzzle sol solving activity that is, we have,

457
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.540
we know how to do that and then we

458
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.010
have a different, you know, um puzzles to solve,

459
00:24:54.069 --> 00:24:55.739
but we know how to solve it, you know.

460
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.229
And the interesting thing is that the para the

461
00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:03.989
para paradigmatic status of psychology is, has always been

462
00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:06.670
acknowledged by leading scholars in the field. So if

463
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.069
you, if, if, if you go to James back

464
00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:11.430
in the um William James at the end of

465
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.979
the 20th century.

466
00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:15.540
The 19th century, I

467
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.849
think, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, at the end

468
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.930
of, of the, of the 19th century, he, uh,

469
00:25:19.969 --> 00:25:22.410
at the end of his book The Psychology Brier

470
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.550
course, he said that psychology, uh, it at the

471
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.349
stage of physics before Newton or chemistry before Lavo

472
00:25:30.349 --> 00:25:33.849
wasisi. OK. But this kind of, uh, this kind

473
00:25:33.849 --> 00:25:37.790
of quote was, this kind of claim was. YOU

474
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.709
know, uh, endorsed repeatedly over the course of scientific

475
00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:43.619
psychology by very diverse scholar, and they're very famous

476
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.469
such as Vigosky. I don't know if you know

477
00:25:45.469 --> 00:25:47.699
him, but the, you know, very influential developmental psychologist.

478
00:25:47.989 --> 00:25:50.270
He spoke about the crisis of psychologist in the

479
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.910
20s and then uh uh Edelbrecher in the 30s,

480
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.349
and the rombach himself in the 50s, he, he

481
00:25:57.349 --> 00:26:01.530
compared the uh the scientific psychology to a circus.

482
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.290
It did it like literally. And then Kohl, as

483
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.160
I, as I said before, then Sigmund Koch was

484
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.319
a very important scholar in the 80s. And then

485
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:13.699
we have no less known uh psychologists who nevertheless,

486
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.170
they dedicated all their lives in studying this thing,

487
00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:19.839
which is, which it is, uh, which was called

488
00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:22.959
by Sigmund Koch and then later by Gregory Rs

489
00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:25.310
as the problem of psychology. So we don't have,

490
00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:29.410
uh, we don't have a shared theory. And, and

491
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.900
we are certainly at another stage of scientific development,

492
00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:36.839
um, in, in respect to chemistry or physics or

493
00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:37.640
biology

494
00:26:38.069 --> 00:26:42.579
and, and so this is still true in 2024,

495
00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:47.410
I would say and, and that yes. I would

496
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.550
say yes, yes, yeah, so,

497
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.880
so let, let me ask you, uh, I, I

498
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.079
don't know if you can answer this question exactly,

499
00:26:57.199 --> 00:27:00.030
but Well, I mean, what would you say are

500
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.439
perhaps some of the reasons why over the course

501
00:27:02.439 --> 00:27:07.349
of more than 100 years, apparently the same problem

502
00:27:07.349 --> 00:27:10.119
is still here in psychology.

503
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.300
It's a big question. I think this, this is

504
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.099
the question, $1 billion dollar question. I think, uh,

505
00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:23.459
I think there are, there are two different, uh,

506
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.979
main reasons. The first one is the hardest one

507
00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.810
and I don't know if we will ever be

508
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:35.290
able to solve it. Um, THAT is, I would

509
00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.250
say 3 reasons. Uh, LIKE the first one is

510
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.599
the, you know, very famous hard problem of consciousness

511
00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.050
that it is very difficult to integrate what we

512
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.010
are from the objective point of view and from

513
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.510
the subjective point of view. Mhm. And then the

514
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.390
second one is the, that is true, is the

515
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.390
complexity of the human mind and behavior. We are

516
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.459
inherently complex and it is inherently difficult to, uh,

517
00:28:01.469 --> 00:28:04.239
maybe we will have better to, I think that

518
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.219
we have a wonderful, uh pro promising line of

519
00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:11.069
research speaking of behavioral genetics in the, in the

520
00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:13.510
years to come. But still, I don't know if

521
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.380
we will have a major shared theory. And the

522
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.969
third problem, which is also linked to the fact

523
00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:24.449
that um evolutionary psychology is no, is, is, um,

524
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.540
could be more prominent in the evolution in the,

525
00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.619
in, in, in the broader study of psychology, but

526
00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:34.750
it is not. Is that And you interviewed Dan

527
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.650
Serber, so you know it very well that we,

528
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.459
as human, one compelling uh evolutionary theory is that,

529
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.900
that our reason, our capacity to reason is not

530
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.979
driven by the uh necessity to seek an objective

531
00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:53.750
truth, but rather to persuade the other, the other's

532
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.969
humans socially. And so we seem to be hardwired

533
00:28:56.969 --> 00:28:59.739
from the biological point of view to conflate the

534
00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:03.140
descriptive is. So this is a mechanism and this

535
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.630
is the way it works with. The rather morally

536
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.079
out. So this is should be how things should,

537
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.520
should be. And so this is very problematic, for

538
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.800
instance, for evolutionary psychology when they talk about gender

539
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.829
difference or violence or homicide or I don't know,

540
00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:22.880
uh, stereotypes and, and, and the problem, the main

541
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.430
problem which I see in many scientists as well,

542
00:29:25.719 --> 00:29:28.800
which should be at least less biased in this

543
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.719
regard is that you, you can't conflate the descriptive

544
00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:33.699
is with the moral. Oh, they are completely different

545
00:29:33.699 --> 00:29:37.060
level. If I say this is um how the

546
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.420
mind uh uh this is how um the mind

547
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.140
of a, of a rapist works and I'm trying

548
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.109
to, to understand the rapist, the, the rapists. I,

549
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.660
I'm not trying to justify his behaviors or his

550
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.099
or her behaviors because that, that, that, that, that

551
00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:54.099
would be nonsense. And so I think that it

552
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:57.890
is very difficult to have an objective psychology because

553
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.369
you Uh, there, there is, you know, uh, the,

554
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.050
the, the, this, this, um, this problem that um

555
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:13.030
You are studying something, someone or something uh the

556
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.920
consciousness of understanding the theory you are proposing. And

557
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.280
use them as they wish to justify themselves. And

558
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.040
so this is problematic. And so this is very

559
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.880
problematic. I, I, I, I mean, if we study

560
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.199
the birds and their social behaviors, no birds is

561
00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:30.920
going to see, ah, you told me in a

562
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.650
paper that I'm more prone naturally to rape uh

563
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.839
the other birds, female birds, so I can do

564
00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:38.079
that. But if you speak about humans. That is

565
00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:40.969
difficult. So it is a major, a major obstacle,

566
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.810
I think. Yeah.

567
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.199
And do you think that perhaps another problem here,

568
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:48.119
and this is something you also mentioned in your

569
00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:50.119
paper, but I'm not sure if you would call

570
00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:53.199
it a problem, it has to do with the

571
00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:57.250
insularity of the different sub-disciplines in psychology.

572
00:30:58.349 --> 00:31:03.770
Yes, definitely. Uh, CAUSE, so, um, I don't know

573
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.729
if you, you know, uh, I, as, as an

574
00:31:05.729 --> 00:31:08.609
academic, uh, I, uh, I spent a lot of

575
00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:11.369
time, uh, and I'm still understanding if I want

576
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:13.089
to be an academic for all my life, but

577
00:31:13.089 --> 00:31:14.130
I spent a lot of my time, you know,

578
00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:17.650
reading the description of the journals when you want

579
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.969
to submit a paper. And all of them, they

580
00:31:19.969 --> 00:31:22.170
claim to be interdisciplinary. It, it is very cool

581
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.650
to claim I am interdisciplinary. Oh, this is an

582
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.180
interdisciplinary journal. And actually, when you go to the

583
00:31:28.535 --> 00:31:32.135
Evidence, uh, it is very, for instance, there is

584
00:31:32.135 --> 00:31:37.614
a study published in the 2014 by Klia, I

585
00:31:37.614 --> 00:31:42.885
think, yeah, and, uh, theylia Russo, and they, uh,

586
00:31:42.895 --> 00:31:46.214
show that in clinical psychology they uh investigated the

587
00:31:46.454 --> 00:31:51.255
a humanistic school of thought, psychoanalysis, and, um, I

588
00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:55.265
think cognitivism and a cognitive behavioral approach and they

589
00:31:56.349 --> 00:32:00.369
found that each one of school of thought is

590
00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:03.209
likely to mention all, only the papers to each

591
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:04.780
and one school of thought. So there is this

592
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.530
very, you know, uh compar compartmentalization. And also in

593
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.369
our study, we, uh, you know, the large majority

594
00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:18.930
of intersections between this first call of thought with

595
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.589
the exception of a Uh, cognitivism and neuroscience, which

596
00:32:22.589 --> 00:32:26.510
are largely contaminated and to a lesser extent between

597
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.869
behaviorism and neuroscience, which there is also a contamination

598
00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:34.030
there, um, are kind of negligible, at least if

599
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.069
compared to the broader scenario of the, of the

600
00:32:37.069 --> 00:32:41.030
prominence to the, to the other theories. And um

601
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.750
of course, it is just, you know, a thought

602
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.380
we have to uh ponder more more about it

603
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.719
and do other studies, but this easily matches uh

604
00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:52.390
also my personal experience as an academic, you know,

605
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.170
we, um, and this is linked to a broader

606
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:59.699
problem of uh of, of the Current academic landscapes.

607
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.739
So people are interested in publishing, publishing, publishing, and

608
00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:06.489
they have very few time to reading, to read

609
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.339
properly, to read not only in their field of

610
00:33:09.339 --> 00:33:11.380
research, but generally speaking. And I, uh, and I

611
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.859
have personally met some people who were very recognized

612
00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:19.199
in that specific field and they did know anything,

613
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.949
anything, not on psychology broadly speaking, but in the

614
00:33:22.949 --> 00:33:27.790
super closer field of research because they didn't uh

615
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.910
didn't care, they, they did not have the time

616
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.069
and blah, blah, blah. And so I do think

617
00:33:32.069 --> 00:33:34.939
there is a major problem. We, we don't have,

618
00:33:34.949 --> 00:33:40.150
you know, uh, you know, the Renaissance uh model

619
00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:44.439
of intellectual who spent Uh, a lot of time

620
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:47.040
trying to be interdisciplinar, of course, it is impossible

621
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.040
nowadays to be like purely interdisciplinear because the amount

622
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.729
of knowledge is, you know, uh, unmanageable. It's not

623
00:33:53.729 --> 00:33:57.339
feasible. It's not feasible, but not, I mean, not

624
00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:02.959
that hyperspecialization would be beneficial. And so, yes, so

625
00:34:02.959 --> 00:34:05.319
I think, I think that, uh, the lack of

626
00:34:05.319 --> 00:34:08.560
cross, cross fertilization is, is indeed the problem nowadays,

627
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:08.929
yes.

628
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.300
OK, so let's now talk about uh the work

629
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.458
you've done on evolutionary psychology specifically because, uh, David

630
00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:21.100
bus a few years ago, I think in 2020

631
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.728
or something like that called it a scientific revolution.

632
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.179
So we've already talked about paradigms here. So first

633
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.208
of all, what is a scientific revolution and then

634
00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:36.340
we can talk about his claims specifically. Yeah,

635
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.530
yeah, definitely. So I would say that the best

636
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.850
thing to Uh, understand what the scientific revolution is,

637
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.860
is to briefly, um, you know, uh, understand how,

638
00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.750
uh, you know, the progress of science of occurs

639
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.590
according to KO. And the first, uh, stage is

640
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.149
the prepardigmatic stage, and we are, we are, we

641
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:57.949
have talked about it. So we have plenty of

642
00:34:57.949 --> 00:35:01.389
schools who disagree over fundamentals. For instance, Newton, and

643
00:35:01.389 --> 00:35:05.500
Newton, for instance, Kohn, um made the example of

644
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.959
uh uh optics. Before, um, the, the, the book

645
00:35:10.959 --> 00:35:13.959
Optics by Newton and it said that there were

646
00:35:13.959 --> 00:35:17.439
different uh ontologies and methodology. There was the Aristotelian

647
00:35:17.439 --> 00:35:19.520
School of Though, the Epicurean School of Thought, the

648
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.840
Platonic School of Thought, and they hold a different

649
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.639
ontologists and methodologies. But then, uh, and this is

650
00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:29.919
the prepardigmatic stage. And then, but then the book

651
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:32.919
by Newton came out and it was a watershed.

652
00:35:33.689 --> 00:35:39.610
And, um, and slowly, um, uh, people in optics

653
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:44.310
began to understand that uh the best way of

654
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.530
explaining uh things was not Aristotelian and epium protonima

655
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.649
was the new part new, new research program initiated

656
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:57.100
by, um, by Newton. And this gradually took over

657
00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.889
the other, uh, the other school of thought. And,

658
00:36:00.919 --> 00:36:03.000
and so when a school, uh, when, when, uh,

659
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.719
you know, a rising school of thought, after years

660
00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:08.530
and after, you know, um, of course, it, it,

661
00:36:08.679 --> 00:36:10.840
it is not that linear, but after, you know,

662
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.070
going against, um, different kind of scientific sociological or

663
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.919
psychological oppositions becomes the norm. And you have 3

664
00:36:18.919 --> 00:36:23.560
indexes in order to understand that. Uh, um, uh,

665
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.330
uh, A school of thought has become a paradigm.

666
00:36:26.449 --> 00:36:29.879
So you have a first stage prepardigmatics. Second stage,

667
00:36:29.929 --> 00:36:32.969
scientific revolution. And when you attain the first stage,

668
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.370
which is called the state of normal science, you

669
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.290
can understand that now we are in a normal

670
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.129
science period by 3 indexes according to Ku. First,

671
00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.070
Uh, what you have in intro, you know, the

672
00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:50.010
theory is the customary practice a newborn in the

673
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.139
that discipline is exposed to. And you can look

674
00:36:53.139 --> 00:36:56.169
at it easily in, in introductory books, uh, uh,

675
00:36:56.179 --> 00:37:00.310
to, um, um, given to uh undergraduate. So, imagine

676
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.449
physics, physics. If you go to different physics university

677
00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:07.090
and you consult different introductory books. They will say

678
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.209
almost the same, maybe with slightly different, but no

679
00:37:09.209 --> 00:37:11.330
one is, is going to disagree over Newton, over,

680
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.129
over, you know, the Newton, the um the measure

681
00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:17.090
unit or, or, or, or job or anything. And

682
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.889
if you go to bio biologist, uh, biology uh

683
00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:24.209
department, you know, uh, each one of these introductory

684
00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:27.290
books will talk about Darwin and Mendel and the,

685
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.969
and Fisher and the modern synthesis. Again, if you

686
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:32.570
go into psychology, that is kind of different. But

687
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.929
you have this kind of first index. Then secondly,

688
00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:38.959
uh, the scholar in that discipline do not have

689
00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:43.560
to justify themselves when they uh explain their theory.

690
00:37:43.729 --> 00:37:46.570
So I, I, I take for, for granted that

691
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:51.250
everyone agrees about uh what a gene is or

692
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.040
what a Newton is. And then the third index

693
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.610
is the progressive marginalization of other scholars. For instance,

694
00:37:59.689 --> 00:38:01.770
I don't think that no one, there is no

695
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.969
one in physics nowadays that is called themselves Aristotelic

696
00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:09.050
or Platonic or epicurean and, or, you know, and,

697
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.360
and, mm like very few, few, few people in

698
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.330
biology call them creationists. I, I think almost no

699
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.739
one after Darwin. And so this is the kind

700
00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:22.280
of normal science. But then, uh, and so the

701
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.449
paradigm, because, uh, the, um, the paradigm is occurring

702
00:38:26.449 --> 00:38:29.080
in that stage. So the scientific revolution is the

703
00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.870
2nd, 2nd stage. And then what may happen is

704
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.709
that it, uh, that the scientific uh Uh endeavors

705
00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:40.620
might be facing some, some anomalies, so some, uh,

706
00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:44.659
things that you cannot explain thanks to your usual

707
00:38:45.629 --> 00:38:49.129
normal science uh perspective and then you encounter a

708
00:38:49.129 --> 00:38:51.959
phase of crisis, which is the first stage. And

709
00:38:51.959 --> 00:38:55.600
then maybe another theory similar to the optics takes

710
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.719
over because it is better than the other ones

711
00:38:57.719 --> 00:38:59.719
and you have a scientific revolution again. And then

712
00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:01.679
normal science and then again, and then this kind

713
00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:04.800
of uh endless cycle. But of course, this kind

714
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.600
of um uh watershed event occurs in a relatively

715
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.320
long period of time. You don't have a paradigm

716
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.439
shift in one, you know, one, you know, every

717
00:39:13.439 --> 00:39:15.760
10 years, but we are speaking about centuries or

718
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.879
we are speaking about, about long times nevertheless. So

719
00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:21.830
a scientific revolution according to Kunn. And that is

720
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.669
why I, I took the instance by David by

721
00:39:24.669 --> 00:39:29.629
some critically, is that something that you can easily

722
00:39:29.629 --> 00:39:32.860
understand, you know, if a scientific revolution has occurred

723
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.669
or, or even if it is happening, happening as

724
00:39:36.669 --> 00:39:40.100
we speak, you can see it in different indexes,

725
00:39:40.189 --> 00:39:42.989
but the one I chose to investigate was The,

726
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.600
the, the prominence because as I, I, uh, as

727
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.810
I said before, 11 index of the scientific revolution

728
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.909
is that you are gradually taking over the other

729
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.479
competitors. And so, uh, that is why I decided

730
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:57.270
what to do and uh to, to investigate from

731
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.750
the bibliometric point of view, devolutionary psychology research program

732
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.040
against its main competitor, which is the standard social

733
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.959
science model, yeah.

734
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:08.459
Yeah, and we're going to talk about the results

735
00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:11.179
you got there, but just before that, just to

736
00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:15.800
be clear, in his 2020 paper, does David Bs

737
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.979
use the term scientific revolution in the Kian way

738
00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:21.629
as well?

739
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.639
Yes, so, yeah, so he, he never cited the

740
00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:29.020
structure of scientific revolution, but it was, um, very,

741
00:40:29.379 --> 00:40:34.020
you know, very, um. Closely to do that because

742
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.129
he used the Kunian lexicon. So speaking of scientific

743
00:40:37.129 --> 00:40:41.399
revolution, paradigm shift, and it, it, it, it did

744
00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:44.429
some, you know, quite Kunian uh examples such as,

745
00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:47.429
you know, he, he said that evolutionary psychology was

746
00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:51.459
the same as Copernicus Elegenri's theory, which was actually

747
00:40:51.459 --> 00:40:53.909
a paradigm shift in aunian sense because no one

748
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.560
today, uh, unless you know, uh, some very crazy

749
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.040
people believes that the, the earth is at the

750
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.679
center of the universe. So, and, and also it

751
00:41:03.679 --> 00:41:07.610
analyzed the history of psychology applying this Kuian perspective,

752
00:41:07.649 --> 00:41:09.169
you know, we say, oh we had back in

753
00:41:09.169 --> 00:41:12.770
the days we had the structuralism and then uh

754
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.570
behaviorism takes over and then cognitivism and then ah

755
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.090
now we have evolutionary psychology.

756
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.820
Yeah. Right. So, tell us then about the bibliometric

757
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.719
analysis you did there when it comes to the

758
00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:29.959
prevalence of evolutionary psychology within psychology more broadly. And

759
00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:32.760
also, you compared it, I think, to what the

760
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.879
Cosmides and John to be in the early 90s

761
00:41:35.879 --> 00:41:40.989
called the standard social model uh approach in psychology,

762
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.840
which, which is sort of the more sociocultural approach.

763
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.080
THE more environmentalist approach. So, uh, how do you,

764
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.770
do you do that and what results did you

765
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:50.969
get

766
00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:54.129
there? OK, so basically the, the methodology was kind

767
00:41:54.129 --> 00:41:56.889
of similar to the one I described before. So

768
00:41:56.889 --> 00:42:00.600
first of all, uh, we investigated the APA Zaurus,

769
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.209
which is, you know, the official controlled vocabulary of

770
00:42:04.209 --> 00:42:08.010
the APA and basically it is a controlled vocabulary

771
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:12.030
because it controls for redundancy. For instance, uh, the

772
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:16.989
word work-related injuries is used to design work-related injuries,

773
00:42:17.149 --> 00:42:21.919
workplace injuries, occupational injuries, and occupational-related injuries. So, when

774
00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:25.379
you type in psyching for occupational-related injuries, the official,

775
00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:28.909
uh, name, it is associated with is work, work-related

776
00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:31.629
injuries. So we, in order to use some keywords,

777
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.590
we started looking at the APA to Zavros. And

778
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.709
then we chose, as, as, as we did in

779
00:42:36.709 --> 00:42:39.989
the other study, someit terms, that is evolutionary psychology

780
00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:44.030
and sociocultural factors, respectively for the evolutionary psychology and

781
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.760
standard social science model. Hence for EP and SSM

782
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.330
to be the faster. And, and then we investigated

783
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.209
because the APASauros is a hierarchical structure. So um

784
00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:57.300
it has like more important names and then it,

785
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.370
it has uh narrower terms and related terms who

786
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.810
are on the same level. And we investigated, uh,

787
00:43:02.889 --> 00:43:07.959
you know, quantatively, I think 60 or 70, um,

788
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:12.120
you know, um. Names and then we decided qualitatively

789
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.439
what uh to use for our uh from with

790
00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:18.639
I, I, I was alone in this paper. I

791
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:21.469
decided what, what to do in the, with the,

792
00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:24.320
or which specific um descriptor to use. You know,

793
00:43:24.419 --> 00:43:26.760
you, you, you could also use a quantitative uh

794
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.199
uh way of deciding what indicators to use, but

795
00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:33.360
it wasn't, you know, preferable in this study. And

796
00:43:33.699 --> 00:43:37.020
Uh, for instance, for EP we have animal behavior,

797
00:43:37.139 --> 00:43:41.340
animal cognition, animal communication, behavioral genetics, and blah blah

798
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.129
blah. Uh,

799
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.290
ALSO you would classify behavioral genetics as being part

800
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.820
of EP in this case.

801
00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:49.820
Yeah, definitely, yes, because, uh, this is a beautiful

802
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.810
question because I decided to investigate EP broadly speaking.

803
00:43:54.459 --> 00:43:57.300
So not the Santa Barbara AP, so you know,

804
00:43:57.379 --> 00:43:59.820
with the massive modularity and the EEA assumption and

805
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.899
all the, the, that kind of stuff, but More

806
00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:06.820
broadly, because, you know, you have the standard social

807
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.899
science model, which is a heuristics used by Tubian

808
00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:12.489
Cosmide. There is no, you know, department uh in

809
00:44:12.489 --> 00:44:14.820
somewhere in the world called the SSM and there

810
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.260
is no one who called themselves SSM because it's

811
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.939
kind of derogatory. And, and so, and so I,

812
00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.300
I, I, I would identify quite uh broadly the

813
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.899
SSM and so I wanted to assure EP to

814
00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:30.419
be as broad as the SSM. And so what

815
00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:33.229
I try to do is not Not to compare

816
00:44:33.229 --> 00:44:36.979
the Santa Barbara AP against the SSM, but broadly

817
00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:42.179
all approaches or all papers actually who mentioned um

818
00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:48.719
e evolutionary laden concept. And, uh, you know, standard

819
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:53.949
culturalist concept to to operationalize uh the vision that

820
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.959
nature is important or culture is important, right? And

821
00:44:57.959 --> 00:45:00.840
which is kind of dichotomic, but we, we will

822
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.439
see not that much. And, and so, uh, yeah,

823
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.080
I do think that behavioral genetics is somehow, you

824
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.110
know, uh evolutionary laden because the basic assumption of

825
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.600
behavioral genetics is that genes are very important to

826
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.379
in determining your behavior. And unless you think that

827
00:45:17.379 --> 00:45:21.100
genes are untied to the evolutionary process, which is

828
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.379
impossible, still you are somehow tied to, to evolution.

829
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.560
Yeah, no, no, but it's very important that you

830
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.520
mentioned that and I asked you more about that

831
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.520
because many people would probably not classify behavior genetics

832
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.080
under evolutionary psychology. They would think about them as

833
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.030
two different disciplines. And also, I mean, there are

834
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.560
there are people who are trying theoretically to integrate

835
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.050
evolutionary psychology. Behavioral genetics, but actually if you talk

836
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:56.040
with a behavior gene geneticist and an evolutionary psychologist,

837
00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.120
uh, their methodologies and what they're trying to study,

838
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.030
uh, many times are very different things,

839
00:46:03.209 --> 00:46:06.250
definitely, yes, definitely, yes. So yeah, I, I, I,

840
00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:07.929
you know, I made that very clear in the

841
00:46:07.929 --> 00:46:10.250
paper that I was investigating a broad sense evolutionary

842
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.270
psychology and not the. The famous one by the

843
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:18.629
EP, the Santa Barbara one, and um, so for

844
00:46:18.629 --> 00:46:21.699
instance, I also include the human behavioral ecology which

845
00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:22.500
is, you know,

846
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.260
so that that that's interesting because many people would

847
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.080
say that that is part of anthropology.

848
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.340
Yeah, but still they are, uh, yes, but still

849
00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.570
they are um studying human behavior, uh, uh, with,

850
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.500
uh, evolutionary assumptions, even though they are kind of

851
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.139
different from the ones, uh, from the DP, but

852
00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:46.860
still there is this, there is this underlying assumption

853
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.860
which is, uh, evolution is important, is important in

854
00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.179
order to understand human behavior, and we can debate

855
00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:57.500
over the methodology or whatever, but there is a

856
00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:01.060
very huge assumption. And I, I, I still don't

857
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.179
think how uh scientists could ignore evolution because of

858
00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:06.580
course, no one in the SSM program would deny

859
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.139
that we are product of the, of evolution, but

860
00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:14.439
somehow, I don't know how, how they um say

861
00:47:14.439 --> 00:47:16.969
that it's not that important. It, it is almost

862
00:47:16.969 --> 00:47:21.750
negligible. And, uh, and so, um, yeah, so this

863
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:24.669
is the, you know, the, the fighting between the

864
00:47:24.669 --> 00:47:27.229
um and if you think about it, it is

865
00:47:27.229 --> 00:47:30.750
a, a long standing fight in between the in

866
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:34.919
philosophy was the fight between Inati and em. So,

867
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.655
I asked you about you. Behavioral ecology because I

868
00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:42.094
know that there are many human behavioral ecologists that

869
00:47:42.094 --> 00:47:45.534
are not very fond of the evolutionary psychologists and

870
00:47:45.534 --> 00:47:50.854
they they present themselves as studying ecology and ecological

871
00:47:50.854 --> 00:47:53.965
factors tend to be environmental factors and not,

872
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:57.614
yeah, definitely, definitely, yeah, I would say the Santa

873
00:47:57.614 --> 00:47:59.935
Barbara IP is somehow, you know, a lot of

874
00:47:59.935 --> 00:48:05.919
people are dissatisfied with it and Uh, I, I

875
00:48:05.919 --> 00:48:08.449
think there are some reasons for that, but yes,

876
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.350
I, I want to, to, uh, this is very

877
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.679
important. I, I, I, I didn't want to compare

878
00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:17.280
Santa Barbara AP, but the broader assumption of evolution

879
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.600
as something important and not negligible. So this is

880
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.120
the main thing. Still, as we will see, the

881
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.010
results are rather, uh, they speak from themselves. And

882
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.169
then on the other end, um, they are the

883
00:48:29.169 --> 00:48:33.129
um the list comprehending the many indicators for the

884
00:48:33.129 --> 00:48:40.159
SSM comprehended terms like acculturation, sexism, patriarchy. Um, MICROAGGRESSION,

885
00:48:40.199 --> 00:48:44.719
minority group, racism, gender identity, feminism, and blah, blah,

886
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.479
blah. So this kind of, we, we are all,

887
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.070
if, if, uh, uh, you know, you, you open

888
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.320
a tweet in the last 10 years, you are

889
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.639
encountering for sure this kind of words. So if

890
00:48:55.639 --> 00:48:58.080
you are a little bit into the debate, especially

891
00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.360
in the US this kind are, are very trendy

892
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:00.840
nowadays.

893
00:49:01.419 --> 00:49:03.760
But, but let me just ask you, since it

894
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.750
included terms like feminism, uh, would, would it also

895
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:13.479
include studies from the humanities, like, for example, women's

896
00:49:13.479 --> 00:49:17.090
studies, gender studies, and stuff like that, or I'm,

897
00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.909
I'm including everything is indexed info. So everything is,

898
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.620
um, is believed by the, you know, official team

899
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.510
of psych Info as being, uh, as, uh, it

900
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.254
has to be. Included in the psych for database

901
00:49:31.254 --> 00:49:34.584
and actually this is, this is one of because

902
00:49:34.584 --> 00:49:38.465
my my paper was commented somehow critically by William

903
00:49:38.465 --> 00:49:42.114
Costello and Douglas. William Costello is a PhD student

904
00:49:42.114 --> 00:49:44.024
of of yeah, I, I,

905
00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:46.024
I interviewed him on the show, so,

906
00:49:46.264 --> 00:49:46.385
ah,

907
00:49:47.304 --> 00:49:48.895
really back in 2022, yeah,

908
00:49:49.104 --> 00:49:52.425
OK, uh, uh, I didn't know that and, and

909
00:49:52.425 --> 00:49:55.304
they did, they did an analysis and they had

910
00:49:55.304 --> 00:49:59.149
this, um. This kind of, uh, one of their

911
00:49:59.469 --> 00:50:02.870
uh criticism toward my paper was that psych Info

912
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.500
included not scientific paper, not scientific journals, and they

913
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.010
said because, you know, Annas of dyslexia is not

914
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:13.590
a scientific journals. And I say that I, I,

915
00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:16.300
I answered them like privately. I also want to,

916
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.379
you know, publish another paper regarding this, but I,

917
00:50:18.459 --> 00:50:21.379
I said that, well, it's David, is, I, it's

918
00:50:21.379 --> 00:50:25.459
very different, uh, it's very difficult to, uh, you

919
00:50:25.459 --> 00:50:29.429
know, um, draw a line specifically where science begins

920
00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:32.020
and where, where science ends. And so it is

921
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.729
very, even though you, you were right. I, I,

922
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:37.229
I would not know how to operationalize that kind

923
00:50:37.229 --> 00:50:40.669
of uh um of instance in a bibliometric study.

924
00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:43.449
First thing. Second thing, it is very difficult to

925
00:50:43.449 --> 00:50:46.429
discard a journal as a non-scientific in an IS

926
00:50:46.429 --> 00:50:49.770
uh Dixit fashion. So I can say it is

927
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.929
not scientific, but I have to demonstrate it because

928
00:50:51.929 --> 00:50:56.729
otherwise, my own behavior is very non-scientific. And so,

929
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:00.209
I would say that, of course, my, my research

930
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:03.489
has some, some limitations and of course, what we

931
00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:05.719
can do, what I can do in the future

932
00:51:05.719 --> 00:51:07.770
to make it more robust is, for instance, to

933
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.770
investigate only the highly inflation journals, as I said

934
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.959
before. So, if I tie my uh research to

935
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.485
largely a the, uh, you know, important and information

936
00:51:17.485 --> 00:51:19.735
journals in psychology, that would be kind of, uh,

937
00:51:19.764 --> 00:51:22.165
uh, you know, uh, another step in, in that

938
00:51:22.165 --> 00:51:26.205
direction. Even though personally, I don't think is that,

939
00:51:26.215 --> 00:51:28.834
the results would change much because looking at, you

940
00:51:28.834 --> 00:51:31.695
know, flagship journals of, um, such as the American

941
00:51:31.695 --> 00:51:34.284
psychologists and the kind of papers they publish nowadays.

942
00:51:34.699 --> 00:51:38.199
Uh, THAT are very toward the SSM, uh, scenario

943
00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:42.360
because there was this very, you know, um, influence

944
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.350
of the SSM in the academic, uh, US US

945
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.300
uh landscape. And, but we can do that, of

946
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.429
course, we, we, we can see if that change,

947
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.330
um. But what we, uh, what I obtained and

948
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:59.330
to a lesser extent, what also what, uh what

949
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.250
uh Costello and Douglas obtained even though somehow differently,

950
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.129
and I do think there are some serious problems

951
00:52:04.129 --> 00:52:06.449
with the methodology, but we can talk about that

952
00:52:06.449 --> 00:52:10.679
later, is that, well, in mainstream psychology that is

953
00:52:10.679 --> 00:52:16.070
in the um all um peer-reviewed journals uh indexes

954
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.129
I came from, you know, the, by official team

955
00:52:19.129 --> 00:52:24.510
by the APA. Um, AND, uh, the, um, uh,

956
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.199
evolutionary psychology, broadly speaking, starts in the 1950s because

957
00:52:29.199 --> 00:52:32.439
this search was, uh, covering a broader, uh, time

958
00:52:32.439 --> 00:52:35.159
span than the other one. So we, I investigated

959
00:52:35.159 --> 00:52:40.949
from the 1950 to the, to 2020, 2022 actually.

960
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:44.810
Um. We see, we, we see it like uh

961
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:48.090
starting at about 3% of the overall publications and

962
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:54.290
then we gradually reach 44 4% in the last

963
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.729
years. On the other end, we say, we, we

964
00:52:56.729 --> 00:52:59.729
see that the SSM start at about 5% in

965
00:52:59.729 --> 00:53:06.060
the 50s and we reach actually uh 10%, 10,

966
00:53:06.169 --> 00:53:09.169
11% in the last years. And we say that

967
00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:11.929
the, the uh the gap is, you know, the,

968
00:53:11.989 --> 00:53:15.209
the growth of the SSM is particularly evident from

969
00:53:15.209 --> 00:53:17.979
the um end of the 80s on. So from

970
00:53:17.979 --> 00:53:18.500
the 90s.

971
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.340
Oh, that's interesting. So that ends up coinciding also

972
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.719
with, with the, the advent of what we call

973
00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:28.590
evolutionary psychology in the late 80s or

974
00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:32.820
yeah, exactly, yes, it's kind of uh it's kind

975
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.139
of paradoxical, but yes, and so we can say

976
00:53:35.139 --> 00:53:40.419
that on average the SSM um SSM laden contributions

977
00:53:40.419 --> 00:53:48.469
are twice. ARE twice, um, actually, uh, 2.20, um,

978
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.879
times the evolutionary uh psychological contributions. And in the

979
00:53:51.879 --> 00:53:55.469
last years, that is 2020, 2022, this gap is,

980
00:53:55.679 --> 00:54:01.639
this ratio is even larger, is about um 2.5.

981
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.040
OK. And even in the William Costello and Douglas

982
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.360
reanalysis, which has some problem because they added two

983
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.120
words to the uh EP keywords, a set of

984
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.360
keywords, so it was unbalanced. So EP add add

985
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.500
more keywords than uh SSM.

986
00:54:17.699 --> 00:54:20.699
So what were, what were those two keywords, by

987
00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:21.120
the way? The,

988
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.129
the two keywords were inclusive fitness. And the other

989
00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:31.969
one, I think, uh, papa parental investment and psychological

990
00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:36.169
adaptation, and they removed the animal cognition. So they

991
00:54:36.169 --> 00:54:38.969
removed animal cognition and they added inclusive fitness, parent

992
00:54:38.969 --> 00:54:43.689
talent investment and psychological adaptation. And, but they did

993
00:54:43.689 --> 00:54:47.959
not, and they also restricted the term uh culture

994
00:54:47.959 --> 00:54:51.649
in the SSM keywords in order to avoid the

995
00:54:51.649 --> 00:54:55.409
uh the term culture as used in the biology

996
00:54:55.409 --> 00:54:57.129
paper that is the, you know, the soil full

997
00:54:57.129 --> 00:55:00.729
of microorganisms. And so, of course, they restricted the

998
00:55:00.729 --> 00:55:03.679
SSM and they expanded the FP so of course

999
00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:05.129
the Russia was different, but it was like a

1000
00:55:05.129 --> 00:55:08.050
kind of a methodological concern I already expressed to

1001
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:08.969
them privately.

1002
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.919
And, by the way, but even with their approach,

1003
00:55:12.979 --> 00:55:14.620
what results did they get?

1004
00:55:14.629 --> 00:55:17.550
EVEN though we, even, even with this approach, which

1005
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.919
of course will power EP, uh, like the contributions

1006
00:55:20.919 --> 00:55:24.929
by definition, um, their, their, the average ratio is

1007
00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:28.479
1.78, so closer to 2. In the last years,

1008
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.659
it's almost equal to mine, so 2.5. So last

1009
00:55:31.659 --> 00:55:35.260
year's 2.5. So it is quite a big hiatus

1010
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.449
and of course, what is the take home message?

1011
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.600
Uh, FROM these studies, even though you, you, you

1012
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.070
think that their study, uh, can say something valuable.

1013
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.000
I, I don't think so. But even though we

1014
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
take this for granted, still, we can't call scientific

1015
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.050
re uh evolutionary psychology as a scientific revolution. We

1016
00:55:56.050 --> 00:56:00.090
can't because uh it's clearly outperformed by the SSM.

1017
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.219
Clearly, no one can deny that. So, uh, we

1018
00:56:04.219 --> 00:56:06.850
have two options, uh, or we, uh, you know,

1019
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.699
um, we, we can say I, I, I wasn't

1020
00:56:10.699 --> 00:56:13.570
referring to scientific revolution in a Kian sense, but

1021
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.540
that is kind of difficult because the terms were

1022
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:19.260
kind of Uh, Cunha Leyden, or we can say,

1023
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:22.070
well, this is the, you know, state status of

1024
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:24.750
affairs and we, we, we have to do something

1025
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:28.469
about it because I uh I also had some

1026
00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:30.870
discussions with some evolutionary scholars and I tried to

1027
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.350
publish this, some, uh, um, I, I had some

1028
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:37.340
problems in publishing these papers, the, this paper. And

1029
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.429
uh I, I had, you know, um private back

1030
00:56:41.429 --> 00:56:43.989
channel with a, and I would say an, an

1031
00:56:43.989 --> 00:56:48.510
important evolutionary scholar. Who was, I would say ideologically

1032
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.870
annoyed by my results and I was kind of

1033
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.189
sad of that because I was white. Uh, YOU

1034
00:56:53.189 --> 00:56:56.110
should be, you know, the no scientist, uh, that

1035
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:59.300
went to the bank, the ideologically laden SSM people,

1036
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.550
but you are, you are still ideologically laden and

1037
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:06.500
uh also, you know, the paper by By by

1038
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.310
Costello and his collaborator, I see it something ideologically

1039
00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:13.459
laden because I, I, I, I do think that,

1040
00:57:13.469 --> 00:57:15.709
of course, if you add two words, the, the

1041
00:57:15.709 --> 00:57:17.909
results will be unbalanced and you, but the problem

1042
00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:20.139
is that I do share and maybe we can,

1043
00:57:20.449 --> 00:57:22.459
we, we, we, we can get to that later.

1044
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.669
I do share, I do. I do have sympathy

1045
00:57:25.669 --> 00:57:29.590
for the evolutionary psychology and also for the EPP

1046
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:32.310
Santa Barbara EP program. I, I don't, don't have

1047
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.060
any, anything uh against it. I don't, I, I

1048
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:39.850
don't share many of the um Of the, of

1049
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:43.260
the criticisms they had toward the Santa Barbara IP.

1050
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.729
For instance, I had a, a conversation with a

1051
00:57:45.729 --> 00:57:48.969
big, big, big person in cultural evolution, like a

1052
00:57:48.969 --> 00:57:51.810
huge one, like one of the leading scholar in

1053
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.719
the world in this regard. And it was very,

1054
00:57:53.969 --> 00:57:58.729
very, very, you know, aggressive towards Santa Barbara. And

1055
00:57:58.729 --> 00:58:01.199
I, I, I, I don't understand that. I have

1056
00:58:01.199 --> 00:58:05.399
my ideas, uh, and, but, uh, yes, but of

1057
00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:08.560
course, I, we, we can't call it even broadly

1058
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.229
speaking. As a scientific scientific revolution,

1059
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.969
yeah, and I mean, I, I mean, as far

1060
00:58:14.969 --> 00:58:17.899
as I'm concerned, I'm not that surprised. I would

1061
00:58:17.899 --> 00:58:20.649
probably be a little bit more surprised like 5

1062
00:58:20.649 --> 00:58:23.739
or 6 years ago because I was very much

1063
00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:26.989
into evolutionary psychology and I thought that perhaps it

1064
00:58:27.449 --> 00:58:30.120
would help, it would hold, I mean, it would

1065
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.989
be more prominent within psychology at. We, uh, and,

1066
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:38.830
and even more so now, nowadays, but, uh, as

1067
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:43.709
I talked with people that would fall under neuroscience

1068
00:58:43.709 --> 00:58:46.189
and of course, I, I don't talk much with

1069
00:58:46.429 --> 00:58:50.949
psychoanalysts or behaviorists, but they, they, I know that

1070
00:58:50.949 --> 00:58:54.959
they are not fond of evolutionary psychology, but even

1071
00:58:54.959 --> 00:58:58.090
people from other sub I'm not sure if we

1072
00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:01.330
should call them subdisciplines, but some barriers in psychology.

1073
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:06.080
Like, for example, the social psychologists, the cultural psychologists,

1074
00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:11.040
and, uh, uh, and even many cognitive psychologists, uh,

1075
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:13.580
I mean, there are many, many people out there

1076
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.260
that are not fond of evolutionary psychology at all.

1077
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.560
And even the other approaches that we mentioned, behavior.

1078
00:59:20.939 --> 00:59:25.510
Genetics, human ecology, many, many people they also do

1079
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:27.909
not like the evolutionary psychologists,

1080
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.810
not at all. I don't know why. I, I,

1081
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:33.229
I have my theory about that, but, um, of

1082
00:59:33.229 --> 00:59:35.189
course I, I, I don't know why. I think

1083
00:59:35.189 --> 00:59:39.090
that one major impediment here is, uh, uh, uh,

1084
00:59:39.149 --> 00:59:42.870
as I said before, this is versus old problem,

1085
00:59:42.949 --> 00:59:46.300
you know, the, the problem that you. Somehow, because

1086
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.020
I think that all, they, they, they get very

1087
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.139
mad when, when evolutionary psychology, for instance, let's talk

1088
00:59:53.139 --> 00:59:57.060
about attachment. No one is discussing attachment. Why? Because

1089
00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.179
it's standard, because we have little kids crying for

1090
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.090
their mom, and this is, you know, so, you

1091
01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:05.179
know, hard moving. But attachment is the one evolutionary

1092
01:00:05.179 --> 01:00:09.179
psychobiological motivation per definition. And no one ever discussed

1093
01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:12.040
it. No one ever discussed bold B remarks about

1094
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.709
the EEA. Actually, Borbi was the inventor of the.

1095
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.290
FUCKING word. So it is kind of the, you

1096
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:22.010
know, problematic that attachment, of course, there are some

1097
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.479
critics, of course, there are some critics of attachment,

1098
01:00:24.649 --> 01:00:27.649
especially during, you know, they, they see attachment as

1099
01:00:27.649 --> 01:00:31.080
something deterministic and uh by uh reductionistic. But still,

1100
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.770
you don't see anyone, especially in clinics or in

1101
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:36.530
my own niche that is against the concept of

1102
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:40.889
attachment as a evolution, evolutionary laden motivation. When you

1103
01:00:40.889 --> 01:00:43.810
talk about mating. And the gender differences in mating,

1104
01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:48.199
which are, you know, robustly, uh, documented by the

1105
01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:54.520
EP in my opinion, robustly, uh, things start to

1106
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.209
change because people get, you know, get, uh, defensive

1107
01:00:58.209 --> 01:01:01.389
and get, um, also, you know, world leading scholar,

1108
01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:04.639
uh, for instance, um, I, I, I, I think

1109
01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:08.919
that We could uh lead back this controversy to

1110
01:01:08.919 --> 01:01:11.000
two very important people in the field in the

1111
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.399
70s who were on one hand, Edward um Osborne

1112
01:01:15.399 --> 01:01:17.939
Wilson, so the author of sociobiology, on the other,

1113
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.780
on, on the other hand, Stephen Jay Gould. And

1114
01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:24.909
uh these two people and good good was, you

1115
01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:27.989
know, a very important, uh super important why I

1116
01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:31.310
think the most cited paleontologist so far is like

1117
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:34.429
he, he is super important. He also elaborated this

1118
01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:38.729
evolutionary theory of punct punctuated equilibrium, so it was

1119
01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:41.419
a leading. Expert in evolution, he wrote, you know,

1120
01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.489
you, is Magnusopus about evolution. Still, when it comes

1121
01:01:45.489 --> 01:01:50.129
to evolutionary psychology, um, you know, mating or, uh,

1122
01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:53.020
or, you know, gender differences or some uh difference

1123
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.020
in intelligence, he wrote, uh, you know, uh, a

1124
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.020
lot about difference in intelligence would and It was,

1125
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.820
I, I think some, somehow ideological and that is

1126
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.699
a pity because it was a great scientist, you

1127
01:02:04.699 --> 01:02:07.540
know. And uh I, I really don't know why

1128
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.090
there is so much hate toward Santa Barbara, uh,

1129
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.379
even though I, I, I don't share some of

1130
01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:15.979
their works, but still I, I know,

1131
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:16.780
I, I have

1132
01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:16.979
a

1133
01:02:16.979 --> 01:02:17.300
feeling

1134
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.060
about that.

1135
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.489
Uh, I'm not completely sure, but at least, uh,

1136
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.449
something that I've noticed even when it comes to

1137
01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:29.000
myself, when I look, when over the years I

1138
01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:34.189
talked with, for example, anthropologists and cultural evolutionists is

1139
01:02:34.189 --> 01:02:37.649
that if you look at, uh, if you look

1140
01:02:37.649 --> 01:02:42.000
at across cultures, if you look at ethnographies, for

1141
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.120
example, if you do ethnographic work across different kinds

1142
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.360
of cultures, and if you're working with a more

1143
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.489
culturally oriented approach, let's say, um, I think it's,

1144
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:59.320
it's very hard for people like that to accept

1145
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.050
the idea that most of what happens within a

1146
01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:07.760
psychologically is innate, you know,

1147
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:08.889
is what?

1148
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:09.280
In

1149
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.750
innate. Uh, YEAH. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

1150
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:16.469
yeah, because, because, uh, uh, I mean, actually, that,

1151
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:20.260
that's probably one of the criticisms that I would

1152
01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.989
have nowadays when it comes to evolutionary psychology. First

1153
01:03:23.989 --> 01:03:29.560
of all, many evolutionary psychologists are not aware. Of

1154
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.189
they are not familiar with, uh, anthropology or anthropological

1155
01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:36.800
literature. And so, I mean, if you ask them

1156
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.399
about something related to anthropology, many of them don't

1157
01:03:41.399 --> 01:03:44.719
know much, to be honest. Uh, AND, uh, and

1158
01:03:44.719 --> 01:03:47.090
I mean, and the other thing is that Uh,

1159
01:03:47.209 --> 01:03:50.560
I, I think that perhaps some people, not all,

1160
01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:53.570
because it depends. There are also a few evolutionary

1161
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:58.000
psychologists who web training in anthropology and so those

1162
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.760
approach things a little bit differently. Uh, BUT men,

1163
01:04:01.889 --> 01:04:05.209
uh, but some of them at least, uh, have,

1164
01:04:05.219 --> 01:04:08.370
uh, come to the table or, or when they

1165
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:12.129
look at things at any kind of psychological phenomenon,

1166
01:04:12.169 --> 01:04:16.010
they assume or they start from a standpoint where

1167
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:20.399
they assume that, uh, wherever. Kind of psychological phenomenon

1168
01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:24.469
they are analyzing that they uh that it should

1169
01:04:24.469 --> 01:04:28.520
be in some way innate or the result of

1170
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.159
natural sexual selection or something like that.

1171
01:04:31.199 --> 01:04:33.429
Yeah, yeah, I do think that I do think,

1172
01:04:33.479 --> 01:04:35.590
I think this is a major problem with the

1173
01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:41.770
the Santa Barbara. I do think that there's Um,

1174
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.449
Uh, I, I, I, I don't know how to

1175
01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.669
define it, but they, uh, are very keen on

1176
01:04:48.669 --> 01:04:51.290
the idea of being tied to, you know, real

1177
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:55.250
science, real biology, and real things, you know, and

1178
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.310
they are not willing, at least to my, to

1179
01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:01.600
my experience, uh, many of them are not willing

1180
01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.169
to, um, collaborate. For instance, I think that a

1181
01:05:04.169 --> 01:05:07.050
major breakthrough for revolutionary psychology would be, um, you

1182
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:12.469
know, um, more collaborative attitude toward clinical psychology. Because

1183
01:05:12.469 --> 01:05:15.500
I do think that being a clinical psychologist myself,

1184
01:05:15.669 --> 01:05:18.580
I do think that when you're having therapy, someone

1185
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.830
and you help someone, a lot of evolutionary insights

1186
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.719
are super helpful for you, super helpful when you,

1187
01:05:24.949 --> 01:05:29.520
when you think about sexuality, mating, attachment, status. You

1188
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.679
know, you see, you know, young males depressed in

1189
01:05:31.679 --> 01:05:34.770
their 30s because they are not attained, uh, in

1190
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:36.760
the status they wanted to attain. And there is

1191
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.800
a major difference of, for, for instance, in gender

1192
01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.780
difference because as, as, as, as David Gerry, which

1193
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.840
who you interviewed and know uh knows very well,

1194
01:05:45.919 --> 01:05:48.580
you know, there is, you know, males are more

1195
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.870
prone to experience depression if uh uh status deprived

1196
01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:56.500
than females. And, um, and there is super, they

1197
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.969
would be super useful for the clinician other than,

1198
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.979
you know, stupid narrative of, oh, let's go and

1199
01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:05.159
talk about your parents, uh, which is useful many

1200
01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:07.379
of the times because so I am, I am

1201
01:06:07.379 --> 01:06:09.219
also, I, I studied a lot of attachment, so

1202
01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.879
attachment is super important in determining your own health,

1203
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.459
mental health. But still, if you are depressed cause

1204
01:06:15.459 --> 01:06:17.179
you are, you, you don't have your place in

1205
01:06:17.179 --> 01:06:19.449
society, we don't have to talk about your parents.

1206
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:23.510
There is no need to do that. And, um,

1207
01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:27.229
and, and so, um, I, I think, I think,

1208
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.360
I, I don't know that, um, uh, you know,

1209
01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:33.760
there's Gilbert, for instance, the scholar Gilbert, the Australian

1210
01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.739
guy, or at least, uh, he works in Australia.

1211
01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.879
And he, he, he, he, he wrote something about

1212
01:06:39.879 --> 01:06:43.479
motivations from an evolutionary perspective is, is, is closer

1213
01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:47.479
to the clinical, um, the clinical scenario. But still,

1214
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.659
if we If we talk about our core evolutionary

1215
01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:53.830
sci um Santa Barbara EP scientists, which is a

1216
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:56.610
small but very, um, you know, living, you know,

1217
01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.419
uh community, uh, they're kind of close because they

1218
01:07:00.419 --> 01:07:04.280
have this, you know, um, I think it is

1219
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.929
like in politics, you know, we, uh, they have

1220
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.580
this, um, they, they, they feel they are hated

1221
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.209
by everyone. And the, and the, and end up

1222
01:07:14.209 --> 01:07:18.810
being feeling defensive and superior and that don't, don't

1223
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:22.850
help other people to appreciate, appreciate, appreciate them, their

1224
01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:27.689
work more. And so um um everything um becomes

1225
01:07:27.689 --> 01:07:31.010
um more difficult. But in, in, in theoretically, I

1226
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.320
think that evolutionary psychology uh is a beautiful candidate

1227
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.760
to be a meta theory. Uh, EVEN more that,

1228
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:42.209
you know, the classical methodological problems, you know, for

1229
01:07:42.209 --> 01:07:44.959
instance, with massive modularity are now over, I think,

1230
01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.489
you know, uh, we, we, um, uh, uh, more

1231
01:07:48.489 --> 01:07:50.330
or less, more or less, but I, I don't

1232
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:52.729
think, and, and most of the evolutionary psychologists that

1233
01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:55.810
I know, they don't have the strict view of

1234
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.000
massive modularity. Maybe to being cosmic, but, but, you

1235
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.649
know, For instance, Marco the judicial, who I, I,

1236
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.330
I know very well, uh, he always talks about

1237
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.040
psychological mechanisms. He never used the word models and,

1238
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:10.580
uh, but I, I do think that some insights

1239
01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.649
from the modularity, um, hypothesis must to be kept

1240
01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:16.959
in order to be specific because the mechanism has

1241
01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:20.660
to be specific, to some degree automatic, um, to

1242
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.250
some, to some degree independent, and it, it, it

1243
01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.129
has to be a neural circuitry. Otherwise, I don't

1244
01:08:27.129 --> 01:08:29.640
know what we are talking about. Of course, the

1245
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.879
problem lies in, to a certain degree. This is

1246
01:08:32.879 --> 01:08:35.319
the, the problem, but to a certain degree, of

1247
01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:38.040
course. And I, I, I, I don't see how

1248
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.240
I, someone can, can believe in a, in a

1249
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.879
purely domain general mind, which is a very, very

1250
01:08:43.879 --> 01:08:46.048
difficult instance to be. Right,

1251
01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:50.948
so, but let me then ask you about another

1252
01:08:50.948 --> 01:08:55.148
specific kind of approach within uh psychology. I, I

1253
01:08:55.148 --> 01:08:56.979
mean, I'm not, I'm not sure how you look

1254
01:08:56.979 --> 01:09:00.188
at it in terms of how it relates to

1255
01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:06.080
evolutionary psychology and More specifically evolutionary psychology from Santa

1256
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.410
Barbara. But what about cultural, what people call cultural

1257
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:14.750
evolutionary theory or culture or a cultural evolutionary approach?

1258
01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:17.310
I mean, is it more, is it more prominent

1259
01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:22.438
in the literature than Let's say standard evolutionary psychology

1260
01:09:22.438 --> 01:09:23.108
or not.

1261
01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:26.508
Not at all. So, uh, starting from my study,

1262
01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:29.679
I also, in order to control for the overlapping

1263
01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:33.038
between uh EP and SSM I also investigated the

1264
01:09:33.038 --> 01:09:39.689
papers which uh which have, uh, you know, uh,

1265
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.910
11, at least one of the set of keywords

1266
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:44.859
and at least one of the set of keywords

1267
01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.020
of the other approach. At least one of the

1268
01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.740
keywords of the AP, at least one of the

1269
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.140
key, and at least one of the keywords of

1270
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:55.100
uh SSM. This way, you can track the so-called

1271
01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.140
culturally um evolutionary uh laden contributions. And what we

1272
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.750
found is that in mainstream psychology, they are fluctuating,

1273
01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:10.720
uh, you know, Almost negligibly around 0%, sometimes um

1274
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:17.240
0.03%, but, but don't be, uh, don't be, you

1275
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.479
know, um too fast in interpreting this because we

1276
01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:23.270
have to remember that especially in the last years.

1277
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.799
So the mean of, um, over all the period

1278
01:10:25.799 --> 01:10:30.240
I investigated, the mean of, um of uh papers

1279
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.250
published per year is um 8, 8,000,000. Last year,

1280
01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:42.529
we have 150,000 papers per year on average. So

1281
01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:45.330
still, when you're talking less than the 1%, you're

1282
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:50.000
talking on about 500, 600 papers per year. That

1283
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.169
means one or two papers published per day, which

1284
01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:57.569
isn't that, you know, uh negligible at all. But

1285
01:10:57.569 --> 01:11:00.689
if you compare it to the overall amount of

1286
01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:04.290
the SSM or the EP this is negligible. Of

1287
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:08.439
course, there is this new research program. The problem

1288
01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:14.770
is that as we said before, um, um, So,

1289
01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:19.220
for instance, one of the most prominent cultural evolutional

1290
01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:24.790
research program is, you know, um uh sprouted out

1291
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:28.180
of the dual linearrison theory by Richardson and, and

1292
01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:33.220
Boyd. And uh we have names like uh Macreth

1293
01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.529
and Eric and this kind of people there. And

1294
01:11:36.819 --> 01:11:40.450
the, and I think they are, their background is

1295
01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:45.669
mainly. There are biologists, anthropologists, or economists. Very few

1296
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:50.640
psychologists there. Very physical is there and they study

1297
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.589
a, no, a broad, um, broad array of, of,

1298
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.600
of different things, applying these, um, you know, methods

1299
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.370
from evolutionary biology to so uh cultural traits, the

1300
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:07.680
so-called cultural traits. That is a socially learned behaviors,

1301
01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:14.060
tradition of socially learned behaviors. Uh, um, THAT is

1302
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.370
culture is defined by them as a tradition of,

1303
01:12:16.379 --> 01:12:20.299
um, socially learned behaviors and cultural traits are this

1304
01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:24.299
kind of, uh, of, uh, of, of quantifiable traits.

1305
01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:27.979
And, but the main problem, and I, it is

1306
01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:32.299
very um trendy and it is very interesting um

1307
01:12:32.819 --> 01:12:35.370
research program. The main problem is that they study

1308
01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:42.240
um anthropological issues, sociological issue. Like um they are

1309
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.319
on, on a The, the, the, they are more

1310
01:12:46.319 --> 01:12:49.080
coarse, you know, the, the, they are not that

1311
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.359
fine-grained at the psychological level. They study how is,

1312
01:12:53.479 --> 01:12:57.479
uh, I don't know, mm how, uh how many

1313
01:12:57.479 --> 01:13:03.680
economic classes are um tied to a specific kind

1314
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.779
of religion or um I don't know, uh, how

1315
01:13:07.779 --> 01:13:10.310
is it the network of collaboration, but from a

1316
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:14.379
sociological point of level, they don't get to the

1317
01:13:14.379 --> 01:13:19.580
individual level of motivation and ultimately, what can help

1318
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:22.470
uh people like me, a clinical psychologist in my

1319
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.390
therapy room because they are studying, you know, very

1320
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:29.009
broad uh uh traditional anthropological issues. Yeah. And also

1321
01:13:29.009 --> 01:13:32.209
this is, this is informed and some scholars at

1322
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:37.569
the intersection between these two these two research programs

1323
01:13:37.569 --> 01:13:40.850
by uh a new approach also in biology, evolutionary

1324
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.689
biology that is called the extended evolutionary synthesis or

1325
01:13:43.689 --> 01:13:47.129
Ivodivo or and some very important people like Feldman,

1326
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:52.029
Marcus Feldman, who initiated actually the dual in Edison

1327
01:13:52.029 --> 01:13:54.890
theory in the 70s with The Ui Cavalli's Forza,

1328
01:13:54.899 --> 01:13:57.020
they are still alive and kicking and doing, you

1329
01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.740
know, their research on, uh, extended evolution into this

1330
01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.330
with Massimo Pilucci, these kind of guys. And, uh,

1331
01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:06.209
but the, that kind of research doing mostly by

1332
01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:10.959
biologists, by, you know, by background is focused on

1333
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.810
um On biological stuff like insects, like ants, like,

1334
01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:21.560
uh, you know, uh, butterflies, uh and, and coral

1335
01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.910
reef, that kind of, uh, of things which is

1336
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:27.700
very interesting from a theoretical point of view. But,

1337
01:14:27.819 --> 01:14:32.189
uh, again, it can say something speculatively about the

1338
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:35.950
human mind. Uh, I know the, the famous Baldi,

1339
01:14:35.959 --> 01:14:39.910
uh, Baldwin effect, which is called after a psychology

1340
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.750
after all, Baldwin, but um it's very difficult to

1341
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:48.750
see how these predictions by uh like uh uh

1342
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:53.310
um uh uh um uh in the time we

1343
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:57.859
are speaking are somehow useful for the human behavior.

1344
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:01.899
And on the other hand, uh, uh, evolutionary psychology.

1345
01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:07.319
Do some study, uh, um, you know, or, or,

1346
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:10.540
or, or say, or say they are sensitive cultural

1347
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.990
differences, but they're not actually. They're not, I, I,

1348
01:15:13.069 --> 01:15:17.819
I don't think they are. And And, and so

1349
01:15:17.819 --> 01:15:22.500
I think this cultural evolutionary research program may may

1350
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.620
be interesting in anthropology or sociology or even in

1351
01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:30.890
biology, but uh so far, not in psychology. Uh,

1352
01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.500
IT is not, uh, you know, um, you know,

1353
01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:38.299
mature enough to say something in, in, in regards

1354
01:15:38.299 --> 01:15:41.259
to how we, uh, behave at the, you know,

1355
01:15:41.419 --> 01:15:46.290
more fine-grained level. And I think, I think that

1356
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:49.169
this is tied to a bigger problem that is,

1357
01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.770
you know, the meaning problem that we spoke about

1358
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:53.779
before. I don't want, I don't know if you

1359
01:15:53.779 --> 01:15:55.370
want to get it into now or,

1360
01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.299
yeah, we can get into it, but let me

1361
01:15:58.299 --> 01:16:00.779
just say that, uh, I mean, I, I agree

1362
01:16:00.779 --> 01:16:04.020
with you when it comes to where would you

1363
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.740
put cultural evolutionary theory and you mentioned anthropology, biology,

1364
01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:11.459
but not psychology, and I actually agree with that.

1365
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.359
I mean, when I think about cultural evolutionary theorists,

1366
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.129
I almost always think of them as being anthropologists.

1367
01:16:19.259 --> 01:16:19.500
Yeah,

1368
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.859
so.

1369
01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:23.529
Or biologists, yeah, or biologists who are trained also

1370
01:16:23.529 --> 01:16:27.810
in anthropology, like for instance Rasse Gray and um

1371
01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.209
who who is a biologist by by background and

1372
01:16:30.209 --> 01:16:34.600
then he dedicated himself to, to anthropology. uh YES.

1373
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:39.129
Uh, OK, but, but then, tell us about because

1374
01:16:39.129 --> 01:16:41.770
uh before we started recording at a certain point

1375
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:46.069
you mentioned. Uh, ONE issue that you, that you

1376
01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:49.430
see both, I, I think that's both within evolutionary

1377
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:54.870
psychology, standard evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory that

1378
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:59.069
is you said, I think that uh they do

1379
01:16:59.069 --> 01:17:02.939
not address issues regarding meaning,

1380
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:06.220
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:06.720
I

1382
01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:06.830
think,

1383
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:08.629
OK, so explain that then.

1384
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.459
Yeah. So, uh, in social psychology, in the cultural

1385
01:17:13.459 --> 01:17:16.779
studies, uh, maybe not in in uh in social

1386
01:17:16.779 --> 01:17:19.459
psychology, but in cultural studies, if you go to

1387
01:17:19.459 --> 01:17:23.060
a traditional cultural anthropology and ask them what culture

1388
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.209
is, they will be uh likely to answer, um,

1389
01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.660
culture is a web of webs of significance. Which

1390
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:34.629
is a very famous definition by Clifford Gertz, who

1391
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:38.229
is a very famous, you know, anthropologist in the

1392
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:44.009
classical cul cultural anthropological tradition, you know. And, and

1393
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:46.129
on the other hand, if you go to the,

1394
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.270
um, you know, cultural evolutionists uh who are anthropologists

1395
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:54.680
or biologists, they are likely to answer. THAT culture

1396
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.120
is a tradition of socially learned behaviors where you

1397
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.589
can study them behavior also in animals. And so

1398
01:18:02.589 --> 01:18:05.669
they are very, very uncompatible in different definitions and

1399
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:08.750
they are, uh, uh, they are an example on

1400
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.109
how the natural science and the cul and social

1401
01:18:11.109 --> 01:18:13.790
science are still divided and the big divide is

1402
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.910
on the concept of meaning and the concept of

1403
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:18.439
meaning is tied to the concept of sense making.

1404
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:22.750
And sense making is the perhaps uniquely human, as

1405
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:27.350
far as we know, capacity to account for reasons

1406
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:32.200
in life, you know. And, and, and, and to,

1407
01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:37.839
to find uh a uh uh you know, all

1408
01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:42.399
big ideologies and religions, I think they are tied

1409
01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:47.870
ultimately to answer questions about life almost trivially. I

1410
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:50.600
don't think they are like the memeticspose it's, you

1411
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.629
know, just uh pieces of information that want to

1412
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:57.109
replicate themselves. I think that Christianity, for instance, is

1413
01:18:57.109 --> 01:19:00.370
way, it's way more complicated than that. It's like,

1414
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:03.390
it gives a purpose in life to people. I

1415
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.350
don't think that purpose is something, um, you know,

1416
01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.950
illusionary or non-existent. I do think it is very

1417
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:10.910
important. I, I don't know, uh there is this

1418
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:14.299
beautiful example, a friend of mine, Gregory Ricks does

1419
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:18.959
that it is very difficult to Explain, for instance,

1420
01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:20.209
you know, I, I don't know if, if you

1421
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:23.140
are familiar with the picture of the Vietnamese monk

1422
01:19:23.569 --> 01:19:27.279
who, uh, who, who, you know, who, um, willingly

1423
01:19:27.609 --> 01:19:29.970
set himself to fire in order to protest to

1424
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:34.160
the government and it is very difficult to understand

1425
01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:37.759
this kind of behavior without taking meaning into account,

1426
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:42.609
you know. And, and it's very, you know, because

1427
01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:46.350
probably the guy really believed his gesture was uh

1428
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:49.330
symbolic and necessary and there was a reason he

1429
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.899
was pursuing a name he was pursuing. And also

1430
01:19:52.899 --> 01:19:56.290
we, we were talking before about the practice of

1431
01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:59.540
Japanese people of uh, you know, removing their shoes,

1432
01:19:59.779 --> 01:20:02.640
the, their shoes before getting into the, the house.

1433
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:06.270
And you could speculate a lot about the reasons

1434
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:09.830
of this behavior. You could call memetics into question.

1435
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:12.790
We, you could speculate, uh, you know, uh, an

1436
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:16.709
advantage to the um inclusive fitness, but it, I

1437
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:19.979
think that The easiest thing to do is to

1438
01:20:19.979 --> 01:20:27.020
tie this behavior to um to the broader problem

1439
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.939
in Japanese culture of the division of public and

1440
01:20:29.939 --> 01:20:33.419
private self. And so, you are entering a private

1441
01:20:33.419 --> 01:20:36.229
space and you must leave your, you know, you,

1442
01:20:36.419 --> 01:20:39.279
you must be respectful to that, you know. And

1443
01:20:39.279 --> 01:20:41.919
a lot of different behaviors could be easily explained

1444
01:20:42.319 --> 01:20:46.720
through this interpretation, which is more qualitative, which is

1445
01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.879
more uh culturally, you know, more akin to the

1446
01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:54.839
cultural studies. But nevertheless, it is very compelling and

1447
01:20:54.839 --> 01:20:57.319
I think it is also a clinical psychologist, it

1448
01:20:57.319 --> 01:21:01.120
is very compelling when people are facing the absence

1449
01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.279
of meaning in their life. And if you take

1450
01:21:03.279 --> 01:21:07.020
meaning Out of the equation as uh everyone is

1451
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.680
doing right now in the cultural, uh, at least

1452
01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.919
as I know, it is very difficult. Of course,

1453
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.799
they are aware of the problem because I, I

1454
01:21:13.799 --> 01:21:17.000
do remember the only source in which I found,

1455
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.279
you know, a small piece of discussion about it

1456
01:21:20.279 --> 01:21:23.720
is a volume edited, uh, you know, published in,

1457
01:21:23.759 --> 01:21:27.979
at the end of the 90s, 1997. By Peter

1458
01:21:27.979 --> 01:21:32.060
Weingart, which is with a German sociologist, and invited

1459
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:35.020
a lot of important people also for of from

1460
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.100
evolutionary psychology. I think Cosmides and to be were

1461
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.770
there. One year in Zurich at uh this interdisciplinary

1462
01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:44.879
center. To try to, you know, um, help the

1463
01:21:44.879 --> 01:21:47.000
natural and the social science get along with each

1464
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.609
other. And he mentioned the meaning problem. So that

1465
01:21:50.609 --> 01:21:53.879
as, uh, uh, that, that there is no theory

1466
01:21:53.879 --> 01:21:56.080
of the emergence of meaning. And I think the

1467
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.240
big, big problem here is that there is a

1468
01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.379
missing point in between our evolutionary history. Of the

1469
01:22:04.379 --> 01:22:07.979
and the emergence somehow I, I, I, I do

1470
01:22:07.979 --> 01:22:11.620
think with the advent of language of our capacity

1471
01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.899
to account for meaning. Which is, which is, which

1472
01:22:15.899 --> 01:22:19.390
is, uh, which was, I think, a major, major

1473
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:24.390
um transition that um helped that, you know, uh

1474
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:28.959
spurred a lot of religions, mythologies. And uh and

1475
01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:32.810
things that, you know. Uh, WE are, are as

1476
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:34.720
humans are deeply affected by.

1477
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.770
Uh, AND actually, earlier you mentioned the extended evolutionary

1478
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:41.890
synthesis, and I've already talked about this on the

1479
01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:45.290
show with even some of the most prominent names

1480
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:50.620
like Massimoiucci and David Sloan Wilson, uh, and one

1481
01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.750
of the things that they mentioned, uh, could, and

1482
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:56.879
other people as well that could be included within

1483
01:22:56.879 --> 01:23:01.569
the external evolutionary synthesis is symbolism. Right. Oh,

1484
01:23:01.899 --> 01:23:02.790
really? I didn't know that.

1485
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:07.569
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So symbolism would probably account

1486
01:23:07.859 --> 01:23:11.189
for what you're saying there or what you're talking

1487
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:14.859
about there and within anthropology, if we're talking about

1488
01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:18.740
the study of humans, uh, it will probably fall

1489
01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.089
under symbiotics,

1490
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.950
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is also

1491
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:26.720
the, you know, like. Um, LINE of research called

1492
01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.160
biosemiotics. I don't know, uh, a lot about it,

1493
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:33.330
but yes, but, and, and I, I, I don't

1494
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:36.520
know how the EES scholar want to address this

1495
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.979
issue. Maybe you can talk more about it later

1496
01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.475
because I, I, I, I, I don't know anything

1497
01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:43.444
specific, but I do think that one of the

1498
01:23:43.444 --> 01:23:47.185
most fascinating thing is that we miss, we miss

1499
01:23:47.185 --> 01:23:51.634
an evolutionary link between the emergence of language and

1500
01:23:51.714 --> 01:23:53.645
the emergence of meaning. And I do have some,

1501
01:23:53.725 --> 01:23:57.004
you know, speculative hypothesis because, so there is this.

1502
01:23:57.359 --> 01:24:01.029
A friend of mine, Greg Ricks, who, who has

1503
01:24:01.029 --> 01:24:05.589
this um justification hypothesis which is, which is, he

1504
01:24:05.589 --> 01:24:11.589
thinks that some time ago, um, about 100 and,

1505
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:17.089
and uh 100,000 years ago, uh, probably our language

1506
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.589
uh reached a tipping point in which we uh

1507
01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:24.899
transitioned from simple words to um do um sentences,

1508
01:24:25.029 --> 01:24:30.080
you know, complex sentences. And he poses that this

1509
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.560
kind of, you know, of course, it is a

1510
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.600
speculation, but he thinks that this um moment could

1511
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.879
have been the starting point of the mythologies and

1512
01:24:39.879 --> 01:24:43.680
religions and our capacity of being a person other

1513
01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.080
than primates, and it's very fascinating. But what I

1514
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:50.520
added to this, you know, justification hypothesis is that

1515
01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.359
I do think that this is, this was probably

1516
01:24:54.359 --> 01:24:58.479
linked to the emergence of causal clauses. So, of

1517
01:24:58.479 --> 01:25:03.950
why because uh adverbs, which are, you know, pervasive

1518
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:06.720
when we talk about something, even in the scientific

1519
01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.640
scenario, uh, you know, cause, causear reasoning is, is

1520
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.040
endemic in explaining why. And as Perber and Mercer

1521
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.279
said in the book, it is very difficult to

1522
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:21.990
Uh, you know, uh, distinguish in between retrospective and

1523
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:26.109
prospective reas reasons. So it seems that our brain

1524
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:29.830
works as every, every time we want to account

1525
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:34.379
for a reason, we are somehow trying to, uh,

1526
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:39.229
to convince someone and, and, uh, yes, and so

1527
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:43.410
this, you know, this Uh, this, the dynamics in

1528
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:47.330
between convincing others and trying to find a reason

1529
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:49.720
why things are the way they are. Uh, I

1530
01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.759
think, I think it is a fascinating way to

1531
01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:54.270
study, even though it is a very speculative, uh,

1532
01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:56.479
I don't know from the operational point of view

1533
01:25:56.479 --> 01:25:58.799
how to, how to do that, but it is,

1534
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.830
it is, I think this is the missing link,

1535
01:26:00.919 --> 01:26:01.390
yes.

1536
01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:06.359
So you think then that even cultural evolutionary theory

1537
01:26:06.359 --> 01:26:10.919
does not account for things related to meaning and

1538
01:26:10.919 --> 01:26:12.399
sense making, is that it?

1539
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:15.919
I don't think so. I, I, I never read

1540
01:26:16.209 --> 01:26:18.009
anything, but maybe I'm wrong, maybe it is my

1541
01:26:18.009 --> 01:26:20.209
ignorance, I don't know. Uh, I, I would be

1542
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:23.250
very glad to, to know if you or someone

1543
01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:26.009
who is watching the show has a different expertise

1544
01:26:26.009 --> 01:26:29.290
on this, uh, because really, but I, as far

1545
01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:31.770
as I know, no, the meaning is, for instance,

1546
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:34.129
it is very important in clinical psychology, a lot

1547
01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:39.470
of, you know, constructivists. Uh, THEORIES, um, has been

1548
01:26:39.759 --> 01:26:42.680
built around the concept of meaning. A lot, a

1549
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.870
lot, a lot of, of, of, of, of clinical,

1550
01:26:45.979 --> 01:26:49.319
um, of clinical works is informed by meaning. For

1551
01:26:49.319 --> 01:26:50.720
instance, I, I don't know if you ever read

1552
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.560
the, the book by Victor Frank, uh, you know,

1553
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.439
the psychiatrist who has been, uh, in, um, in

1554
01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:57.520
search for meaning.

1555
01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.439
Uh, MAYBE, I don't know. I don't know. I,

1556
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.240
I don't know Victor Victor Frankl, I think that's

1557
01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.200
the, the title of the book Man's Search for

1558
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:06.750
Meaning.

1559
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:09.200
You see that kind of thing, you know, when

1560
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.839
you, when you are, when you are, um, when

1561
01:27:12.839 --> 01:27:15.240
you are, when you experience such, uh, um, you

1562
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.770
know, uh, troubling and distressing events such as being

1563
01:27:18.959 --> 01:27:22.169
in a concentration camp, the main thing you try

1564
01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:26.470
to do later on is to explain it. And

1565
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.060
maybe there is an illusion, maybe this is our,

1566
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:32.299
you know, brain just, uh, being, uh, you know,

1567
01:27:32.509 --> 01:27:35.299
broken or maybe there is something, you know, bigger,

1568
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:36.620
uh, out of it. I don't know.

1569
01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.939
Uh, I, I mean, I, I don't know what

1570
01:27:38.939 --> 01:27:41.419
you think about this, but I have this idea

1571
01:27:41.419 --> 01:27:47.919
that most of what happens in psychotherapies, people, um,

1572
01:27:47.979 --> 01:27:53.899
psychotherapists trying to help their patients integrate wherever bad

1573
01:27:53.899 --> 01:27:57.689
happens in their lives, wherever. Yeah, whatever bad happens

1574
01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.839
in the labs into a personal narrative. And when

1575
01:28:00.839 --> 01:28:03.529
people are able to integrate that into a personal

1576
01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:06.890
narrative, then they make sense of it and that's

1577
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:09.129
when they are able to, I don't know, move

1578
01:28:09.129 --> 01:28:12.939
on with their lives and be more positive, I

1579
01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:13.479
guess.

1580
01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.549
Yeah, definitely, yes, yeah, yeah, I think, I think

1581
01:28:17.549 --> 01:28:21.299
that I, I don't think. I don't think that,

1582
01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.819
uh, you know, um, finding, uh, you know, a

1583
01:28:24.819 --> 01:28:30.220
reason just cognitively and from a cold perspective is

1584
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.500
can help you, uh, most of the times that

1585
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.700
cannot help you, but definitely I think that when

1586
01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.620
you are able to integrate and process all the

1587
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:45.970
information in appropriate way, your narrative becomes more um

1588
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.540
cohesive and coherent, yes, yeah, for sure, yeah.

1589
01:28:51.029 --> 01:28:53.709
OK, so let me ask you about another thing

1590
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:56.149
because this is also something that you studied when

1591
01:28:56.149 --> 01:29:00.870
it comes to evolutionary psychology specifically, what are the

1592
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:06.029
main topics of study there? Because I can, because

1593
01:29:06.029 --> 01:29:09.609
one of the things interestingly that I read and

1594
01:29:09.609 --> 01:29:13.870
heard from people who are not fans of evolutionary

1595
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:19.240
psychology but come from other Domains other areas like

1596
01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.359
for example, human beaver ecology or cultural evolutionary theories

1597
01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:28.479
that they say that evolutionary psychologists are too focused,

1598
01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.330
too obsessed with topics like mating, for example.

1599
01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:32.770
So

1600
01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:34.720
is, is that true or not?

1601
01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:38.669
Yeah, so I did this, um, these studies, computational

1602
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:42.509
linguistic studies, uh, thanks to a topic modeling approach.

1603
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:49.979
Or with a thing called uh Latentrichlet allocation. And

1604
01:29:50.339 --> 01:29:54.060
what if, and I analyzed the um if I

1605
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.459
remember correctly, about 300 or 400 abstracts. The, the

1606
01:29:57.459 --> 01:30:00.950
study has still to be published. I, I just

1607
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:04.600
uh Have a, had a presentation to a conference.

1608
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.560
But what I found out analyzing the abstracts of

1609
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.089
um ethology and sociobiology and then evolution and human

1610
01:30:12.089 --> 01:30:16.430
behavior, so the flagship journal Evolutionary Psychology. Yeah. By

1611
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:18.709
the way, it is also a journal, uh, very,

1612
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:23.490
um, very, uh, you know, in, in which many

1613
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:26.979
behavioral ecologists, uh, human behavioral ecologists published, so there

1614
01:30:26.979 --> 01:30:32.720
is not the dividing line. Um, BUT nevertheless, and,

1615
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:37.089
uh, and also, uh, like, just a note side,

1616
01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.939
the other link I, I found in between the

1617
01:30:39.939 --> 01:30:44.529
human behavioral eco uh, the, uh, culturally evolutionary program

1618
01:30:44.529 --> 01:30:48.459
and the Santa Barbara is that Richardson was the

1619
01:30:48.459 --> 01:30:52.620
chair of the evolution and Human Behavior Society, which

1620
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:56.419
is the Santa Barbara thing. So this is somehow

1621
01:30:56.419 --> 01:31:00.020
they, sometimes they communicate likely. Getting back to the

1622
01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:03.939
topics. Um, YEAH, so, uh, thanks to some, you

1623
01:31:03.939 --> 01:31:08.759
know, index, like, um, you know, um, I, I

1624
01:31:08.759 --> 01:31:13.410
found, uh, that, um, the, the, the, the, uh,

1625
01:31:13.419 --> 01:31:15.580
the core coherence and stability. I found that the

1626
01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:20.200
optimal number of topics was 13. And the topic

1627
01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.310
there is, there is mating there, of course.

1628
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:30.189
M mating and sex differences are that many people

1629
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:33.189
tend to associate with evolutionary psychology.

1630
01:31:33.399 --> 01:31:38.359
Definitely yes, but let me take the the the

1631
01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:41.000
graph so I can tell you more, uh, specifically

1632
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.089
what I'm talking about. Uh, SO, um, at the,

1633
01:31:46.169 --> 01:31:51.410
you know, so we have 1313, um, topics, first

1634
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:55.169
of all, and then, of course, I, I, I

1635
01:31:55.169 --> 01:31:57.180
can remember it without looking at it. So there

1636
01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.250
are 13 topics and I can, I can list

1637
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.689
it, list them to you. They are vocal communication.

1638
01:32:03.549 --> 01:32:08.819
KINSHIP group living, parental investment, male attractiveness, cultural and

1639
01:32:08.819 --> 01:32:13.660
cross-cultural studies, female mating, life history theory, social learning,

1640
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:20.549
disgust system, cooperation, perception, and um the kin detection

1641
01:32:20.549 --> 01:32:23.109
model in the same, uh, in the same analysis,

1642
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:28.029
sex differences and mating. OK. Of course, what I

1643
01:32:28.029 --> 01:32:32.229
want to stress about this um labeling is that

1644
01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:35.990
um well, topic modeling is kind to factorize this

1645
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:39.430
so you have after you decided uh on the

1646
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:43.390
optimal uh number of topics, you have have a

1647
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.299
list of the most probable words in that topic.

1648
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:50.750
And so by looking at the 1st 10 or

1649
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:53.879
20, you can have an idea on what this

1650
01:32:53.879 --> 01:32:55.750
topic is about. But of course, it, it's not

1651
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:59.149
something purely objective. This is important to, to tell

1652
01:32:59.149 --> 01:33:03.950
you. And so, these are the 1313 uh um

1653
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:06.180
topics and what I found, I also had, um,

1654
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:08.470
I also did a network analysis, so I, I

1655
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:13.009
plotted them, uh, graphically. And I saw that very

1656
01:33:13.009 --> 01:33:17.140
in, of course, mating is super important, but the

1657
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:20.049
central, the most, most central node in the network

1658
01:33:20.049 --> 01:33:21.180
is life history theory.

1659
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.120
Life history theory. Yeah. And

1660
01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.879
so I think, I think this is, this is

1661
01:33:25.879 --> 01:33:28.430
the, I would say this, this is the most

1662
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:32.479
important uh topic in evolutionary psychology so far. And

1663
01:33:32.479 --> 01:33:35.759
for instance, some, some traditional topic like uh parental

1664
01:33:35.759 --> 01:33:39.000
investment are colder, so they are decreasing in their

1665
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.399
prominence in the abstract of the evolution of human

1666
01:33:41.399 --> 01:33:44.569
behavior and previously on theology and sociobiology. On the

1667
01:33:44.569 --> 01:33:47.609
other hand, we have, we have, uh, this, you

1668
01:33:47.609 --> 01:33:49.729
know, centrality of life history theory. So I, I

1669
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:51.890
would say that it is not at all, all

1670
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:58.209
about mating, but surely, traditionally, um, uh, all the,

1671
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:00.919
you know, most, most of all of the evidence

1672
01:34:00.919 --> 01:34:04.049
on evolutionary psychology is exclusively on mating. David Bass

1673
01:34:04.049 --> 01:34:08.319
is dedicating himself a lifetime to mating. David Smith,

1674
01:34:08.649 --> 01:34:13.250
you know, uh, also. And um um so mating

1675
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:17.479
is, is super important, but I would say that

1676
01:34:17.479 --> 01:34:21.680
uh like the contemporary emotional psychology is focusing more

1677
01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.759
on life history theory.

1678
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:27.899
Right, which is interesting because life history theory is

1679
01:34:27.899 --> 01:34:32.140
something that at least I myself, I've already done

1680
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:35.779
more than 1000 interviews, but I would, I, I

1681
01:34:35.779 --> 01:34:39.220
would tend to associate it more with uh the

1682
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:45.609
biologists and the behavioral, the behavioral ecologists,

1683
01:34:45.779 --> 01:34:50.259
so. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, yes, but the,

1684
01:34:50.299 --> 01:34:53.729
the, the cool thing with life history theory. Is

1685
01:34:53.729 --> 01:34:57.009
that, you know, they, they have all these nice

1686
01:34:57.009 --> 01:35:00.850
models, uh, mathematical models. It is highly formal as

1687
01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:03.490
a theory. And uh there is also, you know,

1688
01:35:03.569 --> 01:35:07.089
the theory by, by Marco de Juice about evolutionary

1689
01:35:07.089 --> 01:35:10.890
psychology is all centered about life history theory. And

1690
01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:13.899
I think it is very, also very This is

1691
01:35:13.899 --> 01:35:16.270
another thing that clinicians would benefit a lot from

1692
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:20.660
evolutionaries like you, like the fact that the condition

1693
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.100
in which you are raised, the environmental variables, so

1694
01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:26.379
the harshness and the uh um um uh unpredictability

1695
01:35:26.379 --> 01:35:30.140
of your environment really set your biological parameters to

1696
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.770
a certain, you know, functioning. And so you are

1697
01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:35.180
more prone to go to the faster end of

1698
01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.180
the continuum or or to the slow end of

1699
01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.490
the continuum, and that is Fascinating because if you

1700
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:44.129
have, you know, this traditional approach of uh everything

1701
01:35:44.129 --> 01:35:47.970
that happens in your first years of life, bad

1702
01:35:47.970 --> 01:35:51.370
is going to ruin you exclusively. On the other

1703
01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:54.649
hand, if you, in a sort of humanistic psychology

1704
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:58.810
um uh way, see also, you know, the, the

1705
01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:01.569
good part of the um of the, the other

1706
01:36:01.569 --> 01:36:04.240
side of the coin, the, the good part, uh,

1707
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:06.250
you can see that many, uh, you know, uh

1708
01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:12.359
fascinating adaptations. ARE arising from harsh and unpredictable environment.

1709
01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:16.250
For instance, all the, um, all the uh adaptation

1710
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:20.680
in the creative uh schizotypic spectrum and uh also

1711
01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.680
some adaptation in the narcissistic spectrum, of course, not

1712
01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.680
the more of, not the most disturbing ones. But

1713
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.069
you see, again, we are kind of mixing the

1714
01:36:30.069 --> 01:36:33.209
moral level with the descriptive level. Uh, BECAUSE if

1715
01:36:33.209 --> 01:36:38.410
you see like most of the top-notch, uh, mm,

1716
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.709
you know, uh, people, uh, you know, successful people,

1717
01:36:41.959 --> 01:36:45.509
uh, in the, in the, um, even in academia

1718
01:36:45.959 --> 01:36:51.180
surely have some dark tri traits. Surely they have

1719
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:53.990
and uh there have been studies about it. And

1720
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:56.029
so, of course, you can see it morally and

1721
01:36:56.029 --> 01:36:58.339
that it's bad, but you can see it descriptively

1722
01:36:58.339 --> 01:37:00.310
and that it is true. And there are 22

1723
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.950
different things.

1724
01:37:01.799 --> 01:37:05.509
Right. So, let me just ask you because I

1725
01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:09.149
was reading here from your paper that you say,

1726
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:12.669
as you said there, the, the two most prevalent

1727
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:17.629
specific topics are mating, general and uh life. History

1728
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:20.589
theory, but then you also mentioned that the two

1729
01:37:20.589 --> 01:37:25.750
hottest topics are cooperation and male attractiveness, and the

1730
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:30.470
two coldest topics are mating general and parental investment

1731
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.459
theory. So explain that what,

1732
01:37:32.759 --> 01:37:34.990
yeah, yeah, so I have, I have a topic

1733
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:38.430
right here. So yes, so speaking of mating, I

1734
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:43.220
think that that is um and it is the

1735
01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.600
first in the, in, in the code, uh, in

1736
01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.680
the code list. So it is the topic that

1737
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.240
is has decreased with the um fitting regression line

1738
01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.709
like more, uh more sharply. OK. And so because

1739
01:37:57.709 --> 01:38:00.180
meeting was very important for David Bass and his

1740
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.770
collaborators to lay down the very foundation of uh

1741
01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:06.290
evolutionary psychology, but I think that. I don't know

1742
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:08.770
if everything that could have been written on mating

1743
01:38:08.770 --> 01:38:10.890
has been written, but most of it. So it

1744
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.569
is like less, less fascinating for, for people. And

1745
01:38:15.569 --> 01:38:18.850
speaking of the cold topics, the other cold topics

1746
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:22.080
are parental investment and the same thing, which is,

1747
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:24.399
you know, mating and parental investment are kind of

1748
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:28.609
intervened because, you know, uh, Trevor's theory about parental

1749
01:38:28.609 --> 01:38:33.000
investment informed David Bass on, on mating. And uh

1750
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.080
speaking of the hot topic, so I would say

1751
01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.209
that speaking of the first one, which is cooperation,

1752
01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.240
I would say that this is the reason, this

1753
01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.160
is informed that the cultural evolutional program because cooperation

1754
01:38:47.479 --> 01:38:52.200
is traditionally studied, you know, um, through, game theory,

1755
01:38:52.319 --> 01:38:58.040
for instance. And so highly mathematical model, uh, more

1756
01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:03.200
prone to kind of uh um anthropological lens. Uh,

1757
01:39:04.419 --> 01:39:06.740
BECAUSE, you know, cooperation has been studied traditionally by

1758
01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:11.609
anthropologists rather than psychologists, you know, and I think

1759
01:39:11.609 --> 01:39:14.180
this reflects what we are talking, what we were

1760
01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.129
talking about before. So the fact that cultural evolution

1761
01:39:18.129 --> 01:39:20.379
is a super trendy research program and so you

1762
01:39:20.379 --> 01:39:23.939
see it also in uh in uh evolution and

1763
01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:27.419
human behavior. Yeah. And speaking of the, on the

1764
01:39:27.419 --> 01:39:33.509
other, um, hot topics. Uh, ALSO that this uh

1765
01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:36.270
so we like if we, if we go on

1766
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.189
the ranking, we have cooperation and then we have,

1767
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.379
uh, uh, male attractiveness, which is the second, which

1768
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:46.509
nevertheless tied to mating. I don't know if I

1769
01:39:46.509 --> 01:39:49.350
have something to say about it. And then we

1770
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:52.669
have cultural and cross-cultural which is again tied to

1771
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:56.259
the cultural evolution uh research program, I would say.

1772
01:39:56.979 --> 01:40:00.970
And then we have the disgust system, which is

1773
01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:03.850
very interesting because the discuss system in the network

1774
01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:08.000
analysis, uh, it isn't, um, so a network analysis

1775
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.560
uh for, for those who doesn't know it is,

1776
01:40:11.569 --> 01:40:15.120
uh, basically a way to see partial correlations. So

1777
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:20.279
the uniquely, uh, the, the correlation between variables controlling,

1778
01:40:20.609 --> 01:40:25.899
uh, for the, for the, for the correlation. With

1779
01:40:25.899 --> 01:40:29.620
the other variables. So this X and it's uh

1780
01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:34.100
Y, um, the, the magnitude of this relationship is

1781
01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:37.779
controlled by the others, you know, potentially confounding variables

1782
01:40:37.779 --> 01:40:40.939
like Z in between them. And so you can

1783
01:40:40.939 --> 01:40:43.939
see how things are related to each other and

1784
01:40:43.939 --> 01:40:47.029
that this gas system is uh far away from

1785
01:40:47.029 --> 01:40:49.979
the, from the rest of the, of the, of

1786
01:40:49.979 --> 01:40:53.419
the, of the graph. And the interesting thing is

1787
01:40:53.419 --> 01:40:59.100
that It, it is like attachment, a motivational system.

1788
01:40:59.899 --> 01:41:02.759
But it is very, uh, it has been, uh,

1789
01:41:02.799 --> 01:41:06.709
you know, studied very specifically from the immunological perspective.

1790
01:41:06.759 --> 01:41:08.720
And so it is very not tied to the

1791
01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:11.799
other rest of the evolutionary reasoning, but it is

1792
01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:13.279
a kind of, you know, I, I've been to,

1793
01:41:13.479 --> 01:41:15.479
to a conference and that, there were a lot

1794
01:41:15.479 --> 01:41:19.810
of um contribution about disgust. So the tend to

1795
01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:23.629
avoid the potential pathogens in the, in the environment.

1796
01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:30.359
And then we to, to, and we have uh

1797
01:41:31.009 --> 01:41:34.479
vocal communication, which is the 5th, but I, I

1798
01:41:34.479 --> 01:41:36.169
don't know if I, if I have something to

1799
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:39.569
say about vocal communication. Uh, I think vocal communication

1800
01:41:39.569 --> 01:41:42.660
is, um, you know, it has been uh considered

1801
01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.779
as a separate topic, uh, because of the technicalities

1802
01:41:46.779 --> 01:41:51.819
of the LDA approach and, uh, but it could

1803
01:41:51.819 --> 01:41:56.819
be easily, um, I think merged on one end

1804
01:41:56.819 --> 01:42:00.209
to mating because uh studying, uh, you know, study

1805
01:42:00.209 --> 01:42:03.740
the um. The tone of males, uh, how it

1806
01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.819
is perceived as attractive or or not attractive by

1807
01:42:06.819 --> 01:42:09.100
women, or I think the other thing, uh, the

1808
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:11.819
other way it could be studied is maybe in

1809
01:42:11.819 --> 01:42:15.370
status competition, but yes, I think this is, uh,

1810
01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:19.370
this is, uh, what this this topic is about.

1811
01:42:19.899 --> 01:42:24.350
Mhm. So, um, just before we wrap up our

1812
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:27.729
conversation, let me ask you a broad question. So,

1813
01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:32.259
when it comes to evolutionary psychology, possibly being a

1814
01:42:32.259 --> 01:42:35.979
scientific revolution, you said no. But then, I mean,

1815
01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:39.294
how do you look at the Perhaps the future

1816
01:42:39.294 --> 01:42:43.805
of psychology, taking into account all of the issues

1817
01:42:43.805 --> 01:42:46.685
that we pointed to there, including the fact that

1818
01:42:46.964 --> 01:42:51.044
there's several different sub-disciplines tend to be insular and

1819
01:42:51.044 --> 01:42:54.685
not, there's not many cross fertilization, there's not lots

1820
01:42:54.685 --> 01:43:00.325
of cross fertilization uh across the different uh psychological

1821
01:43:00.325 --> 01:43:02.734
sub-disciplines. So how do you look at it? Do

1822
01:43:02.734 --> 01:43:07.410
you think that There's any chance of in the

1823
01:43:07.819 --> 01:43:13.419
somewhat near future having something that could become or

1824
01:43:13.419 --> 01:43:18.750
that could turn psychology into a paradigmatic discipline.

1825
01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.029
I don't think so. I don't think so. Uh

1826
01:43:23.029 --> 01:43:25.609
LUCKILY, I wish, I wish I would, uh, I

1827
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:29.689
wish I was more hopeful and optimistic, but I'm

1828
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:32.569
not, I'm not. I, if I, if I, if

1829
01:43:32.569 --> 01:43:35.410
I have, have to be honest, I see that

1830
01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:37.330
the, I don't know in the years to come,

1831
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:39.290
but as for now, I, I think, I, I,

1832
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:41.770
and I see this is a, uh, uh ill

1833
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:44.930
uh malady. And, uh, a, a problem, you know,

1834
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:47.990
the, the prominence of the standard social science model

1835
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:51.390
approach is getting bigger and bigger and getting ideological

1836
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:54.399
and ideological. And this is, uh, this is scary

1837
01:43:54.399 --> 01:43:56.310
for me. And this is scary for me because

1838
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:59.950
I have many emails, you know, asking for editors

1839
01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:04.040
and collaborators in leading journals in the field and

1840
01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.790
I perceived the, them a kind of racist because

1841
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:10.509
they just want, you know, people from, from mar.

1842
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.080
OR you know, by, by, I, I, I do

1843
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.640
call it um by um communities and uh I

1844
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.640
don't like this kind of uh you know, trend

1845
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.759
which is endemic in the US aca academia. So

1846
01:44:27.759 --> 01:44:31.759
speaking of the, you know, um, brief or medium

1847
01:44:31.759 --> 01:44:34.790
term, I see this is a problem. Um, I

1848
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:36.439
don't know if this is the main problem of

1849
01:44:36.439 --> 01:44:38.660
psychology, but this is one of, one problem. I,

1850
01:44:38.759 --> 01:44:40.520
I, I, I, I see that it's getting more

1851
01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.120
and more ideological, and I think this is a

1852
01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.740
huge problem, a huge problem. Uh, AS a side.

1853
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:56.479
Um, As another big problem is tied to another

1854
01:44:56.479 --> 01:44:59.000
bigger problem, not tied exclusively to psychology, but is

1855
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.000
that of hyperproductivity. And I think that uh most

1856
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.359
of scientific, so for instance, in the study that

1857
01:45:07.359 --> 01:45:11.970
I've done on psychinfo, we found that Each day

1858
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:18.799
on cycling for. So, the medium, on average each

1859
01:45:18.799 --> 01:45:23.009
day in scientific psychology, if you call scientific psychology

1860
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:31.959
each paper indexed in like info, we have 437.5

1861
01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:37.160
papers published. That means approximately 1 paper every 3

1862
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.629
minutes. Mm Yeah, that's,

1863
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.259
that's a bit ridiculous.

1864
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:48.229
That's a bit, that's totally ridiculous, you know, you

1865
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:51.390
think, of course, of course, you know, as science

1866
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:55.109
grows, you cannot be, um, you, you, you can

1867
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:57.549
be specialized in your own niche, of course, you

1868
01:45:57.549 --> 01:46:00.000
can, you know, you, there is no Leonardo da

1869
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.200
Vinci anymore in our society, and that's OK, but

1870
01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:07.229
But this kind of hyper productivity, which is not,

1871
01:46:07.399 --> 01:46:09.799
you know, an exclusive of psychology, is endemic in

1872
01:46:09.799 --> 01:46:15.580
medicine, biology, engineering, and whatever. Um, IT'S, it's pushing

1873
01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:19.560
the scientific standards down. And I see also in,

1874
01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.720
in my personal academic, uh, you know, life, uh,

1875
01:46:22.799 --> 01:46:24.919
and I, I think I, I'm, I'm, I'm about

1876
01:46:24.919 --> 01:46:26.479
to finish my PhD and then I think I

1877
01:46:26.479 --> 01:46:28.919
will have some time, uh, you know, away from

1878
01:46:28.919 --> 01:46:31.000
academia, maybe in the future, I will be back

1879
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.790
at it, but for now, I have to spend

1880
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:36.160
some, some time away. I, I see that, you

1881
01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:42.240
know, scientific transparency and quality are Super rare and

1882
01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.279
most of the time is uh is um is

1883
01:46:46.279 --> 01:46:50.799
uh is like who you know, uh who you

1884
01:46:50.799 --> 01:46:57.220
are submitting your paper with and, and So that

1885
01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:00.899
is another, and, and most of the, and, and

1886
01:47:00.899 --> 01:47:03.060
I'm, I'm not afraid to say, to say, most

1887
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:05.689
of the professors, even a full professor I know,

1888
01:47:06.259 --> 01:47:10.060
they're not good scientists. Most of them, most of

1889
01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.259
them. Like I, I, I can count on my

1890
01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:13.660
hand, you know, the, you know, the, the good

1891
01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.779
scientists I know. Like, at least not, not speaking

1892
01:47:16.779 --> 01:47:19.660
of, um, not speaking of, uh, you know, pure

1893
01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.259
intellectual ability, which is one thing and it's truly

1894
01:47:22.259 --> 01:47:25.779
important, but about, you know, ethical transparency and, uh,

1895
01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:29.899
you know, um the willingness of, uh, doing a

1896
01:47:29.899 --> 01:47:32.859
research just to do the research, just to answer

1897
01:47:32.859 --> 01:47:35.500
the fucking question, you know. And I think, I

1898
01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:39.089
think that's, that's kind of uh disturbing. And so,

1899
01:47:39.299 --> 01:47:42.020
uh, this is one other bigger problem, not tied

1900
01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.899
to psychology, which is also kind of, you know,

1901
01:47:45.339 --> 01:47:50.100
people don't have time to read. Papers. People and

1902
01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.490
most, most importantly, people do not have to think.

1903
01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:56.279
And, and they think that, you know, theoretical question

1904
01:47:56.279 --> 01:47:58.879
because one of the problems of evolutionary psychology is

1905
01:47:58.879 --> 01:48:01.620
that it is heavy theoretically laden, and I love

1906
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.399
it for that because it has a lot of

1907
01:48:03.399 --> 01:48:05.879
theory behind it. And it is very rare in

1908
01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:08.680
psychology. If you go to social psychology, it's all,

1909
01:48:08.759 --> 01:48:12.560
you know, sla equation models, uh factor loadings. Now

1910
01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.700
we have a theory. This, this kind of attitude,

1911
01:48:15.759 --> 01:48:18.339
you know. And, uh, on the other hand, the,

1912
01:48:18.419 --> 01:48:20.339
the thing I love of evolutionary psychology and they

1913
01:48:20.339 --> 01:48:22.910
spend time in thinking, OK, what is the most

1914
01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.569
um uh most reasonable theory to endorse, to have

1915
01:48:27.569 --> 01:48:30.020
a decent theory of the human mind. We have

1916
01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.259
this proposal, maybe we are wrong in some regards,

1917
01:48:32.299 --> 01:48:33.859
but we have this proposal, and I think this

1918
01:48:33.859 --> 01:48:36.979
is still the most solid and robust proposal because

1919
01:48:36.979 --> 01:48:39.419
it, it, it ties psychology to, to biology, which

1920
01:48:39.419 --> 01:48:44.069
is a necessity in my opinion. And um Still,

1921
01:48:44.359 --> 01:48:46.120
a lot of people do not have the time

1922
01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.959
to think or do not have interesting uh interest

1923
01:48:49.959 --> 01:48:51.839
in theoretical issues. And so there are, you know,

1924
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.120
this um super empiricism which is, which is a

1925
01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:01.240
catastrophe in, in psychology. And so this is the

1926
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.779
3rd reason. So, first reason, uh, we have, uh,

1927
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:06.950
we have, you know, the SSM, uh, the ideology,

1928
01:49:07.009 --> 01:49:09.870
then we have high productivity, then we have the

1929
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:14.109
unwillingness of scholars to think and to read. And

1930
01:49:14.109 --> 01:49:16.430
so I don't think, I don't see it as

1931
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:21.189
a possible uh for revolutionary psychology or other theories

1932
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:24.669
to become paradigms. I, I see the possibility, to

1933
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:29.250
be honest, of the SSM as for now, the

1934
01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:31.750
standard social on the other end, it seemed that

1935
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:34.629
it is right now the most, the closest thing

1936
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:37.310
to a paradigm in psychology that, that I ever

1937
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:39.750
seen in my life because people are scared of

1938
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:42.410
being against it. And, and so, you know, they,

1939
01:49:42.589 --> 01:49:45.180
they, they don't, don't want to do anything against

1940
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.799
it. And I don't know, maybe this is not

1941
01:49:47.799 --> 01:49:50.879
going to last, hopefully, but, uh, actually, this is

1942
01:49:50.879 --> 01:49:54.040
uh quite endemic among people. uh, FOR instance, a

1943
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.629
lot of people in neuroscience are, are, are, uh,

1944
01:49:56.959 --> 01:50:00.950
are, uh, more than happy to join SSM instances.

1945
01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:07.709
Uh, SO people biologists, biology-oriented people, and And so,

1946
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:10.549
yes, my, my, I, I, I, I, I'm not,

1947
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:13.680
I, I'm not that hopeful uh for the future

1948
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:16.250
and I don't know, I don't know if we,

1949
01:50:16.259 --> 01:50:19.359
we, maybe the only thing we would be ever

1950
01:50:19.359 --> 01:50:23.990
able is that when you, when we have that

1951
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:27.910
um knowledge of genetics that will help us, you

1952
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:30.319
know, in tracing, you know, the power of uh

1953
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:35.310
of genetics in determining our disposition dispositions, that could

1954
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:39.350
be one thing. But you, you see, this is

1955
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:44.200
very problematic relationship with ethics. And with uh the,

1956
01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.229
the temptation to conflate is versus out and uh

1957
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.549
human to human, as Nietzsche used to say, tendency

1958
01:50:51.549 --> 01:50:54.810
of not being transparent and uh and honest in

1959
01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:58.359
life. And yeah, as for now, I'm not optimistic.

1960
01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:04.390
Well, it is, uh, I, I mean, I'm also

1961
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:08.339
not very optimistic, particularly even more so because of

1962
01:51:08.339 --> 01:51:11.950
the, the lack of cross fertilization and the fact

1963
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:15.149
that people do not have enough time to familiarize

1964
01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:19.814
them. Themselves with other specialized areas. So, yeah, it,

1965
01:51:19.935 --> 01:51:23.975
it's very complicated. I, I don't blame anyone. I,

1966
01:51:24.055 --> 01:51:27.165
I don't blame people in general because it's also

1967
01:51:27.455 --> 01:51:30.734
very hard to have enough time to do that,

1968
01:51:30.814 --> 01:51:36.509
so. And perhaps, and perhaps just having more time

1969
01:51:36.509 --> 01:51:40.339
to think would be good because if you go

1970
01:51:40.339 --> 01:51:44.660
and go back and look into the biographies of

1971
01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:48.390
some of the greatest geniuses in history, they all

1972
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:51.379
have tons of time to think, so.

1973
01:51:52.259 --> 01:51:55.500
You know, uh, I think Darwin, it took Darwin

1974
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:58.839
something like 20 or 30 years to write the

1975
01:51:58.839 --> 01:52:02.700
Origin of Species, which is, which is unthinkable in

1976
01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:06.779
these times, unthinkable, unthinkable. You, you, you do not

1977
01:52:06.779 --> 01:52:10.700
even have 20 days, so it's kind of, it's

1978
01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:12.419
kind of, you know, you, you, you, you don't

1979
01:52:12.419 --> 01:52:16.009
have the time to think and um. Yes, I

1980
01:52:16.009 --> 01:52:17.509
think this is the major, major problem.

1981
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:21.870
Yes. Yeah. OK, so where can people find you

1982
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:23.859
when you work on the internet?

1983
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:28.709
OK, so, um, good question. So uh you can

1984
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:32.189
contact me in my email. Uh, I can, I

1985
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:34.509
can, which is, uh, I can, I don't know

1986
01:52:34.509 --> 01:52:36.060
if you can like um

1987
01:52:36.359 --> 01:52:39.049
Uh, like, uh, put it on the description, yeah,

1988
01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:39.370
the

1989
01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:43.129
description of my personal email. Then I'm building my

1990
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:46.290
personal site which will be online, I think in

1991
01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:48.209
2 or 3 weeks. I don't know when will

1992
01:52:48.209 --> 01:52:51.209
this be released, but uh uh I have a

1993
01:52:51.209 --> 01:52:54.169
personal site. I have also an Instagram account, which

1994
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:56.859
is more like in Italian, so I, because I

1995
01:52:56.859 --> 01:52:59.290
kind of do like uh I, I, I love

1996
01:52:59.290 --> 01:53:03.180
to do kind of popular science. Uh, VIDEO to,

1997
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:05.089
you know, to communicate sciences. I also I have

1998
01:53:05.089 --> 01:53:07.890
a TikTok account, but it's in Italian, so I

1999
01:53:07.890 --> 01:53:09.609
don't know if the people of the watching this

2000
01:53:09.609 --> 01:53:11.529
video are interested in it, but I can share

2001
01:53:11.529 --> 01:53:13.009
you with you all the details and you can

2002
01:53:13.009 --> 01:53:15.290
find them in the description. And if you have

2003
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:17.850
some questions, please do not hesitate in contacting me.
