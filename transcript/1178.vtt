00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.259
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.570
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Ops, and

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.859
today I'm joined by Doctor Karen Lloyd. She's the

4
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.899
Wrigley Chair in Environmental Studies and professor of Earth

5
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.940
Sciences at the University of Southern California. And today

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.979
we're talking about her book Intra-Terrestrials Discovering the Strangest

7
00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:25.579
Life on Earth. So, Doctor Lloyd, welcome to the

8
00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.120
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.309
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.119
So what are intraterrestrials?

11
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.450
It's not a very commonly used term, but, um,

12
00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:40.610
it's, I'm using it to talk about anything that's

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.139
alive inside Earth. Um, IT turns out that it's

14
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.340
a kind of a different community than what we

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.180
experience in our daily lives, um, different enough that

16
00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:51.650
it kind of needs it, its own name. Um,

17
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.330
I didn't come up with that name, but, um,

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.380
a couple of other scientists did, but I find

19
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.099
it useful.

20
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.709
And are these all unicellular organisms, or can some

21
00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:03.130
of them be multicellular?

22
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.510
For the most part, these are unicellular organisms, so

23
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.459
tiny little single-celled microbes, um, but of course they

24
00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.150
interact with each other and they form sort of

25
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.629
biofilms with each other and so then you start

26
00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:19.110
to that question of what's a single-celled organism versus

27
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.769
what's a tissue, you know, is this a community.

28
00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:24.620
Um, SO that line gets a little hazy, but

29
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.419
also some of my colleagues have found like eukaryotes,

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.300
so worms, tiny worms, um, buried deeply in Earth's

31
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.540
crust as well. So I wouldn't rule out the

32
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.160
presence of, um, some small multicellular organisms as well.

33
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.139
Yeah, and what is the subsurface habitat like? I

34
00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:47.059
mean, how, and does it vary or not?

35
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.949
Yeah, it's pretty varied all over Earth. I mean,

36
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.069
so you can think about Earth as in like

37
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.300
layers and the layer that we're concerned with in

38
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.430
our daily lives is where the trees and the

39
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.019
sun and the birds and, you know, all the,

40
00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:00.669
all the things that we experience in our daily

41
00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:02.790
life, but we don't often spend a lot of

42
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.230
time thinking about what's underneath our feet. And, you

43
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.258
know, literally where you're standing right now, underneath you

44
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:12.169
is probably some soil, probably some Um, rock, um,

45
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.490
you know, eventually it gets pretty hot if you

46
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.130
keep going straight down from where you are right

47
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.610
now. Um, BUT, you know, you and I are

48
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.320
in different places and so what that environment would

49
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.610
look like underneath our feet is very different. It

50
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.169
would have different amounts of porosity. It would have

51
00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.830
different types of energetic resources that can support life.

52
00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.410
Um, IT'S, uh, it's actually a, a vastly diverse

53
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.449
ecosystem down there.

54
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.250
And how do you go about exhuming living beings

55
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.990
from the subsurface?

56
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.199
Um, WE go about it in a lot of

57
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:49.050
different ways. Um, IT tends to be, um, creative

58
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.160
and sometimes desperate. Um, IT'S hard to get things

59
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.130
from inside Earth, um. So, sort of the two

60
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.410
main categories as I see it are either we

61
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.559
dig down to them or we wait for them

62
00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.610
to come up to us. And so the digging

63
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.630
down to them option is a lot of um

64
00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.210
we have giant drills and drill ships that we

65
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.130
can go out in the ocean and drill underneath

66
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.645
the ocean. There's drilling on land, making big boreholes.

67
00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:17.235
These are pretty big, um, a lot of financial

68
00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:20.554
and time and expertise resources have to go into,

69
00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:22.285
to doing these sorts of things or we can

70
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.365
do simpler things like just take a handheld core,

71
00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:28.904
uh, like punching a straw into a slushie. Um.

72
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.529
There's also sort of waiting for it to come

73
00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.899
back up to us. There's a lot of natural

74
00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.070
springs that are deeply sourced. So you can go

75
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.740
to like one place in Canada has um some

76
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.059
waters that are gushing up slowly from a giant

77
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.100
underground aquifer that are, have not seen the light

78
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.259
of day for over a billion years, which I

79
00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.699
just still have trouble even understanding the magnitude of

80
00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.020
that.

81
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.970
Yeah. Uh, AND since they tend to be, or

82
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.669
for the most part, they are unicellular, cellular, and

83
00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.460
they are so small, how do you see them?

84
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.750
What kinds of techniques do you employ?

85
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.119
So we use a lot of um sort of

86
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.839
uh DNA techniques is probably our number one way

87
00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.479
of getting at these things because if you, if

88
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.320
you spread them out on a petri dish or

89
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.238
you put them in some liquid medium and wait

90
00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:22.279
for them to start growing, like maybe they don't

91
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.959
know how to react to what you've given them

92
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.880
to eat. Um, SO you can't expect them to

93
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480
do that. So we, um, generally speaking, kill them.

94
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.799
The first thing we do is kill them. Don't

95
00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:34.279
worry, there's, there's literally billions and billions, they are,

96
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.179
they're all right. Um, AND then, uh, we crack

97
00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:39.579
them open and take out their DNA, um, but

98
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.260
we also, you know, since we found DNA to

99
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.579
be so useful in reconstructing their lives, we try

100
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:47.820
to take all the biomolecules that we can. So

101
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.859
we take RNA, take proteins, we take small metabolites.

102
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.980
Um, LIPIDS, we just, whatever we can do to,

103
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.970
to sort of pick apart what these things' lives

104
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.130
are, um, and then we measure all the chemicals

105
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.700
around them too and sort of put those two

106
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.359
things together and say, OK, there's genes to eat

107
00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:06.820
a certain chemical. Do we see evidence of that

108
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.559
chemical is being eaten, that kind of thing.

109
00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:14.549
And how do they breathe, quote unquote in these

110
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:19.179
environments, and I mean what corresponds to their breathing?

111
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.630
Yeah,

112
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.059
breathing is a tough word. It's, um, you know,

113
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.910
it's, you, they, what they do is they take

114
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.630
breathing down to its most essential chemical details, um,

115
00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.420
you know, we associate breathing with. Inspiration, you know,

116
00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.940
lungs taking air into our lungs, um, and that,

117
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.820
that's true, of course, um, but they, um, show

118
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.700
that that's not the important part of breathing. The

119
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.899
important part even for us of breathing is when

120
00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.519
those tiny chemicals that are carried in our blood

121
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.540
reach the oxygen that's in, you know, that comes

122
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.549
into our lungs and the, the, the actual respiration

123
00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:56.500
part of this is that chemical reaction that we

124
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.750
have in our own bodies with um Electron-rich chemicals

125
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.790
from our food and oxygen. And so, since these,

126
00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:09.510
these organisms sort of, I don't want to say

127
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.269
they realized that, but they make use of the

128
00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:13.589
fact that that's all that respiration is. Um, IT

129
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.010
doesn't depend on oxygen, it doesn't depend on air.

130
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.630
Um, THEY will do that chemical reaction with lots

131
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.570
and lots of chemicals. So that really cracks open

132
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.070
the possibilities for, for breathing for life to extend

133
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.290
to Almost everything in the middle of the periodic

134
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.329
table can be breathed by something on life, um,

135
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.459
in, on, I'm sorry, on Earth. Um, THEY, anything,

136
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.089
any chemical or element that is capable of giving

137
00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:44.899
up an electron or receiving an electron is probably

138
00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.209
gonna be used by life to breathe, um, and

139
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.959
they even go so far as to Um, not

140
00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.040
even use chemicals in some cases. Um, THEY just

141
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.720
break it down to its barest essentials, which is

142
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.190
really just the movement of electrons and they can

143
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.519
work with electrons directly.

144
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.589
Mhm. And, and some of them even breathe, so

145
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.359
to speak, uh, rocks,

146
00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.750
yeah, yeah. So these solid surfaces are great places

147
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.709
in the subsurface. I mean, if there's one thing

148
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.720
that the subsurface is rich with, it's rocks, right?

149
00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:19.109
It is, it's made up of rocks, and so

150
00:07:19.109 --> 00:07:21.190
that's nice because it's a nice place to settle.

151
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.540
It's a nice place to sort of hang out

152
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.429
and a home that you can make. For yourself

153
00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:28.549
if you're a subsurface being, um, but also the

154
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:31.299
rocks are often made of these metals like iron.

155
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.670
They're really good at either accepting an electron or

156
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.429
donating an electron and so they can, they can

157
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.350
do that right there with the rocks around them.

158
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.910
So they, it's kind of like they're breathing their

159
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.450
house.

160
00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:46.130
Uh, AND how do they have access to energy?

161
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:50.940
Um, SO, they, you know, if you think about

162
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.579
rock and you think about trying to live in

163
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:55.260
rock, it may seem like nothing really happens, um,

164
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.339
but actually, you can, um, things do happen. Um,

165
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:03.459
FLUIDS move around, we have earthquakes, there's, um, ways

166
00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.105
to make new chemicals. So there, there is Sources

167
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.105
of energy that are geological sources of energy that

168
00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:12.734
have nothing to do with sunlight, you know, our

169
00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:15.005
main form of energy up here is, is sunlight

170
00:08:15.184 --> 00:08:16.904
and then the things that come from that later

171
00:08:16.904 --> 00:08:19.464
like the breakdown of the plants, the food that

172
00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:21.975
the plants make for us, um, but they are

173
00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:25.304
instead dependent upon geological sources of all these chemicals.

174
00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:31.209
How do they play with thermodynamics? I mean, how

175
00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:33.070
does it work in their case?

176
00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:36.450
Yeah, so thermodynamics is not something that we talk

177
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.690
about a lot with biology, um, and that's, uh,

178
00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:41.609
the fact that we don't talk about it with

179
00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:45.090
biology is, is instructive, you know, we, we don't

180
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.270
talk about it that much. I mean, there are

181
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.409
parts of biology that, that do do, I don't.

182
00:08:49.484 --> 00:08:50.875
I want to say that no one does, but,

183
00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:53.005
you know, it's just not in our common parlance.

184
00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:54.525
Um, WE think of it more as like a

185
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:57.125
chemistry or a physics thing, but the reason that

186
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.885
we don't talk about it that much, at least

187
00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:02.724
for respiration, is that our thermo thermodynamics as these,

188
00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.770
you know, beings that we are, are quite boring.

189
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.409
Like we just have a ton of energy. We're

190
00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:14.289
not energy-limited. Um, OUR food will always, as long

191
00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:16.969
as we have access to food and air, we

192
00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.929
will always get energy from it. These beings, these

193
00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:25.344
subsurface beings live at the Edge of what's thermodynamically

194
00:09:25.344 --> 00:09:28.825
possible. They're getting energy from tiny, tiny little quanta

195
00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:32.505
of energy that are so small that something, if

196
00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:36.104
something changes about their environment, then the same food

197
00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:39.224
that gave them energy yesterday, even when it's present,

198
00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:42.025
will not give them energy today. And that is,

199
00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:45.380
that is just something that it's a It's a

200
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.429
situation for which we have no analog in our

201
00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:51.109
lives. Like, it doesn't, a hamburger is always gonna

202
00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:53.450
give you energy as long as you can breathe,

203
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.210
um, but for them that can switch on them,

204
00:09:56.349 --> 00:09:59.570
and, and I, I find that really fascinating. Mhm.

205
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.109
I, in what ways would you say these beings

206
00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:05.890
change our conception of life?

207
00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:10.659
So, we have this, this assumption that, you know,

208
00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:13.090
we are, I shouldn't speak for other people. I,

209
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.859
I sort of have this implicit assumption in my

210
00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:18.419
own head that everything does need um sunlight and

211
00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:20.419
everything does need oxygen because that, that really is

212
00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:25.039
what drives everything up here. Um, BUT these Intraterrestrials

213
00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:27.349
show us that actually there's a whole another world

214
00:10:27.349 --> 00:10:30.880
that can exist without sunlight and without the dead

215
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.880
things falling down. I mean, they use the dead

216
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.960
bodies that fall down for sure. Um, BUT that

217
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.000
they can get by without it as well. Um,

218
00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:40.679
THEY can do all the same things without any

219
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:44.219
inputs from the surface world. And that, that is

220
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.400
the notion that there are, that life extends that

221
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.679
deeply into the realm of chemistry and into the

222
00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:54.909
realm of physics is something that Changes my, my

223
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:56.030
way of thinking, for sure.

224
00:10:57.099 --> 00:11:02.479
Does the existence of these intraterrestrials have any implications

225
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.700
uh as uh for what we know about the

226
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.679
evolutionary relationships among all life on Earth?

227
00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:12.229
So one of the weirdest things that we found

228
00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:14.150
when we first started looking at DNA that we

229
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.030
pull out of these deep environments was that the

230
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.950
DNA that we were pulling out did not match

231
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.909
the DNA of anything we'd ever seen before. Um,

232
00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:24.830
I, I was there for this. This was one

233
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.020
of my first projects as a PhD student in

234
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.645
the early 2000s. I was trying to, you know,

235
00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:31.674
I was, I was pulling these DNA sequences out

236
00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:34.364
of some deep subsurface samples. And I was like,

237
00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:37.484
OK, am I gonna have this kind of proteobacteria

238
00:11:37.484 --> 00:11:38.844
or am I gonna have a firm acute? Is

239
00:11:38.844 --> 00:11:40.205
it gonna be gram positive? Is it gonna be

240
00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:42.604
gram negative? All these things that I've learned about

241
00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:45.885
microbiology. And what it was, was none of that.

242
00:11:46.044 --> 00:11:51.539
It was Totally, totally independent. It was so weird

243
00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:54.539
that I thought I was screwing it up, um,

244
00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:56.700
because when you're first starting out, that's always, I

245
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.260
see this in my own students. The first thought

246
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.179
is, well, I just, I just messed it up

247
00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:01.619
somehow. Let's throw it all away and start over

248
00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:03.059
and like, wait, don't throw it away. You're doing

249
00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:06.419
a good job. Um, SO, uh, one reason why

250
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.190
I knew that it wasn't me who was screwing

251
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.669
up, is that it matched almost perfectly to what

252
00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:16.309
my colleagues were getting in Japan, and what other

253
00:12:16.309 --> 00:12:19.710
colleagues were getting um in New Jersey, and different

254
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.409
places all around the world and the UK. And

255
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.590
so when you put together, when you string together

256
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.690
like, 1500, that's how long this gene is, 1500

257
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.409
AG C T T GC, uh, you know, if

258
00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:38.169
you get that order, almost exactly the same between

259
00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:40.650
what I'm getting in the Gulf of Mexico and

260
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.119
what somebody's getting in Japan, that didn't happen by

261
00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:45.210
accident. Um, I didn't screw up and they didn't

262
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.900
screw up. We're both looking at something real, but

263
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.440
it's something that no one's ever seen before. And

264
00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:52.940
what we found, we now know is that this

265
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.179
is a new deep branch. There's many, many new

266
00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:59.099
deep branches on the tree of life, and we

267
00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:02.739
have so many more relatives than we ever knew

268
00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:04.700
that we did, um, on this planet.

269
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.469
So I would like to ask you now about

270
00:13:08.469 --> 00:13:11.429
the kinds of organisms that we can find across

271
00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:14.390
different kinds of environments just for people to also

272
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.510
have a better understanding of exactly what we're talking

273
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.830
about here. So, what kinds of life have you

274
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.989
found on the sea floor and particularly in methane

275
00:13:25.989 --> 00:13:26.570
seeps?

276
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.530
Yeah, so methane seeps are a great source of

277
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.210
energy for microbiota. Um, METHANE can interact with sulfate,

278
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.369
it can interact with iron, it can interact with

279
00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:40.330
oxygen to do all these different respirations. Um, SO

280
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.650
we tend to see, um, uh, a lot of

281
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.969
energetic things happening at methane seeps at the bottom

282
00:13:45.969 --> 00:13:47.450
of the sea. So, if you go down in

283
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.890
a, in a submersible, um, In the Atlantic basin

284
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.289
in the middle of the Atlantic and you drop

285
00:13:53.289 --> 00:13:57.330
down, it's just kinda be a sandy-looking muddy bottom

286
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.169
without much going on. You might see a couple

287
00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:02.289
of things, but if you drop down onto a

288
00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:06.049
methane seep, you're gonna see a teeming life, crabs

289
00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:09.450
and worms and worms that are so dependent upon

290
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.729
the microbial interaction with these chemicals that they actually

291
00:14:12.729 --> 00:14:15.804
don't have mouths. Anymore. They don't even try to

292
00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:20.125
eat normal worm food. They just bring in chemicals

293
00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:23.664
for these little intraterrestrials that live inside their bodies

294
00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:26.604
and they, those microbes then will make food for

295
00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:29.525
the worm. Um, THEY'RE completely dependent upon it.

296
00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:35.650
How about the Arctic permafrost? What kinds of organisms

297
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.950
can we find there?

298
00:14:37.489 --> 00:14:42.369
Um, WE'RE really, um, just starting to work on

299
00:14:42.369 --> 00:14:45.330
permafrost, I would say, because, um, it's often quite

300
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.450
inaccessible. It's buried underneath layers of, of soil, um,

301
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.169
so you, you have to drill down to it

302
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:53.260
for the most part. Um, SOMETIMES when it slumps

303
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.570
as it's thawing from climate change, we can kind

304
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.450
of get at it from the side, um, which

305
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.669
can be useful as well. Um, SO, what we're

306
00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:03.260
seeing from this is that actually there seem to

307
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.820
be a lot of things that live in permafrost,

308
00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:09.460
even very ancient permafrost, and um that's, that's not

309
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.479
a new idea. This is um, Um, some colleagues

310
00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:15.609
of mine in Russia for, uh, maybe 20 years

311
00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:18.450
ago came up with this concept of, um, these

312
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.330
brines. So as you freeze, if you take to

313
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.729
soil with water in it, and it freezes, then

314
00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:27.890
the water that freezes into ice is freezing as

315
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.849
pure water like H2O, which leaves any salts that

316
00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:33.849
were like even freshwater will have like a little

317
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:36.109
bit of salts in it. That will again, then

318
00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:39.075
get concentrated in the remaining liquid water. Such that

319
00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:40.914
as you increase as you make more and more

320
00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:43.755
ice, at some point, the leftover water is salty

321
00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:47.914
enough that it actually lowers its freezing point. And

322
00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:51.674
so now this briny water that's leftover never freezes.

323
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:55.765
So it's below zero, it can be -5, -10,

324
00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:59.474
but it's liquid and so these organisms do live

325
00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:02.715
in permafrost slowly. They're not doing much, um, but

326
00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:04.395
as far as we can tell, they're alive in

327
00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:05.135
permafrost.

328
00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:10.299
Another place that I would imagine people would not

329
00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:13.599
think it would be possible to find life there

330
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.219
is the bottom of active volcanoes. So what can

331
00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:18.570
we find there exactly?

332
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:22.059
So I do not, well, I have not, and

333
00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:23.289
I, I want to be clear that I'm not

334
00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:26.770
saying that we're finding life in lava. Lava is

335
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.080
too hot for life that we know, um. You

336
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.760
know, I won't discount that life can be made

337
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.880
of other things than carbon, but carbon-based life is,

338
00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:36.489
is gonna burn up in lava. Um, BUT the

339
00:16:36.489 --> 00:16:39.679
nice thing about volcanoes is that they are the

340
00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:44.940
ultimate source of good geological food and nutrients coming

341
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.359
up to the, to the surface. And so, They

342
00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:54.039
bring with them, uh, carbon dioxide, nitrogen compounds, so

343
00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:57.400
much sulfur compounds, and iron. Um, THERE'S just a

344
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.309
lot of really important biological elements that are brought

345
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:03.739
up by volcanoes from the deep earth. And so,

346
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.280
what you'll see is when it gets cool enough

347
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.319
on the edges of volcanoes, even down at the

348
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.000
base of them, even very close to the inside

349
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.280
of them, we see life just creeping in wherever

350
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.079
it can to make use of all that good

351
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.108
stuff. Until it erupts and is killed.

352
00:17:20.719 --> 00:17:23.530
And as far as you explore in your book,

353
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.449
there's also life, or there can, there can also

354
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:30.729
exist life in boiling water, pure acid, and bleach,

355
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.489
right? I mean, those are at least they sound

356
00:17:34.489 --> 00:17:35.729
like extreme

357
00:17:35.729 --> 00:17:38.050
conditions. Yeah, it's wild. The first time I started

358
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.875
working on hypertherm. IS what we call the ones

359
00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:44.035
that live in 100 degrees. Um, IF you've ever

360
00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:45.994
done like a lab class or something and you

361
00:17:45.994 --> 00:17:47.944
had to make media, you maybe made an auger

362
00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:49.755
plate, you had to be very careful to be

363
00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:52.234
sterile, right? Like you didn't want to contaminate your,

364
00:17:52.334 --> 00:17:54.675
your medium. So that's how we do it. That's

365
00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:57.234
how we make media. And it's such a strange

366
00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:00.650
cognitive dissonance to be You know, holding these, being

367
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.260
so careful with media preparation and, you know, being

368
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.410
so loving and, and making sure that there's everything

369
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.500
that these organisms need to live. And then when

370
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.760
you inoculate it, when you have a hyperthermophile, you

371
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.449
throw it in a vat of boiling water. And

372
00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:15.250
it just feels so weird. I mean, it's in

373
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.869
a tube, right? So it's not like the water

374
00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:19.410
doesn't get inside the, the thing. But it's so

375
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.890
weird to be like, spending time nurturing this precious

376
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.760
little thing and then you just like dunk it

377
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.520
in boiling water. But if you don't do that,

378
00:18:26.569 --> 00:18:29.089
it's not gonna grow. And so it's, it's really

379
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:32.609
amazing. Um, THEY, they really, they just need things

380
00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:35.569
to be that hot. Otherwise, their enzymes don't really

381
00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:37.709
work right. Yeah, wild.

382
00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:40.989
Yeah, yeah, right. Uh, IN your book, you also

383
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:44.030
talk about how some of them can live for

384
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.589
hundreds or even thousands of years or longer. How

385
00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:48.670
can they do that?

386
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.270
Yeah, we, this is something we are definitely still

387
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.469
working on. Um, PROVING that is hard. Um, YOU

388
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.030
know, we can do a lot with variables. We

389
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.869
can make all kinds of temperatures, we can make

390
00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:03.030
all kinds of pressures in our labs. Um, THERE

391
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.510
are people who, there are geologists who make ultra-high

392
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.109
pressures. They can basically recreate some of the pressures

393
00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:12.670
deep inside Earth, inside their own laboratories, which is

394
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:17.229
amazing. Um, BUT we can't manipulate time. So, we

395
00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:19.869
cannot run an experiment for 1000 years or even

396
00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:22.319
100,000 years, you know, that, that we would need

397
00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:25.489
to replicate this. So, We think that they live

398
00:19:25.489 --> 00:19:28.050
for that long because we find them in places

399
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.369
where we know that no material has moved in

400
00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:33.180
and out for, you know, 100,000 years or so.

401
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.599
And we can see that they're alive and we

402
00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:38.329
can see the waste products that they've made and

403
00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:39.930
we can look at the rate at which they've

404
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.530
been breathing and we can use thermodynamics to calculate

405
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.650
how much energy that they had. And when we

406
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.569
add all that up and we compare it to

407
00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:49.530
the amount of energy that it would take to

408
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.380
create a, a baby, it's, it doesn't work. They

409
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.579
can't do it. There's not enough energy there to

410
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:59.430
ever have divided. And we look at their genes,

411
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.030
we don't see a lot of evidence that they're

412
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.109
evolving over 100,000 years, which if something's growing normally,

413
00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:06.709
100,000 years is plenty of time to, to make

414
00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:09.630
something happen. Um, AND we don't see evidence of

415
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.099
big evolutionary changes over these times. So, um, our

416
00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:14.829
best guess is that they're just not growing for

417
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:15.369
that long.

418
00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:19.979
Yeah, but how is it that they evolved to

419
00:20:19.979 --> 00:20:22.109
stop growing for that long?

420
00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:24.780
We don't really know the answer to that either,

421
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.050
but in my book, I get very speculative about

422
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.489
it because you have to, like, what are you

423
00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:31.300
gonna do? These things exist. This seems to be

424
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.250
true. Um, EVERYTHING I learned about evolution was about

425
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.750
fast, like speed, be the one to reproduce faster.

426
00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:42.069
Um, YOU know, we know that that's not always

427
00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:44.760
the case, you know, if you look at Um,

428
00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:48.250
shrimp growing in the ocean, they reproduce quickly versus

429
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.380
an elephant which reproduces slowly and lives a long

430
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.660
time. So we have words for these, our strategists

431
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.800
and K strategists in ecology. Um, BUT still an

432
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.680
elephant is not gonna live 1000 years. Um, THERE'S

433
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.839
a couple of trees that will live for 1000

434
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:06.439
years, maybe a few 1000 but their individual cells

435
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.880
turn over much faster than that. So the idea

436
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.339
that there would be a living cell that would

437
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.160
live for that long is not something that, definitely

438
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.599
not something that Charles Darwin thought about. I, I

439
00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:20.000
think I, I feel pretty confident in saying he

440
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.479
never, he never had to work out how that

441
00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:25.880
fit on into natural selection. Um, SO now we're

442
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.680
faced with this problem and um, We, I, I

443
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.479
would really like to not reject Darwin because I

444
00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:34.459
think that would get me in, in some trouble.

445
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.959
Um, BUT you have to think, OK, do we,

446
00:21:37.239 --> 00:21:39.349
should we reject Darwin or are these things actually

447
00:21:39.349 --> 00:21:43.239
doing natural selection? And I can imagine that, you

448
00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:46.329
know, to, to make sure that Darwin's OK. Um,

449
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.939
WE can do natural selection with these things based

450
00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:51.410
on something that they experience in the far, far

451
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.339
future. Um, SO if you are an intraterrestrial, you

452
00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:57.859
don't really have much to eat, nothing's really going

453
00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.199
on, you're getting buried slowly in the sea floor.

454
00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:03.000
Um, IT just seems like a one-way trip to

455
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.979
hell, you know, you're never gonna come back, you're

456
00:22:05.979 --> 00:22:07.819
just gonna die down there, you maybe get buried

457
00:22:07.819 --> 00:22:10.540
in the mantle. But actually, if you can wait

458
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.479
for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years,

459
00:22:13.739 --> 00:22:16.250
then actually you could come back up after an

460
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.060
earthquake or you could come back up in a

461
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.020
volcano, um, not again, not in the lava, not

462
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.140
in the magma parts, but you can get sort

463
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.000
of flushed out of the sides of it. Um,

464
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.280
OR as these sediments pile up when continents collide

465
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.939
into each other. So, I think that there could

466
00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:37.359
be evolutionary drivers that happen on geological time scales,

467
00:22:37.719 --> 00:22:40.119
which is really, really hard to think about as

468
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:40.969
a biologist.

469
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.400
Do these life forms tell us anything about the

470
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.589
origins of life on Earth?

471
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.290
So 11 thing that's important when we think about

472
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.489
how life originated on Earth, if it did in

473
00:22:53.489 --> 00:22:55.369
fact originate on Earth, is that we have to

474
00:22:55.369 --> 00:22:58.329
think about what is life, like what are the

475
00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:01.290
full range of life. And so one way that

476
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.040
these things help us think about that is that

477
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.050
they do tell us about um what all is

478
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.270
there. So, Life can be very, very slow. Life

479
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.150
can function on very, very low energy, um, delivery

480
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.790
gradients. And so, those two facts really expand our

481
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.839
notion of like, What kinds of things could support

482
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.420
early life on Earth. Um, AND they, they actually

483
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.699
get in, they get us a bit into the

484
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:30.010
second law of thermodynamics, which is that entropy must

485
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.060
always increase. And that fact, um, really seems to

486
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.219
be driving a lot of what life is. And

487
00:23:37.219 --> 00:23:39.910
so, In a way, they sort of help us

488
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.229
see life as more of a process than like

489
00:23:42.229 --> 00:23:44.699
a cell. Like the fact that these things are

490
00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:47.069
living cells is sort of not the point. The

491
00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:48.790
point of them is that they are doing a

492
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.290
better job of increasing entropy in an open system

493
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.229
over longer and longer time scales. And I, I

494
00:23:55.229 --> 00:23:58.069
think that's, by taking that view, we can sort

495
00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:59.819
of think about the origin of life a little

496
00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:00.349
differently.

497
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.959
But as far as we know, where and how

498
00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:07.540
did life first form on Earth?

499
00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:12.160
We don't know. Anybody who says they know, does

500
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.040
not know. I've heard, I've heard people have fights

501
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.449
over this, like, oh, it couldn't have formed there,

502
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.699
it has to form here. It definitely formed here,

503
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.560
and like, at the end of the day, we

504
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.640
truly, truly don't know. It doesn't mean we shouldn't

505
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.839
think about it and, you know, do our best

506
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:30.040
to, to imagine it, um, but I mean, I

507
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.319
think that there's, the subsurface is at least in

508
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:34.540
the running for a good place to form life.

509
00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:38.000
Um, IT'S protected from a lot of the harsh

510
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.439
things that happen up at the surface of the

511
00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:43.560
earth like bombardment and um radiation from the sun.

512
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.660
Um, BUT also, it just offers all these diverse

513
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.699
gradients. Um, SO there's just many, many different chemicals

514
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:53.420
sitting at different redox states. And so, if a

515
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.599
variety of energy sources at very low power are

516
00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:01.140
advantageous to sort of getting this nascent life going,

517
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.459
then the subsurface is, is gonna, gonna be a

518
00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:04.260
great place to do it.

519
00:25:05.369 --> 00:25:07.849
And as far as we know, is there any

520
00:25:07.849 --> 00:25:11.069
depth at which life ceases to exist?

521
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.050
I would say there has to be, but I

522
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.020
don't know where it is. Right now, 8 kilometers

523
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.660
is, is kind of our record, um, but it's

524
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.579
just basically because we haven't really dug much deeper

525
00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:27.550
than that. Um, IT'S hard, it's hard to dig

526
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.900
down very deep despite You know, movies like the

527
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.260
core, which is a really, really fun movie, but

528
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.380
you know, the, the people in it drill, they

529
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.170
go down, they physically go down to the core,

530
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.819
like we can't do that. Um, YOU know, even

531
00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:42.819
though we know a lot about the core and

532
00:25:42.819 --> 00:25:45.099
the mantle and the crust of Earth, we know

533
00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:47.979
that mostly from seismics and from rocks that sort

534
00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:50.219
of get popped up on land and, and analyzing

535
00:25:50.219 --> 00:25:52.699
their chemicals. We've never been to the mantle.

536
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.380
Right, but what are the limits really? I mean,

537
00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.630
do we know what are the conditions in which

538
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.369
life can really no longer exist?

539
00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:06.709
So some people think, and this is a, I

540
00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:08.949
think this is a good idea, that temperature is

541
00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:11.699
gonna be the ultimate limiter, um, you know, just

542
00:26:11.699 --> 00:26:14.310
at the point at which things incinerate is, as

543
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.310
I said, you know, lava is a no go,

544
00:26:16.589 --> 00:26:19.180
um, so you definitely get the lava temperatures, um,

545
00:26:19.189 --> 00:26:22.910
within the crust for sure. Um. But the thing

546
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.630
about temperature is that it could be offset by

547
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:31.229
pressure, um, because high temperature disorders things and pressure

548
00:26:31.229 --> 00:26:33.910
pushes them back together again. So it is possible

549
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.829
that under high pressures, you could actually extend the

550
00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:39.829
temperature, uh, range over which life can be found

551
00:26:39.829 --> 00:26:43.170
too. So, um, I, we're, the, the only thing

552
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.390
I know about the ultimate depth at which we'll

553
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.339
find that life ceases to exist is that we

554
00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.699
have not hit it yet. Mhm.

555
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.619
How much of life on Earth do you think

556
00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:54.839
we have yet to discover?

557
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.300
Well, at every moment, it sort of feels like,

558
00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.900
OK, we're pretty much done now, you know, we're,

559
00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:03.339
we're slowing down. I, I don't discover a new

560
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:06.140
phylum every day anymore, you know, that, that used

561
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.180
to be a daily occurrence, and now it's, you

562
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.859
know, maybe once every few years or something. Um,

563
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.699
IT'S It feels like we may be slowing down,

564
00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:17.020
but then I remind myself, people would have said

565
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.219
the same thing in the 70s, like, oh, we've

566
00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:22.209
pretty much nailed it and they didn't even know

567
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:26.869
about the subsurface at that point. Um, SO, I

568
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.689
imagine that when we get a new way of

569
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:32.209
looking for life, we're gonna discover a whole new

570
00:27:32.209 --> 00:27:34.199
axis of life that I can't even imagine right

571
00:27:34.199 --> 00:27:34.510
now.

572
00:27:35.969 --> 00:27:40.449
In terms of the potential applications that these life

573
00:27:40.449 --> 00:27:44.130
forms might have, can they help us fight climate

574
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.989
change, for example?

575
00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:49.099
Yeah, so they are uh very much involved in

576
00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:51.550
our climate and regulating our climate in a natural

577
00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.989
way over long time scales. But if we want

578
00:27:53.989 --> 00:27:56.750
to interact with them more immediately, um, they're very

579
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.699
credible, um, technologies on the books to bury carbon,

580
00:28:00.989 --> 00:28:03.270
to sequester it out of the atmosphere and sort

581
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.189
of lock it away underground. Um, AND if that

582
00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:08.989
becomes a valid strategy, it will never be the

583
00:28:08.989 --> 00:28:11.469
silver bullet. We're going to have to also decrease

584
00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:13.390
emissions and, and do all the other good things

585
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.439
that we need to do. Um. If that becomes

586
00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:19.959
a strategy for mitigating climate change, it will only

587
00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:22.160
be successful if we do so with the knowledge

588
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.439
that there are living things down there and they're

589
00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:28.000
gonna help or hurt, um, but we can't act

590
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.079
like this is a sterile Tupperware container and we

591
00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:32.040
can just like throw things down there and out

592
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.920
of sight, out of mind because somebody's down there

593
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.000
and they might spit them back at us. So

594
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.239
we, we've got to pay attention to the microbes

595
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:39.979
and we do this.

596
00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:43.819
And and what other kinds of applications do they

597
00:28:43.819 --> 00:28:44.119
have?

598
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.689
Um, SO right now, we, I, I am a

599
00:28:49.689 --> 00:28:53.760
firm believer that we have not Use them to

600
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.930
their maximum usefulness um for humans. Um, THE fact

601
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.609
that we are seeing such new types of life

602
00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:04.689
means that they followed their, their biomolecules, their proteins

603
00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:07.890
have been under evolutionary pressures that are totally foreign

604
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.609
to the rest of us. And so, they probably

605
00:29:10.609 --> 00:29:14.739
have really cool things that their enzymes do like

606
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.890
The first thing that I can think of is

607
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.650
um high stability. Um, SO they should make enzymes

608
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.770
that last for a long time because that's a

609
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.750
good adaptation to, to low, low energy and, uh,

610
00:29:27.209 --> 00:29:29.709
we, you know, for years, humans have been using

611
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.849
proteins taken out of microbes or out of animals

612
00:29:33.849 --> 00:29:37.790
to, you know, do biotechnology with or bio medicine.

613
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.130
And if we start looking at some things from

614
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.810
the subsurface, maybe we can find ones that operate

615
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.530
a little bit better, more efficiently with higher affinity

616
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.869
for substrates or maybe they hang out on our,

617
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.920
um, maybe they can um be allowed to be

618
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.849
transported without refrigeration, which would save a ton of

619
00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:58.800
money or make, um, You know, technology accessible to

620
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.439
places that don't have uh reliable electricity.

621
00:30:02.819 --> 00:30:06.420
Looking into the future, what do you think life

622
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.239
will look like and how can we know that,

623
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.239
um, where, here or

624
00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:13.020
yes, yes, on

625
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:18.310
Earth, on Earth, OK, um, so I think that

626
00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:22.489
we are going to be, um, Less lonely because

627
00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:24.729
I do think that we're gonna find life elsewhere.

628
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.890
Um, I think we just must, um, but life

629
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.969
on Earth, uh, going forward, you know, I think

630
00:30:30.969 --> 00:30:34.969
we're, uh, I know this is like unnecessarily sunny,

631
00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.020
but I think we're gonna be fine. I think

632
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.099
we're gonna figure out a way to, to not

633
00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:42.380
poison ourselves. Um, WE'RE, we're just working through it

634
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.619
right now, um, and it's messy and it's not

635
00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:47.140
good. Um, AND we are, you know, all the

636
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.329
climate alarm bells are, are the way to go,

637
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.069
like being, feeling alarmed is helpful because then we

638
00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:58.630
will be moved to action. Um, BUT it's, it's

639
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.069
really, we're going to find a way as a

640
00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:04.150
species to interact, to recognize that we're not outside

641
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.819
of nature, that we're part of it, and we're

642
00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:09.310
part of this continuum, even with these strange beings

643
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.670
that seem to live for maybe a million years

644
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.540
and their genes look nothing like our genes. Um,

645
00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:16.219
THEY look enough like our genes to know that

646
00:31:16.219 --> 00:31:20.140
we are rela related to them and um, I

647
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.500
think we're gonna figure out how to, how to

648
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.319
live with them better.

649
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.699
Uh, WHEN it comes to finding life on other

650
00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:32.540
planets, what do intraterrestrials tell us about what life

651
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.719
might look like?

652
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.979
So the first thing that they do is that

653
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:38.780
they expand the area over which we can search

654
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.420
for life within our solar system or outside. So

655
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.459
we spent a lot of time looking at the

656
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:45.890
surface of planets just out of necessity and planetary

657
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.900
bodies because that's the part that we can get

658
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.680
at. Um, BUT if you peel off the layers

659
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.530
of You know, every planet and moon in this

660
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.550
solar system and then every planet and moon in

661
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.329
all the galaxies all around the universe. Now, you've

662
00:32:02.329 --> 00:32:06.989
really compounded the area over which life can exist.

663
00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:11.270
And so, I think that subsurface life may be

664
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.930
extremely common in our universe. We just have to

665
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.930
find it. It's hard.

666
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.140
And in what ways do you think we should

667
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.079
perhaps expand the range of conditions where life might

668
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:27.219
exist across the universe to try to find it?

669
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.359
I think that we, um, when we think about,

670
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.400
um, Goldilocks planets, so we, we right now think

671
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.800
about planets that are close enough to a warm

672
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.880
star but not too hot of a star to

673
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.319
allow liquid water at their surface. That's, that's sort

674
00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:44.079
of our criteria for, it's like Kepler's criteria for

675
00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:47.750
an Earth-like planet. Um, BUT you could, you can

676
00:32:48.209 --> 00:32:51.030
put in models that say, OK, well, now like

677
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:56.239
3 kilometers down. Is it close enough to the

678
00:32:56.239 --> 00:32:58.390
star and is the star bright enough to allow

679
00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.729
or and not too bright to allow liquid water?

680
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.270
Um, I think that you would have a lot

681
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.650
more Earth-like planets to, to choose from. Mhm.

682
00:33:07.949 --> 00:33:12.760
OK, great. So the book is again Interrestrials, Discovering

683
