00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.559
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.359
today I'm joined by Adam Chandler. He's a journalist

4
00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.319
and author based in New York. And today we're

5
00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:18.799
talking about his latest book, 99% Perspiration, A New

6
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:22.440
Working History of the American Way of Life. So

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.920
Adam, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.219
everyone.

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.319
Thank you so much for having me. I'm, I'm

10
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.280
really happy to be here.

11
00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:33.500
So tell us first about the phrase that basically

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.599
is behind the title of your book. It comes

13
00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.900
from Thomas Edison, if I got it right, it's

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.340
genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. So what

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.400
does that mean exactly? What does it imply and

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.459
particularly in the context of what you explore in

17
00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:53.259
your book?

18
00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.770
Right. Well, in, in American life, the idea that

19
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.610
hard work is something that will deliver anything you

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.370
need and everything you want in your life is

21
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.279
kind of a cherished article of faith. Working, working

22
00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.790
hard is something that we are kind of instilled,

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.730
uh, that, that gets instilled in American life from,

24
00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.510
from birth in a, in a way that separates

25
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.209
America from other countries. Uh, THE US in particular

26
00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.339
puts a focus on hard work. As being the

27
00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:25.980
sole determinant factor of whether you're going to succeed

28
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.419
in life, and the reality is that it's not

29
00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:31.300
true. I mean, we're we're seeing it play out

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.809
in our politics and we're seeing it play out

31
00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.339
in our culture. People are very angry because they're

32
00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:37.379
working very hard and they're not getting, and I

33
00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:40.620
thought it's an interesting way to look at American

34
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.290
culture and society. This, this unique focus on The

35
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.769
individual and the political idea around hard work really

36
00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:54.050
tells the story of why there's so much animosity

37
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.709
and anger and historically why there's been so much

38
00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:59.730
animosity and anger.

39
00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:06.569
Right. And how would you define American meritocracy or

40
00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.399
what Americans are taught about meritocracy in your country

41
00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.190
and why do you say that it is, uh,

42
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.320
if I understood it correctly, unique compared to other

43
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.000
countries?

44
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.500
Well, we're really raised on this belief of individual

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.259
destiny. This, this thought, and it begins all the

46
00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.399
way back at the founding of the country where

47
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.550
you're, you're born into this possibility. It's not like

48
00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.479
The old Europe that America and the US specifically

49
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.440
was seeking to separate itself from by being a

50
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.839
country where you could do anything you wanted to

51
00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.839
as long as you applied yourself. That is, that

52
00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.820
is the meritocratic ideal that it was hoping to

53
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.399
embody in separating itself from from the British. And

54
00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.199
you know it's a beautiful idea, don't get me

55
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.619
wrong, but it's never matched the reality of it,

56
00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:58.919
and I think we all know that, you know,

57
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.490
it started. It started with a caste system. It

58
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.169
started with slavery, and it worked its way into

59
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:09.809
these modern iterations of discrimination and forces like Jim

60
00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.809
Crow and economic exclusion. And so it's never really

61
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.009
been true, but we, we don't make any sort

62
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.850
of provisions or adjustments for the fact that it's

63
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.529
not true. We make, we make some a little

64
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.289
bit in policy, but We don't have a social

65
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.729
safety net here. We don't believe that people can

66
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:33.470
be. Sort of the victims of circumstance when the

67
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.500
economy is bad, when when when jobs get shipped

68
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.830
overseas or when communities fail because of bad policy

69
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.949
or bad governance and people don't have good paying

70
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.460
jobs, it's seen as their own fault that they

71
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.229
didn't find a way to make it work, and

72
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.020
that's just not the reality in countries that the

73
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.990
US likes to compare itself to, and it's the

74
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.880
source of a lot of anger and tension. AND

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.110
rage and outright rage, the kind of rage that

76
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.119
has delivered us into this very heated and acrimonious

77
00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.759
political moment.

78
00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.000
Yeah, and we're going to talk more about why

79
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.850
and how this idea is flawed later in our

80
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.108
conversation, but where do you think it comes from?

81
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.079
I mean, where does this particular idea of meritocracy

82
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.579
or American meritocracy stems from historically?

83
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.959
Sure, well, the idea begins, you could argue with

84
00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:33.239
Columbus, even Columbus is not somebody who actually discovered

85
00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:37.950
America, but In seeking out a new symbol for

86
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.640
the United States as it was seeking its independence,

87
00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:43.769
it embraced this idea of the symbol of Columbus,

88
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.910
somebody who went out on his own and said,

89
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.160
you know, Basically, the rest of the world thought

90
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.839
he was crazy for trying to find another way

91
00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:59.160
across to India from Europe. And he did it

92
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.829
anyway, and he forged his own path and he

93
00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:04.329
found the new world. That is the Construction that

94
00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:08.489
we use when we describe our history and in

95
00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:10.730
doing so, he embodies a lot of these really

96
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.799
cherished ideals of rejecting conventional wisdom and striking out

97
00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:20.769
on your own and being a self-guided individual in

98
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.559
pursuit of a dream. And that is something that,

99
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.010
you know, has led to this Columbus worship in

100
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.170
a way that, you know, is ahistorical because he

101
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.279
didn't discover. You know, America, there are people here,

102
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.600
more people in North America than in the Europe

103
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.440
that he left, and we forget that. But if

104
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.600
you look at the founding fathers, they all kind

105
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.459
of try to embody this story, even going back

106
00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.640
to the settlers who came over on the Mayflower

107
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.149
who were trying to make it on their own.

108
00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:54.559
All of these have these particular stories, these particular

109
00:05:54.559 --> 00:06:00.480
motifs and themes of Rugged individualism and self-reliance. It's

110
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.799
about the individual effort to find a way to

111
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.679
make it work, to make your life succeed, to

112
00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.739
reach your dreams, as opposed to the community and

113
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.880
all of the sort of supporting cast members that

114
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.399
make life actually possible. And that is something that

115
00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:20.119
has been embedded in American culture ever since. And

116
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.359
you know, it defies logic, but it's powerful and

117
00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:27.100
potent and it's seductive. And it's been the bedrock

118
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.179
of American life.

119
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.149
And how has this idea of meritocracy been woven

120
00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:36.799
into the fabric of American society? I know that

121
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.079
in the book you talk about the role of

122
00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:42.239
things like the government, the education system, and the

123
00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:46.809
culture at large. So how has it become dominant

124
00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:48.239
in your culture?

125
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.630
Well, it's dominant in your in the culture in

126
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.429
a sense that There is a lot of shame

127
00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:59.970
and disgust around people who need help, who run

128
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.170
into problems, and these don't have to be, you

129
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.619
know, it doesn't have to be. Abject poverty. It

130
00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:11.309
could be someone who's in college, studying to become

131
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.829
a doctor, who has to drop out to take

132
00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:17.290
care of a family member and then ends up,

133
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.709
um, you know, struggling and needing public assistance. There's

134
00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:26.010
a lot of shame around that idea that you

135
00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.540
are not able to transcend your circumstances. And the

136
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.640
thought of self-reliance is something that goes back to

137
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.100
Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. All of

138
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.760
these iconic American figures are cast as these people

139
00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:41.579
who managed to get it done on their own,

140
00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:44.260
find their own way forward, and they're modern analogs

141
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.540
to that too. We, we, we worship the founder

142
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.779
who tinkered in their garage to come up with

143
00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.420
a new idea and make it available to the

144
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.540
masses, and it's always one person. It's not a

145
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.890
team of people. It's not. Taxpayer dollars that create

146
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:00.730
the roads and the research and the the energy

147
00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:04.940
to make these inventions possible, it's always that one

148
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.380
person. And so this focus on the individual shows

149
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.589
up in our policy. It shows up in our

150
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.109
culture, it shows up in our storytelling in ways

151
00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:18.829
that really make the idea of community support and

152
00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:25.279
policies that Create opportunity, um, less a check in

153
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.320
the, in, in the public's mind, you know, this

154
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.579
is why we're the only Western country, um, and

155
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.239
beyond the Western countries that don't have universal healthcare,

156
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.359
you know, you, you are very much on your

157
00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:39.590
own here if you're not. Either paying in for

158
00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:43.039
for really substandard healthcare in the in the public

159
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.260
marketplace, or you're tethered to a job, and that's

160
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.640
a really clear example of how important it is

161
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.359
in American culture to find a way to make

162
00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:54.840
it on your own. And if, if you run

163
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.900
into trouble, you're out of luck.

164
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.940
Right. You've alluded there to an idea that is

165
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.380
really very interesting. So is achievement or success really

166
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.500
the pro the product of individuals or communities?

167
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.530
Well, in American life it's seen as, as individual

168
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.119
achievements. We, we, we hold up the individual. We,

169
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.900
we extol the individual in ways that um stand

170
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.380
out culturally and, and, and socially and politically. We

171
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.909
are, we are, we are meant to take um

172
00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:32.340
pride in individual achievement and we hold up individuals

173
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.619
and not teams and not, not uh communities as

174
00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:39.570
being responsible for it. Um, AND this is evident

175
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.820
in our politics, you know, we have a, we

176
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.780
have a system where We vote for individuals for

177
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.700
president. We don't vote for parties in the same

178
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.020
way that they do in European parliamentary systems where

179
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.340
you're voting for a party and there's a head

180
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.619
of a party. You're really voting for an individual,

181
00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:56.419
you know. There are things that you, you don't

182
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:59.219
really think about because they're so normalized here in

183
00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:02.840
terms of the way that the individual figure interacts.

184
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.479
And this again comes, comes back to the concept

185
00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:08.140
of individual destiny and self-reliance and all of the

186
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.830
things that focus on one person making it. You

187
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.190
know, making their dream, whether it's arriving as an

188
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:22.250
immigrant or working long hours to find a way

189
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.150
to wealth from, from nothing, the rags to riches

190
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.150
mythos, and it's never really about the people along

191
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.309
the way who help create opportunities, whether it's through

192
00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:38.330
smart, smart policy or good community ties, good schools,

193
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.369
mentorships, the things that people don't all have access

194
00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:44.780
to. Um, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm a writer

195
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.460
and people often say, you know, congratulations on, on

196
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.580
making it into a world that's a difficult creative

197
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.609
field and you've written a few books and, you

198
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.020
know, you must have worked really hard to get

199
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.700
there, and I, you know, I do say yes,

200
00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:58.739
I have, and I'm, but I had mentors. I

201
00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:00.780
had opportunities. I was able to go to school.

202
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.969
I had communities around me supporting me. I had

203
00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:04.219
people telling me, you know what, if you want

204
00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:06.679
to be a writer, go for it, not. That's

205
00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:09.919
a pretty crazy idea. Um, AND, and, and that's

206
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.119
not something that a lot of people get when

207
00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:14.559
they are in pursuit of whatever it is they

208
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:17.080
want to pursue, you know, I, I, I try

209
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.479
to, I try to take that in stride when

210
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:19.989
I, when I, when I answer these kinds of

211
00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:21.710
questions because I'm, I'm a product of something that

212
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.919
is not my own hard work. It is something

213
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:28.030
that community supported and sustained me, and I'm very

214
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.919
lucky to have, have had those, those opportunities and

215
00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:34.320
I'm aware that not everybody else does, but Um,

216
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.369
you know, the more you talk to people, the

217
00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:38.710
more that they really want to say this is

218
00:11:38.849 --> 00:11:41.010
all because of one person and their individual effort,

219
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.619
and that's just a microcosm, an individual personal anecdote

220
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:46.010
of, of, of a broader whole.

221
00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:50.320
Yeah, and you mentioned self-reliance there. I mean, is

222
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.940
it really possible for anyone to actually be self-reliant?

223
00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:57.049
And I, I, I think that also connects at

224
00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:00.570
least to some extent with the very American idea

225
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.090
of the self-made man. I mean, people being able

226
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.250
to self-make themselves. So, uh, I mean, but is

227
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.210
it really possible to do that?

228
00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:15.239
Well, if you told somebody who has made it

229
00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:18.520
that they had help, they get very upset. That

230
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.200
is, that is something to, to be, to diminish

231
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.380
your achievement, to say that because you had perhaps

232
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.280
a wife or a husband who supported you either

233
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.080
financially or took care of the family while you

234
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.599
were working late hours, that's one example of something

235
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.119
that would make someone feel diminished in their, in

236
00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:42.010
their achievement, and that's just One small fragment of

237
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.140
a of a mosaic. Self-reliance is something that we,

238
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:48.929
we, we've always played into culturally. And again, this,

239
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.119
this goes back to the Puritans. This goes back

240
00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:57.059
to the early founders, Benjamin Franklin types of people

241
00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:00.700
who wanted, wanted Americans to be their own, the

242
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.820
masters of their own destiny, and it is a

243
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.969
romantic and quixotic idea, but it's undercut by the

244
00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:10.309
reality that You can't do it on your own.

245
00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:14.190
You need partners to trade with, you need communities

246
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.750
to sustain you, you need outlets to socialize, you

247
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.429
need help, you need mentorship, you need education, and

248
00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:25.039
all of these things are underplayed because It interferes

249
00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:27.530
with the idea that we are, we shouldn't be

250
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.130
governed, that we shouldn't have any, any external say

251
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.770
so in how we make it in this world.

252
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.250
So there is a political ideology and it's an

253
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.700
undercurrent in American life and an American rage that

254
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.609
He intentionally tries to neglect and sort of undermine

255
00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:51.380
the thought that um we're in this collectively. And,

256
00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:55.630
and that's a large reason why we're willing to

257
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.359
give people who make Far too much money to

258
00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:02.070
begin with, even more tax cuts, um, which is

259
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.690
something that's currently under discussion in America right now,

260
00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.739
but also historically has been a big, a big

261
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.400
feature of our political discourse and our political movements

262
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.270
in the last 20 or 30 years. And um

263
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.409
You know, it, it, it's, it's a, it's a

264
00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:21.849
chaotic, it's a chaotic thing because it's hard to

265
00:14:21.849 --> 00:14:24.450
argue with people who say, I did it and

266
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.869
so can you. Um, IT, it, it's It's anecdotal

267
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:32.950
to the point of being problematic, and it's a

268
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.190
real part of the experience here politically.

269
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.849
Uh, IN your book, you use a very interesting

270
00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:45.390
expression, American abracadabra. What, what do you mean by

271
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:45.710
that?

272
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.309
Right. So, kind of related to what I was,

273
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.070
what we were talking about just now with the

274
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.489
idea of individual destiny. The American abracadabra is this,

275
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.909
is this concept that if you don't make it

276
00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:02.489
here in America, in the land of opportunity, It's

277
00:15:02.489 --> 00:15:04.489
because you didn't try hard enough. And it's this,

278
00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:07.409
it's this idea, it's this mirage that if you

279
00:15:07.409 --> 00:15:12.359
failed to achieve success, stability, happiness, it's, it's because

280
00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:16.690
you didn't try and It places a lot of

281
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.250
guilt and shame on the individual for not achieving

282
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.809
what they should have achieved, when the reality is

283
00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:24.179
that there are plenty of reasons why people don't

284
00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:26.330
make it in America, and it's not for lack

285
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.690
of hard work. There are tens of millions of

286
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.130
people here who are living paycheck to paycheck in

287
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.650
the United States. 60% of Americans live paycheck to

288
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.450
paycheck. They're working hard. They're working long hours. People

289
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.010
who are on food assistance in this country, the

290
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.330
majority of them work. The majority of people who

291
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.880
receive benefits are are working people, and We don't

292
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.799
like to admit that because it, it undercuts the

293
00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:53.580
idea and, and, and the core value of this

294
00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:58.630
individual hardworking focus that is meant to deliver all

295
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.239
of our dreams. And so the American abracadabra is,

296
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.799
is sort of the, the phrase that I use

297
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:07.440
in the book to kind of describe the reality

298
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.419
of it. It's, it's a mirage to say, You

299
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:12.020
just should have worked harder and that's why you

300
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.340
didn't get where you're going. It didn't have anything

301
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.659
to do with bad policies or job markets, the

302
00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:23.679
conditions that we create, bad trade deals, um. Creative

303
00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:28.409
destruction of communities through economic change. Um, IT places

304
00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:30.609
all of the community expectations and keeps them on

305
00:16:30.609 --> 00:16:33.690
the individual's shoulders. And it's an important part of

306
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.650
the story because this is a lot of why

307
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.440
people are, um, turning out and turning away from

308
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.809
institutions and they're not believing in government anymore. They're

309
00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:48.489
not believing in leadership and what their teachers and,

310
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.099
and, and, and institutions are telling them. AS a

311
00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:54.190
result of this myth not being true.

312
00:16:55.469 --> 00:17:01.400
Mhm. And how do you square ideas surrounding meritocracy

313
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.910
with the fact that there's growing economic inequality in

314
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.829
the US? Wages have been stagnant in the US

315
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:14.050
for the last few decades, and many Americans have

316
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.229
been working more or less. I mean, because unless

317
00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:22.829
we assume that There's a growing number of individuals

318
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.510
or people that are just lazy or don't work

319
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.630
hard enough. This doesn't seem to be even a

320
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.930
very meritocratic system to me,

321
00:17:34.469 --> 00:17:36.339
right? You've almost answered the question for me in

322
00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.750
large part because those are, those are the excuses

323
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.750
that people will say it's because younger people don't

324
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.270
want to work hard anymore. It's something that I'm

325
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.859
a millennial, and I was, I, I remember reading

326
00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:49.119
and hearing about all of the people who said,

327
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.780
Um, these millennials, they don't want to work anymore.

328
00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:53.060
They don't want to try hard, they don't want

329
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.119
to do anything. And now I'm hearing those same

330
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.280
kind of accusations leveled at Gen Z. It, it,

331
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.060
it, it's cyclical every, every few years, it's the

332
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.619
next generation doesn't want to work hard anymore. And

333
00:18:03.619 --> 00:18:07.449
the reality is that, first of all, Gen Z

334
00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:09.859
in particular is aware that hard work isn't going

335
00:18:09.859 --> 00:18:11.839
to pay off for them. They, they've seen how,

336
00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:16.910
how, um, Americans have become 64% more productive in

337
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.040
the last 40 years, and their wages have only

338
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.439
increased 17%. You know, they, they may not know

339
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:24.189
the stats, but they know the reality of it.

340
00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:27.520
They're living the reality of it. And so the

341
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.920
fact that we have so many wealthy people in

342
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.589
this country and yet more people are struggling is

343
00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:36.060
something that is, is not eluding our grants. But

344
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.459
the dominant working theory is that it is People

345
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:45.300
who want to instill dependency and laziness by giving

346
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.209
more to communities, whether it's healthcare, whether it's childcare,

347
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.300
whether it is more funds for communities for people

348
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.770
to learn and take time to develop their careers,

349
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.089
these are all things that are seen as socialist

350
00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:01.209
plots to make people dependent on the government and

351
00:19:01.209 --> 00:19:04.680
lazy and It doesn't go away even if it's

352
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.959
not true, and this is a stronger motif that

353
00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:10.219
we get, the more the more people become desperate

354
00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:13.109
and hungry for answers that are different from the

355
00:19:13.109 --> 00:19:16.680
conventional wisdom. And so it is this, it is

356
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.640
this concept that only reinforces that it's, it's lazy

357
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.859
people or people who wish to destroy American values

358
00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:27.599
that are causing all of this distress economically and

359
00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:28.459
socially in America.

360
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.380
And what happens when hard work isn't enough? What

361
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.319
kinds of effects does that have on people who

362
00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.380
experience that psychologically?

363
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.829
Absolutely great question. Um, IN part because we really

364
00:19:45.829 --> 00:19:48.270
are living through this. If you, if you told

365
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.050
people, you know, 15 or 20 years ago that

366
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.390
we would have, uh, you know, a, a, a

367
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.829
billionaire who's been divorced 3 times from New York

368
00:19:56.829 --> 00:19:59.219
City be the president of the United States twice,

369
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.869
they would laugh at you because it, it, it,

370
00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:04.270
it seems preposterous that someone who, um, you know,

371
00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:08.390
inherited a lot of money and, you know, became

372
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.689
this lightning rod. Of of outsider sort of rage

373
00:20:13.989 --> 00:20:17.030
would find a foothold in American life, and that

374
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.630
is, that is the, the upshot, that is the

375
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.270
result and the consequence of the fact that people

376
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.949
have been working hard for less and harder for

377
00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:28.670
less, more hours, fewer vacation days, fewer time off

378
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.670
for leisure, less community orientation, less time for civic

379
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.369
groups, and Leisure time with family members and friends,

380
00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:41.260
these are all having this cumulative effect where people

381
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.569
don't feel like they're catching up or even staying

382
00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:46.780
afloat, and they're angry. They're angry at the elite

383
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.500
systems that have made this possible, and that's a

384
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.599
bipartisan failure, and they're angry at everyone who told

385
00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:55.060
them that all you need to do is work

386
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.109
hard. And so, They're looking for people to blame,

387
00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:01.790
and political opportunists have really stepped into the into

388
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.349
the foothold here and said, you know, it's not

389
00:21:05.349 --> 00:21:08.189
because you're, you're not working hard enough, it's because

390
00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:12.189
of immigration or it's because of socialism or teachers

391
00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:17.109
who are teaching people the wrong things or Politicians

392
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:21.599
who want to support people by giving them Access

393
00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:26.000
to healthcare or childcare or a higher minimum wage.

394
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.000
These are all handouts and entitlements. And so there's

395
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.800
a lot of distraction that allows people who feel

396
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.959
righteously angry about the fact that they're not keeping

397
00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:37.560
up to direct their anger and animus at certain

398
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.520
targets. And it's been a very effective strategy in

399
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.000
American politics for generations.

400
00:21:45.189 --> 00:21:47.910
Yeah, and it's not only that, but also this

401
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.589
is a conversation that I've had on the show

402
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:55.709
with a few economists about how rich people in

403
00:21:55.709 --> 00:22:03.109
our modern capitalist societies and particularly it manifests very

404
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:06.349
well in American society, I guess, tend to build

405
00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:12.189
their wealth because it's not very commonly through hard

406
00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:13.390
work, or is it?

407
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.250
That's right. Well, if you look at the way

408
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.250
that we tax assets in the United States, your,

409
00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:23.609
your people are taxed less on things in the

410
00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:26.689
stock market that accrue wealth or the land that

411
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:29.209
they own, the properties that they develop, those are

412
00:22:29.209 --> 00:22:32.329
taxed at a, at a lower rate than the

413
00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:37.160
money you make working, actually working. And that is

414
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.579
a really important feature of our tax system because

415
00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:43.160
that is the way that people really accrue wealth

416
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.079
here. A lot. Some of it is by working,

417
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.420
but a lot of it's through these other mechanisms

418
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.140
that create wealth, and we don't. We don't penalize

419
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.290
or we don't reap collective benefit from those things,

420
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.199
even though it's not just one person who's doing

421
00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:03.130
this, um. You know, it's entire companies, it's entire

422
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.530
communities and systems, and that's just 11 fragment of

423
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.829
the picture that is so important to show because

424
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.089
we get angry at relief for poor people, but

425
00:23:14.089 --> 00:23:19.010
we don't get upset about entitlements and giveaways to

426
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.520
rich people, whether it's tax cuts or corporate welfare

427
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.280
or all these other features of society. Um. You

428
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.719
know, I'm, I'm lucky to have a house that

429
00:23:28.719 --> 00:23:31.300
I, that, that I own with my wife, and

430
00:23:31.439 --> 00:23:34.310
we pay our interest on our mortgage every year,

431
00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:36.099
and we can write that off on our taxes,

432
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.839
and that's not something that anyone is saying is

433
00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:43.079
unfair, but it's a huge, it's it's a significant

434
00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:46.119
amount of money that we're being given by the

435
00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:51.260
government for being homeowners that if it were Institutionalized

436
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.339
in any other sort of format for people who

437
00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:57.180
made less money than us, it would be seen

438
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.760
as some kind of socialist conspiracy, but we, we,

439
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.599
we, we don't look at it that way because

440
00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:04.300
wealthy people are seen as deserving or people who

441
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.819
have made it or into a into a steady

442
00:24:06.819 --> 00:24:08.979
middle class life or were born lucky to be

443
00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:12.969
in those positions are seen as Deserving some and

444
00:24:12.969 --> 00:24:14.569
the reality is that they're no more deserving and

445
00:24:14.569 --> 00:24:17.589
tend not to work nearly as hard or battle

446
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.170
as many obstacles as people who are scrapping to

447
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.000
get by on a daily basis. And so that's,

448
00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:25.319
you know, that's just a big, a big part

449
00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:26.119
of the story too.

450
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.829
Right. And even if hard work plays a role

451
00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:35.790
in becoming rich, is it even possible for anyone

452
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.290
to work hard enough to earn, I don't know,

453
00:24:39.369 --> 00:24:43.119
10s of millions, 100s of millions, or even billions

454
00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:47.250
of dollars and hundreds or thousands of times more

455
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.890
than the average worker? I mean, is that even

456
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.689
realistic to think about?

457
00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:55.319
I think a lot about Jeff Bezos, who just

458
00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:58.260
got married in Venice, you know, and took over

459
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.400
the city to have a very lavish wedding. He

460
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.770
is obviously one of the richest people on Earth,

461
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.199
and it's not because he's working that many times

462
00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.000
harder than an Amazon factory worker who has, you

463
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.119
know, a GPS attached to him and a timer

464
00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.359
so that people are monitoring his steps and movements

465
00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:17.430
and making sure he's efficient enough or riding in

466
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.300
a van without air conditioning around to make deliveries.

467
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.709
It's not because Jeff Bezos is working harder or

468
00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:27.430
working 24 hours a day. It's because he's not

469
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.160
paying his workers properly, and worker attrition is a

470
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.630
huge part of why Amazon could be even more

471
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.000
profitable if they treated their employees better. You know,

472
00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:37.680
this is, this is the reality of it. We

473
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.959
don't, we don't want to concede that workers could

474
00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:45.199
actually benefit from higher pay and a certain choosiness

475
00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:47.380
in the marketplace because that would give them power.

476
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.760
And so instead we have a system where Amazon

477
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.189
loses billions of dollars every year because people work

478
00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:55.000
there for two months and they quit because it's

479
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.140
too hard, it's too physically painful. And that's just

480
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.780
one example of people who are working so hard

481
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.819
that they can't even have a life, and so

482
00:26:03.819 --> 00:26:05.260
they quit and they leave and they can't make

483
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:10.849
things work versus the person who is shutting down

484
00:26:10.849 --> 00:26:12.890
the city of Venice to have a wedding because

485
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.430
he just has so much wealth and has nothing

486
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.890
to do with it but throw foam parties on

487
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.810
a yacht. It's just the split screen is astounding

488
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.449
to think about and to look at because it

489
00:26:25.449 --> 00:26:28.510
just shows how false the reality of this is.

490
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.010
And when people harken back to the to the

491
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.930
better days of American life where there was a

492
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.890
little bit more even distribution of wealth, and this

493
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.079
is post-war America. They look at the idea that

494
00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:41.270
American bosses and CEOs were making 20 or 30

495
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.119
times more than their employees versus thousands of times

496
00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:46.800
more than their employees as a sign that, OK,

497
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.359
things are a little bit more in balance and

498
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.339
things make a little bit more sense, and that's

499
00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:54.709
a big part of the story is that it

500
00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:56.560
used to not be the case that people had

501
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.920
runaway wealth versus their workers and they interacted with

502
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.989
them, and it was, it was a company that

503
00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:07.130
was Cohesive as opposed to driven by shareholder demands

504
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.839
and this insane financial chicanery that makes people so

505
00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:10.040
wealth.

506
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.650
Right. Uh BY looking across the history of these

507
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.089
ideas you did in your book, do you think

508
00:27:19.089 --> 00:27:22.170
that there's ever been a time in American history

509
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.170
where hard work actually paid off or do you

510
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.689
think that it got worse over the past few

511
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:34.130
decades in, since the late 70s, 80s with the

512
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.089
rise of neo-liberalism?

513
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.380
It's, it's a really important question in part because

514
00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:43.119
people do look back on that era that I

515
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:46.680
was just talking about post-war, post-World War II American

516
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.719
life as this moment where things made sense to

517
00:27:49.719 --> 00:27:52.589
people in terms of the finances. We, we, we,

518
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.839
we looked at the baby boom and the creation

519
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:57.739
of wealth and the rise of the middle class,

520
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.660
and unfortunately, you know, that wasn't true for everyone.

521
00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:04.689
Um, A lot of people were left out of

522
00:28:04.689 --> 00:28:06.890
that, and a lot of people have always been

523
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.569
left out of this wealth making, but even that,

524
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:13.489
even that period of time itself is kind of

525
00:28:13.489 --> 00:28:17.439
a mirage because the US had this really unique

526
00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:20.479
set of circumstances where almost all of its competitors

527
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:22.819
in Europe were had been decimated during the war,

528
00:28:22.969 --> 00:28:25.050
so they had this huge head start on the

529
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.089
rest of the economies, um. They had access to

530
00:28:30.089 --> 00:28:34.380
a young workforce that had been educated and they

531
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.260
had strong union power so that people who were

532
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.699
working could create terms of their compensation in their

533
00:28:42.699 --> 00:28:46.500
lives that made a good life more possible than

534
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.660
it is today. And that slowly chipped away, particularly

535
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.439
in the 80s, and we saw the runaway wealth

536
00:28:53.439 --> 00:28:56.060
and income inequality shoot up as a result of

537
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.880
that. So even though the 50s and 60s were

538
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.920
a mirage in that way, there were elements of

539
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.400
it where it was more possible to be socially

540
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.359
mobile. And even though it wasn't perfect, it was

541
00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:08.969
closer to a better balance than it has been

542
00:29:09.839 --> 00:29:11.640
throughout the history of American life. So I, I'd

543
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.260
like to point to that era in part because

544
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.319
it shows how unrealistic it was, um, the expectation

545
00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.839
that it would go back to that because it

546
00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:27.380
was such a, a, a momentary, um, unique. Sort

547
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.939
of period. But also the forces that made it

548
00:29:30.939 --> 00:29:34.140
possible in some some respects are no longer with

549
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.380
us, strong union bound.

550
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.270
Right. Uh, I would like to ask you about

551
00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.819
hustle culture. I mean, what do you think about

552
00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:47.770
the rise of so-called hustle culture, particularly in the

553
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.709
2010s and now in the 2020s, which I think

554
00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:55.550
is very interesting because it's sort of followed the

555
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.630
economic crisis from 2007, 2008. I don't know if

556
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.670
you think that it would have anything to do

557
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.400
with that, but nowadays, Uh, I mean, most people,

558
00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:09.400
if they go on Instagram or other social media,

559
00:30:09.479 --> 00:30:14.079
they are constantly inundated by these, uh, I mean,

560
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.880
shorts of people waking up at 3 a.m. or

561
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.550
4 a.m. to hustle all day, and I mean,

562
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.680
it just seems a bit ridiculous. So what, what

563
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.839
do you make of it?

564
00:30:27.239 --> 00:30:32.500
Yeah, hustle culture is absolutely the result of Economic

565
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.930
precarity, a sense of social precarity, the, the, the

566
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.989
reality that um if you are going to succeed,

567
00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:42.420
you really have to turn everything that you do

568
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.300
in this life into some kind of job. No

569
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.739
one really enjoys hobbies for leisure in the way

570
00:30:48.739 --> 00:30:50.859
that they once did it. It's performative. It's part

571
00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:54.060
of building a brand, it's part of monetizing everything.

572
00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:56.439
And some of that has to do with the

573
00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.839
culture that supports it, and some of that has

574
00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:01.040
to do with the fact that it's necessary for

575
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.520
a lot of people. We're reaching a point in

576
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.719
America right now where more people have multiple jobs

577
00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:09.349
than at any point in history in terms of

578
00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:13.760
the modern labor force, um, sort of resembling what

579
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.589
one job used to cover in terms of the

580
00:31:15.589 --> 00:31:19.599
basics of life versus everything else. And we're taking

581
00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:22.969
our cues from our culture too. If you look

582
00:31:22.969 --> 00:31:27.329
at a lot of our biggest celebrities, you know,

583
00:31:28.189 --> 00:31:31.430
Years ago it would be seen as selling out

584
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:37.030
for a big Um, artists to endorse products or

585
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.530
to launch their own lines of tequila or whatever

586
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.030
it is that they're doing. And today, no. No

587
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.040
celebrity avoids this. Every celebrity has some kind of

588
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.290
endorsement, has some kind of product that they're also

589
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.689
selling in addition to the art that they create

590
00:31:52.689 --> 00:31:55.989
on the side. And so there is this general

591
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.910
entrepreneurial spirit about being your own boss, but also

592
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:06.780
constantly working, constantly hustling, that is contagious and also

593
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.790
necessary. So in some ways it's ridiculous because we

594
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.819
we we we take our social cues from people

595
00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:16.729
who are Hustling without any need to hustle other

596
00:32:16.729 --> 00:32:18.689
than the fact that it shows that they are

597
00:32:18.689 --> 00:32:20.489
working hard and they don't want to, they don't

598
00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:22.449
want their wealth to be seen as something that

599
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:25.089
they're not working for. There's an insecurity among the

600
00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:28.750
elites in that way. However, Then there are people

601
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.770
who are working really hard and hustling. Unglamorous jobs,

602
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.079
not for, for companies that they founded to appear

603
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.699
to be, um, you know, hardworking folks. They're actually

604
00:32:43.699 --> 00:32:46.819
in the, in the, in the, in the mire

605
00:32:46.819 --> 00:32:49.479
themselves just trying to get by. And it's one

606
00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:53.219
of those, again, split screen differences between what we

607
00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:55.339
see, you know, in the elite circles in American

608
00:32:55.339 --> 00:32:58.790
life and what we see on the ground and

609
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.020
Hustle culture is kind of at the heart of

610
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.540
it. It's something that we, we, we've really whole,

611
00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:06.260
whole hog embraced in a way that is kind

612
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.310
of terrifying to watch.

613
00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:13.729
How would you characterize current work culture in the

614
00:33:13.729 --> 00:33:15.849
US? What does it seem like?

615
00:33:16.869 --> 00:33:19.510
Well, for, for me, um, you know, as an

616
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.829
observer of it and having in this book gone

617
00:33:21.829 --> 00:33:23.989
around the country talking to people, it's a lot

618
00:33:23.989 --> 00:33:25.750
of precarity, a lot of people who are, who

619
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.869
are nervous about what tomorrow brings, and that can

620
00:33:27.869 --> 00:33:31.869
be artificial intelligence, and that could be a recession

621
00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:35.069
or the labor market contracting. It can be tariffs

622
00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:38.270
that might turn all of our trading partners against

623
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.430
us in terms of, you know, the US and

624
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.439
its relationships. Um, ALL of those kind of speak

625
00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:46.599
to a broader nervousness that people have around what

626
00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:48.280
their jobs will and will not be able to

627
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.920
provide them in a long-term setting, and that's on

628
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.910
top of what was already existing in terms of

629
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.719
income inequality, in terms of inflation, the cost of

630
00:33:58.719 --> 00:34:01.189
living, the fact that essentials in this country have

631
00:34:01.189 --> 00:34:03.800
gotten so much more expensive over the last 20

632
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.439
or 30 years, and So a lot of people

633
00:34:07.439 --> 00:34:09.860
are, are, are, are staying, staying put in jobs

634
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.820
that they don't like that may not give them

635
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.899
the mobility that they that they want or they

636
00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:16.370
need because they're nervous about what, what could or

637
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.280
could not happen if they, if they decided to

638
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.020
go out on their own or, or try to

639
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.860
find a new way. And so they're just taking

640
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.620
on more work and that's, that's really, I think

641
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.570
what is, you know, connected to the hustle culture

642
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.860
question you just asked is the reality that people

643
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.010
feel trapped. And are very nervous about things even

644
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.770
though you could say economic conditions right now look

645
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.949
good. Nobody feels good. The perception is that we're

646
00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.409
standing on the brink of something, and they're not

647
00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.889
wrong to feel that way. So there is, you

648
00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.570
know, a lot of adjective here about that.

649
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.909
And what do you think that, what do you

650
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:58.469
think are the perceptions that people have in America

651
00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:02.510
about hard work? Do you think that, uh, because

652
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.949
it is still, I guess, part of the hegemonic

653
00:35:05.949 --> 00:35:10.350
culture, these ideas surrounding meritocracy and so on, that

654
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:15.389
most people still buy them, or do they not

655
00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:19.810
because they are basically going through A period where

656
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.629
they're, they are working hard and not being able

657
00:35:23.629 --> 00:35:24.810
to get by.

658
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:31.540
I, I think that um The idea of hard

659
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.500
work is now something that people kind of absorb

660
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.620
as a necessity, not because it's aspirational, but because

661
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.250
it is, it is the demand of the moment.

662
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.080
It is the demand of, of, of, of everything

663
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.909
right now. And um You know, there are younger

664
00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:51.790
generations that aren't buying into the idea of hard

665
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.790
work as being something that will pay off, and

666
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.110
so there's a reluctance there. There are people who

667
00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:02.290
don't want a job that is going to require

668
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.389
them to be. On their phones working at 11

669
00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:09.399
o'clock at night, um, checking emails and being present.

670
00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:11.719
And so they're, they're trying their best to buck

671
00:36:11.719 --> 00:36:14.850
against the system and they're looking for alternative ways

672
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:21.100
to live and they're being sort of Criticized and,

673
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.800
and, and, and satirized by older generations for not

674
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.320
buying into the system, but around it is a

675
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.979
lot of ambition. I don't think that the younger

676
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:33.000
generations lack ambition, that their ambition looks like a

677
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.080
steady life where their needs are met and they're

678
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.719
not working a job that isn't going to give

679
00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:41.030
them everything that they need, and they're not buying

680
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.800
into the old systems, but they want to do

681
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.879
things that are exciting and forward moving and progressive

682
00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:48.909
for the world. Um, THEY'RE, they're just looking around

683
00:36:48.909 --> 00:36:52.080
and seeing the modern state of things and saying,

684
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.469
why would I throw away my life working really

685
00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:58.469
hard and not making enough when I could try

686
00:36:58.469 --> 00:36:59.949
to strike out on my own and find my

687
00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:02.510
own path forward. And so I think that that's

688
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.020
when we see things like the creator economy and

689
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:11.889
influencers influencers and This sort of low-level entrepreneurship that

690
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.800
other people in older generations don't understand, but um

691
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.429
is attractive to younger people who don't buy into

692
00:37:19.429 --> 00:37:22.830
the idea that generations ago, you had 25 years

693
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.550
and a pension and a gold watch. This is

694
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:29.870
a real classic Midwestern American ideal, factory workers, and

695
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.510
those things are all gone. So, and people now

696
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.159
don't even have a memory of that. So they

697
00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:37.840
can't even romanticize about getting that back.

698
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.250
Could you tell us about at least one example

699
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:47.689
of another country with a different kind of work

700
00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:51.250
culture and where do you think that differences in

701
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.320
work culture between countries come from?

702
00:37:54.729 --> 00:37:56.659
Sure. So in the book, I, I traveled to

703
00:37:56.659 --> 00:37:58.810
France and, and, and part of what's interesting to

704
00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.550
me about the French culture in terms of work.

705
00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:04.580
IS, you know, we make fun of it here

706
00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.219
in the United States because it is seen as

707
00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:11.860
so luxurious and so devil may care in terms

708
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.739
of its seriousness about work versus life in terms

709
00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:19.139
of what, what gives people satisfaction, what gives people

710
00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:22.370
meaning. It is something that we constantly have always

711
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.060
made fun of the French for, but when you

712
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.949
drill down into the stats of it, Um, the

713
00:38:27.949 --> 00:38:31.860
French workers are almost exactly as productive as American

714
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.350
workers. They're, they're separated by percentage points. And when

715
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.590
you look at what a French worker's day looks

716
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.510
like, you have an hour more of sleep, you

717
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.389
have an hour more of leisure. Those are two

718
00:38:43.389 --> 00:38:47.620
important things. Um, AND then you have these aspects

719
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.189
of the French labor code. And again, France isn't

720
00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:53.510
perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but just

721
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.570
looking at what the cultural norms are there. They've

722
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.409
written into their labor code, um, a lunch break,

723
00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:01.370
a period in the middle of the day where

724
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.709
you get at least 1 hour, sometimes 2, to

725
00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:08.030
have a meal. You're, you're supposed to leave your

726
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.449
office. Perhaps you, you meet up with colleagues and

727
00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:15.250
have non-work related conversations. Sometimes you meet up with

728
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.449
friends, sometimes you go on dates. Um, YOU get

729
00:39:18.449 --> 00:39:20.649
errands done, and you, you, you do, you do

730
00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:21.729
things that you need to do to make your

731
00:39:21.729 --> 00:39:23.449
life work so that you don't have to do

732
00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:25.959
them in your off hours. That is something that's

733
00:39:25.959 --> 00:39:30.100
embedded in French work culture that we don't really

734
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.000
pay attention to here, and we, you know, over

735
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.699
half of Americans eat their lunches at their desks.

736
00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:38.659
It's, it's one of those things they've studied. Even

737
00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:41.379
though these pauses, you know, in the middle of

738
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:45.729
the day, make French workers and workers in other

739
00:39:45.729 --> 00:39:49.300
countries more productive, more creative, less burnt out, more

740
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.540
loyal to their companies. There's a real benefit to

741
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.590
those kinds of measures that we Don't pay attention

742
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.860
to because it, it actually would benefit us as,

743
00:39:57.939 --> 00:40:00.919
as a, as a country that's obsessed with work,

744
00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:03.340
to have our workers be more productive and creative

745
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.379
and loyal and to be less burnt out. They

746
00:40:06.379 --> 00:40:09.659
take more days off in France by, by several

747
00:40:09.659 --> 00:40:12.780
weeks. Um, IN terms of national holidays and just

748
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.300
culturally, there are weeks of time where you're not

749
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.100
supposed to work. Um, AND then they have laws

750
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.409
like the right to disconnect, which is essentially a

751
00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:23.179
law that says If you are a company with

752
00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:25.060
a certain number of workers, you have to work

753
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.489
out an arrangement between employees and management about whether

754
00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:31.699
you can or should be available after work. It

755
00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:34.340
creates an expectation that if you get a phone

756
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.540
call on a Sunday, you don't necessarily have to

757
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.300
respond to it right away or an email or

758
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.340
a text message or anything on any of Slack

759
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.340
or Teams or any of the myriad ways that

760
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.739
work has infiltrated us outside of our, our working

761
00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:49.939
hours. You're not, you're not. At risk of losing

762
00:40:49.939 --> 00:40:51.899
your job if you don't respond to something right

763
00:40:51.899 --> 00:40:55.459
away, and those are important things because we now

764
00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:58.020
live in our phones. And so if work is

765
00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.770
on your phone, it's going to creep into every

766
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.139
aspect of your life, and the expectation is going

767
00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:04.580
to be that you're going to continue working. So

768
00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.139
that's an important part of the story too. And

769
00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:08.820
and and France has all of these things and

770
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.500
a quality of life that is enviable in terms

771
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.300
of the amount of time off that people have

772
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.370
in terms of what people are able to do.

773
00:41:15.699 --> 00:41:17.739
And so I really love pointing to that as

774
00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:20.370
an example of Not that we should emulate or

775
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.489
necessarily become friends, but here are just some cultural

776
00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:25.479
examples of things that have proven benefits, and French

777
00:41:25.479 --> 00:41:28.360
people also live 5 years longer than American people.

778
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.290
And that's again a mind boggling statistic.

779
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.110
But do you think that uh it's the idea

780
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.689
that we should work hard itself that's bad, or

781
00:41:41.689 --> 00:41:46.050
is it simply the sort of obsession that people

782
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.370
have with it in America particularly that is bad?

783
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.219
I, I love this question because it's so important,

784
00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:54.459
especially, you know, uh, the more I talk about

785
00:41:54.459 --> 00:41:56.889
this subject, I'm not against hard work. I, I,

786
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.100
I like working hard. I enjoy it. It, it

787
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.580
should pay off. If you're working as hard as

788
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.300
you are, it should, you should be able to

789
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.300
have a good life. You should be able to,

790
00:42:05.419 --> 00:42:08.300
to make the basics of a life function if

791
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.219
you are working a job, any job with, you

792
00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:15.800
know, the focus and vigor that is expected. Um,

793
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.850
AND With a reasonable expectation set by a working

794
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:23.689
culture that centers itself around people. I think that

795
00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:25.469
that's really what it comes down to, that's so

796
00:42:25.469 --> 00:42:29.469
important is, is not that hard work isn't necessary

797
00:42:29.469 --> 00:42:32.750
or useful. It, it makes all these things that

798
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.550
are incredible in the world possible. It's that it

799
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.030
should benefit people to work hard. It shouldn't be

800
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.429
a necessity because they're going to go broke or

801
00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:45.229
homeless or lose everything if they don't work hard.

802
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.399
Um, There has to be a better balance, and

803
00:42:49.399 --> 00:42:52.639
it's, it's really critical that we find a way

804
00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:56.500
to kind of, at least in American life, reestablish

805
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.199
a baseline that makes it possible for people to

806
00:43:01.199 --> 00:43:04.760
be socially mobile, to be ambitious, because right now

807
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.879
people who are working hard are not getting ahead

808
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.939
and they're trapped in this endless cycle of, of

809
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.620
Of obstacle and and and disillusion and anger around

810
00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.620
the fact that they're not getting it.

811
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:25.239
So we shouldn't tell people that they shouldn't work

812
00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:26.919
hard, or should we?

813
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:31.020
Well, we should tell people that they should work

814
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.679
hard, but they should work hard for bosses and

815
00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:36.010
for companies that respect them. We should, we should

816
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.929
put the onus less on talking to people about

817
00:43:38.929 --> 00:43:41.649
the work that they do and more around the

818
00:43:41.649 --> 00:43:45.070
work culture that needs to change to make People

819
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.949
more invested in it. People should feel like they

820
00:43:47.949 --> 00:43:50.790
are actually cared for and, and that they're part

821
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.189
of a team and that they're part of a

822
00:43:53.189 --> 00:43:56.149
system that, that means it well as opposed, means

823
00:43:56.149 --> 00:43:58.510
them well as opposed to, you know, sees them

824
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:03.010
as disposable and, and with suspicion, you know, we,

825
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.149
we have all of these bizarre systems in place

826
00:44:06.149 --> 00:44:10.100
where we're monitoring people's movements throughout the day, whether

827
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.870
you're working at a high-tech place like Google or

828
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.139
you're working at an Amazon factory. Um, IN a

829
00:44:15.139 --> 00:44:18.459
warehouse, and the reality is that we should be

830
00:44:18.459 --> 00:44:20.780
tracking people's time off and making sure they're taking

831
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.659
enough days off for themselves. We should have paid

832
00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:26.540
time off. I used to bartend and one of

833
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.300
the things that I learned over the years of

834
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.939
working in restaurants and bartending was that we have

835
00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:34.500
people who are choosing between paying their rent and

836
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.020
going to a restaurant when they're physically ill and

837
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.899
working. These are people who are preparing foods and

838
00:44:38.899 --> 00:44:41.879
they're sick. And they couldn't stay home because they

839
00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:44.120
don't have paid leave, and they have to make

840
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.100
their rent. And so the person preparing your food

841
00:44:47.679 --> 00:44:50.800
will come to, come, come to come to the

842
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.600
job sick because they have no choice in the

843
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.040
matter. You know, that's just one example of something

844
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.679
that is absurd and costs everyone. There's a social

845
00:44:59.679 --> 00:45:03.199
cost. There's, there, there's a public cost to all

846
00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:07.439
of this sort of systemic disregard for basic human

847
00:45:07.439 --> 00:45:10.419
decency. And that's, that's really what has to change.

848
00:45:10.949 --> 00:45:12.790
That's really what kind of is at the core

849
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.790
of this moment in its need for change is

850
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.350
that we, we're not giving people an opportunity to

851
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.750
be as ambitious as they could be, to work

852
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.320
hard as they could work in a way that

853
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.340
will actually make a difference, and that is something

854
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.350
that I think really gives us another way to

855
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.810
look at what hard work could and should be

856
00:45:32.909 --> 00:45:33.469
in this world.

857
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.280
OK, so one final question then. When do you

858
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.159
think about the future in the US, are you

859
00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:45.760
hopeful about it, particularly when it comes to the

860
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.959
working culture?

861
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.870
Um, I'm not hopeful. Um, BUT I will say

862
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.750
that I spent, you know, for this book, I

863
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.629
traveled around the country and I went to communities

864
00:45:55.629 --> 00:45:58.889
that put me in touch with people that are

865
00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:07.120
Old, young, rural, urban, rich, poor, religious, secular, and

866
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.199
what I loved about that opportunity and hearing people

867
00:46:10.199 --> 00:46:13.489
talk about their lives is the fact that when

868
00:46:13.489 --> 00:46:16.520
you have a good conversation with somebody who has

869
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:21.199
a different political outlook than you, Eventually, you know,

870
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.800
it doesn't actually even take that long. You realize

871
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.919
how much you have in common. You realize what

872
00:46:26.919 --> 00:46:29.439
people say when they want a good life, sounds

873
00:46:29.439 --> 00:46:31.520
pretty similar to what you, what you say when

874
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.580
you want to have a good life. And We

875
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.100
are hopelessly divided over a lot of things right

876
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.419
now, but if there is a way that we

877
00:46:39.419 --> 00:46:43.850
can break through, and again, in-person communication, um, the,

878
00:46:43.899 --> 00:46:46.620
the restoring of, of the public space and third

879
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.020
spaces where people interact. I, I believe that it's,

880
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.600
it's possible for us to kind of see each

881
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.780
other again as real people as opposed to these

882
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.899
kind of siloed caricatures of each other that dominate

883
00:46:59.899 --> 00:47:04.679
the way that we See each other and react

884
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:06.959
to each other and believe certain things about each

885
00:47:06.959 --> 00:47:09.060
other. You know, I, I grew up in Texas

886
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.340
and I live in New York, and those are

887
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.439
two very different places in American life. Um, AND

888
00:47:13.439 --> 00:47:15.080
I can tell you that there are people there

889
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.959
who would disagree with each other and people who

890
00:47:17.959 --> 00:47:19.639
would love each other, and there are some that

891
00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:23.120
are really annoying and dogmatic in each place. And

892
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.560
the reality is that you can bridge these gaps

893
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.679
and find common solutions. And so that's what makes

894
00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:31.800
me hopeful. Um, In the short term, I think

895
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.530
there's going to be a lot more agony to

896
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:34.959
get there, but I, I do think that there

897
00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:36.260
is a hunger there for change.

898
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.389
Great. So the book is again 99% Perspiration and

899
00:47:42.389 --> 00:47:45.350
New Working History of the American Way of Life.
