00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.019
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.070
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.510
today I'm joined by Doctor Mauricio Suarez. He is

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.470
full professor in logic and philosophy of Science at

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.708
Universidad Complutense de Madrid. He's also a life member

6
00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.909
at Claire Hall at Cambridge University, and today we're

7
00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.989
going to talk about his book Inference and Representation,

8
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.349
A Study in Modeling Science. So, Doctor Suarez, welcome

9
00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.429
to the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.900
Thank you very much, Ricardo. I'm very pleased to

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.139
be here finally. It took us some time to

12
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:40.180
arrange this, but we finally made it.

13
00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:43.900
Thank you. Yes, that, that's true. That's true. So

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.490
let me first ask you about uh modeling. Uh,

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.159
WHAT is the practice of modeling in science?

16
00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:56.950
Um, YES, the practice of modeling in science is,

17
00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:03.930
um, the way scientists throughout all disciplines, um, go

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.290
about constructing hypothetical, imaginative, or fictional scenarios in order

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.690
to compare to real systems targets that they're interested

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.699
in studying in the world and to gain some

21
00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:24.150
information about those systems. So it is. It is

22
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.230
a central practice in contemporary scientific activity across all

23
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.470
kinds of different fields, and it doesn't um attempt

24
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.910
to study nature, um, or society, the objects of

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.970
the study, um, directly, but by means of constructing.

26
00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:52.080
This hypothetical or imaginative or fictional scenarios that are

27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.610
then compared with the real systems and knowledge can

28
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.370
be acquired. Uh, BY means of these comparisons.

29
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.500
And what is a model? I mean, what, what

30
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.370
does that mean in science?

31
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.179
Uh, YEAH, that's a different question. Um, THAT'S a

32
00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.460
question in the ontology of models. The first question

33
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.740
that you asked me was a question about practice,

34
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.940
and one can answer that question by looking at

35
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.300
the phenomenology of scientific activity and practice. The second

36
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.910
question that you asked me is a more philosophical

37
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.529
question and perhaps surprisingly, it's a harder question to

38
00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.050
answer. I mean, the, the first question. It is

39
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.820
relatively easy to answer because we just have to

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.699
look at the practice and the practice is very

41
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.389
much a given. But models are not a given.

42
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.830
We have to philosophically interpret them in order to

43
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.990
come up with an answer to that question. What

44
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.100
are models? Um, AND it turns out that no

45
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.059
single philosophical answer to this question has been very

46
00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.899
good, um, to be frank, there have been lots

47
00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.220
of different philosophical attempts to come up with an

48
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.690
answer, and all of them have some, uh, issues

49
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.779
or limitations of one sort or another. Perhaps the

50
00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.699
simplest answer is to say that a model is

51
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.330
a description. But that really doesn't tell you much

52
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.210
because then you have to ask a description of

53
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.610
what and how does it describe a model what

54
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.449
it describes, and that gets you into the heart

55
00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.289
of the philosophical problem with representation. So, I don't

56
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.490
think we have a very good answer to the

57
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.350
question what models are. Um, IT'S quite clear that

58
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.169
there are many things that can play the role

59
00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.190
of models from equations to linguistic descriptions to contraptions

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.009
and real physical objects to imaginative scenarios and thought

61
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.960
experiments. They all can play the role of models,

62
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.869
and there is not a single thing that identifies

63
00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:55.279
or cuts across. All of those. So, uh, in,

64
00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.520
in part, um, my project has been for some

65
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.880
time now to come up with a functional answer

66
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.139
to the question of what models are rather than

67
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.520
answering the question directly and giving you a definition

68
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.960
of what the model is abstractly, which I think

69
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.639
has not been a very successful project. I prefer

70
00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.010
to give you a definition of what models are.

71
00:04:17.688 --> 00:04:21.528
In the practice of modeling, which is uh something

72
00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.760
that is much more accessible and easier. To contemplate

73
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.399
and study and so I try to come up

74
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:31.279
with um a purely functional definition of what a

75
00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.920
model is in terms of what it does for

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.470
us, which is to allow us to investigate the

77
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.309
world in the way that I described in my

78
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.720
answer to the first question.

79
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.450
And then in the book you talk about what

80
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.769
you call the modeling attitude. What is that and

81
00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.809
how did it emerge in the 19th century?

82
00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:55.239
Yes, so I mean this really gets us already

83
00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:00.130
going into the project because the whole I wrote

84
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.290
a whole chapter. The second chapter, which is devoted

85
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.690
to the historical background to the philosophical analysis of

86
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.299
present-day scientific modeling. Um, THERE has been modeling in

87
00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:16.559
science, and there have been models in science, um,

88
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.589
for as long as there has been science. Um,

89
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.739
Galileo famously constructed models, so did Kepler. But they

90
00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:27.899
were not in any way dominant or a dominant

91
00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.059
part of science. They only become a dominant or

92
00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.679
central part of scientific activity. At the end of

93
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.570
the 19th century. So, the modeling attitude is this

94
00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:44.549
very prevalent and dominant way of doing science by

95
00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:50.029
means of this construction of imaginative hypothetical fictional scenarios

96
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.029
that I was talking about at the beginning, which

97
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.109
only becomes really dominant and central to the way

98
00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:59.390
we do science. Um, IN the 20th century. So

99
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.549
it's a really fin de sela development and it's

100
00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:06.019
really with the start of the 20th century that

101
00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:10.309
we can start talking about a central modeling attitude

102
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:13.549
on the part of scientists. Scientists gain this attitude

103
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:17.320
of doing science by means of the construction. OF

104
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.119
models. So I, I go into some details of

105
00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:25.589
this history. And I find a number of locations

106
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:29.269
throughout Europe, throughout the 19th century where this modeling

107
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.290
attitude becomes dominant, particularly around the work of um

108
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.609
James Clerk Maxwell and the Maxwellians in Victorian Britain

109
00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:42.040
in the second half of the 19th century, and

110
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.640
then slightly later, but really pretty much simultaneously in,

111
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.209
in the German lands, particularly around the schools in

112
00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:55.790
Berlin and Um, Vienna, um, both around Hermann von

113
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.829
Helmholtz and, uh, Ludwig, uh, um, Boltzmann. Um, IN

114
00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:05.190
Vienna at the turn of the century, um, there

115
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.309
are a couple of very signaling events, um, both

116
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:12.750
in Britain and then later on, um, the publication

117
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.390
of, um, uh, and a very famous and influential

118
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.290
entry. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica by Boltzmann entitled Models,

119
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.619
which is published in 1900 at the turn of

120
00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:31.299
the century, um, which signals the dominance of the

121
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:35.500
modeling attitude. So it has two cultural sources. Um,

122
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.690
THAT are predominant, but it's really happening all throughout

123
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.089
Europe. It happens in France, it happens in Italy,

124
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.269
it happens everywhere where scientific activity takes place that

125
00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.989
this, uh, modeling attitude, this attitude of building models

126
00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:56.549
in order to investigate phenomena becomes, uh, prevalent, and

127
00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:59.739
I think the history is important because it gives

128
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.910
us clues as to how to understand the notion.

129
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.690
So, um, what I undertake in that chapter in

130
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.869
the book is uh If you want, you could

131
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:14.459
call it a philosophical history of the present, uh,

132
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.230
the present day condition in science which has a

133
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.350
history and I go to doing a bit of

134
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.070
genealogy of that, and I happen to be one

135
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.750
of those philosophers who think, who thinks that you

136
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.049
can only really understand the philosophical debate or position

137
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.950
if you understand the history and in this case.

138
00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:36.890
I think it's very obvious that the history is

139
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.530
incredibly informative for how we should think about uh

140
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.969
models and, and, um, nowadays. So, it has a

141
00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:48.869
history, it has a very precise history with precise

142
00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:53.289
locations and scientists who take on this particular way

143
00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:56.890
of doing science and then it spreads out very

144
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.390
quickly and eventually becomes very dominant.

145
00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:05.659
Um, LET me ask you now about representation in

146
00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:10.340
the philosophy of science, when exactly did people start

147
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.500
thinking more about the concept of representation?

148
00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:19.289
This is a very good question, um, because you

149
00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:23.190
would have thought that representation would always have been

150
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.809
a topic of philosophical interest, and there is a

151
00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.530
sense in which it always was a topic of

152
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.929
philosophical interest, but, um, during the, the, the years

153
00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:40.840
of dominance of formal philosophy and the um Dominance

154
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.030
of logical positivism, particularly in North America. I think

155
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.429
the concept was somewhat relegated, um, and that may

156
00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:50.729
have had to do with the fact that for

157
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.309
the logical positivists, the fundamental notions of analysis were

158
00:09:56.309 --> 00:10:02.190
linguistic and particularly um descriptive, um, and representation is

159
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.419
a more general concept. Um, SO for a long

160
00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.270
time, philosophers didn't really care much about this concept.

161
00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:13.349
And so you find a paradox that for instance

162
00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:19.070
in the 1970s and 1980s, philosophers of science barely

163
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.109
touch the topic and there is no established topic

164
00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:25.390
of scientific representation in the curriculum is in no

165
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.669
way a canonical topic, still nowadays remains perhaps slightly

166
00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:34.849
outside the canon, um. Yet in other areas of

167
00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:38.770
philosophy, for instance, in the philosophy of art, representation

168
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.429
is the central concept which every philosopher of art

169
00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:45.609
has something to say about in the 1970s, in

170
00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:51.219
the 1980s, in the 1990s. So, uh, something happens,

171
00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:54.450
um, in the second half of the 20th century

172
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.049
in philosophy of science where representation as a topic

173
00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:01.969
gets suppressed in some ways. Um, IT comes back

174
00:11:01.969 --> 00:11:06.729
to the fore, um, mainly through renewed interest by

175
00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:11.880
philosophers of science or modeling. Um, WHICH is, uh,

176
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:15.739
something that philosophers take up in the 1990s, really.

177
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.250
And once we take up that interest, we connect

178
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.010
with previous philosophical discussions of modeling that there were

179
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.890
at the beginning of the 20th century around figures

180
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.960
like Pierre Duhaim and Henry Poincare here as in

181
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.770
many other areas, a real pioneer, um, and later

182
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.849
on Campbell, uh, in, in England, and then some

183
00:11:38.849 --> 00:11:42.989
minor figures, um. During the 50s and 60s that

184
00:11:42.989 --> 00:11:45.750
were at the time considered marginal like Max Black

185
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.190
and Mary Hesse, who did uh write extensively about

186
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.229
models but were not uh regarded as canonical figures

187
00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:57.549
in the field, but who have been rehabilitated in

188
00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.669
the last 20 or 30 years precisely because of

189
00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:04.719
this new interest on, on representation. So it has

190
00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:08.750
um And an interesting history of its own, the

191
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.849
concept of representation in the philosophy of science because

192
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.239
um it has suffered waves of interest and disinterterest

193
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.809
um throughout the history and I think it's interesting

194
00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:23.729
to study the philosophy of science through the lens

195
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.679
of what philosophers of science do with the concept.

196
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.219
Um, AT some point, um, they are centrally occupied

197
00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:34.099
with it. Later on, they become very much disinterested

198
00:12:34.099 --> 00:12:36.710
in it. And in the last 20 or 30

199
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.929
years, the topic has emerged again with renewed uh

200
00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:43.549
force and vigor, and it's now one of the

201
00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:46.989
central topics of research for philosophers of science and

202
00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:50.390
I think again, possibly becoming canonical again.

203
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.890
And what is representation exactly?

204
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.840
OK. I mean this is you have to read

205
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.109
my book to get the answer to the full

206
00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:07.150
answer to this question, um, so, um, representation is

207
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.739
um A, a concept, a notion that we use

208
00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:16.919
to describe the way, the different ways in which

209
00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:21.460
in different areas of knowledge and particular in science,

210
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.119
uh, people get on with ways to characterize the

211
00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:33.059
reality around them. Now, There is a traditional, very

212
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.760
old, um, ancient really way of thinking of representation

213
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.400
as a sort of Mimsis or copy of the

214
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.000
reality. One way in which we go about representing

215
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.719
reality is by copying it, um, identifying its fundamental

216
00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:56.919
elements and producing some sort of copy. Um, OF

217
00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:00.239
it as kind of mirror image of the reality

218
00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:03.599
and this has been, this is an ancient thought.

219
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.969
But it's been crit also critic criticized very strongly

220
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:13.109
also since antiquity. I mean it's had its defenders

221
00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:16.469
and its critics ever since it was born possibly

222
00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:21.609
with Plato. Um, AND nowadays, uh, we, we think,

223
00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:24.510
I think the consensus is that any sort of

224
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.229
attempt to get on with the concept of representation

225
00:14:27.229 --> 00:14:30.590
by means of any mirroring metaphor is very limited.

226
00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:36.599
And encounters very important fundamental problems. But basically, that's

227
00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:42.270
what representation is. It's a, it's a concept. Um,

228
00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:46.880
THAT we use and apply to every attempt to

229
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.280
provide a characterization of the surrounding reality that helps

230
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.760
us manage in some ways and get to know

231
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.520
that reality.

232
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.679
AND what are the most prominent accounts of scientific

233
00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:02.679
representation?

234
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.679
Uh, WELL, as I was mentioning before, um, interest

235
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:13.640
in this notion is, is relatively new in the

236
00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:16.719
philosophy of science of the last, uh, century or

237
00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:21.030
so, um, and this is an evolving, uh, field,

238
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.440
so there are new accounts springing up, um, almost,

239
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.000
uh, as we speak, uh, on a monthly basis.

240
00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:34.130
It's a very rich, uh, lively and dynamic. FIELD

241
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.729
of research. I would divide all the accounts of

242
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.450
representation and this is something I do in the

243
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:45.049
book um into two kinds. Uh WHAT I Accounts

244
00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:48.169
of representation and what I call deflationary accounts of

245
00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:53.250
representation. The substantive accounts of representation try to attempt

246
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.369
to get to grips with the with the concept

247
00:15:55.369 --> 00:16:00.169
of representation by defining it, essentially providing a set

248
00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:04.489
of sufficient and necessary conditions for the concept and

249
00:16:04.489 --> 00:16:07.530
in so doing reducing it to other concepts that

250
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.650
we may think are easier to comprehend or to

251
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.739
understand. Since, as I mentioned, representation itself is a

252
00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:20.130
complex. A concept, you may think that one way

253
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.570
of going philosophically about it is to try to

254
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.429
reduce it to a simpler concept or set of

255
00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:28.890
concepts, and that's what a substantive account would on

256
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.640
the whole try to do. And there are a

257
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.799
number of different accounts that fit the bill here.

258
00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:37.489
There have been people who have claimed that representation

259
00:16:37.489 --> 00:16:41.840
can be reduced to similarity of relations between model

260
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.010
sources and model targets. And there are people who

261
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.010
have uh employed the structuralist notions derived from morphism

262
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.950
or isomorphisms of some sort in order to characterize

263
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.140
this substantive relation. In all these cases, the, the,

264
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.849
the idea in the background of these attempts is

265
00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:06.780
that representation is complex and um. Very hard to

266
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.260
understand and you try to analyze it or reduce

267
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.699
it to concepts that are easier to understand, such

268
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:17.069
as similarity or or isomorphism. Um, I, I think

269
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.260
all these attempts to reduce the concept of representation

270
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.420
encounter uh what I now regard that as insurmountable

271
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.579
difficulties and I don't think any of them really

272
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.989
works. To the satisfaction of the proponents. The other

273
00:17:30.989 --> 00:17:35.968
kind of um account, um, is a deflationary account,

274
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:38.428
and this is an account that doesn't necessarily try

275
00:17:38.428 --> 00:17:42.270
to define the notion. Um, THERE are many concepts

276
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.920
that we employ in ordinary life and in our

277
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.000
cognitive lives that we don't know how to define.

278
00:17:48.699 --> 00:17:51.099
And there's a whole philosophical tradition that claims that

279
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:55.140
no concept except very recondite concepts in the formal

280
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.780
senses can be fully analyzed in this way, um.

281
00:17:59.949 --> 00:18:03.189
And a deflationist, um, would approach the concept of

282
00:18:03.189 --> 00:18:06.750
representation in this spirit instead of trying to analyze

283
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.109
it away in terms of simpler concepts, the deflationist

284
00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:14.270
thinks that representation is not in fact such a

285
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.869
complex concept, but it is related to the phenomenology

286
00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:20.589
of the practice of model building that we discussed

287
00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:22.949
uh at the beginning of the interview. And so

288
00:18:22.949 --> 00:18:26.270
therefore it's, um, in some ways a given. It

289
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.949
is a given in the way that we do

290
00:18:27.949 --> 00:18:31.170
things that we employ representations. And we can only

291
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.910
really say some very general things about the concept

292
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.589
and then the philosophical task that remains to do

293
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.209
is not to analyze it but to see how

294
00:18:40.209 --> 00:18:43.089
it works in practice and to study the practice

295
00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:46.930
and you know it's a splendid variety and trying

296
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.349
to draw as many general lessons as we can

297
00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:54.489
from the practice about how we use um representations.

298
00:18:54.969 --> 00:19:01.420
So deflationist tends to Um, to favor the study

299
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.020
of the practice while the substantivist would tend to

300
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.849
favor the analysis of the concept, um, and, uh,

301
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.180
and, and there are two very different approaches to

302
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.300
this field, um, just as there are different substantivist

303
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.579
accounts, there are also different deflationist accounts. Uh, I

304
00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:22.219
have proposed one, but there are other, and there

305
00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:25.739
are other versions of this different accounts that circulate

306
00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:29.520
in the literature that can be. Uh, MADE or

307
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.920
read in other place or spirit. So I think

308
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.400
there is quite a range of accounts that are

309
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.079
acceptable and that one could choose from, um. Mine

310
00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:42.359
is not necessarily the only one, although I claim

311
00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:45.479
some virtues for it, but there are other accounts

312
00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:49.000
of representation that, as I mentioned before, are deflationist

313
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.209
in the sense that they put the practice first

314
00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:53.839
and they try to study the practice ahead of

315
00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:57.000
trying to analyze the concept in any abstract way.

316
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.540
In the book at a certain point, you talk

317
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.099
about the distinction between the means and the constituent

318
00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:09.819
of scientific representation. Uh, WHAT is that distinction and

319
00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.180
why does it matter?

320
00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:18.609
Yeah, good. Um, SO, this, this distinction, um, has

321
00:20:18.609 --> 00:20:22.290
a role to play in the assessment of the

322
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.770
different accounts of representation. I introduced it explicitly in

323
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.089
the book. I mean, it, it originates uh with

324
00:20:29.089 --> 00:20:32.609
me for Uh, for good or bad, it originates

325
00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:35.890
with me. Um, AND I introduced it in order

326
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.030
to, uh, produce some sort of assessment of the

327
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:44.180
different accounts of representation. Um, THE constituent of representation

328
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.209
is the relation, if there is one, between sources

329
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:51.900
and targets in virtue of which, uh, a model

330
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.959
is a representation of its target. So it's basically

331
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.380
the defining conditions in this analytical spirit of the

332
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.020
substantive, uh, accounts to representation of the notion of

333
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:11.270
representation. Now defenders of the substantivist accounts of representation

334
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.989
would claim that there is a constituent to representation

335
00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:17.989
and moreover, it's a substantive one that allows us

336
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:20.270
to understand the concept. I claim in the book

337
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.099
that there is no substantive constituent of the uh

338
00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:27.390
concept of representation. We can at best express some

339
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.790
very general platitudes of how the concept is employed

340
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.869
in practice and that's as much as we can

341
00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:36.310
say about the constituents. So I have a very

342
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.839
thin. Account of the constituent of representation, but this

343
00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:44.520
needs to be distinguished from the means of any

344
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.599
given representation which is the relation between source and

345
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:52.949
targets. That scientists will utilize in the context of

346
00:21:52.949 --> 00:21:56.099
their practice in order to draw conclusions about the

347
00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:59.589
targets on the basis of the source of the

348
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:04.780
representation. These are the means of the different sets

349
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.420
of representations that we find uh across the different

350
00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.699
sciences, and scientists will employ very many different such

351
00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:17.260
relations in different contexts. Now, varieties or types of

352
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.989
similarity may play a role in some contexts, a

353
00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:23.939
stronger or weaker forms. Varieties or types of morphism

354
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.819
could play a role as means of the representational

355
00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.270
relation in different contexts. Um, THERE are different kinds

356
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.109
of morphisms that could play that role, but then

357
00:22:33.109 --> 00:22:37.329
there are other, uh, relations such as instantiation, which,

358
00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:41.439
uh, is one possible relation between a model and

359
00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:45.290
its target, uh, that cannot be reduced to either

360
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.430
similarity or isomorphism, and I claim those also can

361
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.430
play and often play a role. So you have

362
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.510
a variety of means that all play a role

363
00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:01.079
in different cases in different representations. Um So, um,

364
00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:03.939
I use the distinction between means and constituents to

365
00:23:03.939 --> 00:23:08.900
defend my account, which is minimal or minimalist with

366
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.989
respect to the constituents. And pluralist with respect to

367
00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:16.550
the means of representation, claiming that there are very

368
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.369
many different means that can play a legitimate role

369
00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:25.229
in order to mediate or facilitate the functional ends

370
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:28.109
of representational models in sciences.

371
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:34.170
Mhm. Uh, TELL us then how this distinction between

372
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.910
the means and the constituent, the constituent of scientific

373
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.719
representation then grounds a clear division of labor between

374
00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:47.250
epistemic and conceptual dimensions of representation.

375
00:23:50.089 --> 00:23:55.239
Yeah, that's a great question too. Um, SO, um,

376
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.530
So for a, for a long time, I think

377
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.890
when people thought about representation, they had in mind

378
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.430
representation of success. That is the ways in which

379
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:12.489
models may accurately characterize their targets. And so in

380
00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:15.050
philosophers' minds, I think for a long time the

381
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.140
question of what are the conditions for representational success

382
00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:23.010
and what are the conditions for representation simpliciter. We

383
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.400
conflated. It's only in the last 20 or 30

384
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.239
years that we've, I think, very successfully disentangled these

385
00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:34.119
two sets of conditions. So, nowadays, I think every

386
00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:37.849
philosopher working on On the topic, I think Buddha

387
00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:43.150
accept this distinction. Um, THERE are representations which are

388
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:47.489
not particularly successful or accurate. There are very inaccurate

389
00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:50.849
representations of target systems, and throughout history we've seen

390
00:24:50.849 --> 00:24:53.979
them. Um, PLAY a role in the history and

391
00:24:53.979 --> 00:24:59.810
the development of science. Um, There are certain models

392
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.770
that we take to be accurate characterizations of their

393
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.369
systems and we end up discovering that they're not

394
00:25:05.369 --> 00:25:09.170
so accurate. Um, 11 could, for instance, take the

395
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.400
succession of models of the solar system or the

396
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.930
planetary system throughout the history of the last 2000

397
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.550
years as a brilliant series of examples of models

398
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.130
that turn out not to be particularly accurate, um,

399
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.849
and for all kinds of different reasons contain inaccuracies

400
00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:31.050
and make false statements about their target system. Starting

401
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.160
with, of course, the geocentric, uh, Aristotelian model that

402
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.859
put the Earth at the center of the universe,

403
00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:39.979
something that we know nowadays to be false, um,

404
00:25:40.689 --> 00:25:43.729
so one has to distinguish the conditions for a

405
00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:47.560
representation, something to be a model. And the conditions

406
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.050
for it to be an accurate, truthful, or faithful

407
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.319
representation. They must be distinct because most models involve

408
00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:59.479
misrepresentations of all kinds. Um, ON these grounds, a

409
00:25:59.479 --> 00:26:05.010
division of labor between, um, epistemic and conceptual dimensions

410
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:10.010
of our analysis, um, representations of epistemic or cognitive

411
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.630
value when they, uh, provide at least partially accurate

412
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.839
descriptions of their target systems, um, but they're nonetheless

413
00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:21.420
conceptually valid. Even if they're not accurate or even

414
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.300
if they're completely inaccurate in all kinds of different

415
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.359
respects, there are still representations of their target systems

416
00:26:27.859 --> 00:26:30.900
and so therefore we need a different account of

417
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.420
representation uh than we need uh an account of

418
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.849
accurate representation. My distinction between means and constituents allows

419
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:41.020
me to do this very easily because the constituent

420
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.099
of representation takes as it were, charge of the

421
00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:48.930
conceptual side. While the um uh study of the

422
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.369
different means of representation in practice takes care of

423
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:54.489
the different ways in which people can, uh, and

424
00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:57.449
scientists can judge their models to be accurate or

425
00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.819
faithful. Um, SO there, there certainly is nowadays a

426
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:05.420
division of labor and a clear distinction between accurate

427
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.459
representation and representation simpliciter, and every philosopher working on

428
00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:14.839
the topic nowadays accepts. That an account of representation

429
00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:18.599
must make room for misrepresentation in all its different

430
00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:20.420
varieties. Yes,

431
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.199
and how does it then lead to a distinction

432
00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:29.719
between successful representation and the more general category of

433
00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:30.510
representation?

434
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.920
Yes, I mean that, that question speaks, I mean,

435
00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.000
I, in a way I've already answered that question

436
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.959
because that question speaks exactly to the distinction between

437
00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:47.400
representation simpliciter. Um, WHICH can be very inaccurate. Um,

438
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.180
IT can be maximally inaccurate. A representation could get

439
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.910
not a single fact right about its target and

440
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.839
it nonetheless is a representation of its target. If

441
00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:01.880
it's intended use is to convey information about the

442
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.199
target, and as I mentioned before, the history of

443
00:28:05.199 --> 00:28:08.560
science is full of examples of this sort. If

444
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.510
you take the original Ptolemaic models of the solar

445
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:16.530
system. There's barely any statement that you can deduce

446
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.079
from those models that we nowadays would think of

447
00:28:20.079 --> 00:28:25.160
as a true statement. Um, Nonetheless, they are very

448
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.800
clearly representations of the solar system. That's their intended

449
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.199
use, that's how they were created and that's how

450
00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:35.439
we must interpret them even nowadays when we know

451
00:28:35.439 --> 00:28:40.069
them to be maximally false. So, um. So this

452
00:28:40.069 --> 00:28:42.619
is really important to people working on the field

453
00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:45.709
at the moment that we distinguish very carefully between

454
00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:49.349
successful representation and the conditions that must obtained for

455
00:28:49.349 --> 00:28:53.869
a representation to be successful from representation simpliciter, which

456
00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:58.510
need not be successful. Um, uh, SO representation is

457
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.790
not, uh, to put it technically in philosopher's jargon.

458
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.969
Representation is not a success term. You can represent

459
00:29:06.969 --> 00:29:10.930
something and do it very poorly, um, with very

460
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.449
little. Um, SUCCESS just as you can have all

461
00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:17.569
kinds of beliefs and the beliefs could be false,

462
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.489
um, and people make this distinction between knowledge being

463
00:29:21.489 --> 00:29:25.010
a success term, belief not being one, and you

464
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.930
could say that nowadays I'd say. Everyone working on

465
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.209
this, uh, topic accepts that representation is a bit

466
00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:36.209
like belief and unlike knowledge, it's not a success

467
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:36.449
term.

468
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.479
You, you criticize reductive naturalist theories of scientific representation.

469
00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:47.079
What are these kinds of theories and what do

470
00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:49.060
you think are their flaws?

471
00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.560
So these are the theories that attempt to reduce

472
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.589
the concept of representation by providing some substantive um

473
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.420
reactive basis and a definition of representation in terms

474
00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:07.540
of that basis. And the two main ideas that

475
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.239
have been discussed in this area throughout the years

476
00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:17.920
are similarity and different variants of similarity. Um, AND,

477
00:30:17.969 --> 00:30:23.109
uh, isomorphism or morphism and different kinds of morphism,

478
00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:27.949
uh, that may operate between targets and sources, um.

479
00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:36.489
Now, it's um. A complex issue, what the relations

480
00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:38.810
between those two are. There are people who think

481
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:43.050
that. Um, ISOMORPHISM is nothing but a kind of

482
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.410
similarity, and there are people who think that all

483
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.890
similarities must be understood to be underpinned by some

484
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:55.380
sort of a structural. Uh, MORPHISM, um, but the

485
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.209
emphasis has been put in placed differently on the

486
00:30:58.209 --> 00:31:02.550
different concepts by defenders. Of the, of the role

487
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.540
of these concepts in the notion of representation, so

488
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.859
I think it's legitimate. To talk about two broad,

489
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.380
broader families, two broad families of um substantive or

490
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.540
reductive naturalist accounts, the similarity account and the isomorphism

491
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.459
account. Now, in the book, I criticize these accounts

492
00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:23.880
and I put forward a number of arguments. Um,

493
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.069
AGAINST them. These are old arguments, um, which I've

494
00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:31.229
been rehearsing, uh, not just me, but other philosophers

495
00:31:31.229 --> 00:31:34.790
of science have also been elaborating for some time

496
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.619
now, for about 20 years. Um, AND what I

497
00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:40.699
do in the book is to try to, um,

498
00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:44.969
Take balance of the debate on, on these arguments

499
00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:48.010
over the last 20 years. I think the arguments

500
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:53.050
have been very successful at dismantling um philosopher's confidence

501
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:58.469
in this productive naturalist accounts. Um, uh, I think

502
00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:01.130
it would be very difficult nowadays to argue for

503
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.040
any of these reductive naturalist accounts. Um, THERE are

504
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.640
5 different types of arguments that I study in

505
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.000
the book. Um, MAYBE the most powerful ones are

506
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.719
the logical argument and the misrepresentation argument. The misrepresentation

507
00:32:16.719 --> 00:32:19.079
argument is connected to what we've just been talking

508
00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:23.000
about, the fact that many representations. If not all,

509
00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:27.260
um, misrepresent in very definite ways their targets and

510
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.400
this is hard for similarity and isomorphism accounts to,

511
00:32:31.979 --> 00:32:35.540
um, to explain. Um, THEY have different ways to

512
00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.569
try to explain them, these failures of representation of

513
00:32:39.569 --> 00:32:41.859
rep full or accurate representation, but none of them

514
00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:45.760
are fully convincing, I think. Um, THE other argument

515
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.750
is a logical argument that simply points out The

516
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:56.189
representation in science and elsewhere. Is a directed relationship

517
00:32:56.329 --> 00:33:01.589
from sources targets. It's not symmetric. It's not reflexive.

518
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.689
Nothing that represents something represents itself. This is very

519
00:33:05.689 --> 00:33:09.609
rare, um, and it's not transitive. You can have

520
00:33:09.609 --> 00:33:12.479
something represents something else which in turn represents something

521
00:33:12.479 --> 00:33:15.050
else and that doesn't turn the first into a

522
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.089
representation of the third. Um, AND this is easy

523
00:33:19.089 --> 00:33:23.290
to see operating in the phenomenology of representation in

524
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.930
science and in art, but very difficult for similarity

525
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:32.420
and isomorphism accounts. To um To account and to

526
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.060
fit. Um, SO it becomes a really um very

527
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.060
important um argument against uh this uh reductive naturalist

528
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.640
or substantivist accounts.

529
00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:50.199
And what would be then alternative non-reductive views?

530
00:33:51.069 --> 00:33:53.560
Yes, these are the deflationary accounts that I was

531
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.920
talking about at the beginning. And these are accounts

532
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.880
from which one doesn't. Invest oneself philosophically in the

533
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.250
reduction of the concept of representation. Um, And that's

534
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.020
partly because one doesn't find it so problematic to

535
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.110
begin with. And the reason why one doesn't find

536
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.668
it so problematic to begin with is connected to

537
00:34:14.668 --> 00:34:17.708
the pragmatism and the phenomenology of the practice that

538
00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:19.590
I was discussing at the beginning of the interview.

539
00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.320
If you are convinced that the practice is a

540
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.239
given and it's accessible and it's reasonably well understood.

541
00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:30.829
Then from a pragmatist point of view, um, you

542
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:33.349
don't really have a big conundrum to answer about

543
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:36.148
the concept of representation. The concept is operative in

544
00:34:36.148 --> 00:34:40.618
practice. And that should be enough um for us

545
00:34:40.618 --> 00:34:42.549
philosophers. It gives us a lot of work to

546
00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:45.509
do because we have to now study this practice,

547
00:34:46.029 --> 00:34:48.069
um, but the work that we have to do

548
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:50.518
is not of a conceptual kind and it doesn't

549
00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:55.447
begin with big puzzles about this obscure notion representation,

550
00:34:55.748 --> 00:35:00.699
um. So, on, on this deflationary accounts, which I

551
00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:02.530
think all of them in some way or another

552
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.770
tend towards pragmatism because they do begin with this

553
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.780
description of the practice and they begin with the

554
00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.260
assumption that the representation is not a very difficult

555
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.989
concept that requires an analysis, but a simple concept

556
00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:18.419
that appears in our practice very prominently, uh, but

557
00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:20.540
just like, um, I don't know, the concept of

558
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.979
a table or a chair appear in our practice

559
00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:26.620
and they don't demand a very deep philosophical analysis.

560
00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:30.780
Um, THE practice of using those objects may demand

561
00:35:31.169 --> 00:35:34.929
the philosophical scrutiny, uh, but the concept itself doesn't.

562
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.780
So, so a deflationist thinks that representation is just

563
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.340
like one of these ordinary concepts, and there's nothing

564
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.800
mysterious about it. There's nothing that requires us to

565
00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:48.179
come up with a deep philosophical theory that analyzes

566
00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:51.100
the concept, but we have philosophical work to do

567
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.409
in understanding the way in which we use it,

568
00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:58.469
this concept in practice. And any deflationary account begins

569
00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:02.409
with this, I think. Uh, MINE is 1, I

570
00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:05.830
offer it as a possible account of representation from

571
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.520
this pragmatist perspective. And this is the idea that

572
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.760
we focus on the way in which models and

573
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.199
representations are used as tools for surrogative inference, a

574
00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:19.270
kind of inference that takes us from sources to

575
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.300
targets, which is part and parcel of the practice

576
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.280
as given, and that, that should be our starting

577
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.600
point. And then we should scrutinize the practice in

578
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.469
order to shed philosophical light on it. But we

579
00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:34.350
shouldn't try to analyze the concept any, in any

580
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.270
other more significant way. There are other approaches to

581
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.270
representation that are deflationary, um, from this point of

582
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.669
view, I think are acceptable and rather legitimate and

583
00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.870
can overcome the objections. Um, MINE is not the

584
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.919
only one. SO there are some approaches that appeal

585
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:58.600
to other notions such as demonstration or denotation or,

586
00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:03.800
um. Um, INTERPRETATION, and if you understand those notions

587
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.979
to be as part of the practice, which I

588
00:37:05.979 --> 00:37:10.739
think one can do, those, um, accounts also in,

589
00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:14.340
in my view are legitimate. Um, SO I'm not

590
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.340
saying mine is the only one, but I do

591
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.780
think that these accounts that begin with the study

592
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.310
of the practice are significantly better. As it, um,

593
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.850
as it turns out in trying to understand philosophically,

594
00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:33.629
um, the way modeling works in science and how

595
00:37:33.629 --> 00:37:38.389
representation generalizes to other areas of inquiry, they're significantly

596
00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:42.709
better as starting points than any substantive reductive naturalist

597
00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:43.110
account.

598
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.939
So tell us then about your inferential conception of

599
00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:50.699
scientific representation.

600
00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:53.479
Yeah, so my, my conception is one of this

601
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:59.649
inflationary. Accounts that I think are survived the criticisms

602
00:38:00.149 --> 00:38:02.189
and in, in the case of, of my approach,

603
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.389
what I do is that I put one feature

604
00:38:05.389 --> 00:38:10.270
of uh representation um and undeniably one feature of

605
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.929
scientific modeling that is ever present in the practice

606
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.510
of modeling, which is uh a kind of inference

607
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.939
that we call surrogate inference. And this is the

608
00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:24.939
sort of inference, logical inference if you want, um,

609
00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:29.669
that takes you from facts about the source and

610
00:38:29.669 --> 00:38:31.709
its description, the source of the model may be

611
00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:35.729
an equation or some kind of fictional scenario or

612
00:38:35.729 --> 00:38:41.310
um hypothesis. You study how that equation or scenario

613
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.550
hypothesis is structured and what sort of claims it's

614
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:48.260
making. And then you draw inferences from those facts

615
00:38:48.629 --> 00:38:52.320
to claims that you make about the target system,

616
00:38:52.399 --> 00:38:55.439
and the target system could be any system you're

617
00:38:55.439 --> 00:38:58.030
interested in, maybe the evolution of a population in

618
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.000
biology or as we were saying before, the movement

619
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.050
of the planets in the solar system. So, a

620
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.010
representation primarily what it does for you, a model

621
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.850
in science what it primarily does for you is

622
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.989
to facilitate those sorts of inferences across from the

623
00:39:15.489 --> 00:39:18.590
source system to the target system. That's called technically

624
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.290
in the literature surrogative inference. So, my, my approach

625
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.070
to representation puts that feature of practice which As

626
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.919
far as I know, it's universal. I having encountered,

627
00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:33.729
and I've been studying this area for more than

628
00:39:33.729 --> 00:39:36.830
20 years, and I haven't encountered yet an instance

629
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:41.389
of a model that doesn't allow for surrogative reasoning

630
00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:44.270
and I think, well, I think I've convinced my

631
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.189
peers that this must be a central feature of

632
00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:50.590
any modeling activity and in my, in, in the

633
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.389
case of my conception, this is the only indispensable

634
00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:57.959
feature. Of the practice um of modeling and therefore,

635
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.100
um, on my account it becomes the only constituent

636
00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:04.110
of the notion of representation because it's the only

637
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.850
universally instantiated feature in the practice. And as I

638
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.020
mentioned before, I'm not interested in a substantive analysis

639
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.969
of the concept. I think as philosophers, we are

640
00:40:13.969 --> 00:40:17.909
better off analyzing the practice of representing. Um, AND

641
00:40:17.909 --> 00:40:19.510
this is the only feature that I can see

642
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:23.070
in the practice that plays a universal, uh, role.

643
00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:25.429
So, so that's why I call it the inferential

644
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:31.949
conception. Because I claim that surrogative inferences a fundamental

645
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:36.110
feature of um of the scientific practice of modeling.

646
00:40:36.189 --> 00:40:38.800
This has to be supplemented with another condition which

647
00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:43.610
supplies the directionality of representations because you can have

648
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.929
surrogate um inferences that are valid to very many

649
00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:51.149
indiscriminate number of target systems, but we typically only

650
00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:54.120
select one. And so it has to be supplemented

651
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.010
with something I call force, which is the way

652
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.000
in which uh scientists would select in the practice

653
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.469
a particular given target for the source. Um, ONCE

654
00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:06.350
you have both of these features instantiated in a,

655
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.110
in a practice, in a scientific practice, you are

656
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:14.229
in a sense studying, uh, modeling practice, um, because

657
00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:17.090
those are the only two necessary conditions that would,

658
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.729
um, turn, uh, a piece of or an activity,

659
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:26.550
um, in science into a modeling activity. So, so

660
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.790
this is in essence the inference of conception. It

661
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.969
is the kind of deflationary approach. To the notion

662
00:41:31.969 --> 00:41:36.469
of representation that locates um as a universal component

663
00:41:36.469 --> 00:41:40.459
of the practice of model building and representing this

664
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.209
um activity of inference drawing um of of a

665
00:41:45.209 --> 00:41:51.409
surrogate surative kind between sources and intended targets.

666
00:41:52.439 --> 00:41:56.570
Mhm. I have one last question then, one last

667
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.989
topic I'd like to explore here. How does an

668
00:41:59.989 --> 00:42:06.929
exploration of scientific representation connect to debates on artistic

669
00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:07.770
representation?

670
00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:13.689
Yeah, yes, I mean, I, I think there's definitely

671
00:42:13.689 --> 00:42:18.219
a connection. Um, AND moreover, I defend him in

672
00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:20.510
my book that this is a connection that philosophers

673
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.239
of science. SHOULD be concerned with and should pay

674
00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:29.219
attention, handsome attention to. And I mount an argument

675
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:32.139
for this, and it is one strong conviction of

676
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:36.949
mine. And in fact, I plan to do more

677
00:42:36.949 --> 00:42:40.580
work on this in the future. Um, THAT philosophers

678
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.540
of science have a lot to learn from philosophers

679
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.739
of art. And now, As you can imagine, this

680
00:42:46.739 --> 00:42:53.120
is slightly contentious because Philosophers of science would like

681
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.989
to think that they are more important than than

682
00:42:58.989 --> 00:43:02.389
other philosophers and to be told that they have

683
00:43:02.389 --> 00:43:04.510
to pay attention to what philosophers of art have

684
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.350
been doing for 50 years is to be told

685
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.709
that they maybe haven't been paying attention to the

686
00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:12.510
right topics, but I think this is actually true,

687
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.989
and I, I, I, I. I think this goes

688
00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:18.189
back to something that we discussed at the beginning

689
00:43:18.189 --> 00:43:23.239
of the interview, which is that Um for different

690
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:27.000
contingent historical reasons, I think philosophers of science were

691
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.389
not very preoccupied with the notion of representation for

692
00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:32.000
a long time. Um AND in particular in the

693
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.250
70s and 80s, there was a scant. Philosophical attention

694
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.889
paid in philosophy of science circles to this notion.

695
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.719
While simultaneously there was an explosion of work in

696
00:43:42.719 --> 00:43:46.429
the philosophy of art. Which was then a nascent

697
00:43:46.429 --> 00:43:50.169
and growing field of philosophy. Uh, ALL of it

698
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:53.409
was centered around the notion of representation. Uh, SO,

699
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.550
so I think in some ways philosophers of art

700
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.229
have been marching ahead of us, philosophers of science

701
00:43:58.649 --> 00:44:01.780
in the analysis of representation, and then not surprisingly,

702
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.290
there are quite a number of lessons that we

703
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.080
can pick up from work that was done in

704
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.610
the philosophy of art, um, decades ago and has

705
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.010
been done for some time, and I tried to

706
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.590
do that in, in, in the chapter number 8

707
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.649
in, in my book that Last, the one but

708
00:44:21.649 --> 00:44:25.750
last uh chapter in the book but I um

709
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:30.719
I go into an in-depth analysis of what philosophers

710
00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:34.050
of art have been saying about representation over the

711
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.310
years, and I try to come up with some

712
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.639
phenomenological lessons for how to understand the practice, um,

713
00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:42.570
from the point of view of the notions of

714
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.699
representation that philosophers of art. I have discussed and,

715
00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:50.280
and I find some very convincing leads there, um,

716
00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.189
on ways to inform my own account of scientific

717
00:44:53.189 --> 00:44:57.090
representation. In the work of some prominent and leading

718
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.979
philosophers of art over the last 50 years or

719
00:44:59.979 --> 00:45:04.320
so. And this comes to show that representation is

720
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.580
a Very wide concept in our cognitive lives. It

721
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.860
doesn't just play a role in science. It plays

722
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.379
a role in many other areas of our cognitive

723
00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:17.899
life. It plays a role, prominent role I think

724
00:45:17.899 --> 00:45:23.600
in other aspects. And areas of our culture. Science

725
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.469
is a part of culture, but it's a small

726
00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:30.030
part of culture. And um there's literature, the, the

727
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:34.000
arts which play a very important role in our

728
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.239
culture and in our cognitive lives, and I think

729
00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:40.100
the concept of representation is just as central there

730
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:43.040
as it is in science and my account has

731
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.929
a virtue. That are placed generally across. The field,

732
00:45:47.989 --> 00:45:51.110
but in order to apply it to artistic representation,

733
00:45:51.189 --> 00:45:53.989
I have to fill in the notion of surrogative

734
00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:58.830
inference and representational force, um, in different ways to

735
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:03.189
account for this phenomenological descriptions that philosophers of art

736
00:46:03.189 --> 00:46:05.860
have been giving us for 40 and 50 years,

737
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:10.149
which I find so insightful and interesting also for

738
00:46:10.149 --> 00:46:13.389
a philosopher of, of science. So, uh yes, I

739
00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:16.000
think there is a connection. Uh, I've done a

740
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.070
lot over the last 20 years to argue, um,

741
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.459
that philosophers of science should pay attention to this

742
00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:26.439
connection, and that it makes us better philosophers of

743
00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:29.270
science when we do. Uh, AT least when it

744
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:32.500
comes to understanding the concept of representation and how

745
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.669
modeling in science works. It gives us tools and

746
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:38.510
resources as philosophers of science that we can then

747
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.500
put to work, um, and I, as I mentioned,

748
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.469
I take some of those tools and resources from

749
00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:47.989
the phenomenological tradition in the philosophy of art and

750
00:46:47.989 --> 00:46:50.949
apply them to the study of the practice of

751
00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:53.110
modeling in that chapter, and I, I think that's

752
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.110
one of the chapters that I feel most proud

753
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:58.189
about because I think what I do there is

754
00:46:58.189 --> 00:47:02.699
definitely very original, and I think it's Uh, breaking

755
00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:04.540
new ground, and I think that new ground really

756
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.979
deserves to be explored, um, and I, I, I

757
00:47:07.979 --> 00:47:10.139
intend to do it in the future. I'm not

758
00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:11.340
the only one. I mean I it has to

759
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.540
be said that there are other philosophers of science

760
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.129
who have been making similar claims. Last 20 years

761
00:47:18.129 --> 00:47:21.129
and where we may have been regarded as a

762
00:47:21.129 --> 00:47:24.889
minority or maybe even a, a bunch of eccentrics

763
00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:28.310
uh 20 years ago. I, I think it's now

764
00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:31.889
widely accepted that it pays to, to look at

765
00:47:31.889 --> 00:47:35.129
the concept of representation across different fields and that

766
00:47:35.129 --> 00:47:39.010
the study of how uh modeling may bear analogies

767
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:42.989
with what goes on in artistic representation. Uh, CAN

768
00:47:42.989 --> 00:47:45.709
be very fruitful for debates in the philosophy of

769
00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:48.389
science. So, so I, I think this is an

770
00:47:48.389 --> 00:47:52.030
argument that's still being made, but it's already carrying

771
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.189
some weight and has moved people towards considering at

772
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:59.479
least a legitimate area of study and And I,

773
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.979
uh, well, I take some pride in having, uh,

774
00:48:03.449 --> 00:48:06.090
worked hard to make this change possible and having

775
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:09.649
been part of this, uh. Reconsideration of the philosophy

776
00:48:09.649 --> 00:48:12.129
of art within the philosophy of science. I think

777
00:48:12.129 --> 00:48:15.189
it's still a very promising area of research.

778
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.899
Great. So the book is again Inference and Representation,

779
00:48:20.909 --> 00:48:23.899
A Study in Modeling Science. I, of course, will

780
00:48:23.899 --> 00:48:26.270
be leaving a link to it in the description

781
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.949
of the interview. And Doctor Suarez, just before we

782
00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:32.469
go, apart from the book, would you like to

783
00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:35.429
tell people where they can find your work on

784
00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:36.110
the internet?

785
00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:41.469
Yes. So, um, I have a personal web page

786
00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:45.979
which is probably the, uh, most complete source of

787
00:48:45.979 --> 00:48:48.479
at least my most up to-date ideas and work.

788
00:48:48.979 --> 00:48:52.620
Um, AND I'm also listed in different kinds of

789
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.189
repositories. There's an institutional page for me at Complutense.

790
00:48:56.939 --> 00:48:59.459
Um, FOR a very long time now, I've been

791
00:48:59.459 --> 00:49:04.449
putting my work in, in open access repositories. Um,

792
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.239
And nowadays I try to get my work to

793
00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:10.919
be published open access. Unfortunately, the book for Chicago

794
00:49:10.919 --> 00:49:14.919
is not open access, um, but, uh, different bits

795
00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:17.399
of it are accessible and of course I'd be

796
00:49:17.399 --> 00:49:22.479
quite happy, um, to respond to any request personally

797
00:49:22.479 --> 00:49:25.350
and send, uh, a PDF copy of my book

798
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:28.199
or parts of my book as requested. If people

799
00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:30.100
do just send me an email.

800
00:49:30.919 --> 00:49:33.429
Thank you. So thank you so much for taking

801
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.270
the time to come on the show. It's been

802
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.129
a real pleasure to talk with you.

803
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:41.250
Yes, well, thank you, Ricardo. I'm very pleased to

804
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.229
finally have made it, um, into the dissenter. I,

805
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:47.070
by the way, I want to congratulate you on

806
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:51.350
the name, um, the dissenter. I, I, I feel

807
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:53.830
there is a lot of philosophical value in dissent.

808
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.929
And I've always tried to practice it. um, SO

809
00:49:57.929 --> 00:50:01.330
I was uh very taken by the name of

810
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.889
your podcast and I'm glad that we finally made

811
00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:05.879
it. It took us some time to arrange this,

812
00:50:06.189 --> 00:50:08.050
but thank you for having me. Thank you very

813
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:08.429
much.
