00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.119
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.239
today I'm joined by Dr. Michael Hudson. He's a

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.000
return guest, and today we're talking about his book

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.190
Temples of Enterprise Creating Economic Order in the Bronze

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.319
Age Near East. So Doctor Hudson, welcome back to

7
00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:23.120
the show. It's always a pleasure to talk

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.020
with you. Thanks for having me, Ricardo.

9
00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.940
OK, so what do we know about the origins

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.490
of the economy in the ancient Near East, and

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.930
why did you get interested in the ancient Near

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.810
East specifically?

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.240
Well, there are two completely separate questions. Maybe I

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.040
ought to say why I got interested first, because

15
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.770
that shows you what I'm looking for. Uh, BEFORE

16
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.810
I, uh, began to read about the ancient Near

17
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.909
East around 1980. I'd worked for 20 years in

18
00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.389
financial analysis of debt. And I'd been warning that

19
00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:03.259
the debts of third world countries, the global South,

20
00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.489
couldn't be paid. And then I was tracing how

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.389
the debt trends of the United States economy and

22
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.989
other economies in the end couldn't be paid. And

23
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:17.190
it was obvious for me that there was going

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.550
to have to be a debt write-down of global

25
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.470
South debts, especially of Latin America. And in 1979,

26
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.370
uh there was a UNITAR meeting. I was working

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.000
for the United Nations Institute for Training and Research.

28
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.989
And uh the meeting was basically on North-South relations,

29
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.069
and I explained, explained how there was no way

30
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.809
that Latin America could pay its existing debts and

31
00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:46.089
there was going to have to be uh a

32
00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.290
break in the chain of payments in a few

33
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.690
years. Well, there was a riot, literally a riot

34
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.610
at the meeting. The US rapporteur was, I think,

35
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.629
a government uh intelligence plot and uh misrepresented. My

36
00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:05.010
statement to say, uh, Professor Hudson has just studied

37
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.210
debt and uh analyzes how it can be paid,

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.570
and I stood up and said that uh there's

39
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.869
no, I analyzed how it could not be paid,

40
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.809
now it could be paid, uh, and the very

41
00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.449
forecast of saying how much was going to be

42
00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.710
owed when you compare it to the earning power

43
00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.380
of Latin America and other countries for exports and

44
00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.119
uh remittances and all of their other balance of

45
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:35.029
payments. Uh, ESSENTIALLY couldn't be paid. Well, the controversy

46
00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.899
over that. Uh, AND as you know, uh, 3

47
00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.589
years later in 1982, Mexico started the whole Latin

48
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.970
American debt bond by, uh, defaulting on its teso

49
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.449
boos, it's uh short-term government debt. Well, I became,

50
00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:54.550
uh, by 1980, uh, 1, interested in writing a

51
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.350
history of how societies had handled their inability to

52
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.830
pay debt. And I'd, um, in, in about two

53
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.029
years, 1982, 1983, I'd gone back through medieval Europe

54
00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.410
and uh through the biblical times, and I'd found

55
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.660
references to Near Eastern uh anticipations of the Jubilee

56
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.149
year, uh, and debt writes down, writedowns, but I

57
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.610
couldn't really find very much of this, so I

58
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.210
uh took the sources that I could find from

59
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.100
Hammurabi's debt cancellations and others. And uh a friend

60
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.800
of mine who was a uh colleague at Harvard

61
00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.860
brought me up to Harvard and they uh appointed

62
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.860
me a post, a fellow in Babylonian archaeology. So

63
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.070
I spent, uh, basically I changed positions from, or

64
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.690
changed my focus of studies from being an economist,

65
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.229
warning that debts couldn't be paid, and this was

66
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.869
in the 1980s when there was no chance at

67
00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.289
all of people accepting this idea, uh, to study

68
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:10.179
archaeology and Assyriology. And uh finally, in 1994, uh,

69
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.389
we decided at Harvard to uh organize. An economic

70
00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.178
history of the ancient Near East that uh uh

71
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:21.579
I, I found that the ancient Near East, Mesopotamia,

72
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.329
Egypt, the other Bronze Age societies in the 3rd

73
00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:30.149
and 2nd and 1st millennium were so different from

74
00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:36.690
today's world that economists had avoided looking at antiquity

75
00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:40.714
because it seemed as if civilization Couldn't possibly have

76
00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:44.114
started this way. This is not how Margaret Thatcher

77
00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:47.075
and Milton Friedman would have started a civilization if

78
00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:49.755
they would have gone back and advised that it

79
00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:53.315
is, is how to develop. Uh, AND so we

80
00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:57.274
uh began to write a history of uh uh

81
00:04:57.274 --> 00:05:01.984
public-private relations, of land tenure, uh, and most of

82
00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:06.720
all, money and debt. And so, uh, basically, uh

83
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.899
and that entailed, well, the origin of money was

84
00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:15.739
in cost accounting by the temples, and the role

85
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.940
of money was not the way the Austrian right

86
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.899
wingers or the opponents of socialism had said money

87
00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.790
is uh to settle barter, uh, we found that

88
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.329
Uh, uh, money was, uh, basically used to pay

89
00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:37.709
debts, and that economists generally have not distinguished between

90
00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:43.049
credit and money. Uh, DURING the crop year in

91
00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:47.320
Mesopotamia, uh, all the way from the 3rd millennium

92
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.470
BC down to medieval Europe, uh, cultivators would, uh,

93
00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:56.730
run into debt during, uh, the year for various

94
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.774
exchanges. Expenses, uh, in, in Babylonia, this included running

95
00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:04.285
up a bill at the ale house, uh, for

96
00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:08.515
ale, it would include hiring priests to officiate at

97
00:06:08.654 --> 00:06:13.214
public ceremonies. Well, all these, uh, this exchange on

98
00:06:13.214 --> 00:06:18.734
credit, uh, basically had to be settled at one

99
00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:22.714
point of the year, at harvest time, when the

100
00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:25.614
crop was in and it was weighed out on

101
00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:29.980
the threshing floor. And uh that's when uh the,

102
00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:34.049
the debts are denominated in grain for the agrarian

103
00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:38.000
sector. Uh, I'll get, and uh silver for the

104
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.160
trade sector, uh, and so the money was for

105
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.640
paying these debts, and the denominations of money were

106
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.440
set in grain, uh, essentially we found by the

107
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.279
temples that had measured grain in terms of what

108
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.799
they had to distribute to the labor force. Uh,

109
00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:05.010
THAT, uh, was employed mainly weaving textiles that were

110
00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:11.839
consigned to private merchants to, uh, travel to Turkey,

111
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.880
to the, uh, to, to what is now Persia,

112
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.609
uh, various countries to obtain the metals and the

113
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.100
stone that wasn't available in Mesopotamians soils. And at

114
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.660
the time that I wrote, uh, there, there was

115
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.579
a, a general belief that, well, all of this

116
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:38.010
is fictitious. Not only did were the Judaic uh

117
00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:42.700
uh jubilee not uh uh ever really enacted, it

118
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.500
was claimed, but all this uh Near Eastern debt

119
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.299
cancellations couldn't possibly have occurred the way uh they

120
00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:54.589
occurred. Uh. Because there would have been a collapse.

121
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.709
Well, basically, here's the problem that Mesopotamia and all

122
00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:03.429
the Near Eastern neighbors face. As I said, the

123
00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:05.230
debts at the end of the year, you paid

124
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.869
in money by measuring out the crops on the

125
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:11.910
threshing floor. Well, what do you do when the

126
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.190
crops failed? What do you do if there was

127
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.529
a drought or a flood or a military disturbance?

128
00:08:18.989 --> 00:08:24.109
Well, At that time, uh, you had a choice,

129
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.410
and the modern solution would be, well, if a

130
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.589
debt can't be paid, then the creditor gets to

131
00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:36.650
uh reduce, to take the property of the debt.

132
00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:41.195
And reduce them to debt bondage has occurred in

133
00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:43.955
classical Greece and Rome and end up taking the

134
00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:47.755
land in payment, uh, that's the sanctity of private

135
00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:51.474
property is the sanctity of the creditor to deprive

136
00:08:51.474 --> 00:08:55.200
debtors of their private property. This did not occur

137
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.260
in Mesopotamia anywhere, uh, uh, or on a permanent

138
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.700
basis. Obviously, if a a debtor had run up

139
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.099
a debt very often to a member of the

140
00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:08.780
temple bureaucracy, he had to work it off, uh,

141
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.479
and that could be anywhere from, uh, giving him

142
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:17.400
the crop. To, uh, working on his land, to,

143
00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:21.359
to harvest, to, uh, outright bondage, if, uh, the

144
00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:24.469
creditor would pledge his wife or his daughter, uh,

145
00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:27.979
as a, uh, house servant, uh, to the creditor.

146
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.760
Well, this, uh, was not, if that would have

147
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.400
happened on a very large scale, society couldn't have

148
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.940
taken off because very soon, Yeah, uh, what you

149
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.539
saw at the end of the Roman Empire, where

150
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:48.359
the whole, uh, economy was, uh, population was turned

151
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:52.559
into serfs, uh, and serfdom, uh, that would have

152
00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:56.299
stifled their development right there because in the 3rd

153
00:09:56.299 --> 00:10:01.380
millennium, 2nd millennium, the scarce labor, the scarce factor

154
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.859
of production in antiquity was labor. There was plenty

155
00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:07.809
of land. Uh, THE problem is, how do you

156
00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:13.140
irrigate it, how do you, uh, divide it and

157
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.049
allocate it? How do you give cities? So, uh,

158
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.609
this led me, you asked me what got me

159
00:10:19.609 --> 00:10:23.049
interested into it, what got me interested, uh, in

160
00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:27.090
was, uh, how, why debts were canceled, and that

161
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.869
led me to say, well, how did debts develop

162
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.460
and who canceled the debts and How was society

163
00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:39.000
organized so that when you canceled debts, it was

164
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.599
resilient and grew instead of collapsing. That's uh the

165
00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:47.719
big picture. Well, the, the rulers of, uh, every

166
00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:51.679
ruler of Hammurabi's dynasty, we found out, the Sumerian

167
00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:56.309
rulers before him and the other Near Eastern rulers

168
00:10:56.309 --> 00:10:58.679
uh elsewhere in the Near East all the way

169
00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:04.090
down to Egypt. Uh, PERIODICALLY, uh, canceled debts when

170
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.409
a new ruler took the throne. They would restore

171
00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:10.799
order and, uh, they wanted to take, begin their

172
00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:13.969
rule with an economy in, in good order, so

173
00:11:13.969 --> 00:11:16.289
they would know all of the debts that had

174
00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:20.979
been accumulated. They'd free the debt bond servants that

175
00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:24.840
had been reduced to bondage, they'd return any land

176
00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:28.919
that had been forfeited. Uh, THIS survived not only

177
00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:34.979
in the Judaic Jubilee year of Leviticus 25, but

178
00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:39.299
also in Europe into all the modern times when

179
00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.419
kings of Poland or Central European countries would take

180
00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:48.349
the kingship, they'd often free the prisoners. Uh, ESPECIALLY

181
00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:52.109
because, uh, prisoners were put in by the preceding

182
00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:55.590
king, uh, and, uh, that would be, I'm, I'm

183
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.049
going to rule in peace, let's all, uh, be,

184
00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:03.650
uh, 11, happy, uh, community. Well, the reason that,

185
00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:07.719
uh, Babylonian and Sumerian and other Near Eastern rulers

186
00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:11.940
canceled the debts, uh, was if they didn't. The

187
00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:14.960
population would have run away. Flight was a big

188
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.039
element of uh uh uh of recourse for populations

189
00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:23.520
who are indebted, and if you did not cancel

190
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.520
the debts, if you did not guarantee everyone their

191
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.119
land, then you would uh find yourself either overthrown

192
00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:36.000
or depopulated. Well, that led me uh and the

193
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.219
group into uh deciding, well, how, how, how do

194
00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:43.630
we decide who got How much land. And we

195
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.570
found that already by the late Stone Age, apparently,

196
00:12:47.869 --> 00:12:53.909
um you had communities expanding out and uh they

197
00:12:53.909 --> 00:13:00.849
basically would Assign standardized plots of land to the

198
00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:04.140
citizenry at large, and they, the size of the

199
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.979
land and the conditions of land tenure would be,

200
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.380
we're going to assign you this land, but in

201
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.619
exchange, you're going to have to, you owe the

202
00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:18.580
community certain basic public services as the condition of

203
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.700
holding this land. Number one, you have to serve

204
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.929
in the army. Number 2, you have to work

205
00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:29.469
on Corvet labor, that is infrastructure projects. Uh, YOU

206
00:13:29.469 --> 00:13:32.349
might have locally, you might have to help dig

207
00:13:32.349 --> 00:13:36.489
canals, uh, but, uh, you might have to build

208
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.849
walls around the cities so that Uh, nomads couldn't

209
00:13:41.849 --> 00:13:45.849
attack you. You might help build temple foundations or

210
00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:49.669
temples, or you might help build palaces. We have,

211
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.119
uh, the inscriptions that are buried in walls, uh,

212
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.450
explaining, you know, how these were done, and The

213
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.969
question is, well, uh, were land, how were landowners,

214
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.809
uh, the, the peasantry, as you would call them

215
00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:11.890
today, um, did, did they accept all this? Well,

216
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.809
we found out, uh, largely from Egyptian records, uh,

217
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.679
from building the pyramids and other records that, uh,

218
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.210
the, these, uh, infrastructure projects, you have, uh, many

219
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.424
cylinder seals and In, uh, Babylonia, uh, and Sumer

220
00:14:29.424 --> 00:14:34.265
about rulers carrying big baskets of, uh, dirt on

221
00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:37.854
their head for excavating projects, uh, and you have,

222
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:42.265
and whole masses of citizens carrying things on their

223
00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:46.625
heads. It was hard work doing construction labor. Nobody

224
00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:49.224
likes doing it today, that's why it's left to

225
00:14:49.224 --> 00:14:53.719
immigrants in America. Before they were expelled earlier in

226
00:14:53.719 --> 00:14:57.239
the year. Uh, THEY, uh, er, but it turns

227
00:14:57.239 --> 00:15:01.520
out that, uh, these were great socializing projects. For

228
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.239
one thing, we know that the government provided enormous

229
00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:08.559
amounts of beer at these festivals. Uh, THEY fed

230
00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:11.289
the people. Not only did they feed them beer,

231
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.239
but they had great feasts, and it was at

232
00:15:14.239 --> 00:15:18.614
these feasts that The uh Near Easterners uh had

233
00:15:18.614 --> 00:15:21.375
their major uh times of year when they ate

234
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:25.405
meat. Uh, NORMALLY the family would live on a

235
00:15:25.405 --> 00:15:30.455
very healthy plant-based diet, but it wouldn't, wouldn't entail

236
00:15:30.455 --> 00:15:33.364
meat. So, we found the whole organization of land

237
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:38.094
tenure. Uh, IT was taxes that created the definition

238
00:15:38.094 --> 00:15:40.969
of and conditions of land tenure. And it was

239
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:44.090
the preservation of this land tenure that led rulers

240
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.849
to say, well, uh, we, uh, if, if the

241
00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:51.799
crops fail and the cultivators cannot pay the creditors,

242
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.690
uh, we certainly don't want them to end up

243
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.710
as bond servants to the creditors because then They

244
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.349
couldn't serve in the army, and they'd be working

245
00:16:02.349 --> 00:16:05.669
the creditors' land or in their houses, not on

246
00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:09.109
building public projects. So, you had a kind of

247
00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:13.469
bifurcated economy, you had the economy of the large

248
00:16:13.469 --> 00:16:16.469
institutions, the palace and the temples on the one

249
00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:22.609
hand, uh, and The uh agrarian sector uh uh

250
00:16:22.609 --> 00:16:27.450
cultivators on the other, and the, uh, the agrarian

251
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.890
sector would provide labor, often war widows or war

252
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.969
orphans, to the temples or palaces to work in

253
00:16:34.969 --> 00:16:38.409
the weaving workshops, and uh they'd produce, buy the

254
00:16:38.409 --> 00:16:43.289
textiles, and uh these textiles. WERE turned into the

255
00:16:43.289 --> 00:16:50.330
economic surplus of Mesopotamia and other countries by being

256
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.130
consigned to merchants, many of them private, some may

257
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.169
have worked also for the temples, we're not exactly

258
00:16:57.169 --> 00:17:00.390
sure, and uh they'd be advanced to the traders,

259
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.699
and uh the traders would have to, uh, in,

260
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.290
in 5 years, they would have to return double

261
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.058
the amount of money. Uh, THAT was lent. Well,

262
00:17:11.178 --> 00:17:13.688
that was the origin of interest rates. We found

263
00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:16.659
out that interest rates did not reflect supply and

264
00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:21.968
demand, but were standardized for century after century, for

265
00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:25.298
over, over 1000 years, uh, and they were, the,

266
00:17:25.499 --> 00:17:30.119
they were standardized for money that was, uh, transactions

267
00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:35.170
that were done between the large institutions. And the

268
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.609
rest of the economy at large. The large institutions,

269
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.069
uh, because they were the institutions, uh, creating and

270
00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:48.209
monetizing the economic surplus with foreign aid, kept their

271
00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:53.089
accounts in silver. The uh agrarian economy was based

272
00:17:53.089 --> 00:17:56.020
on the land and the crops and, and grain

273
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.510
because that's what was, what was grown. And in

274
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.910
order to make a balance sheet and an income

275
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.589
and expense statement of the temples, you needed to

276
00:18:04.589 --> 00:18:09.630
consolidate foreign trade and uh domestic production and uh

277
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.079
so you had to buy monetary standard of Of,

278
00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:19.239
uh, setting a unit of, uh, uh, grain is

279
00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:23.170
equal to one shekel of silver, and, uh, this

280
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:28.160
fixed unit, uh, the exchange rate between grain and

281
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.680
silver was standardized again for uh the, the certainly

282
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.479
the duration of a king's reign and pretty much

283
00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:41.119
over time, uh, but it only uh related to

284
00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:47.459
transactions. Between the economy at large and the large

285
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:51.219
institutions. In other words, what gave money its value

286
00:18:51.219 --> 00:18:55.160
was its acceptance by the large by the government,

287
00:18:55.439 --> 00:18:58.890
by the palace, the palatial economy for payment of

288
00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:04.800
Either taxes or debts or uh transactions with it,

289
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.640
just like modern monetary theory uh explains and uh

290
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.479
that uh we, we created this, this picture of

291
00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:21.160
an economy, you, you couldn't call it a democracy

292
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.920
because nobody voted for the ruler, you couldn't call

293
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.670
it an oligarchy. Uh, BECAUSE the object of rulers

294
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.410
was to prevent a creditor oligarchy from evolving as

295
00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:37.829
developed in, uh, uh, Greece and Rome in classical

296
00:19:37.829 --> 00:19:42.270
times. Maybe you could call it agrarian socialism. Nobody's

297
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.719
figured out an acceptable term for it, but at

298
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:49.949
any rate, uh, uh, we, uh, we created, uh,

299
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.689
rewrote the Uh, I shouldn't say rewrote, we wrote

300
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.349
the first economic history of the ancient Near East

301
00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:01.310
in the five, colloquium volumes that I edited between

302
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:06.109
1994 and I think, uh, 2008, and the Temples

303
00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:10.510
of Enterprise, uh, uh book that uh led you

304
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.430
to have this, uh, discussion are the collected articles

305
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.589
that I wrote on this during these years, uh,

306
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:24.035
explaining how Interest rates originated, why they differed from

307
00:20:24.035 --> 00:20:27.734
one, you know, from Mesopotamia to Greece and Rome,

308
00:20:28.295 --> 00:20:32.675
how land was distributed, how money was used to

309
00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:37.074
settle credit balances, why the temples created money instead

310
00:20:37.074 --> 00:20:42.814
of private, just private individual merchants creating their own

311
00:20:43.635 --> 00:20:46.829
pieces of silver for exchange. Well, that's my answer

312
00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.630
to the question, and when you ask why did

313
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.349
you do something, it's like a, a lawyer is

314
00:20:51.349 --> 00:20:54.859
told in, in court, never ask why, because it

315
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:58.829
means that the er er the person, you're the

316
00:20:58.829 --> 00:21:01.750
witness can say whatever they want. And the judge

317
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.310
can't overrule it and say, well, you asked him

318
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.469
that, we won't, we won't exclude that. So you

319
00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:10.510
ask me, maybe if you ask more specific questions

320
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.109
on the big picture that I described, we can

321
00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:16.150
get more specific.

322
00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:19.199
Yes, of course, we're going to break down many

323
00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:22.199
of the things you said there. Let me ask

324
00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:25.920
you specifically about the origins of money because I

325
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.959
think that's a very interesting topic also to explore

326
00:21:28.959 --> 00:21:34.359
here because we very commonly hear from this sort

327
00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:40.329
of Anti-government mythology, uh, people who have a take

328
00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:45.229
on the origins of money based on barter without

329
00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:50.310
that or public institutions playing a significant role. What

330
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.969
do you make of that kind of take?

331
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.900
What, what do I make of, of, of the

332
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.140
Austrian theory? Uh, THE whole idea of the Austrian

333
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.619
theory was, uh, to fight, uh, it was developed

334
00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:07.900
in the late 19th century, uh, by Menger, and

335
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.020
the whole idea was they hated government. There was

336
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.459
a class war in Vienna, especially, they, there was

337
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:18.859
fighting in the street. Uh, THE uh, the, the

338
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:23.161
whole dynamic of industrial capitalism was to, uh, Uh,

339
00:22:24.352 --> 00:22:28.462
have an increasing role of government in providing for,

340
00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:33.572
uh, basic, uh, services and needs that otherwise would

341
00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:39.151
be monopolized for, uh, transportation, for communications, and of

342
00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:42.891
course for healthcare, education. All of these are provided

343
00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:46.991
by government so that you would minimize the cost

344
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:50.803
that employees. HAD to pay for these, using these

345
00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:56.563
services, which would have required the industrial capitalists to

346
00:22:56.563 --> 00:22:59.644
pay higher wages, and if the government did not

347
00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:04.703
subsidize these services, uh, including housing, that uh workers

348
00:23:04.703 --> 00:23:08.803
uh needed to uh pay uh in order to

349
00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:13.235
live, then the, uh, the, the, these industrialists. COULD

350
00:23:13.235 --> 00:23:16.635
not afford to compete with those of other countries

351
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:20.806
that had a govern, uh, a capitalism evolving into

352
00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:26.095
socialism. Well, the, the whole basis of classical political

353
00:23:26.095 --> 00:23:31.255
economy from Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Marx, and

354
00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:34.156
the whole rest of the 19th century was based

355
00:23:34.156 --> 00:23:39.089
on a value theory, uh, this isolating. Economic rent

356
00:23:39.089 --> 00:23:42.849
is unearned income. The whole political fight of the

357
00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:47.089
19th century from Britain, France, all over Europe was

358
00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:51.869
uh to prevent uh the landlord class from controlling

359
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:57.839
the economy and protecting itself, increasing food prices, uh,

360
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.770
and, uh, obtaining higher and higher land rent that

361
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.849
would raise the cost of living. And make labor

362
00:24:07.069 --> 00:24:13.500
unemployable by industrialists and David Ricardo in his principles

363
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.689
of Political Economy in 1817 and explained how if

364
00:24:19.689 --> 00:24:26.349
you don't reform parliament and take away the land.

365
00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:31.142
Lord's ability to control the economy, then uh and

366
00:24:31.142 --> 00:24:35.003
adopt free trade so that uh Britain could import

367
00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:37.772
its food at a low enough price to keep

368
00:24:37.772 --> 00:24:41.822
British wages low, so that, uh, industrialists could compete.

369
00:24:42.133 --> 00:24:46.782
Well, then you, you'd uh uh have uh profits

370
00:24:46.782 --> 00:24:50.696
being stifled. By the rent recipient. So all of

371
00:24:50.696 --> 00:24:52.245
Europe said we've got to get rid of the

372
00:24:52.245 --> 00:24:56.276
aristocracy and it's, it's charges like a, a tax,

373
00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:58.475
and we have, and uh that was the fight.

374
00:24:59.015 --> 00:25:03.816
Well, the uh the not only the landlords fought

375
00:25:03.816 --> 00:25:07.936
back, but uh there were monopolies that were created

376
00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:11.880
under feudalism. Largely by the financial class of bankers

377
00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:16.439
that helped kings create uh monopolies of foreign trade

378
00:25:16.439 --> 00:25:21.939
and er other er basic uh privileges, special privileges

379
00:25:22.369 --> 00:25:25.800
that er would give them the income to pay

380
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.089
the war debts er that they ran ran up.

381
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.540
Well, the Austrians wanted to keep the protect the

382
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.829
monopolies, Protect the landowners and especially to protect the

383
00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:40.780
bankers. Uh, uh, THEY wanted to protect every form

384
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.209
of economic rent that Adam Smith and the classical

385
00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:49.670
economists opposed, the land rent, monopoly rent, and interest

386
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.689
charges. And so they, uh, they tried to create

387
00:25:53.689 --> 00:25:59.839
a narrative that denied and erased the entire Origins

388
00:25:59.839 --> 00:26:04.319
of economic origins of civilization. They said government can

389
00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:10.540
only be negative. Government and public institutions, palaces, temples

390
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.540
have no productive role to play, and in fact,

391
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.040
from the very beginning, economics took off purely by

392
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.119
merchants and private enterprise, by greedy people that wanted

393
00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:25.170
to make money. Uh, BY exploiting other people, and

394
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.010
fortunately they were able to exploit other people and

395
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.810
amass huge fortunes, and that's what's helped civilization grow.

396
00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:36.089
This was the Austrian attack on civilization and uh

397
00:26:36.089 --> 00:26:40.569
the that attack that in America, you had exactly

398
00:26:40.569 --> 00:26:46.420
the same anti-classical reaction by uh JB Clark here,

399
00:26:46.689 --> 00:26:52.349
my uh. In my economic books, I've described this,

400
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.650
uh, uh, in, in various books, uh, Killing the

401
00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:03.780
Host especially. Well, uh, the The rontiers, that, uh,

402
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.170
rent, the landlords and bankers fought back and they,

403
00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:13.859
uh, subsidized universities and they actually have Erased the

404
00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:20.219
entire economic theory of the free market economists of

405
00:27:20.219 --> 00:27:24.000
the 19th century. That's not in the United States,

406
00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:28.540
there's no longer the history of economic thought being

407
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:33.540
taught in the standard economic curriculum, and there's no

408
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.020
economic history being taught. At least when I went

409
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.780
to school in the 1960s for my PhD in

410
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.140
economics, there were courses like this. They've all been

411
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.459
replaced simply by mathematics courses or uh by everything

412
00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:55.020
except economic history because according to if uh the

413
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.660
economic model, civilization could not have taken off. It

414
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:05.859
could not have originated. Civilization. WOULD have been impossible

415
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.770
unless it followed today's rules that very quickly would

416
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.959
have stifled its growth immediately. It would have turned

417
00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:17.959
into the decline of the Roman Empire in the

418
00:28:17.959 --> 00:28:21.739
1st 50 years of its existence, uh, basically. Uh,

419
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.739
AND so, uh, basically I, I stopped uh having

420
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.550
much interest in Today's economic, uh, orthodoxy because, uh,

421
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.069
I, I got much, I became an economic historian

422
00:28:38.189 --> 00:28:44.599
and uh uh the and archaeologist and anthropologist, uh,

423
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.790
all of the anthropology studies show that uh uh

424
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:56.010
surviving small local communities. HAVE not tried to encourage

425
00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.040
wealth accumulation because if you're a low surplus economy,

426
00:29:00.329 --> 00:29:03.170
like the Stone Age and the Bronze Age were,

427
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:09.650
you cannot afford large fortunes from being accumulated except

428
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.420
at the expense of other people. And if they're

429
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.640
accumulated at the expense of society as a whole,

430
00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:20.800
then the uh emerging oligarchy, the wealthy class, the

431
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.880
1% obtaining these fortunes would have prevented the economy

432
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.270
from taking off. And so, uh, the Bronze Age

433
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.489
succeeded in doing something that modern democracies and Western

434
00:29:36.489 --> 00:29:39.790
civilization has not been able to do, and that

435
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:44.609
is to prevent the development of an oligarchy and

436
00:29:44.609 --> 00:29:50.650
specifically a financial and land owning oligarchy from impoverishing

437
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.770
society. And uh deindustrializing it and uh and uh

438
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.329
stifling economic growth to a halt. That was its

439
00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:03.880
great contribution and that's why economists uh just uh

440
00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:11.229
exclude any thought of this economic history. From the,

441
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.349
from their curriculum and uh the Assyriologists and Egyptologists

442
00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:20.030
and other scholars who were members of my Harvard

443
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.750
group uh basically are have no interest in talking

444
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.510
to economists and at first they were Uh, hesitant

445
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:35.750
to have, uh, me and, uh, organizing, uh, the

446
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.520
whole set of colloquia that we had, but they,

447
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.599
they thought that I, they worried. That I was

448
00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:45.170
going to try to impose modern economic ideas on

449
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.079
them, and I said just the opposite. I want

450
00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:52.030
to find out how it was that these societies

451
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.040
were able to start by canceling the debts, by

452
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.920
redistributing the land, by distributing land in the first

453
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.040
place, by creating a monetary system in which debts

454
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.500
were denominated in the first place, and uh how,

455
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:11.589
how did this whole structure develop and What made

456
00:31:11.589 --> 00:31:15.790
Western civilization so different in after around the 8th

457
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.829
century BC?

458
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.979
And in regards to imposing modern concepts or modern

459
00:31:23.979 --> 00:31:33.020
ways of thinking in on onto ancient civilizations, earlier

460
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.319
you talked about the role of temples and palaces

461
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:43.489
in the ancient Near East. Were such institutions public?

462
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:48.729
Does the private public dichotomy work when talking about

463
00:31:49.189 --> 00:31:52.750
the institutions in the Bronze Age Near East?

464
00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:01.349
Uh, ARE you tell me again how you're, uh,

465
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.390
explain it in different words, the dichotomy, uh, you

466
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.310
mean the, uh, there, there were two sectors together.

467
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.670
For instance, many people thought that Hammurabi's laws were

468
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.699
a tax code. They weren't a tax code because

469
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:17.170
it, uh, the, uh, community on the land had

470
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.290
its own common law. Uh, BUT Hammurabi would have,

471
00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:25.430
uh, rules like an eye for an eye for

472
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.829
the tooth and the tooth. Well, was that really

473
00:32:27.829 --> 00:32:31.750
a law? We have many legal cases in, uh,

474
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.369
cuneiform documents on clay. Uh, WHERE there were injuries

475
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.709
by, uh, one person against others, and in no

476
00:32:39.709 --> 00:32:44.339
case was, uh, there a retaliation in kind for

477
00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:47.550
the injury. There was a fine, just as in

478
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.790
Indo-European societies there was V guilt type of fines.

479
00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:54.069
So if you cause an injury you had to

480
00:32:54.069 --> 00:32:58.589
pay. Well then, why, and it turns out this

481
00:32:58.589 --> 00:33:02.750
was not only medieval European, it was how The

482
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.189
whole world worked, uh, uh, certainly it's how the

483
00:33:06.189 --> 00:33:09.290
Near Eastern world worked. So how do you explain,

484
00:33:09.709 --> 00:33:14.969
uh, Hammurabi's laws? Well, they were specifically related to

485
00:33:15.189 --> 00:33:19.530
the palace economy and the temples in its relation

486
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.349
to the rest of the economy, and in the

487
00:33:22.349 --> 00:33:27.005
palace economy, The, the uh uh uh employees of

488
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.204
it were dependents. They were people that you, today

489
00:33:30.204 --> 00:33:33.244
you would call them welfare uh workers. Well, if

490
00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:35.885
you're on welfare, you don't have any money to

491
00:33:35.885 --> 00:33:39.464
pay the fine to compensate the person who you've

492
00:33:39.464 --> 00:33:42.564
injured by poking out his eye or breaking an

493
00:33:42.564 --> 00:33:46.239
arm, uh, or, or killing him. Uh, SO that,

494
00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:51.239
uh, Hammurabi, uh, had that principle as saying, well,

495
00:33:51.349 --> 00:33:54.040
if they don't have any money, then there's no

496
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.369
choice but to, uh, retaliate. Uh, GRADUALLY there was

497
00:33:59.369 --> 00:34:04.209
a reinterpretation. OF Hammurabi's laws and the laws of

498
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:10.030
all the rulers. The laws were uh basically for

499
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:15.649
relations between the palace and the, the self-sufficient economy

500
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.280
on the land. Uh, AND it, it was the

501
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:26.389
palace that essentially, uh, took the grain surplus, uh,

502
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:29.370
that was provided, uh, I, I won't say in

503
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.889
taxes, but in the various forms of payments, including

504
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.250
the advance of sharecropping land, the rents that they

505
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.649
owed, the various service payments they owed to the

506
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:43.310
government, uh, that were settled in, in grain money.

507
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.612
The, the, they use this to Support uh an

508
00:34:47.612 --> 00:34:51.011
institutional labor force to make the exports to uh

509
00:34:51.011 --> 00:34:55.641
obtain the uh foreign raw materials including silver. That

510
00:34:55.641 --> 00:35:00.312
was valued apparently because of its use in religious,

511
00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:05.241
uh, uh for religion as a, a sanctified metal,

512
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:09.211
which is why the, uh, the, the temples were

513
00:35:09.211 --> 00:35:12.251
the key of providing, uh, silver. I think one

514
00:35:12.251 --> 00:35:16.283
of your questions. WAS, uh, no, why, uh, how,

515
00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:19.053
how was, how the money produced? Well, and the

516
00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:23.573
Austrians said, you know, the the governments, uh, degrade

517
00:35:23.573 --> 00:35:26.573
money, you know, they run deficits and uh they

518
00:35:26.573 --> 00:35:29.854
spend much and they destroy money. Well, actually, it

519
00:35:29.854 --> 00:35:35.134
was the private sector that destroyed money. Uh, ACCORDING

520
00:35:35.134 --> 00:35:37.354
to Menger, well, the merchants would just, uh, uh,

521
00:35:37.384 --> 00:35:40.313
you know, provide gold and they would, er silver,

522
00:35:40.654 --> 00:35:43.055
mainly. They would take the silver and they would,

523
00:35:43.295 --> 00:35:44.845
you're you're going to buy some food at the

524
00:35:44.845 --> 00:35:49.016
market, you pay a little silver uh in exchange

525
00:35:49.016 --> 00:35:51.845
for things as if cash on the barrel header

526
00:35:52.135 --> 00:35:55.256
right away, and nobody asked, well, who makes the

527
00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:59.115
silver? Well, we know not only from the Bible,

528
00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:03.476
but from similar Babylonian wisdom literature, that there was

529
00:36:03.565 --> 00:36:09.375
a condemnation of merchants for cheating, and not only

530
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.199
Degrading the silver they used at less than uh

531
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.169
the standardized purity, and the temples would stamp the

532
00:36:17.169 --> 00:36:20.760
purity uh on, you know, various uh uh sheets

533
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.469
that they had, uh, but also divide them into

534
00:36:24.469 --> 00:36:26.929
specific weights and measures. You can't just take, you

535
00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:29.729
know, here's a piece of raw silver, Hach gilt,

536
00:36:29.989 --> 00:36:33.270
uh, as it's called in, uh, uh, in German.

537
00:36:33.469 --> 00:36:36.189
The silver was, you would have bracelets that were

538
00:36:36.189 --> 00:36:42.229
divided into 55 shekel little pieces, uh, that you

539
00:36:42.229 --> 00:36:45.870
could break off. There were standardized measures, and you

540
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.030
also had scales. Well, again, you have the Babylonians,

541
00:36:50.389 --> 00:36:54.989
like the biblical, uh, the Old Testament, uh, complaining

542
00:36:54.989 --> 00:36:59.790
about merchants with false scales. They would use, uh,

543
00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:04.379
One wait for buying and selling, uh, for buying

544
00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:07.179
goods, and another way for selling goods to cheat,

545
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.179
to cheat the customers. Um, uh, PRIVATE merchants were

546
00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:14.379
always known for cheating throughout history, not only in

547
00:37:14.379 --> 00:37:19.379
modern times. Uh, SO you, you, you needed the

548
00:37:19.379 --> 00:37:23.120
temples to provide honest money, and that's why most

549
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.679
of the marketplaces down through the Athenian agora, for

550
00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:31.000
instance, were held in the uh open space in

551
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.139
front of the temple. So if there was any

552
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:38.719
uh argument, the uh Athenians had the agora nomoi,

553
00:37:38.919 --> 00:37:44.840
uh, the enforcers of uh uh law and uh

554
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.360
and weights and measures in, uh, in the agora.

555
00:37:48.556 --> 00:37:52.316
Oversee, yeah, fair dealing. You needed the government to

556
00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:57.717
regulate crooked, greedy merchants. Well, the Austrians said, wait

557
00:37:57.717 --> 00:38:00.007
a minute, you don't want to regulate greed, greed

558
00:38:00.007 --> 00:38:02.316
is good. Greed is what drives things. We're the

559
00:38:02.316 --> 00:38:05.116
greedy people, we're the good people, not the bad

560
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:08.277
people, we're what drives civilization. Our greed is not

561
00:38:08.277 --> 00:38:10.797
you people who we exploit, you're just there to

562
00:38:10.797 --> 00:38:14.354
be. Exploited. We provide the surface, the surplus by

563
00:38:14.354 --> 00:38:18.384
extracting interest from you, land rent, and monopoly rent

564
00:38:18.513 --> 00:38:21.694
to exploit you. We are the drivers of civilization.

565
00:38:22.194 --> 00:38:25.904
That's Austrian and free enterprise theory as opposed to

566
00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:31.503
uh classical uh industrial capitalism that said we cannot

567
00:38:31.503 --> 00:38:35.031
afford this kind of behavior. And have a stable

568
00:38:35.031 --> 00:38:40.510
industrial competitive economy. That's why industrial capitalism was to

569
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.470
the Austrians evolving into socialism and had to be

570
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.631
fought against, which is what you have today with

571
00:38:47.631 --> 00:38:50.891
the free, the free enterprise boys and the libertarians

572
00:38:51.141 --> 00:38:56.150
uh uh deindustrializing the US and European economies.

573
00:38:57.429 --> 00:39:01.110
And regarding that, regarding the Austrian school and the

574
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:06.709
libertarians, has a free market ever existed?

575
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:11.120
Well, the, the question is, ha ha, trick question.

576
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.679
What is a free market? To uh Adam Smith,

577
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.929
John Stuart Mill, the, the entire classical uh value

578
00:39:19.929 --> 00:39:23.639
and rent theory century, a free market was a

579
00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:28.149
market free from economic rent. It was free from

580
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.429
unearned income. Everyone was supposed to earn their income

581
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.239
by playing a productive role. Uh, AND that is

582
00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:41.120
why they wanted to end the special privileges of

583
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.189
the landlord class, of the monopoly class, and ultimately,

584
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.399
the privilege of money and credit, money creation and

585
00:39:48.399 --> 00:39:52.280
credit allocation by the banks. So, uh, the, their

586
00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.959
kind of free market was free from, uh, parasitism,

587
00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.469
from Unearned income. For today, the free market is

588
00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:05.830
free for parasitism, for rent seeking, for deregulation. It

589
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:11.010
is free from government regulation to prevent the concentration

590
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.669
of wealth, not by playing a productive role in

591
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.459
uh. Bu il ding factories and employing labor to

592
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:24.379
produce industrial goods, but in being a rontier, uh,

593
00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:28.300
a, a rent collector, either as a landlord, as

594
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.899
a monopolist, or a banker, so the whole concept

595
00:40:31.899 --> 00:40:35.159
of a free market has been turned upside down

596
00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:41.570
from how it originated. In the classical economy. So

597
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.060
when you say, was there a free market, any

598
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.699
market is structured, any market has to have a

599
00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:52.219
structure and regulation or it becomes anarchy and there's

600
00:40:52.219 --> 00:40:54.659
not a market, real market anymore. It's just uh

601
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.060
everybody do whatever you can and it's a war

602
00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.219
of all against all.

603
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.020
So in regards to the ancient Near East, tell

604
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:10.340
us about how urbanization occurred there. I mean, in

605
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:15.260
the book you go through how ritual centers developed

606
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.429
as gathering places or trading venues and how cities

607
00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:24.080
then emerged in the modern sense of the term.

608
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.820
Tell us about that.

609
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.000
Well, what I, I, uh, uh, at Harvard, I

610
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.679
worked very closely with Alex Marshak, uh, the great

611
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:39.540
ice age archaeologist who wrote The Roots of Civilization.

612
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:43.000
And uh he, he found already in the ice

613
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.149
age, many of the social structures that uh survived

614
00:41:49.149 --> 00:41:52.310
through uh the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and the

615
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.870
modern times, uh had uh had their origins. And

616
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:02.469
uh what he found was already in the Magdalenian

617
00:42:02.469 --> 00:42:09.110
period, 14th millennium BC. You had uh people, uh

618
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.830
the land was not very densely populated, and you

619
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:16.500
would have clans and tribal organizations of clans, uh,

620
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.649
growing and expanding, but they'd have to get together,

621
00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:23.250
uh, once, once a year or twice a year

622
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.389
or quarterly, uh, one time or another, they were

623
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.709
a clindrical times for them to get together. So

624
00:42:29.709 --> 00:42:32.784
one of the roles Of the chieftains was to

625
00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:35.864
keep the calendar, so, and it was a lunar

626
00:42:35.864 --> 00:42:38.784
solar calendar, so that they would know, OK, we

627
00:42:38.784 --> 00:42:42.544
follow when the moon is full or uh new

628
00:42:42.544 --> 00:42:45.824
or whenever, we will get together at a given

629
00:42:45.824 --> 00:42:48.554
spot, or where do you get together? Well, most

630
00:42:48.554 --> 00:42:52.284
of the caves where we have archaeological evidence of

631
00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:56.979
ice age gatherings were uh uh on Watercourses, uh,

632
00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.500
or if not watercourses on, uh, roads or paths

633
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.090
that were intersection easy to get to, transport easy

634
00:43:06.179 --> 00:43:10.580
to so that people could join in these consolidations

635
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.659
of identity, and these occasions were, I won't say

636
00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:18.739
markets, uh, because everybody was uh self-supporting at that

637
00:43:18.739 --> 00:43:22.685
time, uh, but they were Uh, uh, where, uh,

638
00:43:22.695 --> 00:43:26.655
marriage and, uh, marriages or whatever you would call

639
00:43:26.655 --> 00:43:30.534
them, uh, would take place, where intercourse of various

640
00:43:30.534 --> 00:43:34.564
forms, uh, would take place, and, uh, that, uh,

641
00:43:34.574 --> 00:43:38.814
then after you would have this consolidation of a

642
00:43:38.814 --> 00:43:44.375
tribal or, uh, other identity, then people would go

643
00:43:44.375 --> 00:43:47.935
back to their hunting and gathering, uh, for, and

644
00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:56.750
so, These. GATHERING places were marked. Cosmologically, the whole

645
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.590
idea was to make a gathering place, a, a,

646
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:05.310
an image of the cosmos. Well, that's what you

647
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.250
had in Stonehenge, and there were many similar uh

648
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.989
uh uh uh places uh er uh such as

649
00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:16.909
Stonehenge where you would have them aligned with the

650
00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:20.550
year on a particular solstice or equinox where the

651
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.225
sun would come and Trace a particular time and

652
00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:27.685
that was, uh, that was showed, OK, this marks

653
00:44:27.864 --> 00:44:30.284
the time of the year that we are uh

654
00:44:30.284 --> 00:44:35.044
developing. Well, just like Stonehenge was sort of, uh,

655
00:44:35.054 --> 00:44:41.215
a scale model of a, an annual calendar, cities

656
00:44:41.215 --> 00:44:46.905
themselves became based as a cosmological model. They had

657
00:44:47.064 --> 00:44:51.689
uh typically 4 gates. Like the seasons, sometimes 12

658
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:56.290
gates, uh, they, uh they, they either would be

659
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.590
round or you would, you would have the, uh,

660
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.969
if not north, south, east, west orientation, then you'd

661
00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:04.790
have it oriented to the way the winds went,

662
00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:09.550
you would have standardized, uh, plots and, and streets,

663
00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:12.770
uh, you, you, you would, uh, you had a

664
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:21.189
cosmological context for Urban design and architecture and development

665
00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:25.189
just like churches as they developed or cosmological, the

666
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:29.510
medieval European churches uh had all of this cosmological

667
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.389
mathematics uh worked into uh their design, that all

668
00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:36.870
of this is to say, the order that we

669
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:41.330
are creating on Earth is as stable as the

670
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:47.120
astronomical. ORDER in the cosmos, and that's why there

671
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.689
have been so many studies of astral religion in

672
00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:56.889
the sense that cosmology was the basis for archaic

673
00:45:56.889 --> 00:46:02.169
religion as an attempt to create a system of

674
00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:04.969
economic order, or I should say a model of

675
00:46:04.969 --> 00:46:07.659
economic order on earth as it is in heaven,

676
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.639
and they wanted to create the stability. But unlike

677
00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:14.479
modern economics, that says if you don't, you don't

678
00:46:14.479 --> 00:46:17.919
need a government because everything returns to normal if

679
00:46:17.919 --> 00:46:20.399
you just let it alone, let the rich people

680
00:46:20.399 --> 00:46:25.280
impoverish the 99% and it's OK. Uh, THE, uh,

681
00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:31.510
uh, ancient society until the Western civilization realized that

682
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:35.409
the economies got out of order if there weren't

683
00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:40.550
intervention, and how do you restore this cosmological order

684
00:46:40.729 --> 00:46:45.790
and balance where uh you have a self-sustaining peasantry

685
00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:49.465
on The land growing crops, you have a uh

686
00:46:49.645 --> 00:46:54.445
the temple bureaucracy, a palace bureaucracy, uh, you have

687
00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:56.564
foreign trade. How do you, how do you keep

688
00:46:56.564 --> 00:47:00.705
econo the economy in balance? And the whole uh

689
00:47:00.705 --> 00:47:04.764
Greek philosophy was based on balance, including the theory

690
00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:08.834
of medicine, for instance, the whole Aristotelian idea of

691
00:47:08.879 --> 00:47:12.360
Balances within the body, you could say it's similar

692
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.280
for uh the uh acupuncture uh that they have

693
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.600
in the Near East. The whole idea of balance

694
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.050
was central, and also the whole idea of fair

695
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:29.699
rulership was based on keeping the population uh happy

696
00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:33.864
and satisfied, so That under Confucianism, for instance, in

697
00:47:33.864 --> 00:47:38.915
uh early uh early China, the rulership was the

698
00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:42.955
ruler was supposed to uh keep the peasantry happy

699
00:47:42.955 --> 00:47:47.435
and uh and if there was a peasant rebellion,

700
00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:50.635
that meant that the ruler had not been ruling

701
00:47:50.635 --> 00:47:54.590
fairly and probably deserved to be overthrown. Uh, YOU

702
00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.790
have that whole concept of economic balance, which is

703
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.919
just the opposite of today's economy saying, uh, the,

704
00:48:02.929 --> 00:48:07.469
the business cycle is self, self-correcting. You don't need

705
00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:10.550
the government to intervene and cancel debts because everything

706
00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:13.899
is balanced with checks and balances, and, uh, you

707
00:48:13.899 --> 00:48:16.669
don't have to worry about debts being unpaid or

708
00:48:16.669 --> 00:48:20.139
you don't have to worry that today. Civilization economic

709
00:48:20.139 --> 00:48:24.139
problems exist. We, we actually don't have any problems

710
00:48:24.139 --> 00:48:27.959
at all today because the problem, reality is impossible

711
00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:31.449
under our economic theory. We can't possibly have Europe

712
00:48:31.449 --> 00:48:34.139
and America acting like they are because our theory

713
00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:39.020
says that's not possible. Well, that's the craziness of

714
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.060
academic economics and the social sciences generally.

715
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:46.860
So it's very interesting all of what you said

716
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.800
there about how some of the institutions we take

717
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:58.280
for granted nowadays have their origins in ancient Mesopotamia.

718
00:48:58.459 --> 00:49:03.639
What would you say was Mesopotamia's role in innovating

719
00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:09.040
and shaping civilization's basic economic institutions?

720
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:15.429
Well, the economic practices that uh became uh part

721
00:49:15.429 --> 00:49:19.500
of how economies operate were originated there. For instance,

722
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.979
money is a means of paying debt. You have

723
00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:27.675
all anthropologists have found. That all uh the surviving

724
00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:32.435
indigenous communities have debts to each other, even uh

725
00:49:32.435 --> 00:49:35.554
as a means of integrating people. Uh, IF you

726
00:49:35.554 --> 00:49:39.235
have one family growing crops and another family growing

727
00:49:39.235 --> 00:49:44.120
the same crop, they'll Uh, give, uh, give this

728
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.790
as a gift to the other, and there'll be

729
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.459
a reciprocal gift, there will be an exchange. There

730
00:49:48.459 --> 00:49:53.179
was always a re re reciprocity and debt, but

731
00:49:53.419 --> 00:50:00.199
the, uh, Mesopotamia achieved a large scale of, uh,

732
00:50:00.209 --> 00:50:05.189
uh, of Uh, specialization of, uh, production that didn't

733
00:50:05.189 --> 00:50:07.629
exist before. Now, there have been a number of

734
00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:10.590
books that were just, uh, published, uh, and reviewed

735
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:15.350
in, uh, uh, the American press on Mesopotamia, and

736
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:20.030
it's just amazing how, uh, uh, how they're, they're

737
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.909
trying to say Mesopotamia never existed, and, and it

738
00:50:23.909 --> 00:50:26.310
didn't, there was no takeoff at all. They said

739
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.709
what made Mesopotamia rich was it had these river

740
00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:33.715
deposited so. Soils just like Egypt had the rich

741
00:50:33.715 --> 00:50:37.415
soil deposited by the Nile, and here's all this

742
00:50:37.415 --> 00:50:40.155
rich soil for growing crops, and they could, they

743
00:50:40.155 --> 00:50:43.185
could afford to have a big population and the

744
00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:45.375
population all got together and when they get together,

745
00:50:45.514 --> 00:50:48.294
you're big enough to begin to specialize labor and

746
00:50:48.435 --> 00:50:53.594
uh develop industry. Uh, THE question is, why did

747
00:50:53.594 --> 00:50:58.354
it happen in Mesopotamia? Well, that's because, uh, these

748
00:50:58.354 --> 00:51:05.750
rich soils. Didn't have metal or uh stone, or

749
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.979
even very uh hardwood trees, uh maybe soft palm

750
00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:14.129
trees or soft trees. So they, that forced them

751
00:51:14.469 --> 00:51:18.750
to trade, well uh with other countries outside of

752
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:24.030
Mesopotamia, with people who weren't Mesopotamians, like uh people

753
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.030
from the Indus Valley or what is now modern

754
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:30.300
Turkey, Anatolia. How are they going to do? This.

755
00:51:30.659 --> 00:51:32.739
Well, there are some signs that in the 4th

756
00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:37.739
millennium BC, uh, the large, uh, largest Sumerian city

757
00:51:37.739 --> 00:51:42.040
of Uruk did try to make outposts, uh, in

758
00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:46.659
what is now modern Turkey, uh, and they were

759
00:51:46.659 --> 00:51:50.399
walled cities, and presumably you have a wall because

760
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:53.739
you don't want to be attacked, but all these

761
00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:58.340
outposts disappeared from the archaeological record pretty quickly. And

762
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:03.719
it, the fact is, you, you couldn't afford to

763
00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:07.959
obtain uh the raw, the raw materials, the metal,

764
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.459
stone and wood that you needed by force because

765
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.580
it was just too expensive to fight people and

766
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.000
get killed and have to build walls and do

767
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.790
that. So the way that Mesopotamia obtained its uh

768
00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:26.000
uh raw materials was to have other countries volunteer.

769
00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:30.504
Voluntarily either supply them or to be hosts to

770
00:52:30.504 --> 00:52:38.274
Mesopotamian developers uh producing tin and copper that gave

771
00:52:38.274 --> 00:52:42.985
their name to the Bronze Age, or silver or

772
00:52:42.985 --> 00:52:48.354
stone or jewelry or the other, uh, everything that

773
00:52:48.354 --> 00:52:52.389
could not be produced in Mesopotamia from its own

774
00:52:52.389 --> 00:52:56.510
soil. So, what Mesopotamia did have because of its

775
00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:01.310
soil, was a very large population uh uh that

776
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:06.750
was growing and uh the, uh this population was

777
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:11.189
large enough to be self-supporting and to support an

778
00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:17.094
export, a labor-intensive export industry, largely of handicraft. Crafts,

779
00:53:17.375 --> 00:53:21.465
textiles, and other handicrafts to trade abroad for the

780
00:53:21.465 --> 00:53:24.425
raw materials that it developed, so that uh uh

781
00:53:24.425 --> 00:53:27.594
that it needed. So, that was a circular flow.

782
00:53:27.784 --> 00:53:32.824
Well, when you advance textiles to a trader, how

783
00:53:32.824 --> 00:53:35.185
are you going to get repaid? How do you

784
00:53:35.185 --> 00:53:38.504
denominate it? You don't get repaid in textiles, you

785
00:53:38.504 --> 00:53:42.870
had to have a standard of measurement. And the

786
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:47.110
role of money was a standard of measurement initiated

787
00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:50.429
by the temples for their own account keeping. That's

788
00:53:50.429 --> 00:53:56.340
why the measure of grain was divided into 60ths.

789
00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:01.360
They were, uh, they had to Give grain regularly

790
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.500
to the um uh the labor force there. Well,

791
00:54:07.979 --> 00:54:12.550
the archaic measurement of time was the lunar month.

792
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.629
But you, you know, the lunar month varies in

793
00:54:15.629 --> 00:54:18.590
time from 26, 27 days all the way up

794
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.429
to 29th or 30 days. You can't just keep

795
00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:24.850
giving various measures for a variable month. You had

796
00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:29.179
the standardize month. So from Mesopotamia to Egypt, you

797
00:54:29.179 --> 00:54:32.800
standardize the calendar on the 30 days. Months. Uh,

798
00:54:32.919 --> 00:54:35.949
WELL, of course, that left uh uh uh a

799
00:54:35.949 --> 00:54:39.570
gap, uh, in the year between 360-day year and

800
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:45.500
the 365 day uh solar year. Uh, AND, uh,

801
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.750
so you, you had a civil calendar based on,

802
00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:54.649
uh, the lunar, uh, the lunation cycle, and In

803
00:54:54.649 --> 00:54:58.370
a solar calendar that was used by the large

804
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.739
institutions for the distribution of food, and if, as

805
00:55:01.739 --> 00:55:05.129
long as you divided the grain ration into uh

806
00:55:05.129 --> 00:55:09.189
60ths, that is, every day for 30 days, twice

807
00:55:09.189 --> 00:55:12.090
a day, you would give them barley or grain

808
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:14.379
or, you know, whatever you were feeding them. They

809
00:55:14.379 --> 00:55:18.270
used the same system of denominations for coins. The

810
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.620
uh they were, the mina was divided into 60

811
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.935
shuts. Just like our minute is divided into 60

812
00:55:24.935 --> 00:55:30.044
seconds. The origins of our time measurements come from

813
00:55:30.324 --> 00:55:35.685
Mesopotamian, uh, measures of grain that was extended to

814
00:55:35.685 --> 00:55:38.925
silver and money in general, and then the measurement

815
00:55:39.465 --> 00:55:42.004
of the counting system, uh, in general. OK,

816
00:55:42.304 --> 00:55:44.625
so, uh, I'm just going to ask you actually

817
00:55:44.625 --> 00:55:47.465
one final question because I don't want to take

818
00:55:47.465 --> 00:55:49.925
too much of your time and we've already done.

819
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.399
Uh, ONE hour, so, um, what do you think

820
00:55:54.399 --> 00:56:00.560
then the modern Western democracies could learn from Bronze

821
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:05.510
Age economic policy that would be possible to apply

822
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:05.800
today?

823
00:56:06.689 --> 00:56:09.320
Well, that's the, the big question and I discussed

824
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.899
that in uh my book, The Collapse of Antiquity.

825
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.340
What uh The Bronze Age really came to an

826
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.020
end in 1200 BC in the Mediterranean. Uh, THERE,

827
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.939
there was bad weather. The bad, the, uh, climate

828
00:56:25.939 --> 00:56:30.159
crisis, uh, began in around 1800 BC in, uh,

829
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.100
the Indus Valley, when you had the whole, the

830
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.979
Indus civilization was the largest civil, uh, Bronze Age

831
00:56:35.979 --> 00:56:42.030
civilization, very standardized, uh, very developed everywhere. Um. But

832
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.989
apparently there was a drought and the population declined

833
00:56:45.989 --> 00:56:50.270
so rapidly that you had the influx of Indo-Europeans,

834
00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.750
largely from what is now Ukraine apparently, uh, come

835
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.929
in there and overlayer it. Well, uh, you had

836
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:03.050
in 1600 BC, uh, there was uh bad weather

837
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:06.610
in still in uh in Uh, what's now Turkey,

838
00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.260
you had the Hittites move in and uh to

839
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.979
the conquer Babylon, and the Babylonian Empire ended in

840
00:57:12.979 --> 00:57:18.100
1600 BC. Well, uh, uh, you, you had a

841
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:23.899
survival of the palatial economy using syllabic syllabic writing

842
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:28.594
in Greek. Uh, IN the Mycenaean, uh, economy with

843
00:57:28.594 --> 00:57:32.905
different, different Greek cities, uh, and palaces. But, uh,

844
00:57:32.915 --> 00:57:38.175
here too, there was, uh, apparently a drought, uh,

845
00:57:38.314 --> 00:57:41.594
we know from the ice age, uh, uh, the,

846
00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:47.739
the, the Uh, ice, uh, way of, of cores

847
00:57:47.919 --> 00:57:50.419
that have been dug up and from the tree,

848
00:57:50.689 --> 00:57:54.199
uh, the trees and other archaeological evidence that there

849
00:57:54.199 --> 00:57:57.080
was really bad, uh, disturbance in the weather, you

850
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.659
had populations set in motion that, uh, essentially Uh,

851
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:06.340
there, it was, uh, a, I guess they call

852
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.350
them intermediate periods, and, uh, you had the palatial

853
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.139
economy fall apart, uh, the syllabic writing fell apart,

854
00:58:14.469 --> 00:58:17.449
the palace control fell apart in Greece, for instance,

855
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.949
uh, and you had, uh, the local Local managers

856
00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:25.409
who were providing uh the tribute or the taxes

857
00:58:25.409 --> 00:58:28.389
to the palace, just sort of ending up in

858
00:58:28.389 --> 00:58:32.629
control of local uh areas. You had warlords, between

859
00:58:32.629 --> 00:58:38.469
1200 BC and about uh 800, 750 BC uh

860
00:58:38.469 --> 00:58:42.669
you, you had uh just kind of anarchy that

861
00:58:42.669 --> 00:58:47.669
historians of that period uh call mafiosi states. You

862
00:58:47.669 --> 00:58:52.537
had a very And, and, uh, uh, cruel centralized,

863
00:58:52.836 --> 00:58:57.217
uh, uh, chieftains holding the rest of the economy

864
00:58:57.217 --> 00:59:00.916
in bondage largely through debt or through control of

865
00:59:00.916 --> 00:59:02.906
the land and through the, you know, kind of,

866
00:59:03.126 --> 00:59:06.947
oh, it was their kind of proto, uh, serfdom.

867
00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:15.386
Well, uh, they, they achieved their ability to indebt

868
00:59:15.386 --> 00:59:19.743
populations because if you had uh the Phoenician and

869
00:59:19.743 --> 00:59:25.343
Syrian traders expanding into the Mediterranean, Mediterranean around 800

870
00:59:25.343 --> 00:59:30.983
BC to Greece to Rome. They brought these practices

871
00:59:31.124 --> 00:59:35.884
of interest-bearing, charging interest, and other commercial practices, weights

872
00:59:35.884 --> 00:59:40.684
and measures, uh, temple organizations, temples, uh, set up

873
00:59:40.684 --> 00:59:43.604
to act as chambers of commerce. They set them

874
00:59:43.604 --> 00:59:48.391
up throughout Greece and Italy. Often on offshore islands,

875
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:52.561
uh, as they had done uh uh in uh

876
00:59:52.561 --> 00:59:56.131
in the Bronze Age, and they brought these concepts

877
00:59:56.131 --> 01:00:00.750
of interest bearing debt to the Indo-European speaking West.

878
01:00:01.091 --> 01:00:03.910
There had been no indication of interest at all,

879
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:08.430
uh, being charged by Western economies before this, so,

880
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:12.730
uh, they, uh, the chieftains were the people who

881
01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:17.320
would advance land. In exchange for interest and rent,

882
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.070
and you had all of these economic practices that

883
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.120
had been developed in the ancient Near East, adopted,

884
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.419
but what you didn't have was this institution of

885
01:00:28.689 --> 01:00:32.300
divine kingship or you didn't have a central ruler

886
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.000
to prevent an oligarchy from developing and impoverishing society.

887
01:00:38.409 --> 01:00:42.219
And that's the characteristic of Western civilization. From the

888
01:00:42.219 --> 01:00:45.419
very beginning in classical Greece and Rome, there was

889
01:00:45.419 --> 01:00:51.100
no authority to prevent the uh emergence of an

890
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:57.280
oligarchy using its wealth to impoverishing, impoverishing the population

891
01:00:57.419 --> 01:01:00.620
at large. So that uh what you had of

892
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.419
uh in, in Greece and also apparently in the

893
01:01:04.419 --> 01:01:09.439
Italian cities uh were uh. But certainly in Greece,

894
01:01:09.739 --> 01:01:15.199
you, you had uh members of the ruling clans

895
01:01:15.379 --> 01:01:17.899
say, you know, this isn't fair. Well, especially it's

896
01:01:17.899 --> 01:01:21.020
not fair if they were a secondary, distant member

897
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.020
of the ruling clans, and they, they, uh, they

898
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.290
got together and they overthrew the clan leaders. This

899
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:31.939
is very well documented in uh in uh in

900
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:36.899
the various Greek cities in and I'm blocking out

901
01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:41.010
for a second. Corinth, uh uh, Corinth, uh, you

902
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.810
had this, you had, uh, a similar overthrow in

903
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:49.550
Sparta, where the reaction of the reformers in Sparta

904
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.469
under the mythical Lycurgus was, uh, we don't even

905
01:01:53.469 --> 01:01:55.770
want to use money, because if you have money,

906
01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.969
then you're going to have interest-bearing debt, you're going

907
01:01:57.969 --> 01:02:00.290
to have poor people. And at the very end

908
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:05.050
of all of these, uh, revolutions of by, they're

909
01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:08.290
called tyrants, and tyrants just meant the, the, the

910
01:02:08.413 --> 01:02:11.663
Big ruler, I think it was uh uh taken

911
01:02:11.663 --> 01:02:14.302
from uh one of the cities in Persia, uh,

912
01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:17.683
that, that, that was, was used, uh, you, you

913
01:02:17.683 --> 01:02:23.143
had the tyrants overthrew the mafiosi states and begin

914
01:02:23.143 --> 01:02:28.133
to undertake public development. Uh, THEY, they, they, uh,

915
01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:32.222
canceled the debts that had held the uh population

916
01:02:32.222 --> 01:02:36.643
in bondage, they redistributed the land, they did basically

917
01:02:36.643 --> 01:02:39.976
what the Near Eastern rulers. HAD done. They uh

918
01:02:40.075 --> 01:02:42.835
uh said, well, we need a free population in

919
01:02:42.835 --> 01:02:47.605
order to have an economy that grows and works

920
01:02:47.795 --> 01:02:50.756
and is resilient, and that's why in Corinth, you

921
01:02:50.756 --> 01:02:54.436
had them developing uh the port area, the docks,

922
01:02:54.476 --> 01:02:57.595
and uh the foreign uh ability for foreign trade.

923
01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:02.476
Uh, YOU had uh Athens, uh Sparta was sort

924
01:03:02.476 --> 01:03:05.045
of a special case, uh, they didn't have so

925
01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:09.149
much foreign trade, they, they conquered a neighboring Uh,

926
01:03:09.159 --> 01:03:13.139
group of, uh, city and turned the population into,

927
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.830
uh, hilots, which are sort of quasi serfs, uh,

928
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.800
and this was, the, it was the tyrants that

929
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.020
set The train for what became Greek democracy um

930
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.199
in Athens and other countries, and that just meant

931
01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:32.199
uh the public, uh, the uh public sector taking

932
01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:37.760
the lead in sponsoring construction projects, trade, and organizing

933
01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:43.939
a uh rules of commerce and exchange and uh

934
01:03:44.689 --> 01:03:48.899
economic stability, uh, sponsored. By the governments, um, in

935
01:03:48.899 --> 01:03:53.389
general. Well, by Aristotle's time, uh, you had, uh,

936
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.699
the increase in wealth, uh, you, you, you had

937
01:03:57.699 --> 01:04:03.979
the technology, had obviously by the 4th century, 5th

938
01:04:03.979 --> 01:04:08.139
century, 3rd century BC, uh, developed way beyond what

939
01:04:08.139 --> 01:04:11.939
it was 3000 years earlier, Society had been rich

940
01:04:11.939 --> 01:04:16.399
enough to Be able to afford a wealthy class

941
01:04:16.399 --> 01:04:21.520
accumulating wealth and uh not only Aristotle, but Greek

942
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.239
philosophers, uh Socrates, uh, the Greek religion, uh Delos

943
01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:32.560
and Delphi all described the phenomenon of wealth addiction.

944
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.719
You have a problem when you have big fortunes

945
01:04:35.719 --> 01:04:39.459
beginning to be accumulated. You have wealth, addiction and

946
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:44.300
greed, and that er er developed into an oligarchy.

947
01:04:44.659 --> 01:04:50.280
So when Aristotle wrote his study of constitutions throughout

948
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.050
Greece and its islands and other areas, he said

949
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.939
almost all these constitutions call themselves democracies, but they're

950
01:04:57.939 --> 01:05:03.669
really oligarchies. And Western civilization has not really had

951
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:07.270
a democracy. It's uh it occurred very quickly into

952
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:12.189
oligarchy. Well, uh, the, uh, both Aristotle and, uh,

953
01:05:12.239 --> 01:05:16.000
Plato described, there was a kind of, uh, cycle

954
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.979
throughout history. Uh, DEMOCRACY would develop into an oligarchy,

955
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.000
and then, uh, some oligarchs would fight other oligarchs

956
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.189
by taking the public, the, the infantry, the masses

957
01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:31.560
into their camp and overthrow them and making democracy

958
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.679
and then that would develop into an oligarchy again

959
01:05:34.679 --> 01:05:38.350
and that was. The eternal return of uh Western

960
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:42.209
civilization, but uh there weren't that many cycles when

961
01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:46.689
oligarchy turned in, when uh democracy turned into oligarchy,

962
01:05:46.979 --> 01:05:49.550
uh, it happened rather fast. I could, I could

963
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.909
go into Roman history if you want, but I

964
01:05:51.909 --> 01:05:54.629
describe all of this in the collapse of antiquity.

965
01:05:54.949 --> 01:06:00.229
So Western civilization, uh, developed the, it took the

966
01:06:00.229 --> 01:06:03.459
economic practices that had Been developed in the Near

967
01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:08.939
East but without any ruler to uh prevent a

968
01:06:08.939 --> 01:06:15.699
domestic oligarchy from developing and impoverishing society and reducing

969
01:06:15.699 --> 01:06:19.600
it to serfdom of the type that uh Roman

970
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.860
that Rome did with its empire collapsing into serfdom,

971
01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:27.199
and we're having that same oligarchic tendency uh today,

972
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.889
and the oligarchies. In all countries became a rent-seeking

973
01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:34.969
class, a rentier class, uh, at first by their

974
01:06:34.969 --> 01:06:40.330
land ownership in conjunction with their creditor power of

975
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.360
interest. So, you had rent in the form of

976
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.719
land ownership, rent in the form of interest, and,

977
01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:49.649
uh, uh, later monopoly privileges. This is what John

978
01:06:49.649 --> 01:06:54.689
Stuart Mill called, uh, making rents, rental income in

979
01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:57.919
your sleep. You don't work for it, but you

980
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.540
achieve a political and military power to extract rent

981
01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.540
from the civilization at large, and that's where classical

982
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.800
economics came in in the 19th century. The whole

983
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.020
ethic of industrial capitalism was trying to restore the

984
01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.419
economic balance that had been missing from uh Western

985
01:07:19.419 --> 01:07:23.479
civilization. Ever since its inception in Greece and Rome,

986
01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:26.669
you know, after the 8th century BC, and, uh,

987
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800
it, it seemed to be on its way to

988
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.659
evolving into socialism uh by World War 1, but

989
01:07:33.659 --> 01:07:37.719
by that time the Rontiers fought back uh and

990
01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:42.360
achieved uh uh regained control of the economy uh

991
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.719
at the expense of uh industrial capitalism by The

992
01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:51.719
rent extractors by the landlords in conjunction with the

993
01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:56.719
financial class of bankers, and that's the same ethic,

994
01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.919
the same uh class, Renttier class that's stifling economies

995
01:08:01.919 --> 01:08:05.360
today from Europe to the United Nations, uh, to

996
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.314
the United States. IS exactly what uh the Mesopotamia,

997
01:08:10.475 --> 01:08:14.544
Egypt, and other Bronze Age uh economies were able

998
01:08:14.844 --> 01:08:18.685
to prevent by having a central rulership, and that's

999
01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:22.265
why the Austrian school in economic liberty, free markets

1000
01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:26.529
today said we don't want any Central rulership, any

1001
01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:30.649
government able to regulate the economy or to prevent

1002
01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:35.470
exploitation, or to discourage economic rent in favor of

1003
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:38.729
earned income by profits and wages, you want to

1004
01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:42.970
shift taxes off, off banking, off real estate, on

1005
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:45.700
to labor and industry, and that is exactly what's

1006
01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:52.533
Polarizing the European and uh uh US economies today.

1007
01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:56.112
I didn't expect this to be the result of

1008
01:08:56.112 --> 01:08:57.973
what I was going to find when I began

1009
01:08:57.973 --> 01:09:00.953
to look in Mesopotamia for, well, how did they

1010
01:09:00.953 --> 01:09:05.462
happen to cancel the debts, but in reconstruction, the

1011
01:09:05.462 --> 01:09:09.255
whole society that I was responsible for doing this,

1012
01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:12.774
I, I realized what that there are really two

1013
01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:19.996
kinds of societies, a regulated society to prevent exploitation

1014
01:09:20.175 --> 01:09:23.496
and rent seeking and a free for all where

1015
01:09:23.496 --> 01:09:27.375
the rontiers take over and and impoverish the population.

1016
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.970
Yes, that is really fascinating, Dr. Hertzen, and we've

1017
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:37.009
already recorded almost 75 minutes, so I think this

1018
01:09:37.009 --> 01:09:40.189
is a good point to wrap up our conversation.

1019
01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:42.089
I don't want to take too much of your

1020
01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:44.350
time, as I said, and the book is again

1021
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:49.305
Temples of Enterprise Creating Economic Order in. The Bronze

1022
01:09:49.305 --> 01:09:52.785
Age Near East, and I'm leaving a link to

1023
01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:56.225
it in the description of the interview. And Doctor

1024
01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.865
Hudson, thank you so much for taking the time

1025
01:09:58.865 --> 01:10:01.064
to come on the show again. It's always really

1026
01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:02.464
fascinating to talk.

1027
01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:04.595
Well, I look forward to seeing the transcript of

1028
01:10:04.595 --> 01:10:07.104
all this because I always get new ideas while

1029
01:10:07.104 --> 01:10:10.064
talking to you, Ricardo. Uh, I mean, your questions

1030
01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:13.964
sort of lead me to, uh, develop a different

1031
01:10:13.964 --> 01:10:16.384
exposition, so I'm looking forward to it.

1032
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:20.229
