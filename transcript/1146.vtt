Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.119
Di Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.270
and today I'm joined by Doctor Brad Duchaine. He's

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.140
a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.309
Sciences at Dartmouth College. He uses neuropsychology, psychophysics, and

6
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.510
neuroimaging to explore the cognitive neurodevelopmental and genetic basis

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.690
of social perception. And today we're going to talk

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.459
about mostly about face perception, prosopagnosia. And prosopo metamorphosia,

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.209
yeah, it's, it's a really a mouthful. So Doctor

10
00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.490
Duchaine, thank you for taking the time to come

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.930
on the show. It's a pleasure to have

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.169
you on. Thanks a lot for inviting me, Ricardo.

13
00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:46.409
I've listened to many episodes of your podcast, so

14
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.720
it's really great to be on here.

15
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:53.259
Thank you. So, let's start with a broader question.

16
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:58.599
What is social perception? What aspects of perception connect

17
00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:01.310
to the social aspects of our lives?

18
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.410
Sure, yeah, so. In order to make sense of

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.169
the social information that's around us, we often have

20
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:11.739
to use our perceptual abilities, so vision, audition, other

21
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:15.459
sorts of perceptual abilities to interpret that information and

22
00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.500
um sort of make sense of it. Much of

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.410
this goes on, um, it's primarily vision and audition,

24
00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:24.220
and my lab studies the visual side of social

25
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.379
perception. So trying to understand the information and faces,

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.620
and people's bodies, and how they move and such

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.470
sort those sorts of information.

28
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.430
And how is face perception specifically processed by the

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.790
brain?

30
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.730
Yeah, that's a complicated question that a lot of

31
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.010
people are working on. Um, AND, um, there are

32
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.089
a lot of different areas in the brain that

33
00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:51.029
contribute to face processing. Many of them are in

34
00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:53.290
the occipital and temporal lobe, but we also see

35
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.010
that there are areas in the frontal lobe that

36
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.300
contribute to face processing. These areas form a network,

37
00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.739
so they're connected up with one another, um, and

38
00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.779
they're able to generate, you know, these immediate percepts

39
00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:06.540
that we have of faces where we're able to

40
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.820
say who somebody is, how they're feeling, where they're

41
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.380
looking. We also make inferences about, say, how trustworthy

42
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.660
we think they are, how attractive they think we

43
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.139
are, and these all, these sorts of perceptions all

44
00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.220
happen within the blink of an eye. Um, AND

45
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.500
so we've got a highly specialized system in our

46
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820
brains that is carrying out that, um, those computations.

47
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.960
But are there any face selective neurons? Are there

48
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.410
any neurons specialized in face perception?

49
00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.350
There are. So, if I were to put you

50
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.929
into a scanner and we showed you faces and

51
00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.460
objects, the first thing, what I would do to

52
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.100
look at your face network is identify those areas

53
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.220
that show a much stronger response to faces than

54
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.660
to objects. And if we did that within your

55
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.949
occipital and temporal lobes, maybe we'd find something like

56
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.259
12 to 14 little face, what we call face

57
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.169
selective areas. Those are blueberry sized regions and as

58
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.529
I said earlier, they're connected up. Then if we

59
00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.419
were able to go in there and record from

60
00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.570
individual neurons, we would find that those, those face

61
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.369
selective areas consist almost entirely of neurons that respond

62
00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.490
to faces and faces only. Occasionally, you can find

63
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.160
another stimulus that has enough sort of stimulus characteristics

64
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.089
that it can drive a face neuron, but it's

65
00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.399
still a phase selective neuron.

66
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.820
And face perception has some temporal characteristics to it,

67
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.059
right? So, what is the importance of the temporal

68
00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.699
characteristics of face perception and how are they processed

69
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.460
by the brain?

70
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.399
Yeah, so face perception, as I said earlier, takes

71
00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:43.559
place very quickly and um people working primarily with

72
00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.279
EEG but also sometimes with intracranial recordings have been

73
00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.880
able to track some of the processes that contribute

74
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.360
to face processing. So, maybe around 100 milliseconds, there's

75
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.080
an important event, 170 milliseconds, 250 out at around

76
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.800
say 400 to 600 milliseconds. So there's these different

77
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.000
steps that need to take place for face processing

78
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.279
to, to operate effectively. What exactly each one of

79
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.479
those steps is, we don't have a great understanding,

80
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.360
but we know that there's, there's sort of major

81
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.679
events at certain temporal milestones.

82
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.748
So tell us about how we tend to have

83
00:04:19.748 --> 00:04:26.748
highly accurate familiar face recognition, but also error prone

84
00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:29.588
performance with unfamiliar faces.

85
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.320
Yeah, so this is a point that Mike Burton

86
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.119
in in York in England has really made a

87
00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:37.880
lot of. And so, you know, if you were

88
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.160
to see a friend, you wouldn't have any difficulty

89
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.609
recognizing them, even from just say a little bit

90
00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:46.480
of their face, maybe under less than ideal circumstances,

91
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.750
maybe poor lighting. Um, AND yet, Um, if you

92
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.549
see an unfamiliar face and you get a good

93
00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:55.910
look at it, you're likely to have a tough

94
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.989
time knowing if you encounter that face again 10

95
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:02.350
minutes later in a slightly different view. Um, AND

96
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.070
so what Mike would say about that is, we

97
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.709
just don't have robust representations that can handle the

98
00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:10.869
many different viewpoints that we see faces from if

99
00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:13.339
we haven't seen it from lots of different viewpoints,

100
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.589
under lots of different lighting. Um, SO just seeing

101
00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.470
that one unfamiliar face doesn't allow you to generate

102
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.309
a, uh, the sort of representation that's gonna be

103
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.200
all that effective.

104
00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:30.609
Does that have any implications for eyewitness identification and

105
00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:31.369
policy?

106
00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:36.320
Yeah, that has major implications for eyewitness identification. So

107
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.480
what it says is, if people are making identifications

108
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.279
involving people that they know, we should have high

109
00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.920
confidence in those identifications. On the other hand, and

110
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.079
this has been shown over and over, if people

111
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.600
are making identifications of unfamiliar people, who they've often

112
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.320
seen in extremely stressful situations, um, they're like, there's

113
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.510
a good chance that they'll be inaccurate with those.

114
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.130
And so we really need to Be quite sort

115
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.690
of skeptical of people's confidence in those sorts of

116
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.290
um evaluations. Another thing, I think maybe later we'll

117
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.119
talk a little about individual differences in face perception,

118
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:15.410
but one thing I think that legal systems should

119
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.089
also um be aware of is that because there

120
00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.130
is a lot of difference in how good people

121
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.869
are with face recognition. That's something that we should

122
00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.339
be considering if we've got somebody who's on the

123
00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.589
stand and is saying that they recognize somebody in

124
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.429
a certain situation. If they've got really good face

125
00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:35.100
recognition, should put more credence in their, their identification.

126
00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.029
If they have poor face recognition, we should put

127
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.750
less into it.

128
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.390
So let's talk then about what you mentioned there.

129
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:47.000
There is individual variation in face perception. Is human

130
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.640
face recognition ability something that varies between individuals and

131
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.600
if so, in what ways does it vary?

132
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.140
Yeah, so this is something I, I, I suspect

133
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.049
people were aware of this informally in the past,

134
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.420
but it's really become a topic of study over

135
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.339
the last 25 or so years that people have

136
00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:11.600
realized that there's a Wide variety of face recognition

137
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.730
abilities. And this is true not just for, when

138
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.269
I say face recognition, I'm talking about identifying an

139
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.410
individual from their face, but this is true for

140
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.209
other aspects of face perception. So how effectively people

141
00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:25.119
can recognize expressions, how well they can tell the

142
00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:27.130
age of a face, and it's true really for

143
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.130
all psychological abilities. And so you can think about

144
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.989
face recognition ability as a normal distribution. You've got

145
00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:36.309
some people in one tail who are very poor

146
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:40.429
with it. We call those individuals developmental prosopagnosics. We've

147
00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:42.510
got other people on the other end who are

148
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.470
super recognizers who are just fantastic when it comes

149
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.339
to face recognition ability. And then in the middle

150
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.350
are the, as are most people who've got, you

151
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.950
know, decent face recognition, but it's not particularly bad

152
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.309
and it's not particularly good. And these differences in

153
00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.029
people appear to be pretty stable across time.

154
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.609
And uh is this face recognition abilities something that

155
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:07.779
is heritable?

156
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.279
Yeah, they are. So there have been a couple

157
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:12.109
of good studies. We carried out a study in

158
00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:15.519
2010, Jeremy Wilmer and, and, um, I and a

159
00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.440
few and some other colleagues. We did a twin

160
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.079
study in which we looked at identical twins and

161
00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.309
fraternal twins. So the identical twins share all of

162
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:26.119
their genes, the fraternal twins share half their genes.

163
00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.799
What we found is that the correlation in between

164
00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.200
performance and the identical twins was quite high. It

165
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.890
was around 0.7, so quite strong correlation. In the

166
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.400
identical twins, or pardon me, in the fraternal twins,

167
00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:41.250
it was 0.3. So it's less than half of

168
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.570
the correlation that we found in the identical twins,

169
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.760
which indicates that almost all the individual differences in

170
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.369
how well people can recognize a face is due

171
00:08:50.369 --> 00:08:54.200
to genetic differences. There was a similar study with

172
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.690
a larger sample that was done by Robert Plowman's

173
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.530
lab 5 years after we did ours, that found

174
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.729
very similar results.

175
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.599
So let's get into some of the deviations from

176
00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:09.729
the norm when it comes to face perception. What

177
00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:11.690
is prosopagnosia?

178
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.679
Yeah, so prosagnosia is a condition where people have

179
00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:20.429
great difficulty recognizing facial identity, despite not having any,

180
00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:24.159
say, low-level visual problems, um, and don't have more

181
00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:27.760
general cognitive problems. So they've got to have difficulties

182
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.190
at the level of visual recognition. And these are,

183
00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:33.559
a lot of my career has been spent studying

184
00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:34.919
people with prosopagnosia.

185
00:09:36.169 --> 00:09:39.739
And this prosopagnosia is something that people are born

186
00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:42.460
with, or is it acquired?

187
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.690
Both are true. So, for a long time, say,

188
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.739
going back to the early 20th century, and you

189
00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:50.859
can even find examples of it in the neurological

190
00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:53.619
literature in the, in the 19th century, there have

191
00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:57.650
been people reported who had normal face recognition ability

192
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.700
and then suffered brain damage and lost their ability

193
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.500
or at least it was severely impaired, um. Lost

194
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.929
their ability to recognize face as well. And so,

195
00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:10.080
this is often fairly obvious to people, you know,

196
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.219
you wake up in the hospital, people are coming

197
00:10:12.219 --> 00:10:14.500
in to see you, and you can't recognize their

198
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.409
face any longer. Um, SO it's a real difference.

199
00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:20.700
What took us a lot longer to recognize the

200
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.820
existence of was developmental prosopagnosia. So, people with developmental

201
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.890
prosopagnosia can have face recognition abilities that are just

202
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.729
as poor as what we see in acquired prosopagnosia.

203
00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:32.659
But of course, there was no before and after

204
00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:36.010
for them. They were, they've been bad with faces,

205
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.849
presumably their entire lives. Of course, we don't actually,

206
00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:40.809
we're not able to measure what happens in those

207
00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:43.169
first few years, but my assumption is that it's

208
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:47.520
probably there, probably even prior to birth, um, and

209
00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:51.130
so they have great difficulty throughout life, um, and

210
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.570
so that's why we call them developmental.

211
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.340
And what do we know more generally or more

212
00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.580
broadly about the theology of prosopagnosia? What causes it

213
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.539
exactly? Yeah, so earlier on, I was mentioning the

214
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.659
face processing network, um, and the regions that are

215
00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:13.940
particularly important for causing prosopagnosia tend to be right

216
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.419
hemisphere, occipital, and, and temporal lobe phase selective areas.

217
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.650
Um, THERE'S an interesting Mystery in the face processing

218
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.729
literature and that if you look, if I were

219
00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:26.369
to put you in the scanner and identify your

220
00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.729
face selective areas, you'd have face selective areas in

221
00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.090
the left hemisphere, and face selective areas in the

222
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.530
right hemisphere. They look pretty similar to one another,

223
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.679
they're a little more pronounced in the right hemisphere.

224
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.109
But it's really rare for somebody who, um, to

225
00:11:39.109 --> 00:11:42.809
have left, unilateral left hemisphere damage, so damage just

226
00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:46.390
to the left hemisphere and then become prosopagnosic. On

227
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.549
the other hand, it's common for people when they've

228
00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:51.549
had right hemisphere damage to the face network to

229
00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:55.150
become prosopagnosic. So there's this really symmetry that we

230
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.869
still don't understand, but the right hemisphere, um, is

231
00:11:57.869 --> 00:11:59.750
much more important for face process than the left,

232
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.270
and it's, it's either damage to those areas in

233
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.409
the case of acquired prosopagnosia. Or it's just a

234
00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:09.520
failure to develop the sort of the face processing

235
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.929
network normally in the developmental cases.

236
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.150
And when it comes to what is affected neurologically

237
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:23.070
in prosopagnosia, is it just a face specific visual

238
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.309
processing or also some aspects of more domain general

239
00:12:28.309 --> 00:12:29.479
visual processing?

240
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.140
Yeah, this is gonna be a common answer for

241
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.419
me for these sorts of questions. It's gonna vary

242
00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:37.539
from case to case. And so we work with

243
00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:41.580
some individuals who have difficulties recognizing faces, but they

244
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.090
also might have difficulties recognizing cars, um, and recognizing

245
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.080
mugs and what have you. Um, THOSE sorts of

246
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.750
cases are challenging to interpret theoretically because it could

247
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.679
be that they've got some general purpose process that's

248
00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:59.369
contributing to recognition of a lot of different categories.

249
00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:01.239
On the other hand, it might be that they've

250
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.119
got separate mechanisms that are, say, important for face

251
00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:07.000
recognition, and important for car recognition, and both of

252
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.320
them have been knocked out at the same time

253
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.859
because they're neighboring regions. Um, The more interesting cases

254
00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:17.119
theoretically are those that just have difficulties with face

255
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:22.039
recognition. Um, AND so they, we've documented and other

256
00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:25.000
labs have as well, a number of highly face

257
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.080
selective cases, so they have difficulty sort of knowing

258
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.760
whose face they're looking at, but they can recognize

259
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.719
cars perfectly normally. And maybe later on, if we

260
00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:37.320
talk about prosopub metamorphopsia, we could talk about evidence

261
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.919
that also speaks to this question. It's probably also

262
00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:43.400
worth mentioning. There was a really fascinating case studied

263
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.719
by Morris Moskovitz's lab in Toronto. Um, THIS guy

264
00:13:47.719 --> 00:13:50.239
is named Mr. CK, and Mr. CK was jogging

265
00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:52.479
one day and got hit by a car. And

266
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:56.830
Mr. CK can still recognize upright faces perfectly normally,

267
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.239
but he can't recognize objects. He's got very severe

268
00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:03.059
object diagnosia. So, you know, Well, this is a

269
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.099
podcast. Maybe people can't see those who can't see

270
00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:07.320
it, but I'm holding up a mug, and that's

271
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.489
also the video version, so people are.

272
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.090
If you were to show this to Mr. CK,

273
00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:14.979
not only would he not be able to say,

274
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.700
oh, that's Brad's particular mug, he would have difficulty

275
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.260
even knowing that it's a mug. So he's got

276
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.820
really severe object diagnosia and yet can recognize upright

277
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.450
faces perfectly normally. Um, AND so, that's the opposite

278
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.369
of prosopagnosia. It's severe object diagnosia with intact face

279
00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:35.489
perception. So, we call that a neuropsychology a double

280
00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:38.609
dissociation, um, and those, that's a particularly important type

281
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:42.900
of evidence for establishing the independence of different processes.

282
00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:48.799
But then people can have both problems or,

283
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.969
yeah, so, you know, if you get a, let's

284
00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:53.789
say you suffer a major stroke, and a lot

285
00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:57.330
of different high-level visual areas are knocked out, one

286
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.369
can lose face recognition and object recognition and, and

287
00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:03.369
those, that's, of course, very difficult to deal with

288
00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:06.409
for those individuals. It's also for researchers, it's hard

289
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:08.729
to make sense of that because they have such

290
00:15:08.729 --> 00:15:10.729
broad deficits, it's hard to know what's causing it.

291
00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:11.229
Right.

292
00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:18.400
What is the psychosocial impact of prosopagnosia during childhood

293
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:18.969
specifically?

294
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.419
Yeah, so we published a paper on this around

295
00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:24.960
10 years ago. And so these are people, the

296
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.859
people we study are those who have developmental prosopagnosia,

297
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.700
which I, I should have mentioned is much more

298
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.580
common than acquired prosopagnosia. Um, THROUGH, through our website,

299
00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:36.340
which is faceblind.org, we hear from lots, maybe 2

300
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:42.570
to 3 prosopagnosics per day. Maybe 5% or less

301
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.130
are acquired. 95% are developmental cases. So it's much

302
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.179
more common than acquired, even though it's, it's interesting,

303
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.409
it took us so much longer to recognize the

304
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.409
existence of developmental prosopagnosia, probably because they didn't have

305
00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:56.450
the before and after that I was talking about.

306
00:15:57.349 --> 00:16:02.239
Um, BUT in kids with developmental prosopagnosia, it's very

307
00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:06.190
challenging because first off, the parents usually don't realize

308
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.539
that the child has prosopagnosia. Um, IT can be

309
00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:13.380
helpful when a parent themselves is prosopagnosic, so they

310
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.539
might be on the lookout for it, although we've

311
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:17.520
also heard from a number of people who've said,

312
00:16:17.979 --> 00:16:19.559
you know, I said to my mom, I can't

313
00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:22.669
recognize faces, and she said, nobody can recognize faces,

314
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.140
don't worry about it. Um, BUT the, the sort

315
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.500
of problems that these kids run into, they don't

316
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.159
know that they've got a particular problem, and they're

317
00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:34.020
in this sea of individuals who they have trouble

318
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.140
knowing who's who. Um, THEY tend to latch on

319
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.739
to people who are visually distinctive, or have something

320
00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:43.260
else, like an unusual voice, so they know who

321
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.090
that person is. And they can be seen as

322
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.250
defiant. So, you know, imagine a teacher asks a

323
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.130
student, hey, could you pass these assignments back to

324
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.679
your classmates? Well, they don't wanna do that, um,

325
00:16:55.809 --> 00:16:57.590
because they don't know who, who the people are,

326
00:16:57.929 --> 00:17:01.344
um, around them. So, it's, it's. It's very challenging

327
00:17:01.344 --> 00:17:04.973
and often it's a real eye-opener for the parents

328
00:17:04.973 --> 00:17:07.895
and then eventually the children, when they finally come

329
00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:11.015
to realize that the difficulties that the, the person

330
00:17:11.015 --> 00:17:13.694
is experiencing are due to problems with face recognition.

331
00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.614
It makes sense of lots of things for them.

332
00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:22.769
Right. So, and how can they distinguish between different

333
00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:25.298
people? I mean, of course, it's more limited than

334
00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:30.818
in normally developing children, but is it through voice

335
00:17:30.818 --> 00:17:34.538
that is through sound? ARE there any other cues

336
00:17:34.538 --> 00:17:35.629
that they're taking?

337
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.260
Yeah, so it's all the different channels that we

338
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.459
use to recognize people. Um, SO they do use

339
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:44.540
voice a lot. They'll also use, say just body,

340
00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:49.479
body shape, the way people move, um. Um, CONTEXT

341
00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:51.609
is often very important for them. So imagine you're

342
00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:54.280
in a small office and there's only 3 other

343
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.859
people in your office. You wouldn't have any difficulty

344
00:17:56.859 --> 00:17:59.160
recognizing the people if their face was covered because

345
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.680
there's lots of other information you could use to

346
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.359
figure out who that is. And developmental prosopagnosics become

347
00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:08.040
very good at using this information because they have

348
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.520
to rely on it. Um, uh, I had a

349
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.760
guy that I wrote my dissertation on a guy

350
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.439
named Bill Schozer who lived in San Francisco. And

351
00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:19.339
Bill grew up in a small town in the

352
00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:22.290
Ozark Mountains, where kids basically wore the same clothes

353
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.180
as in 1940s and 1950s. Kids wore the same

354
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.699
jeans every day. So Bill became a blue jeans

355
00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:31.829
specialist. He would focus on their pants, and he'd

356
00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.910
say, Oh, I know that that's Chuck cause he

357
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.859
wears that particular pair of pants. And even as

358
00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:39.180
an adult in the 90s when I was testing

359
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.500
Bill, he was still using jeans to recognize people.

360
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.170
And I remember one day we were walking along

361
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.770
chatting. And he said, well, last time you were

362
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.569
up here, you wore those 505s, and they had

363
00:18:49.569 --> 00:18:51.209
a little scuff in the back of the right

364
00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:52.599
leg. And so I got home and I checked,

365
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.369
and sure enough, there was a scuff in them.

366
00:18:54.449 --> 00:18:57.640
So, yeah, that people will often focus on particular

367
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.459
things that they can use reliably each time they

368
00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:01.329
encounter somebody.

369
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.709
Uh, AMONG the general population, what is the percentage

370
00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:11.150
of people who suffer from prosopagnosia?

371
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.689
Yeah, so if we think about that normal distribution

372
00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:16.880
I mentioned earlier, a face recognition ability. The people

373
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.599
with developmental prosopagnosia are going to be in one

374
00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:20.609
of the tails. Well, this is my tale, but

375
00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:22.319
for the viewers here will be over on this

376
00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:24.989
side. And, you know, where you draw the line

377
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:29.160
for what is prosopagnosia is subjective. There's no clear

378
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.439
cutoff. Uh, WHAT researchers have tended to do is

379
00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:36.560
look at that bottom 2% of the distribution. That's

380
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.339
who they tended to call, that's who we tend

381
00:19:38.339 --> 00:19:42.060
to call prosopagnosic. Now, are they really qualitatively different

382
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.969
than the people that 2.1%? Of course not, no.

383
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.260
And plus our, our measures are pretty noisy in

384
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.699
terms of categorizing people. There's always noise in any

385
00:19:50.699 --> 00:19:53.579
of these measures, but it's that group. So, so

386
00:19:53.579 --> 00:19:57.020
maybe something like 1 in 50 people have difficulties

387
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.260
that really affect them on a daily basis. So

388
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.900
if I give a talk to a decent sized

389
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.859
audience about prosopagnosia, it's very common for one or

390
00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:08.260
two people afterwards to come up and tell me

391
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.180
about experiences that they've had that sound like prosopagnosia.

392
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.959
So I asked you about the psychosocial impact of

393
00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:21.300
prosopagnosia during childhood. How about adulthood? I, I, what

394
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:27.119
is, uh, what are its psychosocial impacts on adults?

395
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.359
And I mean, are there differences between how it

396
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.430
affects children and adults?

397
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.739
Yeah, I wouldn't say there's, there are clear differences.

398
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:38.439
For the most part, similar sort of difficulties that

399
00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:41.680
adults have. Um, YOU know, in some ways, the

400
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.790
consequences. SOMETIMES can, or the, the effects of it

401
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.989
can be more consequential. I think about participants who

402
00:20:48.989 --> 00:20:53.630
I've tested, who look back at, say, missed romantic

403
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.910
opportunities. They walk past somebody that they're involved with,

404
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.839
and they don't recognize them, and the person takes

405
00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:03.589
it as a snub, and that blows up the

406
00:21:03.589 --> 00:21:07.109
relationship. Similarly, you know, you imagine you get into

407
00:21:07.109 --> 00:21:11.010
an elevator and your supervisors in there. And you

408
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.609
look right at them, don't recognize them, and don't

409
00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:16.329
acknowledge them. It doesn't go over well. People take

410
00:21:16.329 --> 00:21:19.489
it very personally when you don't acknowledge them. And

411
00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:24.209
so, um, it can be very difficult, particularly when

412
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:26.849
people don't realize that it's face recognition that they

413
00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:29.369
have a problem with, which might sound surprising to

414
00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:31.770
people, but, you know, you think of it say

415
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.489
similar to color deficiency, color, what people typically call

416
00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:37.770
color blindness. Um, YOU know, it's hard to know

417
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.489
that your perception of the world. IS different than

418
00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:43.770
other people's perception of the world. Many developmental prosopagnosics

419
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.680
will know something's off, but they don't know it's

420
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.170
specifically a problem with the face. When they don't

421
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.209
recognize people, they'll often attribute it to more general

422
00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:55.540
characteristics, sort of personality flaws. Maybe I just don't

423
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.380
care enough about people. Maybe I'm not trying hard

424
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.449
enough. And so, this is another time where learning

425
00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:04.650
about prosopagnosia is really useful for people, because they

426
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.410
realize it's just a little tweak in the visual

427
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.079
system that's causing their difficulties. It's not some character

428
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:09.489
flaw.

429
00:22:10.969 --> 00:22:16.329
Is there a link between social perception and loneliness?

430
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:19.819
Yeah, there is. So I was involved in a

431
00:22:19.819 --> 00:22:22.780
study and I had a fairly peripheral role in

432
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.060
this study, but uh Riotaca I published a paper

433
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.050
in I think it was 2012, and in there

434
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.930
we Measured loneliness in a group of typical participants,

435
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.939
so these are not prosopagnosics. And what we found

436
00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:39.699
is that if we looked at their just behavioral

437
00:22:39.699 --> 00:22:44.770
self-report measures of loneliness, that we found some um

438
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.420
structural differences in their left superior temporal sulcus, which

439
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.660
is a brain structure over here. Um, AND it

440
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.859
turned out that these individuals who are lonely also

441
00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:58.619
had more difficulty re carrying out social perception tasks

442
00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:02.969
like reading eye gaze, reading facial expressions. Um, THERE'S

443
00:23:02.969 --> 00:23:04.410
a bit of a chicken and egg problem. It's

444
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.770
not clear whether the neurological problems preceded the behavioral

445
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.170
difficulties that they had, or whether they just didn't

446
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.130
get enough practice doing these, and so they weren't

447
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.729
very good and then you didn't develop those areas,

448
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.199
but it seems like that's a contributor to loneliness,

449
00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:20.270
which I think in many ways makes sense. If

450
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.410
you're having trouble making sense of the social signals

451
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.930
around you, it's gonna be difficult, more difficult to

452
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.689
form those social bonds.

453
00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:30.420
So we've been talking about face perception. I would

454
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.099
also like to ask you a couple of questions

455
00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:37.300
now about, about face memory. In what ways does

456
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.300
one connect to the other? Does face perception connect

457
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.780
to face memory?

458
00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:46.489
Yeah, that's something that's maybe not as well understood

459
00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:47.729
as you would have hoped it would be at

460
00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:51.880
this point. Um, SO, of course, you know, face

461
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.010
perception takes place first. You need to generate a

462
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.609
percept of the face that you're seeing, and then

463
00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:59.170
you need to compare that percept to the faces

464
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.449
that you have stored in memory. Um, WHERE that

465
00:24:02.449 --> 00:24:07.160
goes on is not well understood. Um, WE do

466
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.040
have a good sense about when it takes place.

467
00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:11.680
We talked earlier about the temporal characteristics of phase

468
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.800
processing, and we can see that by 250 milliseconds

469
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.359
after a stimulus is presented, People are already matching

470
00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:23.119
the incoming percept to memories. We see that this

471
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.849
EEG component, there's a stronger response if the person

472
00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:29.119
is familiar with the face than if they're not

473
00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:31.130
familiar with the face. Whereas, let's say we go

474
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.050
back to 170 milliseconds, there's no difference between familiar

475
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.890
and unfamiliar faces. So, it, memory is brought into

476
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.530
things very quickly, probably in some of these temporal

477
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.290
lobe areas or almost certainly in some of these

478
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.530
temporal lobe areas. How that plays out though is

479
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.489
not well understood.

480
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:51.060
Is face memory also affected in prosopagnosia?

481
00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:56.150
Yeah, and in fact, Most people, when they're trying

482
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.829
to categorize people as prosopagnosic, do it based on

483
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.119
memory tests. So they, for example, we'll give them

484
00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:05.920
a famous face test. We show them 60 famous

485
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.680
faces one at a time, and when we show

486
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.599
them to them, we crop them. So it's just

487
00:25:09.599 --> 00:25:11.030
the internal part of the face. We don't want

488
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.359
to have hair, for example, it's something they can

489
00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:16.910
use to identify them. Um. So we use face

490
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.390
memory tests. An awful lot of prosopagnosics though, also

491
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.660
have difficulties with face perception. So that proceeding step,

492
00:25:24.829 --> 00:25:28.310
we even see prosopagnosics who have difficulty with what

493
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.310
we think of as a step that precedes face

494
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.520
perception, which is face detection. And by face detection,

495
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.400
we just mean the sort of somewhere in your

496
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.760
visual field, there's a face and your visual system

497
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.439
detects the presence of that. And I think we've

498
00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.670
all had that experience where, you know, you get

499
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.030
the sense that someone is out in your periphery,

500
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:47.040
and you turn and you look and you, your

501
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.000
visual system is detected, the existence of a face

502
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.290
out there. Um, SO, memory is how we categorize

503
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.839
people, but a lot have perceptual problems.

504
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.729
Can prosopagnosia be improved in any way?

505
00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:03.819
Yeah, that's something that a number of labs have

506
00:26:03.819 --> 00:26:07.410
looked at. Joe Degutis down in Boston, Jason Barton

507
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.859
out in Vancouver. Um, THERE have been some encouraging

508
00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:16.020
results, so modest improvements with training, so people say,

509
00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:19.300
get on a computer, they spend 40 minutes making

510
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.300
decisions about faces, and what you find is that

511
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.459
they tend to do better on tests after that

512
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.060
than they did before. They also do better with

513
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.109
um Control groups that didn't do that sort of

514
00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:35.310
testing, but did the pre-testing. The problem with these

515
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.630
results is that they tend to be pretty small

516
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.150
boosts, and they also don't persist. So, there's a

517
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.910
lot more work to be done when it comes

518
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.150
to improving face recognition in, in, in prosopagnosia.

519
00:26:48.439 --> 00:26:53.300
So, let's move on then to Prosopo metamorphos. Uh,

520
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.609
WHAT is it?

521
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.819
Yeah, so this is something I'm very excited about.

522
00:26:57.829 --> 00:27:01.300
My lab's been studying. Well, we first studied PMO

523
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.390
15 years ago or so, and we heard from

524
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.040
a woman who got in touch with us because

525
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.709
she told us that she was seeing distortions when

526
00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:10.819
she would look at a face. So, the shape

527
00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:13.739
of the face would change as she looked at

528
00:27:13.739 --> 00:27:17.780
it, and it would become extremely distorted, um. For

529
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.699
her, we've done a lot of work with her

530
00:27:19.699 --> 00:27:22.339
over the years. It's only faces. That's the only

531
00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:25.349
thing that will distort on her. Um, EVERYTHING else

532
00:27:25.349 --> 00:27:28.750
is, is, um, normal. As she looks at the

533
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.229
face, the face becomes more and more distorted over

534
00:27:31.229 --> 00:27:34.069
time, um, so that, say by 10 seconds, it's

535
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:38.380
just a, a mess. Um, AND so that was,

536
00:27:38.589 --> 00:27:40.869
we published a paper on her in 2014, and

537
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:44.420
then I got involved with a colleague of mine,

538
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.349
uh, George Almeida, who's actually in Queenra, um, and

539
00:27:48.349 --> 00:27:50.920
he was working with a 59 year old man

540
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.869
who'd had a stroke. And this stroke left him

541
00:27:53.869 --> 00:27:57.430
with what we call hemi PMO. So, most PMO,

542
00:27:57.489 --> 00:28:00.630
if the distortions affect the whole face. In this

543
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.260
individual, it was just half of the face. So,

544
00:28:03.469 --> 00:28:05.630
one half of the face looked normal, one half

545
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.209
of the face was usually was drooping. And um,

546
00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:11.859
so George and I um wrote a paper about

547
00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:14.469
this guy. And after that paper was published, heard

548
00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:16.660
from a few more people who had, was having

549
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.020
these were having face distortions. So my lab created

550
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.339
the website, I think it was 2021, and we've

551
00:28:23.339 --> 00:28:25.739
now heard from about 200 people around the world

552
00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:29.219
who have face distortions. So, it turns out there's

553
00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:30.420
a good number of these people out there. If

554
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.260
you look in the neurological literature, maybe there's 75

555
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.020
to 80 cases that have been published over the

556
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.569
last 125 years. But these individuals are out there

557
00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:40.670
and as you can imagine, if you're looking at

558
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.660
a face and it's severely distorted, it's really disturbing.

559
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.550
And so this is a, a really difficult condition

560
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.869
to live with. It's also a condition we think

561
00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:53.589
that's gonna provide a really interesting window into how

562
00:28:53.589 --> 00:28:55.069
normal face perception works.

563
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.489
So is it less common than prosopagnosia?

564
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.410
It's far less common. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know,

565
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.729
before we've got this special face distortions website now

566
00:29:06.729 --> 00:29:11.010
to find people. But in the 20 some years

567
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.130
before we had that website, we have this site

568
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.369
where we hear from prosopagnosics, we heard from like

569
00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:18.300
20,000 people. I think we heard from two people

570
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.880
who had face distortions during that time. So I

571
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.219
think We would have been hearing from more people

572
00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:25.420
if it was more common. Yeah, I think it's

573
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.219
very uncommon.

574
00:29:27.219 --> 00:29:28.989
And what causes it?

575
00:29:30.189 --> 00:29:32.630
That's something that we don't have a great understanding

576
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.510
of. One working hypothesis we have is that often

577
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:42.040
these distortions are caused by Deterioration or damage to

578
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.089
the connections between the face areas within the face

579
00:29:45.089 --> 00:29:46.660
network. So we talked earlier about how there are

580
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.060
these different face selective areas. Of course, they're connected

581
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.969
up with one another. In the people that we've

582
00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:55.000
been able to bring here to Dartmouth and scan,

583
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.530
we've seen that a substantial percentage of them have

584
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.770
what we call white matter abnormalities. So the white

585
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.479
matter, the cells that wrap around these connections, um,

586
00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:06.930
you see something similar when you look in the

587
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.739
literature, um, Of the people who have hemi PMOs

588
00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:14.180
are just distortions that affect one half of the

589
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.819
face. More than half of those people have white

590
00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:20.530
matter abnormalities in the connection that connects the left

591
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.339
and right hemisphere visual regions, including that, that man

592
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:27.579
from Queenber who we, who we tested. Um, SO,

593
00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:30.199
This is probably not true. This is too simple

594
00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:33.339
a story, but you could imagine that white matter

595
00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:37.979
damage causes face distortions, whereas when there's damage specifically

596
00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:41.099
to a face selective area, then you result in

597
00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:42.660
it results in prosopagnosia.

598
00:30:43.489 --> 00:30:49.229
Right. Uh, FROM a neuroscientific and psychological perspective, in

599
00:30:49.229 --> 00:30:53.959
what ways does prosopal metamorphosia differ from prosopagnosia?

600
00:30:54.979 --> 00:30:59.300
Yeah, so It has a lot of advantage PMO

601
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.500
that is with Posopo metamorphosy because we don't wanna

602
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.020
say that long word every time, so we call

603
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.739
it PMO. Um, PMO has a lot of interesting

604
00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:11.209
advantages when it comes to Sort of addressing theoretical

605
00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:15.979
questions. One is that their distortions are so salient

606
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.489
that you really only need a couple trials to

607
00:31:18.489 --> 00:31:20.209
find out if they see a distortion to a

608
00:31:20.209 --> 00:31:23.369
particular type of stimulus. Um, SO one of the

609
00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:26.050
big questions that I've been interested in throughout my

610
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.849
career has been understanding if there are mechanisms that

611
00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:31.530
are specialized just for faces. And I've been talking

612
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.170
about them as if they, they exist, and I

613
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.079
do believe they exist, but it's still a matter

614
00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:39.109
of debate within the literature. Um, IF I have

615
00:31:39.109 --> 00:31:42.239
somebody with prosopagnosia and I were to ask them,

616
00:31:42.469 --> 00:31:47.349
do you have difficulty recognizing tools? Well, it's hard

617
00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:50.180
for them to know the answer to that question.

618
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.630
Um, uh, AND then, so if I want to

619
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.949
find that out, I need to run them on

620
00:31:53.949 --> 00:31:55.869
a test that's probably gonna take 10 minutes to

621
00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:58.780
run. On the other hand, if somebody has face

622
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.979
distortions, uh, I say, I want you to look

623
00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:04.000
at this hammer here. I want you to tell

624
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.520
me, do you see a distortion? Um, THEY can

625
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.479
immediately look at it and tell me very quickly

626
00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:10.849
whether they see a distortion or not. And so,

627
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.400
we've got data that we've recently collected where we

628
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.680
show individuals with PMO 1000 objects. So we've got

629
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.479
500 categories, 2 examples each. And so we're able

630
00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:23.069
to move through 500 categories within a couple hours

631
00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:25.630
with these individuals. We're also at the same time,

632
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.719
making sure that they're having distortions to faces while

633
00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:30.869
they're looking at these objects, and they, they are.

634
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.859
And so it provides us to much more thoroughly

635
00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:38.780
sample object space. And so when we find individuals

636
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.680
who see distortions to all 100 faces, we presented

637
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.250
them, and no distortions to any of the 1000

638
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.609
objects. And they also report, yeah, I've had this

639
00:32:48.609 --> 00:32:51.060
condition for 14 years, and I've never seen a

640
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.729
distortion in a, in an object. I always see

641
00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:57.180
distortions in faces. It's really powerful evidence for the

642
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.140
existence of face-specific processes.

643
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.959
Does the intensity of face distortions vary depending on

644
00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:08.979
the context or on the stimulus in PMO?

645
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.930
Yeah, so we've been surprised. We've stumbled across a

646
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.719
couple ways that we can influence people's distortions. Um,

647
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.010
A very simple 11 day, one of my PhD

648
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.849
students was talking to a guy who has faced

649
00:33:22.849 --> 00:33:27.290
distortions, and He, he, he showed him a face,

650
00:33:27.319 --> 00:33:29.819
and the face happened to have eyeglasses on. So

651
00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:31.689
he's looking at the face, he's got eyeglasses on,

652
00:33:31.979 --> 00:33:36.020
and the guy said, no, no distortion there. And

653
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.420
Antonio was surprised and said, Hmm, no distortion, huh?

654
00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:42.420
Whereas cause he'd been consistently seeing distortions. And the

655
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.979
participants said, Well, yeah, he's got glasses on. I've

656
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:47.619
noticed I don't see distortions on faces that have

657
00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:49.780
glasses. And this is somebody who's got full face

658
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.930
distortions, so it's not just, say, around the eye

659
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:56.739
region. Um, SO we've now tested several people who

660
00:33:56.739 --> 00:34:00.900
show substantial reduction in how strongly they see distortions

661
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.099
when eyeglasses are present. So that's kind of a

662
00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:05.819
simple, easy way for people in daily life to

663
00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:07.660
reduce their distortion. And we don't understand why that's

664
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.208
happening, and we need to look into it more.

665
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.340
Another thing that we've done more thorough work on

666
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.899
is the effect of color filters on face distortions.

667
00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:21.299
Um, SO we've tested a few people who, if

668
00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:24.569
they look at a face through a green filter,

669
00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:28.399
their distortions are substantially reduced. On the other hand,

670
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.040
if they look through a red filter, their distortions

671
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.909
are amplified. Um, AND in fact, we looked across

672
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.520
the spectrum, and they show these kind of nice

673
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.370
sort of Linar patterns as you move through the

674
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:43.360
color through color space, um. And what it looks

675
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.770
like in those two, it's sort of roughly red,

676
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.478
green, you can think of it's not quite cyan

677
00:34:47.478 --> 00:34:50.080
is actually the worst color for one individual. Then

678
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.000
we've got another woman who we work with, who

679
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.708
lives here in the US who we brought up.

680
00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:56.830
She shows the opposite pattern. So for her now,

681
00:34:57.379 --> 00:35:00.239
red is, sorry, I should be doing it this

682
00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:04.360
way, red reduces distortions and green amplifies distortions. What

683
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.040
we haven't found is anybody whose distortions are influenced

684
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.110
by the blue yellow dimension. This is, I don't

685
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.030
know that you want me to go into this,

686
00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.709
but there's basically two dimensions in color. And so

687
00:35:14.709 --> 00:35:16.790
we're seeing that only one of those two dimensions

688
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.189
seems to influence phase perception, which fits nicely with

689
00:35:20.189 --> 00:35:22.939
the theory about sort of why we, why we

690
00:35:22.939 --> 00:35:26.350
evolved a third um cone for, for color percept

691
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.669
for color perception. But, um, so that's been a

692
00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:32.219
real surprise to us that color would influence these

693
00:35:32.629 --> 00:35:35.949
shape distortions strongly. Um, THE last thing that we

694
00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:40.229
found in some people is that The asymmetries in

695
00:35:40.229 --> 00:35:42.830
the face, in between the two halves of the

696
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.830
face, often drive distortions. So if we show an

697
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.510
individual a perfectly symmetric face that we've created in

698
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.310
the lab where we flip one half of the

699
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.360
face over. We sometimes find that individuals say, my

700
00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.840
distortions are much weaker for that face, or they'll

701
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.840
even say, I'm not having any distortions, um, when

702
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.719
they see that perfectly symmetric face. So there's something's

703
00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:06.479
happening in the visual system when these asymmetries are

704
00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:06.879
present.

705
00:36:07.919 --> 00:36:10.840
So tell us more about that bit that you

706
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.840
mentioned about uh why we evolved the first cone

707
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.120
for color perception and how does that connect to

708
00:36:20.419 --> 00:36:21.520
face perception?

709
00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:28.229
Sure, yeah. So, so, um. Primates, because we went

710
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:33.350
through a long nocturnal phase, so many, so if

711
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.870
you look at most vertebrates, they have 4 different

712
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.929
photoreceptors that are used for color vision. Um, HOWEVER,

713
00:36:40.229 --> 00:36:43.020
primates went through a long nocturnal phase, and during

714
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.709
that nocturnal phase, we lost two of the photoreceptors.

715
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.310
So we were down to two different photoreceptors. So

716
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:55.340
we had considerably reduced, um, uh, color sensitivity. Um,

717
00:36:55.610 --> 00:37:00.389
AND then though, something like 25 million years ago

718
00:37:00.389 --> 00:37:04.070
or so, a third photoreceptor emote, and that, that's

719
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.830
what we still have. We have 3 different cone

720
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.270
types in our visual system. And it's not clear

721
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.629
what the selection pressures were that drove the emergence

722
00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:14.310
of this third cone type and, and as well

723
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.040
as the processing to, to make sense of that.

724
00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.389
Um, ONE hypothesis that has been around for a

725
00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:23.429
long time is that it's important for sort of

726
00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:26.590
seeing the difference between foliage in the background behind

727
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.810
fruit. Um, AND so this is one that's important

728
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.129
for foraging, and that may well be a factor

729
00:37:32.129 --> 00:37:34.060
in it, a good chance it is in fact.

730
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.850
Um, ANOTHER hypothesis, so that came along roughly 20

731
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:43.219
years ago is that This third photoreceptor emerged in

732
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:45.260
order to help us make sense of information and

733
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.500
faces and social perception more generally. Um, AND so,

734
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.050
Um, and that bit, that, that new photoreceptor allowed

735
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.570
us to make sense of red-green differences. And there

736
00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.290
are a lot of red differences within the face

737
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.229
that we're able to read and make sense of.

738
00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:03.810
And you also see other primates like mangils, for

739
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.919
example, will have skin patches back on their hips

740
00:38:07.129 --> 00:38:09.689
that show different colors that Um, we would be

741
00:38:09.689 --> 00:38:12.040
able to make sense of with that 3rd photoreceptor.

742
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:15.330
So this is a social perception hypothesis. And so

743
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.969
what this hypothesis suggests is that that the red-green

744
00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:23.090
dimension is particularly closely tied to face and social

745
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.379
perception more generally. And so, thus, it wouldn't be

746
00:38:26.379 --> 00:38:30.610
surprising if there's some special sort of modulation that

747
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:34.010
the red-green dimension can have on face perception if

748
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.729
they evolved in tandem with one another.

749
00:38:36.669 --> 00:38:40.189
And is there good scientific evidence to support that

750
00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:42.300
that hypothesis.

751
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.909
Depends what you consider good. I think it's pretty

752
00:38:44.909 --> 00:38:48.469
good. So, um, there's a really interesting finding from

753
00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:51.949
Bevil Conway's lab. Um, AGAIN, this is a little

754
00:38:51.949 --> 00:38:54.469
complicated to explain, but what you do is you

755
00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:57.010
put people into an environment in which there's only

756
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.219
one wavelength that's illuminating it. And when you put

757
00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:03.929
these are sodium lamps that generate this single wavelength.

758
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.419
And when you get into this environment, everything looks

759
00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:08.620
yellow. Um, THAT would be true for the mug

760
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.300
I was holding up. My shirt would have something

761
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.820
of a yellow glow, but there's one exception to

762
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.340
this, and that's the face. The human face in

763
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.449
these in these environments looks a little bit green.

764
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.860
Um, AND even if you look at compare, say

765
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.469
the neck, um, the neck doesn't look green. The

766
00:39:28.469 --> 00:39:30.949
the skin on our hands doesn't look green. So

767
00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:33.110
there's just something about the way the face is

768
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:36.590
processed in this unusual color environment that suggests there's

769
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:40.669
something different about the red-green dimension, um, for the

770
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:43.310
face than for all other aspects of the visual

771
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.780
world that we're trying to make sense of.

772
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.370
So is it the case that in certain cases

773
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.610
PMO affects the whole face and in other cases

774
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.159
it only affects certain individual facial features?

775
00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:02.729
Yeah, that's right. I've already mentioned that some people

776
00:40:02.729 --> 00:40:05.010
have distortions just one half or another where the

777
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.929
vertical meridian of the face seems to be an

778
00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:10.699
important representational division. But we also see people who

779
00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.500
have distortions limited to maybe just the mouth. We're

780
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.820
getting ready to submit a paper, but a, a

781
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.520
gentleman who's got mouth-specific distortions. And um You might

782
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.439
imagine that, well, maybe it's just the lower half

783
00:40:22.439 --> 00:40:24.149
of the face, but what we do with him,

784
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.610
we turn the faces, let's say 90 degrees, 180

785
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.669
degrees, and it's still only the mouth that's distorting,

786
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.439
despite the fact that when we turn the face

787
00:40:32.439 --> 00:40:35.239
180 degrees, now the mouth region is actually on

788
00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:38.120
the top of the stimulus, but that's what's distorting

789
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.639
for him and say not the eyes, which are

790
00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:42.760
now on the bottom. So, it's a mouth-specific distortion

791
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.969
for him. What he'll see. He'll see shape distortions

792
00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:48.570
to the mouth. He'll also see duplications of, say,

793
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.050
a row of teeth, and sometimes he'll see the

794
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.729
duplication of the mouth that he saw. So imagine

795
00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:56.050
somebody's face is in one particular viewpoint, then it

796
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.129
shifts. He'll see that mouth that he was viewing

797
00:40:59.129 --> 00:41:01.729
a second ago, and he'll also see the mouth

798
00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:04.330
that he's actually currently perceiving. So you'll see two

799
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.290
mouths simultaneously. It doesn't last long, but it's very

800
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.560
salient to him, of course.

801
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:14.120
Right, and can PMO be improved in any way?

802
00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:19.629
Well, these manipulations I mentioned, you know, eyeglasses, color,

803
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:22.070
I don't know what you do with symmetry, um,

804
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.000
at this point, but, so yeah, those are things.

805
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.469
So we work with a guy in South Africa

806
00:41:26.469 --> 00:41:29.909
whose distortions are reduced by green and cyan. Well,

807
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.479
he actually had some green lights installed in his

808
00:41:33.479 --> 00:41:37.159
house. Um, AND he'll ask people, if they don't

809
00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:39.629
mind, to just keep their eyeglasses on, for example,

810
00:41:39.879 --> 00:41:42.070
because it reduces the distortions in their faces and,

811
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.909
you know, people usually don't mind doing that. So

812
00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:46.239
it's simple ways sometimes that you can, you can

813
00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:48.879
help people. We also have a gentleman who we've

814
00:41:48.879 --> 00:41:52.750
done testing with who, like the South African man.

815
00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.080
His distortions are reduced by green colors, and he

816
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.790
has some green tinted glasses that he had made.

817
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.719
And if he's gonna go into a crowd, where

818
00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.370
there are gonna be a lot of people, he'll

819
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.949
wear these green glasses so that he's not surrounded

820
00:42:05.949 --> 00:42:07.629
by what he calls demons.

821
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.550
Right. So, I have one last question then. Can

822
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:17.149
we learn more about how face perception and representation

823
00:42:17.149 --> 00:42:22.229
work by studying conditions like prosopagnosia and PMO? And

824
00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:25.350
if so, what can we learn exactly?

825
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.310
Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of what my

826
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.350
lab does, um. Let me just give you a

827
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.429
few examples from PMO because I think these are

828
00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:35.790
easier to understand. Um, I mean, I mentioned the

829
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.820
face specificity, which has been a major theoretical question.

830
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.909
I think that's an easily understood one. With the

831
00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:44.590
gentleman from Queensboro, what we did with him as

832
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.270
well as I mentioned the South African guy, they've

833
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.510
got very similar sort of distortions, limited to just

834
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.959
one half of the face. There's, there's been a

835
00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:56.110
hypothesis for a long time that um when we

836
00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:59.639
encounter a face, we represent that face, and then

837
00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:03.110
we fit it into a template, a face template

838
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.479
that other faces that we've seen in the past

839
00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:08.040
have also been fit to. And because the faces

840
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.919
have been standardized, it makes it easier to compare

841
00:43:10.919 --> 00:43:14.520
your current percept of the face to previously seen

842
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.800
faces because it's easier to computationally to compare, contrast

843
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.290
those two faces. Um, SO that's an idea that's

844
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.000
been out there, but there hadn't been much good

845
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.090
evidence for it. So, to look at this question

846
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.290
about whether faces are fit into this template, what

847
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.719
we did with this guy who had hemi PMO,

848
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.090
we presented faces to him in a wide variety

849
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.250
of ways, but sort of the clearest and easiest

850
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.360
to understand is we presented them at different orientations.

851
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.649
And what we found is, let's say we're looking

852
00:43:41.649 --> 00:43:44.050
at upright face, and he's got distortions on this

853
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.530
side. As we turned the face, the distortions stuck

854
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.739
to that side. We turn it now we turn

855
00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:53.350
180 degrees. Now the distortions are actually on the

856
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.989
other side of the face, but it's still the

857
00:43:54.989 --> 00:43:57.669
same parts of the face. And so what that

858
00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:00.270
indicates is, when he sees a face, regardless of

859
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:03.989
whether it's upright, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, that face

860
00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:07.550
is somehow normalized and fit into a template, and

861
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.149
then he's got something's not working on one half

862
00:44:10.149 --> 00:44:14.044
of those um templates and That's what generates this

863
00:44:14.044 --> 00:44:16.875
distortion. So that was the first really clear evidence

864
00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:20.475
that we have these what are called face-centered representations,

865
00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:24.155
um, in our visual system. Another really simple thing,

866
00:44:24.314 --> 00:44:25.885
and if you look at these individuals who have

867
00:44:25.885 --> 00:44:29.135
hemi PMO, the fact that we see this division,

868
00:44:29.645 --> 00:44:32.004
that indicates the left half and the right half

869
00:44:32.004 --> 00:44:35.560
of the face are processed separately. Within the visual

870
00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.520
system. And not only that, there's good reason to

871
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.850
think that if I'm out looking at a face,

872
00:44:40.919 --> 00:44:43.280
the face that I'm seeing that's on my right

873
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.159
is processed in my left hemisphere, and the face

874
00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:48.719
that I'm seeing in my left is processed in

875
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.399
the right hemisphere. And we can see that just

876
00:44:50.399 --> 00:44:53.040
based on when people have lesions to just one

877
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.010
side or the other. If somebody's got a lesion

878
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.189
in the left hemisphere, and they've got a hemi

879
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:01.120
face distortion, so only affecting one half, it's always

880
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.439
on the right side. Um, AND so that what

881
00:45:04.439 --> 00:45:06.550
that suggests, and this is a pretty radical idea

882
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.350
that the left hemisphere is not used to represent

883
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.959
the left side of the face. This left right

884
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:14.229
is confusing I'm sure for your listeners here, but

885
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.239
hopefully people are getting a sense for what I'm

886
00:45:16.239 --> 00:45:17.040
trying to convey.

887
00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:21.639
Yeah, sure. So, before we go, where can people

888
00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.870
find your work on the internet?

889
00:45:24.399 --> 00:45:27.330
Yeah, so if people are interested in prosopagnosia, they

890
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:32.229
could go to faceblind.org. And um I think our

891
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:37.429
PMO site is facelind.org/PMO, but I'm not 100% sure,

892
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.870
so I would just say search for Prosopo metamorphopsia

893
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.110
or even just face distortions and Duchaine, my last

894
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.939
name, and they'll be able to find our website.

895
00:45:46.979 --> 00:45:49.780
It comes up pretty clearly, uh, pretty high up

896
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.820
in the search results.

897
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.179
Great. So, Doctor Duchen, thank you so much for
