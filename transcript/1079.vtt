00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.760
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops and

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.520
the Mgen by Doctor Christopher Federico. He's professor of

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.149
Political Science and psychology at the University of Minnesota.

5
00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.639
And today we're talking about political preferences, ideological belief

6
00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:23.219
systems, collective narcissism, conspiracy thinking, ideological uncertainty, and some

7
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.760
other related topics. So, Doctor Federico, welcome to the

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.610
show. It's a huge pleasure for everyone.

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.389
Oh, thanks for having me.

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.389
So, I would like to start here with the

11
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:39.189
topic of political preferences. So when studying the foundations

12
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.549
of political preferences, where do you start? I mean,

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.590
what factors do you look into?

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.419
Well, to make sense of this, uh, you really

15
00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:50.979
need to look at two sets of factors. Uh,

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.979
ONE, we generally refer to as bottom-up factors. So

17
00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.299
these are really sort of characteristics of individuals, their

18
00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.299
psychological needs, traits, and motives. Uh, THAT might attract

19
00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.220
them to this or that political view. Uh, IN

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.099
some cases, these traits may stand in for other

21
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.250
things we can observe, but, uh, at some level,

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
the basic ideas that are their characteristics that we

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.099
hold as individuals, um, or that might reflect our

24
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:23.379
immediate situations that sort of predispose people to gravitate

25
00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:27.500
toward this or that, uh, political identity or political

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.730
preference. So that's one part of it. Uh, ANOTHER

27
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.599
part of it is what you might call, uh,

28
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.769
top-down forces or top down variables. So these are

29
00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.489
things like the nature of the political culture that

30
00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.680
you live in, um, the groups that you are

31
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.050
a part of in the political world, so say

32
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.300
political parties and what have you. Uh, AND in

33
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.879
particular the role of what, uh, political scientists call

34
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.599
political elites. So, party leaders, intellectuals, media figures, pundits,

35
00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.050
and what have you that uh sort of model,

36
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.500
uh, the packages of beliefs that make up this

37
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.410
or that party's idea or a particular ideology, um,

38
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.718
as we might call it, um. And, uh, what

39
00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:14.839
a lot of the work that me and some

40
00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.958
of the people I work with have shown is

41
00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.589
that, you know, these individual differences, the bottom-up factors,

42
00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:24.119
they may very well predispose people to adopt this

43
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.460
or that political identity or be attracted to. This

44
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.100
or that political preference, but, um, really, uh, the

45
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.850
menu of choices that people have to draw from,

46
00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.740
that's sort of a, a top-down process. A lot

47
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.699
of that is constructed by political elites. Uh, THEY

48
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.899
don't spring from people's heads, um, really, uh, your

49
00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.220
society and particularly in particular political leaders within it

50
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.960
kind of offer you a menu of options. And

51
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.949
the extent to which you map your own, uh,

52
00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.039
sort of individual needs, traits, and motives onto certain

53
00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.509
types of political preferences has to do with how

54
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.630
much attention you pay, uh, to mainstream political discourse,

55
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.050
uh, to political leaders and what have you. So

56
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.050
really it's a combination of top-down and bottom-up factors

57
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.440
and other variables that kind of determine the extent

58
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.649
to which people make a connection between the two.

59
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.380
OK. So uh talking specifically about liberal and conservative

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.020
attitudes, do we know where broad-based liberal and conservative

61
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.570
attitude packages stem from? I mean, why is it

62
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.979
that apparently some people hold broadly liberal worldviews and

63
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.940
other people hold broadly conservative worldviews?

64
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.639
Well, there are a variety of answers to that

65
00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.580
and uh some of these answers, you know, focus

66
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.740
again more on the bottom up type variables, needs,

67
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.179
traits and motives that we have as individuals and

68
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:57.119
that, you know, Different individuals have different versions of,

69
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.309
um, uh, other people kind of focus more on

70
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:05.580
uh the bottom or the top-down aspect of this.

71
00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.110
Um, MY own approach kind of again, you know,

72
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.830
focuses on, uh, both of these things. Uh, SO

73
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.350
part of what is going on here is really

74
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.459
how do political leaders operating under certain Social and

75
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:28.829
historical circumstances, how do they combine different packages of

76
00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:34.059
policies, values, uh, broad social and political goals, and

77
00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:38.089
what have you. So, uh, to some extent, uh,

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.540
the packages or the ideological packages of beliefs that,

79
00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:46.179
uh, we call liberalism and conservatism or left or

80
00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:49.019
right, um, you know, they're a function of the

81
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.980
particular societies we live in. Uh, SO if you

82
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.179
look in particular at English speaking countries and many

83
00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:01.459
Western European countries, uh, you have what might be

84
00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.260
regarded as sort of the standard left versus right

85
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.010
package. So, you know, you have um a right

86
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.380
or a set of conservative, uh, political forces that,

87
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.950
um, Tend to, uh, want stability, tradition, order, and

88
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.480
what have you, and are more comfortable with society

89
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.869
being organized in a hierarchical fashion. Um, uh, ON

90
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.750
the other hand, uh, you traditionally have, uh, a

91
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.619
left. Uh, WHICH is more open to change, which

92
00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:38.980
is more interested in, uh, reducing hierarchy and, uh,

93
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:43.459
achieving equality, and that's really sort of the organization

94
00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.779
of the organization of political competition you see much

95
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.779
in the western world. Uh, OUR understanding of left

96
00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.940
versus right really kind of goes back to the

97
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.510
French Revolution, um, uh, in many respects. Now, uh,

98
00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:00.750
well that is very much how uh political debate

99
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.109
and political conflict is organized, uh, particularly among leaders

100
00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:08.440
and elites and very highly engaged people, uh, again

101
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.709
in Western Europe and also in many English-speaking countries,

102
00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.640
it's not universal throughout the globe. Uh, ONCE you

103
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.440
get outside those parts of the globe, uh, you

104
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.019
don't always consistently. Say, uh, say a preference for

105
00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.760
more uh economic in more economic equality and greater

106
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.779
government intervention in the economy paired with what we

107
00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.260
might call social and cultural liberalism. That really sorts,

108
00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.940
uh, sort of breaks down. So part of the

109
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.779
extent to which we see the traditional left and

110
00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:43.820
right packages grouped together, really, you know, it, it

111
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.290
depends on particular social circumstances. Now, uh, in terms

112
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.109
of how individuals Map their own needs, traits, and

113
00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:54.700
motives onto that and get attracted to a liberal

114
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.269
or a conservative viewpoint. Uh, REALLY the exact way

115
00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:01.149
that happens sort of depends on the society you're

116
00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.989
in. So, um, you know, political psychologists and social

117
00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:10.320
psychologists have really studied this. Um, THEY initially studied

118
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.720
it the most in Western European societies in America

119
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.359
and Great Britain, traditionally what was found there is,

120
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.660
um, If uh you have traits that are more

121
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.369
what we would call uh closed or that emphasize

122
00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.140
uh a need for certainty and security, the more

123
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.980
likely you are to be attracted to uh conservative

124
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.230
ideologies. The idea there is that um conservatism by

125
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.709
retaining the status quo provides people with certainty in

126
00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:44.950
order that they might not otherwise have if they

127
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.350
were more open to change. And the reverse goes

128
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.070
for people who are, say, more open, um, and

129
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.100
whose needs for certainty and security are not quite

130
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.470
as strong. Um, THEY will be more amenable to

131
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.910
the left, to liberalism, to change, to openness and

132
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.690
what have you. And we have a lot of

133
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.880
evidence for that, uh, in particular societies. Uh, THAT

134
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.350
said, uh, there are some, uh, limits to that,

135
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.320
even in the kind of society where you have

136
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.799
that sort of tradition, very traditional left-right structure. So

137
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:26.480
one thing we find is that, uh, if you

138
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.320
look at these traits at the individual level that

139
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.729
represents, say, high needs for certainty and security. Um,

140
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.489
THEY really align only with certain kinds of conservative

141
00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:42.008
preferences more than others. Uh, SO in particular, we

142
00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:45.888
find that variables that represent needs for certainty and

143
00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:49.328
security, personality traits, basically, uh, they tend to predict

144
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:54.479
social and cultural conservatism, so religious conservatism, moral conservatism,

145
00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:57.629
uh, wanting traditional values and what have you. Uh,

146
00:08:57.729 --> 00:09:01.284
THE relationship. Between, uh, having a strong need for

147
00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:06.844
certainty and security and say, uh, wanting more market-oriented

148
00:09:06.844 --> 00:09:10.804
form of economics versus a more distributive redistributive form

149
00:09:10.804 --> 00:09:14.484
of economics, that is far weaker and, uh, we

150
00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:17.234
find that, you know, the nature of that relationship,

151
00:09:17.674 --> 00:09:20.645
uh, in the economic realm really kind of depends

152
00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:24.159
on how much attention you pay to politics. So,

153
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:28.130
uh, that relationship is not universal, uh, and the

154
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.169
other thing is it kind of again, uh, once

155
00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:36.369
you leave Western European society, English speaking societies, uh,

156
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.969
you get some very different patterns.

157
00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:43.080
Mhm. So, I would like to ask you now

158
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.630
about ideological belief systems because it's political attitudes are

159
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.070
one thing, but then we also have the sort

160
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:55.229
of packages of policy preferences that uh come together

161
00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:58.400
into ideological belief systems. But I would like to

162
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.400
ask you about one specific kind of view because

163
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.760
I think there are many here of uh ideological

164
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.400
belief systems that is the elite driven view of

165
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.989
them. So could you tell us about it and

166
00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:13.830
more generally, what do you think about it?

167
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.859
Uh, IDEOLOGICAL belief systems,

168
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:20.919
uh, yeah, and then n view of them.

169
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.059
OK, so, um, you know, the question is where

170
00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:30.809
do what we call ideologies come from, um, what

171
00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:34.059
undergirds them, uh, and, you know, you might as

172
00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:37.219
well define this ahead of time, and ideology is

173
00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:41.940
really sort of a network of associated, uh, issue

174
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.919
preferences, values, and identities. That have been grouped together

175
00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.960
for some reason. So again, we talked a little

176
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.159
bit earlier about, you know, what makes the left

177
00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.159
the left and the right the right in many

178
00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:58.299
societies. Traditionally, in, in Western society, the notion of

179
00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:01.719
the right, for example, is a combination of preferring

180
00:11:01.719 --> 00:11:04.989
tradition, order, and security on one hand and being

181
00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:08.919
more amenable to certain forms of inequality or hierarchy

182
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:11.400
on the other. So why, why are those things

183
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.059
tied together? And, uh, I think the argument that

184
00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:19.159
most political scientists would make is that, um, you

185
00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:21.580
know, when we try to figure out why are

186
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.580
these things slotted together or packaged together as ideologies,

187
00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:31.179
it's not necessarily that there's some intrinsic logical relation

188
00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:36.000
between, uh, different, uh, beliefs. System elements, as we

189
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.119
would call it. So, you know, why is there

190
00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:41.840
any logical reason that, uh, people would want a

191
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.799
combination of very, very low taxes on the wealthy

192
00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:50.559
and, uh, more restriction of abortion? It's not entirely

193
00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.960
clear, and, uh, this point was famously made by

194
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.590
a political scientist. Uh, NAMED Philip Converse, um, you

195
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.700
know, who said that if we want to understand

196
00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:04.469
why belief systems hang together or why ideologies fit

197
00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:07.780
together, uh, a lot of it is due to

198
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:12.500
the norms established by political leaders. So in particular,

199
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.030
he emphasized, and a lot of other political scientists

200
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.640
emphasized party leaders. Uh, PARTY leaders packaged together different

201
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.000
sets of issue positions, values, themes, identities, and what

202
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
have you. And the question is why do they

203
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.229
do this and how do they do this? Well,

204
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.280
you know, that is something, uh, that I think

205
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.960
in many respects is looked at in strategic terms.

206
00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:39.849
So in particular, party leaders are trying to put

207
00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:44.880
together winning coalitions, uh, groups of enough people who

208
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.169
have different interests, um, that, you know, eventually reach

209
00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:52.590
a large enough size, uh, to win elections, uh,

210
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.130
win contests, basically. So part of it is strategic,

211
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.609
you know, it's kind of finding, well, if you

212
00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.330
work with me on this issue, I'll work with

213
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.650
you on that issue, and I'll support that, um.

214
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.619
So part of it is indeed strategic, basically the

215
00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:11.940
maintenance and cre creation and maintenance of coalitions. Uh,

216
00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:16.140
SO politicians, uh, particularly elected officials and party officials

217
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.909
play a large role in that. Um, uh, ONE

218
00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:21.770
thing that's also been studied by political scientists is

219
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.729
the role of what you might call intellectuals, academics,

220
00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:30.659
scribblers, uh, pundits, um, what, um, Uh, my colleague

221
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:34.979
Hans Knoll in political science calls coalition merchants essentially.

222
00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.380
Um, AND these are people who say, you know,

223
00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:41.349
write for news magazines who are pundits who kind

224
00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:45.590
of opine on politics, and, uh, often what they

225
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.030
are doing is they're kind of surveying the political

226
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.460
landscape and saying, well, you know, We can potentially

227
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.460
join the people who are interested in this kind

228
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.460
of thing together with these kind of people to

229
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.700
create a broader coalition that can win elections. And

230
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.500
what those folks do in particular is they sort

231
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.219
of manufacture or help develop or they elaborate. The

232
00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:11.619
philosophical rationales that make up, you know, liberalism or

233
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:15.419
conservatism or socialism or whatever ideology you have in

234
00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.739
mind at a given time and period. So they

235
00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:21.280
kind of elaborate all the arguments about why different

236
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.539
things go together. So in terms of the actual

237
00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:28.169
construction of these ideologies, a lot of it is

238
00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:33.799
top down. Uh, NOW, again, There are limits to

239
00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:38.159
that. Uh, SO, uh, often there may be reasons

240
00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:43.039
that are more bottom up or psychologically driven why

241
00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:47.190
certain, uh, types of beliefs and attitudes hang together

242
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.000
within particular domains. So again, if we think about

243
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.919
a limited domain of people's political preferences, say what

244
00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:58.239
are broadly referred to as social and cultural or

245
00:14:58.239 --> 00:15:02.440
moral issues, um, uh, I would say that Uh,

246
00:15:02.479 --> 00:15:06.479
the reason why we see correlations between, say, greater

247
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:10.090
support for gay rights and greater support for abortion

248
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.590
rights, um, and, uh, things of that nature is

249
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.280
that, uh, a lot of those things are very

250
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.830
much driven by the same underlying, uh, Needs, traits,

251
00:15:21.869 --> 00:15:24.270
and motives or preferences that people have at a

252
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.580
psychological level. Those things can very readily be linked

253
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.979
to needs for certainty and security. People who are

254
00:15:31.979 --> 00:15:36.390
more strongly, uh, oriented toward having certainty and security

255
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.950
will kind of want to stick with what is

256
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.869
traditional, uh, what, uh, sort of, uh, emphasizes tight

257
00:15:42.869 --> 00:15:45.989
social norms, so to speak, rather than greater individual

258
00:15:45.989 --> 00:15:49.820
freedom. So in limited domains like that, very specific

259
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.609
domains, you might see more of a bottom-up effect.

260
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:55.619
But if we're talking about whole big ideologies that

261
00:15:55.619 --> 00:16:01.260
transcend multiple domains economics, uh, foreign policy, uh, social

262
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.219
and cultural and moral issues, then you start to

263
00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:06.299
really get into something that is very much the

264
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.539
role of political elites of various sorts.

265
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.880
OK, so I would like to ask you now

266
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.390
about the set of uh phenomena here. First, what

267
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.450
is collective narcissism?

268
00:16:19.609 --> 00:16:23.650
OK, well, collective narcissism is sort of a group

269
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.619
level equivalent of what we think of as narcissism

270
00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:30.640
at the individual level. Um, THIS is a concept

271
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.760
that was developed by a colleague of mine named

272
00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:39.210
Doctor Agnieszka Goletz Diavala, and, uh, this, she's done

273
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.679
a lot of work on this in the last

274
00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:42.849
15 years. I've done some of this work with

275
00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:48.880
her. Uh, BASICALLY collective narcissism is, uh, an exaggerated

276
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.869
sense of in-group worth, uh, sort of an exaggerated

277
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:56.700
feeling that your group is exceptional, which is combined

278
00:16:57.039 --> 00:17:01.349
with a perception that others don't respect the group

279
00:17:01.349 --> 00:17:06.380
enough. So it's sort of a brittle, exaggerated, uh,

280
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.469
love of the in-group, so to speak. And uh

281
00:17:09.469 --> 00:17:12.430
people who are high in collective narcissism with respect

282
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.239
to a particular group identity, uh, they tend to

283
00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:20.670
be very sensitive to perceived slights to their group

284
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.079
or perceived signs that their group is not respected

285
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:27.000
enough. And when they believe that their group is

286
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.630
not respected enough, they tend to respond with hostility,

287
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.339
with prejudice, with intergroup aggression. Uh, AND a variety

288
00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:37.619
of other things like that that, you know, you

289
00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:42.660
notice in political contexts. Now, um, collective narcissism is

290
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.020
a very general idea. It can apply to any

291
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.050
number of, uh, types of group identities we hold.

292
00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:52.300
So, you know, there's such thing as racial collective

293
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.380
narcissism. You can measure with respect to a particular

294
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.060
religious identity, you can uh, you can look at

295
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.165
it with respect to gender. IDENTITY. But, uh, in

296
00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:04.574
research on this, the one that has been looked

297
00:18:04.574 --> 00:18:07.935
at the most is what we call national collective

298
00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:11.974
narcissism. So it's very specifically a perception that the

299
00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:17.635
national in-group or your country is exceptional, extraordinary, uh,

300
00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:20.494
but not respected enough by others. Uh, AGAIN, it's

301
00:18:20.494 --> 00:18:24.295
a very exaggerated sense of group regard that's sort

302
00:18:24.295 --> 00:18:28.079
of out of line with, uh, Uh, reality in

303
00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:32.489
some respects, and we, we find that a tendency

304
00:18:32.489 --> 00:18:36.869
to be high in national collective narcissism is associated

305
00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:40.880
with all kinds of phenomena that really relate to

306
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.599
be, uh, being hostile and prejudiced and what have

307
00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:47.560
you. There are more details to it, of course,

308
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.239
and some exceptions and different ways it plays out,

309
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.199
but that's the gist of it.

310
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.439
Mhm. So, and the other phenomenon I would like

311
00:18:57.439 --> 00:19:01.130
to ask you about is in-group satisfaction. So what

312
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.709
is in-group satisfaction and is there any link between

313
00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:08.089
collective narcissism and it?

314
00:19:09.469 --> 00:19:12.109
OK, so in-group satisfaction is a little bit more

315
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:16.430
general than collective narcissism. In-group satisfaction is very simply

316
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.270
feeling proud of the group you belong to. Uh,

317
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.709
YOU know, if you talk about it in the

318
00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:22.790
context of how you feel about your country, your

319
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.500
nation, it's what we would call patriotism. It's just

320
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.599
loving your group and the fact that you were

321
00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:34.020
a member of it. It doesn't necessarily imply hostility

322
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.390
toward uh other groups or a deep sense of

323
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:44.140
superiority or anything like that. Um, NOW, uh, Typically,

324
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.550
collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction are considered uh in

325
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.459
conjunction with one another in research on this topic

326
00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:59.180
because, um, collective narcissism is often sort of, uh,

327
00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:01.270
if you look at it and work on this,

328
00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:08.560
it sort of represents the, um, Uh, narcissistic or

329
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.000
hostile aspect of being attached to a group and

330
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.189
liking a group. Uh, SO we do find that,

331
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:19.359
uh, in-group satisfaction and collective narcissism are positively related

332
00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:22.969
to one another. All other things being equal, uh,

333
00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:27.839
people who have a high sense of in-group satisfaction

334
00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:32.939
also tend to be, uh, collective narcissists. Now the

335
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:36.900
important thing is that there's not 100% overlap between

336
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.020
those things. Not everyone who feels a strong sense

337
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.140
of in-group pride or in-group satisfaction is a collective

338
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.219
narcissist and vice versa. And, uh, there's some interesting

339
00:20:47.219 --> 00:20:52.790
things you find when, uh, you consider Uh, collective

340
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.949
narcissism and in group satisfaction at the same time

341
00:20:55.949 --> 00:21:00.229
as predictors of other things, like, for example, predictors

342
00:21:00.229 --> 00:21:04.109
of hostility toward other groups of prejudice against other

343
00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:08.430
groups. So as it turns out, once you, uh,

344
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:13.579
isolate the part of collective narcissism. That, uh, does

345
00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:17.239
not overlap, that's independent of in-group satisfaction. You find

346
00:21:17.239 --> 00:21:20.839
that that still predicts being hostile and prejudiced to

347
00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:23.300
other groups. But when you look at the other

348
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.739
way around, when you look at the portion of

349
00:21:26.739 --> 00:21:31.500
in-group satisfaction, uh, that overlaps with collective narcissism, that

350
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.260
is when you control for collective narcissism, you find

351
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.140
that what's left over is sort of a more

352
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.160
healthy, uh, form of pride in the in-group. And

353
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.989
you know, once you take out or account for

354
00:21:43.989 --> 00:21:47.319
the part of in-group satisfaction that overlaps with collective

355
00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:53.439
narcissism, what's left over is often associated with a

356
00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:58.910
stronger sense of in-group friendship, positivity, and, uh, you

357
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.739
know, relative lack of bias toward outgroups. And there

358
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.930
are any number of examples of that you can

359
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.410
find out there. There's evidence of this pattern with

360
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.729
respect to, for example, uh, wanting to see your

361
00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:18.890
national in-group or your nation militarily or economically dominate

362
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.609
others. So collective narcissism, national collective narcissism, very strongly

363
00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:27.489
predicts that's sort of wanting your country to dominate

364
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:30.420
others, and it does even after you control for

365
00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:34.142
satisfaction. But if you look at in-group satisfaction on

366
00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:38.642
the other hand, and you control for collective narcissism,

367
00:22:38.822 --> 00:22:40.583
that is, you take out the part of in-group

368
00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:45.142
satisfaction that reflects collective narcissism, what's left over that

369
00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:50.142
non-narcissistic part of in-group satisfaction, um, that tends to

370
00:22:50.142 --> 00:22:54.942
predict a reduced level of support for wanting your

371
00:22:54.942 --> 00:22:59.686
national in-group to dominate others, either militarily. Or economically.

372
00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:03.326
So the basic idea here is that in-group satisfaction

373
00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:06.796
and collective narcissism, they're related to one another, but

374
00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:08.906
once you get rid of the overlap between them

375
00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:11.556
or account for the overlap between them, they tend

376
00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:15.115
to relate to intergroup behavior and attitudes in very

377
00:23:15.115 --> 00:23:19.595
different ways. Collective narcissism tends to promote and escalate

378
00:23:19.595 --> 00:23:23.475
conflict, uh, in-group satisfaction, at least after you account

379
00:23:23.475 --> 00:23:25.515
for the part of it that overlaps with collective

380
00:23:25.515 --> 00:23:31.030
narcissism. That uh is often associated with reduced uh

381
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.709
uh conflict and a reduced tendency to escalate uh

382
00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:36.229
hostilities with other groups.

383
00:23:37.329 --> 00:23:40.579
And is there a link between collective narcissism and

384
00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:41.530
nationalism?

385
00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.260
Uh, YEAH, and that's in part what uh what

386
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.420
I was describing earlier. So nationalism, uh, is often

387
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.500
distinguished, uh, in research on this topic and also

388
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.060
among political theorists, uh, from patriotism. Again, patriotism is

389
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.900
like what I described as in-group satisfaction at the

390
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.099
national level. You just feel proud of your nation

391
00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:08.479
and your membership in it. Uh, THAT'S often distinguished

392
00:24:08.479 --> 00:24:13.079
from nationalism, which again is, uh, believing not only

393
00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:17.400
is your nation great or good or something worth

394
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.479
being proud of, but you think that it should,

395
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.729
you know, get its way with other countries all

396
00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:24.199
the time, that it should dominate them, it's so

397
00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:27.410
great that, uh, it should be superior to all

398
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.000
other national groups. Uh, SO what we find is

399
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.890
that collective narcissism is very much a predictor of

400
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.079
nationalism. They're not the same thing, but they relate

401
00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:42.170
to one another very highly. So people who have

402
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.849
kind of an exaggerated love of their nation but

403
00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:48.300
feel like others don't respect it, national collective narcissists,

404
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.290
they also tend to be nationalists in the sense

405
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.250
of wanting their nation to dominate others, thinking it's

406
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.969
superior to all other nations and what have you.

407
00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:59.829
But again, you get the same dynamic once you

408
00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:03.069
consider a collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction at the

409
00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:08.109
same time. Once you, uh, take into consideration, once

410
00:25:08.109 --> 00:25:12.390
you remove the portion of in-group satisfaction that overlaps

411
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.339
with collective narcissism, you find that non-narcissistic in-group satisfaction

412
00:25:17.589 --> 00:25:22.630
is actually associated with reduced nationalism. So less of

413
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.189
a strong feeling of national superiority or that the

414
00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:28.949
national in-group has the right to dominate others.

415
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.869
So I have one more question about collective narcissism

416
00:25:33.869 --> 00:25:36.430
before we move on to other topics. Was there

417
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.430
a link between collective narcissism and perceptions that the

418
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.579
2020 election in the US was illegitimate?

419
00:25:45.209 --> 00:25:50.630
Uh, YES, um, so national collective narcissism, uh, first

420
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.709
to take a step back, uh, it's very generally

421
00:25:54.709 --> 00:25:59.560
associated with conspiratorial beliefs. Um, AND this is something

422
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.479
that's not just found in the context of the

423
00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:05.160
United States politics, but elsewhere. Uh, SO people who

424
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.920
are high in national collective narcissism, they tend to

425
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.880
be very prone to conspiratorial thinking and conspiratorial beliefs

426
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.359
about why bad things are happening, why outcomes they

427
00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:20.530
might not like are happening, why the nation has

428
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.060
fallen on hard times or Uh, why the nation

429
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.540
is not headed in the right direction. Uh, AND

430
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.380
in particular, uh, you know, if you look in

431
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:34.140
European context, uh, national collective narcissism is, you know,

432
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.989
associated with all kinds of conspiracy theories about, uh,

433
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.099
how outside groups or minorities within the nation are

434
00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:46.939
somehow traitorously undermining, uh, the nation. Uh, IN the

435
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.619
United States, uh, a very good recent example of

436
00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:51.859
this is the one you mentioned. Um, SO in

437
00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:54.660
the wake of the 2020 election, of course, we

438
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.060
saw a lot of election denial, um, basically this

439
00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.260
idea that, uh, uh, Joe Biden had not won

440
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.339
the election, that there had been some kind of

441
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:05.939
rigging of it and that Donald Trump had actually

442
00:27:05.939 --> 00:27:09.219
won. Uh, SO, uh, in some of the research

443
00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:13.680
we did, we found that national collective narcissism. Uh,

444
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.770
AGAIN, after you control for a plain old in

445
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:20.689
group satisfaction, uh, that that is strongly, strongly associated

446
00:27:20.689 --> 00:27:23.410
with believing that there was cheating in the 2020

447
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.160
election, that Donald Trump had actually really won it.

448
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.910
Other research shows that People who are higher in

449
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.939
national collective narcissism are also willing to support, uh,

450
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:41.109
potentially violent, illegal, or extraconstitutional methods of reversing the

451
00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:43.989
2020 election outcome. So there are really two parts

452
00:27:43.989 --> 00:27:49.329
of that. One, collective narcissism is very much associated

453
00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:55.300
with conspiratorial beliefs, people who have an exaggerated. View

454
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.810
of the worth or exceptional nature of the in-group,

455
00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:01.300
uh, they tend to want to blame anything bad

456
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.630
that happens in their eyes on some outside group,

457
00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.140
uh, that's kind of interfering with the true nature

458
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.939
of things. But in particular, in the context of

459
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:13.300
the 2020 election, we found that um it was

460
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.060
very much uh collective narcissism was very much associated

461
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.699
with uh election-related conspiratorial beliefs.

462
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.780
So we've talked about collective narcissism. Is there also

463
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.819
self-esteem at the group level? And if so, what

464
00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:32.250
kinds of effects does it have when it comes

465
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.739
to attitudes toward out groups?

466
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.770
Um, WELL, um, social psychologists do have, uh, a

467
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.650
concept known as collective self-esteem, which is really sort

468
00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.250
of, you know, an analog of self-esteem at the

469
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.849
personal level. Personal self-esteem is how positively or negatively

470
00:28:51.849 --> 00:28:56.569
do you evaluate yourself as an individual. Collective self-esteem,

471
00:28:56.689 --> 00:29:02.170
um, is, uh, really sort of this idea. Uh,

472
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.390
IT'S how positively or negatively do you identify, uh,

473
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.030
do you evaluate, excuse me, the groups that you

474
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.989
belong to, and there are multiple aspects of it,

475
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.839
and, um, Uh, you know, there's sort of, uh,

476
00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:18.140
the two most important parts of it are what

477
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.800
we call public self-esteem and private, uh, public collective

478
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.079
self-esteem and private collective self-esteem. Public is what do

479
00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:29.650
you think other people think of, uh, the, uh,

480
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.660
group you belong to. Private is what do you

481
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.619
think, uh, how do you evaluate the group you

482
00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:38.180
belong to? Uh, USUALLY these things kind of go

483
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.260
together. So if you think other people like your

484
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.430
group, you like your group as well. Um, BUT,

485
00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:49.739
uh, in general, um, we find that, uh. Collective

486
00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:52.939
self-esteem, it's, you know, associated with, you know, liking

487
00:29:52.939 --> 00:29:56.130
your in-group, of course, and, you know, often, you

488
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.859
know, wanting to do things that help the in-group.

489
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.380
Um, IT can often, you know, it's often related

490
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.234
to how strongly do you feel, uh, how strongly

491
00:30:05.234 --> 00:30:07.834
attached do you feel to your group? Do you

492
00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:11.645
feel a strong link to it? Uh, NOW, interestingly,

493
00:30:11.824 --> 00:30:14.185
uh, there is a bit of a link, uh,

494
00:30:14.234 --> 00:30:19.074
between different types of collective self-esteem and what we

495
00:30:19.074 --> 00:30:23.140
call collective narcissism. So remember that collective narcissism is

496
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.819
sort of an exaggerated sense of the worth of

497
00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:29.040
the in-group, believing that it is truly unique in

498
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.839
some way and special, combined with this perception that

499
00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:37.260
others don't respect the in-group enough. So one interesting

500
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.739
thing we find is that, uh, people who are

501
00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:45.260
high in private collective self-esteem, so people who think

502
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.650
that, um, Uh, their group is really great, and

503
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:53.170
personally evaluate their in-group as being wonderful. Uh, PEOPLE

504
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.400
who are high in private collective self-esteem while being

505
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.849
low in public collective self-esteem, tend to be collective

506
00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:04.930
narcissists. Remember, public collective self-esteem is, what do you

507
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.969
think other people think of your group? So people

508
00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:11.000
who think very highly personally of their own group,

509
00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:13.599
but think that others don't think highly of it,

510
00:31:13.849 --> 00:31:18.599
those people tend to have this collective narcissistic way

511
00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:21.280
of viewing things. And again, that's sort of what

512
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.199
collective narcissism is. It's, you know, again, really loving

513
00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:28.790
your in-group in an almost exaggerated or inaccurate way,

514
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.280
but at the same time believing that others don't

515
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.260
respect it. Um, SO that particular combination of forms

516
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.660
of collective self-esteem does seem to manifest itself in

517
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.859
terms of this collective narcissism thing we've been talking

518
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:43.140
about.

519
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:49.290
OK, so, uh, another topic now, what is ideological

520
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.380
uncertainty?

521
00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:55.839
Uh, IDEOLOGICAL uncertainty, um, uh, I think the the

522
00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:58.630
piece of research to be sure that you're, um,

523
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.680
you know, referring to with Joe Vitriol and others,

524
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.280
that's something I will note. I've been, I was

525
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.439
a little bit more tangentially involved in, so you

526
00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:08.880
might not get as much out of me on

527
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.390
this one, but, uh, ideological uncertainty is like really,

528
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.229
you know, how much uncertainty do you perceive. Uh,

529
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.390
ABOUT where you stand on the ideological spectrum. So

530
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.109
some people very have a deep sense of certainty

531
00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:26.030
that they are a conservative or a deep sense

532
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.189
of certainty that they're a liberal. Uh, THEY'VE thought

533
00:32:29.189 --> 00:32:32.189
about it, they, these beliefs are very important to

534
00:32:32.189 --> 00:32:34.869
them, and they don't feel any sort of doubt

535
00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:38.500
about what their actual position or beliefs is. Uh,

536
00:32:38.569 --> 00:32:41.479
OTHER people are a little bit more uncertain. They're

537
00:32:41.479 --> 00:32:43.550
not really sure whether they're as much of a

538
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.619
liberal or as much of a conservative as they

539
00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:50.510
are. Um, SO, uh, that's sort of what we

540
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.510
call in psychology, uh, a metacognitive belief. How do

541
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:58.079
you think about your own thinking, essentially. And, uh,

542
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:01.790
so, you know, people can have a consciousness that

543
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.790
they're very certain about what they believe ideologically. People

544
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.910
can also have sort of a consciousness that they

545
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.869
are not so certain. And, um, in general, what

546
00:33:11.869 --> 00:33:15.229
we find, um, or what this research finds is

547
00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:20.099
that people who uh are more certain, they use,

548
00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:24.949
uh, their ideological identification, so their social identification as

549
00:33:24.949 --> 00:33:28.869
a liberal or a conservative to make more judgments

550
00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:32.579
about things, to organize more of their political preferences.

551
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.599
Um, SO it's not just enough that a person

552
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:39.319
sort of generally thinks of themselves as being on

553
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:41.359
the left or being on the right as a

554
00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:45.040
broad social identity. Um, THERE'S also an element of

555
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.719
how certain do you feel about what it is

556
00:33:47.719 --> 00:33:50.839
you think you are ideologically. If you do feel

557
00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:55.040
more certainty, then, you know, basically what that suggests.

558
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.319
Is that that identity you hold as being either

559
00:33:58.319 --> 00:34:00.369
a liberal or a conservative, a member of the

560
00:34:00.369 --> 00:34:02.449
left or a member of the right, that's going

561
00:34:02.449 --> 00:34:05.790
to inform a wider range of other judgments you

562
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.080
make about issues, candidates, and what have you.

563
00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:15.340
Does ideological uncertainty lead people to invest themselves more

564
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.290
into politics or to disengage from politics?

565
00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.120
Well, uh, uh, does certainty do that?

566
00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:25.080
UNCERTAINTY, yes. Yes,

567
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:31.149
so, um, in general, uh, The uncertainty of different

568
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:34.540
sorts can lead, uh, people to do different things.

569
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.350
Um, YOU know, there's actually some research in social

570
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:44.149
psychology which suggests that if you, uh, generate or

571
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:48.449
induce a very general sense of uncertainty about the

572
00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:51.668
self, like who am I? That kind of uncertainty

573
00:34:51.668 --> 00:34:54.938
about that big question, uh, you can sometimes get

574
00:34:54.938 --> 00:34:59.560
people to identify more strongly with other groups. Now,

575
00:34:59.729 --> 00:35:02.520
uh, it works a little bit differently when you

576
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:08.919
zero in on, uh, uncertainty about specific identities or

577
00:35:08.919 --> 00:35:13.560
specific aspects of the self. So when, you know,

578
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.850
my colleagues and I did the research on ideological

579
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.810
uncertainty, we're not really asking about how uncertainty you

580
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.770
feel about yourself in general, but how uncertain do

581
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:29.409
you feel about uh your ideological, uh, Uh, viewpoint,

582
00:35:29.689 --> 00:35:34.290
uh, in particular, and there we find that, uh,

583
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.000
you know, for individuals who are a little bit

584
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.139
more uncertain, uh, again, it's not Front and center

585
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:44.889
to the same extent in uh how they see

586
00:35:44.889 --> 00:35:48.209
themselves and how they make judgments about any number

587
00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:51.689
of things. So when we talk very specifically about

588
00:35:51.689 --> 00:35:55.620
uncertainty in the ideological sense or uncertainty about one's

589
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.580
ideological identity, um, all other things being equal, it's

590
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.300
gonna sort of dial things down in terms of

591
00:36:02.649 --> 00:36:05.419
the extent to which you're walking around and making

592
00:36:05.419 --> 00:36:07.780
all kinds of judgments in terms of ideology.

593
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:14.830
So, is there a link between religiosity and political

594
00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.389
ideology, and if so, what, what would it be?

595
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.350
Uh, WELL, again, that really sort of depends uh

596
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.709
on the context and the group. Um, SO here

597
00:36:27.709 --> 00:36:30.889
we're thinking of religiosity as sort of a compound

598
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:34.219
variable, a combination of like, do you see yourself

599
00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:36.909
as religious? Do you practice, uh, your religion, uh,

600
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.379
do you attend services and things like that. Um,

601
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:44.110
IN general, it really sort of depends on the

602
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:48.830
context you're in. Uh, TRADITIONALLY, greater levels of religiosity.

603
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.500
Um, HAD been associated with conservatism. There's a decent

604
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.889
amount of evidence in countries like the United States

605
00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:58.659
that the more religious you are, uh, the more

606
00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:04.110
likely you are to, uh, identify as conservative, and,

607
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:09.040
you know, there's even Some psychological research, uh, that

608
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.479
suggests that under certain circumstances, you know, the same

609
00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:15.239
things that attract you to being more religious will

610
00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.590
also attract you to being more conservative. Now, uh,

611
00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:23.270
the, uh, thing is that it sort of breaks

612
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.649
down or it's not as consistent across all time

613
00:37:27.649 --> 00:37:33.840
periods and uh all uh groups in society. So

614
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.500
this is where research, uh, Uh, in political science

615
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.459
is especially important. So at this point, uh, if

616
00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:44.699
you look at the entire United States population, typically

617
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:47.439
what you find is that people who are higher

618
00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:52.520
in religiosity, uh, they're more likely to identify as

619
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:58.169
Republicans in terms of partisanship. Um, So that's a

620
00:37:58.169 --> 00:38:01.250
pretty robust finding, but the question is, is that

621
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.250
something that's universal or is it a function of

622
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.399
uh particular forces that we've seen operating in, say,

623
00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:11.929
the last 30 or 40 years. And actually as

624
00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:15.810
it turns out, if you rewind things, uh you

625
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.729
find if you go back to the 70s or

626
00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:21.370
80s, there really isn't a relationship between how religious

627
00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.209
you are and what party you belong to or

628
00:38:24.209 --> 00:38:27.449
vote for. That's something that really sort of steadily

629
00:38:27.449 --> 00:38:32.810
emerged and grew after about 1992. So why is

630
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:37.370
that? Um, THE reason that's typically offered, um, By

631
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.580
political scientists who studied this, is that political leaders,

632
00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:43.899
again, what I was calling political elites earlier, they

633
00:38:43.899 --> 00:38:47.939
started to diverge more in the extent to which

634
00:38:47.939 --> 00:38:53.550
they, uh, endorsed religious traditionalism, a large public role

635
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.780
for religion, and what have you. The Republicans became

636
00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.895
more oriented toward public religiosity and religious traditional. WHEREAS

637
00:39:01.895 --> 00:39:04.965
the Democrats became more oriented to having a more

638
00:39:04.965 --> 00:39:08.094
secular society. And this in turn kind of reflects

639
00:39:08.094 --> 00:39:10.135
some of the things that we talked about earlier

640
00:39:10.135 --> 00:39:14.534
about political coalitions. Uh, THE typical answer that political

641
00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:18.945
scientists give here is that, uh, religious conservatives and

642
00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:24.094
in particular, uh, Protestant religious conservatives, evangelicals, fundamentalists, whatever

643
00:39:24.094 --> 00:39:26.449
you want to. Whatever term you want to use

644
00:39:26.449 --> 00:39:31.889
became a more significant portion of the Republican coalition

645
00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:35.209
starting in the late 70s, growing through the 80s

646
00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:38.300
and then really kind of solidifying in the 1990s.

647
00:39:38.729 --> 00:39:42.370
So, from about the late 80s, early 1990s onward,

648
00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:46.169
you see Republican leaders and Democratic leaders sending different

649
00:39:46.169 --> 00:39:51.939
signals about um you know, uh You know, whether

650
00:39:51.939 --> 00:39:54.629
they're the party for religious people or people who

651
00:39:54.629 --> 00:39:58.179
are not religious. Now, um, there's an important caveat

652
00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:01.179
to all that. Even though that's changed over time,

653
00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:04.939
it's changed more for some groups than for others.

654
00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:08.120
So in particular, uh, you find that there's an

655
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.939
especially strong link in the United States between religiosity

656
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.310
and identifying with the Republican Party and voting for

657
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.159
the Republican Party among white Americans. So that relationship

658
00:40:19.159 --> 00:40:22.040
is pretty strong and pretty robust, and to the

659
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.399
extent that you observe this increasing relationship between being

660
00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:30.560
religious and being republican. Uh, IT'S most pronounced among

661
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.879
white Americans. Uh, IT'S far weaker among black Americans,

662
00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:37.159
and in fact, sometimes you even find that black

663
00:40:37.159 --> 00:40:40.469
Americans who are more religious tend to be more

664
00:40:40.469 --> 00:40:44.439
identified with the Democratic Party. Uh, THE relationships also

665
00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:48.919
weaker among, uh, Latinos and Asian Americans, though there

666
00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:53.389
is some relation. THERE. So in part, it also

667
00:40:53.389 --> 00:40:57.989
reflects uh differences in culture across groups in the

668
00:40:57.989 --> 00:40:58.850
United States.

669
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.429
OK, so, uh, I would like to get into

670
00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:05.229
the last, I think what will, I think will

671
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:07.870
be the last topic of our conversation today. I

672
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:10.550
would like to ask you now about feelings of

673
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.830
group extinction threats. So, what is this about and

674
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.870
then perhaps we can get into a specific example

675
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:18.229
of it.

676
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:23.489
Um, OK, so this, uh, again, it's a line

677
00:41:23.489 --> 00:41:26.159
of research I've been a little bit more tangentially,

678
00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:29.770
uh, involved in. This is work that was spearheaded

679
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.679
by my student, uh, Max Bai. Uh, SO a

680
00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:35.209
lot of this is work that he took the

681
00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:36.929
lead on and that he really needs to be

682
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:40.489
given, you know, uh, credit for in terms of

683
00:41:40.489 --> 00:41:44.050
like the research results. But group extinction threat, broadly

684
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:50.489
speaking, is, uh, a fear that, uh, The in-group

685
00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:55.800
will be physically wiped out, essentially, you know, severely

686
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.169
reduced in uh terms of its percentage in the

687
00:41:59.169 --> 00:42:02.850
population and in its numbers. And, uh, you know,

688
00:42:02.929 --> 00:42:06.280
we find that that is very much related to

689
00:42:06.409 --> 00:42:07.969
uh intergroup hostility.

690
00:42:09.629 --> 00:42:15.090
Mhm. So, in the specific case of white people,

691
00:42:15.229 --> 00:42:20.419
how do they react to their perceived numerical decline

692
00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:21.659
in certain countries?

693
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.659
Well, um, again, you know, uh, there's considerable variation

694
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.709
uh among members of different groups including white Americans

695
00:42:30.709 --> 00:42:33.750
and, you know, the extent to which, uh, you

696
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:39.469
know, they experience extinction threat. And, you know, actually

697
00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:42.590
not that many, you know, white Americans feel that

698
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.030
way about things, uh, but there's variation among individuals

699
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.149
and that variation is significant in terms of the

700
00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:54.340
other thing it relates to. So, uh, one thing

701
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:59.659
that Max studied in some of his work, um,

702
00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:02.239
which he did with me. Uh, IS, you know,

703
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.459
where does this sense of group extinction threat come

704
00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:09.699
from? Um, AND partly, uh, the feeling is that

705
00:43:09.699 --> 00:43:12.300
it has to do, or the evidence suggests that

706
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.580
it has to do with, uh, a belief, not

707
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.379
just that other groups are growing, uh, as a

708
00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:24.219
percentage of population, so say immigrants or specific racial

709
00:43:24.219 --> 00:43:27.985
and ethnic groups. Black Americans, Latino Americans, and so

710
00:43:27.985 --> 00:43:31.344
on and so forth, but a very specific belief

711
00:43:31.344 --> 00:43:35.814
that white Americans are declining as a percentage of

712
00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:39.425
the United States population. So that belief in particular

713
00:43:39.425 --> 00:43:42.385
really seems to align very much with an imagined

714
00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:46.385
belief that somehow, uh, the in-group is going to

715
00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:48.864
be a racial in-group is going to be extinguished.

716
00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:53.500
And in turn that sort of predicts those two

717
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.580
beliefs, thinking that your group is declining as a

718
00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.899
proportion of the population or in numbers, and then

719
00:43:59.899 --> 00:44:03.610
group extinction threat. Those things are also related to

720
00:44:04.659 --> 00:44:09.149
certain kinds of policy attitudes. And, you know, certain

721
00:44:09.149 --> 00:44:11.830
kinds of political preferences. So one thing that both

722
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:16.229
of those things relate to very strongly are, you

723
00:44:16.229 --> 00:44:21.870
know, strongly anti-immigrant or immigrant restriction, uh, immigration restrictionist

724
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:26.100
positions, uh, wanting to kind of turn off immigration,

725
00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:31.090
uh, crack down very hard on, uh, illegal immigration.

726
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.770
And uh things like that. It's also associated in

727
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:39.129
some of the evidence that we collected or data

728
00:44:39.129 --> 00:44:43.530
we collected with uh support for uh far far

729
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:48.570
right movements, so Nazism, uh, the KKK, uh, the

730
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.360
outright, um, so far right politics as well.

731
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:59.959
So is there a link here with racial biases

732
00:45:00.129 --> 00:45:02.360
and conservatism or not?

733
00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:09.540
Um, WELL, it's, uh, most research, uh, does find

734
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.270
some level of a of correlation between those two

735
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.949
things and in the present era in the United

736
00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:18.344
States, uh, it is not a perfect relation. So

737
00:45:20.044 --> 00:45:23.195
one thing that has to be understood is that,

738
00:45:23.284 --> 00:45:26.514
uh, just as we observe that relationship, it does

739
00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:29.165
not mean that everyone who identifies with the political

740
00:45:29.165 --> 00:45:32.364
right or who identifies as a conservative, is some

741
00:45:32.364 --> 00:45:36.405
raging racist. Uh, IT is a probabilistic relationship. All

742
00:45:36.405 --> 00:45:41.709
other things being equal. Um, And, uh, so it

743
00:45:41.709 --> 00:45:45.899
exists, it's not a perfect relationship, um, and again,

744
00:45:45.949 --> 00:45:51.239
in terms of why we see that, um, Uh,

745
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:55.560
there are two theories. One is that it's a

746
00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:01.520
top-down, uh, top-down effect. So in this regard, uh,

747
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.919
the idea is that again, you have to look

748
00:46:03.919 --> 00:46:07.280
at the nature of political conflict in the United

749
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:14.419
States, and um, A major source of conflict throughout

750
00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:18.129
American history has been, you know, uh, uh, civil

751
00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:21.459
rights or racial equality. Are we going to have

752
00:46:21.459 --> 00:46:24.780
a multiracial democracy or are we going to have

753
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.939
some system where whites dominate and have some kind

754
00:46:27.939 --> 00:46:31.620
of superior status? This is a endless conflict in

755
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.500
the United States, and most of our major flashpoints

756
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.770
are related to it in some way. Uh, SO,

757
00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:41.520
you know, in the 1960s you see a decisive

758
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.879
move towards civil rights. Uh, uh, THE legal apparatus

759
00:46:45.879 --> 00:46:49.250
of segregation and white supremacy is dismantled, of course,

760
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.149
in multiple ways, but you know that doesn't end

761
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:57.610
differences within the population about the desirability of racial

762
00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:02.699
equality. So over time, You see this, uh, resurface

763
00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:06.510
as something that divides people in a partisan and

764
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.429
ideological way. So, you know, one way of looking

765
00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:12.739
at this is to kind of look at how,

766
00:47:12.909 --> 00:47:15.899
you know, the two parties divide in terms of

767
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.300
the extent to which they bring on board, uh,

768
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.590
white Americans in particular but not exclusively, uh, who

769
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.899
are opposed to racial equality, uh. Before the 1960s,

770
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.159
you know, the Democratic Party has a very strong

771
00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:33.760
racist element to it, concentrated in the American South,

772
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.889
and the Republican Party has a very strong pro-civil

773
00:47:37.889 --> 00:47:40.689
rights, not universal, but it does have a pro-civil

774
00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:45.120
rights faction. After, um, in particular, one thing you

775
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.040
see after civil rights is an acceleration of party

776
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.800
sorting on, uh, you know, how far should we

777
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.649
go with civil rights? Should we keep it up?

778
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.030
Should the government play an active role in, uh,

779
00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.790
helping to guarantee racial equality, or is it something

780
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.080
that, you know, the government should stay out of?

781
00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:05.979
And one thing you see over time is a

782
00:48:05.979 --> 00:48:08.899
greater pairing of a lot of the themes that

783
00:48:08.899 --> 00:48:12.060
are associated with the political conservatism in the United

784
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.739
States. So having a small government, less government intervention,

785
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.060
getting the government off people's backs, and uh sort

786
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:24.209
of hostility toward further action to bring about greater

787
00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:27.189
racial equality. So part of this is sort of

788
00:48:27.189 --> 00:48:30.679
a top-down process. Uh, POLITICAL leaders are sort of

789
00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:35.129
pairing traditional conservative themes which don't necessarily have to

790
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:38.899
go with, you know, a preference for racial inequality

791
00:48:38.899 --> 00:48:41.350
or indifference to civil rights. Uh, THEY'RE just kind

792
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:43.889
of pairing them as part of the belief package.

793
00:48:44.409 --> 00:48:46.770
Uh, SO that's, you know, one force, um, you

794
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:50.909
know, another, you know, potential role there is that,

795
00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:57.199
well, Um, you can look at the certain aspects

796
00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:01.729
of, uh, conservative ideology, in particular, the part of

797
00:49:01.729 --> 00:49:04.679
it that sort of is more lenient toward economic

798
00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:10.320
inequality and more opposed to re redistribution of economic

799
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.114
resources and say, OK, that. Something that tends to

800
00:49:14.114 --> 00:49:17.205
increase or maintain the amount of inequality in society.

801
00:49:17.415 --> 00:49:19.735
And if you look at civil rights policy on

802
00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:23.284
the other hand, and, you know, feelings about, uh,

803
00:49:23.334 --> 00:49:27.175
racial equality, that's also something that intrinsically touches on

804
00:49:27.175 --> 00:49:30.135
questions of, well, how, how much equality should we

805
00:49:30.135 --> 00:49:33.949
work for in society. And there is some evidence,

806
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.159
uh, my, my advisor, my late advisor, Professor Jim

807
00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:41.659
Zedans, you know, he did work on something, uh,

808
00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:47.169
called social dominance orientation, and social dominance orientation is

809
00:49:47.169 --> 00:49:50.840
sort of the general characteristic or belief. That reflects

810
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.879
the extent to which you like groups to be

811
00:49:53.879 --> 00:49:56.360
more equal with one another or the degree to

812
00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.399
which you think it's OK for some groups to

813
00:49:59.399 --> 00:50:02.199
dominate other groups. And as it turns out, that's

814
00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:05.229
something that applies to all kinds of group distinctions.

815
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.850
So part of it may just be that um

816
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.270
People who generally are indifferent to equality as a

817
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.939
value might be attracted to a variety of themes.

818
00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:17.300
Uh, I mean, I would say at this point

819
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.070
in the United States, a lot of it reflects

820
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:22.830
top-down effects. Um, IT'S just kind of how party

821
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:26.629
leaders have packaged different things together as a matter

822
00:50:26.629 --> 00:50:29.429
of ideology. And again, like we talked about at

823
00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:33.389
the beginning, this sort of reflects political leaders strategic

824
00:50:33.389 --> 00:50:36.590
judgments about, well, how can I assemble a winning

825
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.860
coalition. And part of what you saw after civil

826
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:44.060
rights in the United States is, um, uh, you

827
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.540
know, laws were passed and uh a lot was

828
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.939
changed in a very short period of time, but

829
00:50:49.939 --> 00:50:55.379
you still have a large number of white Americans

830
00:50:55.379 --> 00:50:58.100
and others, uh, particularly in the American South, who

831
00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.669
had been socialized. Uh, TO think that America was

832
00:51:01.669 --> 00:51:03.929
always going to have segregation, that whites would always

833
00:51:03.929 --> 00:51:05.850
be on top. So there is a group of

834
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.080
people that are dissatisfied with the trajectory of things.

835
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.530
Well, if, you know, you're trying to build a

836
00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:16.129
political coalition and in particular divide the previous, uh,

837
00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:19.929
another political coalition, say the Democratic coalition, one thing

838
00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:21.969
you want to do is try to attract some

839
00:51:21.969 --> 00:51:25.169
of those people who are dissatisfied with the Democrats

840
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:28.290
becoming a civil rights party. Because again, you have

841
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.959
to remember that prior to the civil rights era,

842
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.129
again, you have this strong southern wing of the

843
00:51:35.129 --> 00:51:38.050
Democratic Party that's very much OK with segregation.

844
00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:43.459
Right, right. So, I have one final question then.

845
00:51:43.909 --> 00:51:48.270
If this is about perceptions because even earlier when

846
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.830
I asked you about white people reacting to this,

847
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:55.820
I mentioned uh the word I used was perceived

848
00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.250
numerical decline. If this is about perceptions, is it

849
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.530
then safe to say that people being exposed to

850
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.719
conspiracy theories like the great replacement theory can lead

851
00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:13.330
them to develop these feelings of group extinction threat

852
00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.090
or not?

853
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.879
Yeah, I think that I think that that's correct.

854
00:52:16.969 --> 00:52:19.489
Um, YOU know, in terms of like how we

855
00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:23.560
are built. How our cognitive and mental architecture works,

856
00:52:23.679 --> 00:52:26.040
um, you know, we probably very much evolved as

857
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.560
a species to track things like the well-being of

858
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.810
our group and the interests of our group, and,

859
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.669
you know, what's happening to people in our coalition,

860
00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:39.090
however, coalition. IS defined. So we have kind of

861
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.610
a very general set of mechanisms that, you know,

862
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.330
focus on that thing. But you have to remember

863
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.209
that when we evolved those mechanisms, or when those

864
00:52:47.209 --> 00:52:51.250
mechanisms were naturally selected, uh, we lived in fairly

865
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.169
small hunter-gatherer type groups, groups of people where there

866
00:52:54.169 --> 00:52:56.949
was a lot of face to face contact and

867
00:52:56.949 --> 00:53:01.405
immediate awareness. Of whatever might be hurting your group

868
00:53:01.405 --> 00:53:03.764
or could hurt your group. But now we live

869
00:53:03.764 --> 00:53:06.245
in mass a mass society, and in particular a

870
00:53:06.245 --> 00:53:09.564
mass political society. Uh, THE groups that we belong

871
00:53:09.564 --> 00:53:13.635
to, in particular racial groups, um, are enormous. They're

872
00:53:13.635 --> 00:53:17.165
just broad abstract categories, and, you know, if you

873
00:53:17.165 --> 00:53:21.659
think about how, um, Human beings evolved to think

874
00:53:21.659 --> 00:53:24.860
about groups, race wouldn't have been, as we understand

875
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.689
it, as a type of social distinction, as we

876
00:53:27.689 --> 00:53:30.860
understand it, would never have been a thing that

877
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.340
was going to act on what traits were selected

878
00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.070
in people. Because, you know, again, you never left

879
00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.739
about. 30 or 60 miles from where you were

880
00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:41.899
born and you didn't live that long in many

881
00:53:41.899 --> 00:53:45.060
respects. So there's very little chance that when our

882
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.739
brains evolved and when natural selection was acting most

883
00:53:48.739 --> 00:53:51.179
heavily on them that we ever encountered people who

884
00:53:51.179 --> 00:53:53.939
were racially distinct in the modern social sense of

885
00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:56.879
the term race. Uh, BUT we are kind of,

886
00:53:56.889 --> 00:54:00.290
uh, predisposed to identify groups that we belong to,

887
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:04.209
coalitions we belong to, and what have you. But

888
00:54:04.209 --> 00:54:06.469
the question is, where do the inputs to all

889
00:54:06.469 --> 00:54:09.850
those cognitive mechanisms that kind of allow us to

890
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.320
see who's a friend and who's a foe, uh,

891
00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:14.330
where are those coming from? And the question is,

892
00:54:14.409 --> 00:54:17.399
well, they're coming from the media, and in particular,

893
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.729
um, as a political scientist, they would say they're

894
00:54:19.729 --> 00:54:22.649
coming from political leaders. Uh, YOU know, if you

895
00:54:22.649 --> 00:54:25.409
belong to a particular political party or identify with

896
00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:28.489
a particular ideology, you are predisposed to some extent

897
00:54:28.489 --> 00:54:31.689
to listen to people who share that ideology or

898
00:54:31.689 --> 00:54:35.169
your party membership at the leadership level, and leaders

899
00:54:35.169 --> 00:54:38.600
can play a large role in kind of, uh.

900
00:54:39.135 --> 00:54:42.094
THOSE beliefs or making those beliefs more salient. So

901
00:54:42.094 --> 00:54:44.975
we have a lot to worry about when political

902
00:54:44.975 --> 00:54:48.975
leaders do spread things, uh, that are conspiratorial in

903
00:54:48.975 --> 00:54:52.495
nature like the great replacement theory. And you see

904
00:54:52.495 --> 00:54:56.125
over and over again in the history of politics,

905
00:54:56.534 --> 00:54:59.844
it's conspiratorial stuff like that. This or that group

906
00:54:59.844 --> 00:55:02.925
is plotting to replace this or that group with

907
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.199
Some other third group that, you know, really can

908
00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:09.310
lead up to uh things that are deeply violent,

909
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:12.320
deeply oppressive, and what have you. So a lot

910
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.760
of this is not stuff that people are directly

911
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.469
seeing on their own, it's ideas that they're getting,

912
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.120
uh, from political discourse, and political discourse can kind

913
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.610
of Tone those ideas down or it can amplify

914
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:24.770
them.

915
00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.340
Great. So just before we go, would you like

916
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.580
to tell people where they can find you and

917
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.169

918
00:55:33.969 --> 00:55:38.250
Uh, YOU can find me on my University of
