00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.579
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.220
joined by Dr. Vivek vanatharaman. He is assistant professor

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.659
in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the

5
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.579
University of Calgary. And today we're talking mostly about

6
00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.450
human tree climbing, running, and hunting. So, Doctor Van

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.639
Caerman, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure

8
00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:27.590
to everyone. Thanks for having me. So, let's start

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.950
with, uh, tree climbing because it's curious because on

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.349
the show, I've already had many anthropologists on and

11
00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:37.419
with a few of them, I talked about walking

12
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.509
and running, but this is the first time I'm

13
00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:44.669
going to talk about tree climbing specifically. So, I

14
00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.389
mean, do you think that that's because it's a

15
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.110
topic that is not as explored in anthropology as

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.080
something like walking and running, and if so, why?

17
00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:00.330
Yeah, um, thanks for thanks for the question. Um,

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.939
YEAH, it's interesting, we do kind of focus on

19
00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.379
walking and running, and I think the big reason

20
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.610
for that, um, is that in industrialized societies that

21
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:13.419
anyone listening to this show will live in, um,

22
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.760
That's, uh, that's mostly what we do, right? We

23
00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:19.330
run for exercise, we sort of walk everywhere, and

24
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.099
that's kind of what we, um, think of as,

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.089
as what humans do. Um, I got really interested

26
00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.639
in human tree climbing, but because I was studying,

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.650
um, rainforest hunter gatherer populations, and these are populations

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.569
who actually, uh, climb trees on a nearly daily

29
00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.129
basis, and. The reason that they do it is

30
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:43.290
because they, they need to. It's because that's where

31
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.330
food is located um in these environments. And we

32
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.129
can get more into that, but I think to,

33
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.319
to answer your question, I think that it's um

34
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.169
perhaps a case of what is in front of

35
00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:58.160
us by seeing what we're, what we're looking at.

36
00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.370
But as anthropologists, we want to understand the broad

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.000
sweep of human diversity to see what people do.

38
00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.038
Across cultures, and as we dug into this, uh,

39
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.250
literature on human tree climbing, we found that actually

40
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.330
a lot of societies around the globe, whether they're

41
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.529
in rainforests or other kinds of habitats that they,

42
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.240
they climb trees pretty often. And um just to

43
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.479
just to back up a little bit, the reason

44
00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.399
that we were interested in this kind of question

45
00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.850
is that when we think about human locomotor evolution,

46
00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.539
Uh, there's kind of a narrative that what happened

47
00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.770
is that a few million years ago, we went

48
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.169
from living primarily in the trees, living in ape-like

49
00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:46.080
existence, to being committed terrestrial bipeds, right? And a

50
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.380
really big question in the field is, you know,

51
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.779
when exactly did this happen? How fast did it

52
00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.350
happen? What was the nature of that um transition?

53
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.550
And so, um, In paleoanthropology, when we find a,

54
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.960
uh, let's say a skeleton that exhibits some some

55
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.240
human-like uh traits, the, the automatic uh Uh, response

56
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.000
is to, is to say, well, you know, we

57
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.119
don't, uh, climb very much as as modern humans

58
00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.789
and so It's unlikely that he, that these hominins

59
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.789
were climbing either, and this has been most notable

60
00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:24.809
with a fossil called uh Australopithecus afarensis Lucy, uh,

61
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.250
which you're probably familiar with, lived about 3.5 million

62
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.630
years ago. From the waist up, it looked a

63
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.619
lot like a chimpanzee, but from the waist down,

64
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.350
it, it looked quite humanlike despite being quite a

65
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.589
bit smaller. Um, SO it, it likely had some

66
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.960
kind of striding gait. Um, AND it had, uh,

67
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.119
most importantly, it's, it's big toe instead of having

68
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.720
its, um, big toe out to the side, it

69
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.960
was, it was up in the, up in the

70
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.360
front. Um, SO this is indicative of a, of

71
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.320
a shift toward, uh, more of a life on

72
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.130
the ground, but the question is, does that preclude

73
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.639
significant amounts of arboreality, and so we conducted some

74
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.639
studies and we think that the answer is, is

75
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.550
not necessarily.

76
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.850
Right. But I, I mean, how regularly do humans

77
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.809
in traditional societies climb trees? Of course, I would

78
00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.570
imagine it depends the location where they live, if

79
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.890
there's many trees there or not, but uh how

80
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.290
often do they do it?

81
00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.230
Yeah, the answer is it depends, and the, the

82
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.429
data are a little bit hard to, to come

83
00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.309
by, but from what we were able to find

84
00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.549
it, uh, it can be up to 10% of

85
00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:37.390
the day, uh, spent in a tree, and I

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.950
think that's kind of an upper limit. These are

87
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.660
rainforest hunter gatherer populations. I believe that's a population

88
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.589
from like, um, Democratic Republic of Congo, um, so

89
00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:52.350
yeah, dense humid rainforest. So people will spend, um,

90
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.739
Yeah, a lot of time and, you know, the

91
00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:56.410
main reason that they'll be there is, is, um,

92
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.540
foraging. But what's interesting in these groups is that

93
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.690
it's not um like what you see in um

94
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.500
like a your your typical primate population, um like

95
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.260
apes or monkeys were kind of everyone is doing

96
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.140
similar things. What you see in human populations is

97
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.070
that sometimes it's um particular people that specialize in

98
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.350
Uh, in this climbing and might do it more

99
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.299
than others. So, it's kind of reflective of a

100
00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:28.019
division of labor that you see in humans. Um,

101
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.350
SO, yeah, it's not everybody doing this all the

102
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.670
time, but, um, it is to get significant uh

103
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.910
amounts of food, and so, um it can actually

104
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.910
happen more than, than we think. The population I

105
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.269
work with called the Batek, um, at least as

106
00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:44.869
far back as the 70s, they were climbing 50

107
00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.220
m trees on a daily basis. Um, SO it

108
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.739
can be frequent, but it isn't always.

109
00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:54.260
So, you mentioned food, is that the primary thing

110
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.660
they go up on the trees to do to

111
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.540
uh gather food? I mean, it's for foraging purposes

112
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.940
or are there other kinds of things that they

113
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.570
do up there?

114
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.269
Yeah, it seems like it's mostly food, although, uh,

115
00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.160
predation is also another um reason that they would

116
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.149
do this. There's actually some really interesting documentation of

117
00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.239
of tree houses, some of them like extremely large

118
00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:22.309
and elaborate, that have been built in some societies,

119
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.640
uh, that people like to keep their You know,

120
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.119
abode off of the ground basically, where you're more

121
00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.359
susceptible to to predation and other other kinds of

122
00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.790
threats. Um, BUT aside from that, yeah, it's food

123
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.040
and it's mainly um hunting, so you can hunt

124
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.239
from trees or you can go up in a

125
00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:41.279
tree to get an animal, um, or you can,

126
00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.799
yeah, hunt from the tree where you might ambush

127
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.959
an animal down below like a deer hunter might

128
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:50.940
like in North America, for example, um. And then

129
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.779
also fruit, so, you know, especially in tropical rainforest

130
00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.140
populations, you have really big trees and a lot

131
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.179
of the food is locked up uh in the

132
00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:02.339
canopy, right? And that requires climbing. So you can

133
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.059
go up and get really, really large amounts of

134
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.660
fruit, and I've and I've seen this in person

135
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.700
in um in Malaysia, um, but the big one.

136
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.510
Is honey. Um, HONEY is pretty much the sweetest

137
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.070
food in nature. Uh, IT'S really delicious. It's highly

138
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.350
prized by all, all societies, um, but of course

139
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.859
it comes with a catch, which is that, uh,

140
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:30.589
it is produced and heavily defended by stinging, uh,

141
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.309
insects, honeybees, right? Um, AND that, and that brings

142
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:35.000
us to a whole other, you know, sort of

143
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.230
topic, which is how do you get, um, honey

144
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.230
out of a tree and so humans are are

145
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.989
quite good at using Um, technologies, um, you know,

146
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.119
smoke and fire, and, um, plant extracts, compounds, um,

147
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.589
to sort of calm the bees down or they

148
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.989
sometimes go honey hunting at night, you know, I've,

149
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.390
I've seen this. I was on a honey hunting

150
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.269
trip up in the, uh, Thai border, um, a

151
00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:05.500
couple of years ago where people were climbing a

152
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.179
just an enormous tree about 2 in the morning,

153
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:13.570
um. With very little technological assistance. They weren't wearing

154
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.529
harnesses, uh, these men were only wearing shorts. Um,

155
00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:19.019
THEY did it at night because it kind of

156
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.040
confuses the bees. So they, they climb up and

157
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.459
they go out to the nest, which the species

158
00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.809
called Apis dorso of the giant Asian honeybee is,

159
00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:29.579
uh, kind of below the branch, kind of like

160
00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:31.579
a crescent, and they go up to it and

161
00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.179
they'll just get a big torch and kind of

162
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.179
just burn the bees off of each side, and

163
00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:40.460
then cut off the honey, put it into Put

164
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.739
it into a container and then kind of lower

165
00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:44.979
it down with a, with a pulley system. But

166
00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:48.179
I was always shocked that they actually did not

167
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.340
want to wear any kind of, uh, protection, like

168
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.659
a bee suit. Um, THEY felt that by being

169
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.330
clean and by wearing as little clothes as possible,

170
00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:01.140
that that was, uh, helpful because the bees wouldn't

171
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.309
be able to detect them through various sensory modalities.

172
00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:06.789
Um, SO, and then when you get honey, it

173
00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:08.750
can be massive amounts, right? Like you can have

174
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.239
100+ kilograms, um, in a single outing, uh, with,

175
00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:18.929
with aposada. There's, there's an astounding statistic from uh

176
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.789
the Mbuti population in Africa that, uh, during the

177
00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:26.570
honey season, um, that they eat up to 2

178
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.559
kg per person per day of honey. Uh, WHICH

179
00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:33.309
is an extraordinary amount of honey. I mean, it

180
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:35.760
actually sounds kind of gross, uh, it might make

181
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.880
you sick, um, but, but these are populations that

182
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.760
are, of course, food limited and, um, honey is

183
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.200
very nutritious. So, um, yeah, I think honey would

184
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.950
have been a really uh important reason to be

185
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.169
climbing for, uh, early hominins as well as obviously

186
00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:53.859
humans today.

187
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.960
Uh, WHICH is interesting because if we were thinking

188
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.400
about someone living in an industrialized society, if you

189
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.349
weigh 2 kg of honey in a single day,

190
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.150
you would probably have diabetes,

191
00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:10.640
right? Well, exactly, that's what's, that's what's amazing about

192
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.679
this is that, uh, I think, um, you know,

193
00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.599
like I said, they're they're food limited in that

194
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:17.440
environment and, and so it seems to be OK

195
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:17.869
for them.

196
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.349
So, uh, let me just ask you, I'm asking

197
00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:23.700
you this because it just came to my mind

198
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.059
and now and then I think we see it

199
00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.140
in movies, but I, I want to ask you

200
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.940
if it's something just fictional or if it also

201
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.619
happens in reality. So, do humans ever use trees

202
00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:39.780
to get away from predators, for example?

203
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:43.070
Oh yeah, um, I think they do. I think,

204
00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.179
I think quite a bit. Uh, WE actually found

205
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.909
a lot of examples of that in the ethnographic

206
00:10:47.909 --> 00:10:52.229
record. Um, WHEN you're out foraging, uh, hunting or

207
00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:57.099
gathering, um, you can come across, uh, animals that

208
00:10:57.109 --> 00:10:59.229
that might see you as prey, and so there's

209
00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:04.619
a particularly memorable, um, report that I read of

210
00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:09.669
a group of peeries. Which are apparently quite formidable

211
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.679
when there's a lot of them, um, attacking, I

212
00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:15.630
think, um, Maybe an Aceh man, this would be

213
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.390
in Paraguay, um, and he had to kind of

214
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.950
go up into a tree until they, until they

215
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.390
went away. Um, I'll also say that in my

216
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.590
own experience in Malaysia. Um, I've, I've heard of

217
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.830
several instances of people running into trees when they

218
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.150
were attacked by tigers. Um, IN fact, last summer

219
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.489
I was with a man who pulled his shirt

220
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:39.570
up and showed me claw marks on his back

221
00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:43.099
that, uh, were from an event where he was

222
00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:45.229
in the forest and a tiger attacked him and

223
00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:47.109
he had to jump into a tree. Sometimes it's

224
00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:49.679
kind of the The last resort. Um, I think

225
00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.679
lucky for these people, they're, they're very good at

226
00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:53.770
climbing and they'd be very capable. Um, IF it

227
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.520
was myself running from a, from a predator, I

228
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.799
don't think I would be, um, you know, nearly

229
00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:02.119
as lucky to get high enough in the tree

230
00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:02.869
to escape.

231
00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:06.369
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, me neither. But, uh, I mean,

232
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.349
but how proficient are humans at climbing trees compared

233
00:12:11.349 --> 00:12:13.479
to other animals? I mean, how good are we?

234
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.409
Yeah, it's a good question, and I think the

235
00:12:16.409 --> 00:12:19.090
answer is we're not as good as other animals,

236
00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:21.770
right? We definitely are, in a sense, committed terrestrial

237
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.640
bipeds. But I think that like our whole point

238
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.840
in this body of literature is that that we're

239
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.570
way better than we think that we are, and

240
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.570
therefore hominids in the past who had to climb

241
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.780
trees for survival were were probably very good. Um,

242
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.619
SO what we did in our study was we

243
00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:43.390
looked at actual performance of human climbing. So we

244
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.469
can look at how fast, uh, humans climb trees,

245
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.250
we can look at, um, Uh, like how much

246
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.690
they climb per day, right, things like that, um,

247
00:12:54.969 --> 00:12:55.969
and then, and then a few other things that

248
00:12:55.969 --> 00:12:58.289
I'll mention in a moment, but on, on those

249
00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:03.450
metrics, uh, it's actually pretty comparable. Um, SO humans

250
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.229
can climb trees pretty fast, um. Not too much

251
00:13:08.229 --> 00:13:11.270
slower than a, uh, let's say a chimpanzee or

252
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.809
something like that. Um They also, you know, we've

253
00:13:14.809 --> 00:13:17.440
already talked about how much time is spent, um,

254
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.659
in the trees, but sometimes they will climb large

255
00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:23.400
amounts per day. Like I was saying, the, the

256
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.359
Batek in Malaysia climb 50 m trees on a

257
00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:28.520
daily basis. So that turns into actually a lot

258
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.719
of, a lot of up and down, right? Uh,

259
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.450
THAT can, that can burn up a lot of

260
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.289
energy. Um, AND there's some other primates that actually

261
00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.030
don't even climb as much, uh, during the day.

262
00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:40.890
Now some primates that we think of as being

263
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.900
arboreally adapted. Like orangutans, chimps, gorillas, they actually spend,

264
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.869
you know, less time in trees than some human

265
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.349
groups do. Uh, SOMETIMES like the males of those

266
00:13:50.349 --> 00:13:52.940
species are actually too big to spend much time,

267
00:13:53.469 --> 00:13:54.750
much time in trees. So when you look at

268
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.229
the raw numbers, um, actually humans aren't aren't quite

269
00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:00.549
as bad as as we might think, and we

270
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:03.989
did a study a couple years ago. Looking at

271
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.750
um this question of how are humans able to

272
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.080
get closer to the tree, get closer to the

273
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.760
substrate, so they can climb, uh, efficiently, right? When

274
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.359
you go to a rock wall and, and you're

275
00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:19.679
climbing, you know, it's, it's certainly easier to climb

276
00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:22.640
when you are close to that, uh, wall, and

277
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.599
that's because Um, you know, there's less mass farther

278
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:30.460
away, so you're using less muscle, um, energy expenditure,

279
00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:33.989
basically to, to support yourself. And so we did

280
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:38.099
a study looking at, um, the ankle dorsiflexion of

281
00:14:38.099 --> 00:14:40.710
hunter-gatherers when they climb trees. So basically how much

282
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.950
the ankle is flexing when they put it up

283
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.460
against the tree. Um, And they do this because,

284
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.369
you know, with that big toe, we have to,

285
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.340
uh, being oriented to the front. We have to

286
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.020
climb in sort of a different way than some

287
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.299
other primates do. And this is a really fun

288
00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:59.380
thing that we've documented. Um, SO, what people will

289
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.460
do is they will walk up the tree where

290
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.780
you kind of lean back like this and put

291
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.780
your foot flat against it. It's called like the

292
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.250
lay back technique. You see in rock climbing too.

293
00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.000
Um, And then you just kind of lean back.

294
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.489
Um, AND this, uh, reduces the amount of, of,

295
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.289
you know, energy, um, that, that you're using. But

296
00:15:18.289 --> 00:15:20.049
this is a way that hominids, I think, could

297
00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:25.450
have climbed, despite having increasingly long legs. Um, ANOTHER

298
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.969
way they do it is by taking the big

299
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:29.479
toe. And, you know, our big toes, we, we

300
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.640
wear shoes, we develop wearing shoes, um, throughout childhood.

301
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.640
And so our feet tend to be very like,

302
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.900
Um, you know, forward, right? And very, uh, like,

303
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.830
uh, you know, clumped together, kind of, they're almost

304
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.229
like stuffed into a shoe. Um, BUT if you

305
00:15:46.229 --> 00:15:49.150
go, you know, live with the populations in Malaysia

306
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.619
and Africa, their feet, I mean, they literally look

307
00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:54.969
like this. They're splayed out completely like this, um,

308
00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:56.950
and the big toe is almost kind of out

309
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.150
to the side in some cases, and this is

310
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:04.229
because of this. Uh, DEVELOPMENTAL history of, um, not

311
00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:07.349
wearing shoes, of being in touch with your environment,

312
00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:10.469
of, of walking up hills and having to grip

313
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:14.359
into the, the mud to like pull yourself up.

314
00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:16.190
Um, AND so as a result, they have very

315
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.190
strong feet, and they can actually grab vines with

316
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.989
their big toe, kind of like this, and, and

317
00:16:21.989 --> 00:16:24.190
climb up. Um, AND so I, I thought that

318
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.349
was amazing because we think of our big toe

319
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:29.299
is basically just useless for other things other than

320
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.940
You know, walking and running, but it's actually been

321
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.289
co-opted, um, in climbing behavior in very kind of

322
00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:37.340
interesting ways. And what we found with the, with

323
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.780
the ankle dorsal flexion was that um people who

324
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.409
do, who, who climb trees regularly are able to

325
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.820
flex their Their ankles to a degree that in

326
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.690
you or me would probably break our ankles. Um,

327
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.690
IT'S, it's about the same as what chimpanzees do.

328
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.179
And this again is probably from a lifetime of

329
00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:57.859
climbing. And so, you know, we've argued that in

330
00:16:57.859 --> 00:16:59.659
these kinds of environments where you have to climb

331
00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:03.580
often, um, we have that phenotypic plasticity that can

332
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.709
allow you to become a very good tree climber

333
00:17:05.979 --> 00:17:08.939
and parallel the performance metrics of great apes in

334
00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:09.979
some surprising ways.

335
00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:14.708
Oh, OK. So, people in traditional societies who regularly

336
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:18.989
climb trees also have different and some anatomical differences

337
00:17:18.989 --> 00:17:22.749
in terms of their like with feet, legs, and

338
00:17:22.749 --> 00:17:23.417
stuff like that.

339
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.630
Well, I think it's still kind of an open

340
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.109
question. Um, CERTAINLY from an anecdotal perspective, like I

341
00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:32.209
was just saying, their feet look way different, um,

342
00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:35.709
they're gonna end up being, uh, stronger. Um, I

343
00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.619
don't, I wouldn't say it's necessarily a genetic effect,

344
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.829
but it could simply be just, um, use throughout,

345
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.000
um, used throughout life, right? Um, THAT enables them

346
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.910
to be, to be really good climbers, yeah.

347
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.199
And the fact that we are bipedal animals, does

348
00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:56.719
that have any effect on our ability to climb

349
00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:59.780
trees? I mean, did it have any negative impact,

350
00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:01.770
the fact that we became bipedal?

351
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.650
Well, I think unquestionably, um, it does. Uh, THE

352
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.489
previous thinking on it was that it basically made

353
00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:15.520
arborealism impossible uh for humans, right? By moving that

354
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.089
big toe to the front, you lose your grasping

355
00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:20.760
ability, so you can't hang out in trees anymore.

356
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.810
And what me and my colleagues have argued is

357
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.170
that, yes, it does compromise it, but not to

358
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.760
the extent commonly, um. Assumed. Now, there's also other

359
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.310
aspects of human anatomy. So, you know, hominins became

360
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.079
generally taller throughout human evolutionary history. Uh, THIS is

361
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:38.959
also gonna make tree climbing a little tougher because

362
00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:41.479
of what I mentioned before, where, you know, with

363
00:18:41.479 --> 00:18:43.640
that big toe being where it is, uh, one

364
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.750
of your options for climbing the tree is to

365
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.880
kind of lean back and that's, that's just gonna

366
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.709
be harder if you have a really long limb.

367
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.089
But there's another way that people actually climb trees

368
00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:55.239
that you see in some non in some non-human

369
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:58.930
primates too. Which is called uh the frog style.

370
00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:00.939
And this is where you take your legs and

371
00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.939
they're kind of splayed out, and imagine that my

372
00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:06.180
coffee cup is a tree, you would kind of

373
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.180
be around it like this, where your legs are

374
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.150
out, right? Um. And so that's a way of,

375
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.130
again, getting around having really long legs. What's really

376
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.560
cool actually, I'll just make a quick note is

377
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.280
that in these populations that they have many different

378
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.719
words for different styles of free climbing. Um, THE

379
00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:25.949
way that you position your foot and your legs,

380
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.630
there's a different vocabulary for all of it. And

381
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.640
so that just goes to show the heritage of

382
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.880
tree climbing having an impact on the language and

383
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.439
the way that that people, you know, see the

384
00:19:36.439 --> 00:19:39.099
world. But when we look at other, other traits

385
00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:41.819
like having um a long Achilles tendon and other

386
00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:45.420
kind of soft tissue adaptations, um, you know, we're

387
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.020
not really using that uh elastic mechanism when we

388
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.819
climb trees unless you were to do it really

389
00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:53.260
fast. And I think it is possible, but frankly,

390
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.369
this stuff hasn't been, uh, studied enough, um, to,

391
00:19:57.469 --> 00:20:00.064
to come to any firm conclusions, but Again, I

392
00:20:00.064 --> 00:20:03.625
think my main argument would be that, uh, while

393
00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:08.094
bipedalism does compromise, uh, compromise tree climbing behavior, um,

394
00:20:08.224 --> 00:20:12.224
that's, it's much more complicated than, um, I think

395
00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:13.905
we made it out to be previously. And that's,

396
00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:17.545
that should impact how we, uh, view fossil hominins

397
00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:18.824
and what their capabilities were.

398
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.410
Right. So now talking a little bit about running,

399
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.000
one interesting thing I read in your work is

400
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.680
that you've done work on different techniques, different running

401
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.579
techniques that people have across human society. So, what

402
00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:37.560
are the different kinds of techniques out there?

403
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.939
Yeah, so anthropologists for a long time, kind of

404
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:43.689
like what we've been talking about, we're really interested

405
00:20:43.689 --> 00:20:48.689
in how, uh, culture and ecology impact, uh, behavior,

406
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.969
right? Impact what, what we do. Now, um, running

407
00:20:51.969 --> 00:20:55.770
is something that, that, you know, in industrialized society

408
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.969
we do, we do as exercise, um, you know,

409
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.290
for fun, um, but it's not something that's actually

410
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.400
been studied a whole lot. There are, of course,

411
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.410
some very prominent hypotheses about, um, endurance running and

412
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.150
persistence hunting. Um, BUT my colleagues and I were

413
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.500
kind of interested in, in some of the nitty

414
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.900
gritty mechanics of how people are, are actually running

415
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.609
and how this depends on, uh, on cultural context.

416
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.900
Now, when we go for a run, um, chances

417
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.709
are that you have a, a really thick soled

418
00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:28.410
shoe, uh, that gives you a lot of, a

419
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.140
lot of cushion. And so when you have that,

420
00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:33.660
what what tends to happen is that when you

421
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.260
run, you land on your rear foot. So if

422
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.300
this is your foot, you'd be landing on uh

423
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.660
on your heel, basically, right? Right. Now, if I

424
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.890
were to say take that shoe off and run

425
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.890
barefoot, your running uh mechanics would, would change, OK?

426
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.180
And they would change because you wouldn't want to

427
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.689
be landing with a really high impact force on

428
00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.250
Your heel. And this is actually in a sense

429
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.849
a suboptimal uh way of running, cause if you

430
00:22:03.849 --> 00:22:06.770
think about it, if you're really uh striding out

431
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.130
and hitting on your heel, then you're actually kind

432
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.180
of breaking. Uh, RIGHT when you land. And if

433
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.280
you're wanting to propel yourself, why would you break?

434
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:18.209
Because then you just have to exert more energy

435
00:22:18.209 --> 00:22:21.569
to get yourself going again, right? Um, SO we

436
00:22:21.569 --> 00:22:24.180
refer to that as suboptimal running mechanics, and there's

437
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.930
been a lot of biomechanical studies and energetic studies,

438
00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:29.790
um, done on this. So it's more efficient when

439
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.640
you run to land on your fore foot or

440
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.099
midfoot, and that means that you're a little bit

441
00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:37.310
like straighter when you run and you avoid this

442
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.589
uh what I'm referring to here is over striding

443
00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:42.150
of hitting on, you know, the kind of the

444
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.800
back of your foot. And so there's been a,

445
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.099
a body of studies recently, um, one of which

446
00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:53.540
was ours showing uh variation in running technique across

447
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.050
societies. We can basically ask which societies run with

448
00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.619
more optimal techniques and which with more suboptimal techniques

449
00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:02.459
and why might you have those differences.

450
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:08.060
OK, and what are perhaps some of the determinants

451
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.560
here? I mean, what's behind the kind of dominant

452
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.209
technique that we see in each society?

453
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.829
Well, there's probably a lot of factors, but one

454
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:21.339
that we were looking at is whether there is

455
00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:26.180
a heritage of long distance running in the society,

456
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.739
right? So, um, a population like the Taramara of

457
00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:34.270
Mexico that's been studied quite a bit, uh, they

458
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.699
have a long documented history of running for, uh,

459
00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:41.630
you know, going after prey animals, but then more

460
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.489
recently and kind of more ritualistic, um, behavior. On

461
00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:47.310
the other hand, you might have societies, you know,

462
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.150
kind of like the ones I work in, rainforest

463
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.310
hunter gatherers, where I've never seen people run unless

464
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.979
they're playing like a game of soccer for fun.

465
00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:57.589
But being in the in the jungle, um, it's

466
00:23:57.589 --> 00:23:59.829
not a great place to go running because of

467
00:23:59.829 --> 00:24:02.500
all the things that are on the ground, basically,

468
00:24:02.869 --> 00:24:04.349
um, it wouldn't really make a whole lot of

469
00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:07.589
sense. Um, SO what you might think then is

470
00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:09.670
that in those societies that have this heritage of

471
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.170
running, um, especially in a fitness relevant context, like

472
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.459
hunting. Like hunting game, that they would evince more

473
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:22.510
optimal running mechanics and those societies that don't. And

474
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.790
there's only a few studies that can really shed

475
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.829
light on this, but it does, the, the, the

476
00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:30.239
current pattern in these societies does kind of match

477
00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:32.709
up. So when you look at societies that have

478
00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:36.540
a heritage of running in a fitness relevant context,

479
00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:42.109
we do find that they are using more optimal

480
00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:46.670
running mechanics, um. Sorry, and this raises the question

481
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.109
of why, right? And there's, there's kind of two

482
00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:51.989
possibilities. One is, it could it just be a

483
00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:54.349
kind of self self optimization. And, and humans are

484
00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:57.390
actually pretty good at, at doing this, right? Like

485
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.099
when you walk around on a daily basis, uh,

486
00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:03.349
just like walking around town, uh, you will end

487
00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:05.630
up, most likely, unless you're like in a rush

488
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.189
or something, you'll end up most likely walking at

489
00:25:08.189 --> 00:25:10.469
the speed that reduces what we call that that

490
00:25:10.469 --> 00:25:14.400
minimizes rather. What we call the the the uh

491
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.949
cost of transport, which is basically how much energy

492
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:21.280
your body is burning, um, per per unit mass

493
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.719
per distance walked, and um and that's basically what

494
00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:28.959
you feel as comfortable, right? So one argument can

495
00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:31.689
be made that it's something like that, uh, where,

496
00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:33.780
you know, if you're running a lot, you should

497
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.339
fall into a more kind of optimal state because

498
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:39.420
you're engaging in energy savings. Let's let's say if

499
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.339
you're doing long distance running and doing this for

500
00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:45.510
20+ kilometers. Um, ANOTHER way to think about it,

501
00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:49.239
uh, that is not mutually exclusive would be the

502
00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:52.760
role of social learning, right? So, humans learn a

503
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.790
lot from each other. We observe each other, um,

504
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.199
we, we watch what other people do, and then

505
00:25:58.199 --> 00:26:02.339
we adopt those behaviors because we trust from our

506
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.920
prestigious colleagues that this is a a good way

507
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.219
to do things. Um, SO there may be an

508
00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:08.859
element of that as well, where people are kind

509
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:11.540
of observing what other people, especially those who are

510
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.579
good at it, what they're doing, and then we

511
00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:15.739
kind of adopt it. Um, THERE'S not a whole

512
00:26:15.739 --> 00:26:18.219
lot of data on what people are observing when

513
00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:21.150
it comes to athletic feats in these societies. I

514
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.400
think that would be interesting to explore, but I

515
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.479
would, I would guess that it's probably a combination

516
00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:28.439
of, of these two, and it's just that if

517
00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:30.609
this is a behavior that's really relevant in your

518
00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:33.109
society, then you're gonna more likely be doing it

519
00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:35.920
in this kind of um more optimal way.

520
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.410
So this culture also influence at least to some

521
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.530
extent, the, the running technique that we see across

522
00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.729
different societies.

523
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.140
Yeah, exactly. Like we, we did a study with,

524
00:26:50.229 --> 00:26:53.780
uh, Jimani hunter horticulturalists. This is kind of like,

525
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.030
um, like the botch in the sense that they

526
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.349
are a kind of a jungle living group, but

527
00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:01.579
they, you know, they're like small scale horticulturalists. And,

528
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.459
uh, we documented, because there's a lot of data

529
00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:06.369
on this group through what's called the Jimane Health

530
00:27:06.369 --> 00:27:08.910
and Life History Project, we actually know what people

531
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.430
do, uh, um, like with their days with a

532
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.479
very high level of, of precision. And, uh, running

533
00:27:16.479 --> 00:27:18.119
is not really a thing that that folks in

534
00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:20.800
this population do. And then when we went and

535
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.000
we studied their, their uh running mechanics, and I'll

536
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.560
just make a quick note about how we do

537
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.989
this. We basically ask people to walk on a

538
00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:31.079
a transect that we set up, and then we

539
00:27:31.079 --> 00:27:34.290
have a a camera oriented perpendicular to that transect

540
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.760
and we just kind of record what they're doing.

541
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.329
Um, THIS isn't, this was a couple of years

542
00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:41.060
ago, this isn't a super fancy way of doing

543
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.020
it, but then you can look at the way

544
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.619
that the foot is landing, um, where it's landing

545
00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:48.579
in relation to the center of mass, and whether

546
00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:51.020
they are doing that thing I described earlier, like

547
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.250
over striding. And it turned out that this group,

548
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.020
um, they were pretty suboptimal runners, right? They weren't

549
00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.489
great runners from a mechanical, uh, standpoint. So that's,

550
00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:03.020
that's consistent with the hypothesis that I was mentioning

551
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.050
earlier. And there's been some other studies um on

552
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.489
other kinds of pastoralists, um, populations in Africa with

553
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:13.449
different subsistence heritage, showing that, um, yeah, if if

554
00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:16.199
they don't run very much, then, then yeah, it's

555
00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:18.439
the same as the Tsimane, they're engaging in these,

556
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.810
these suboptimal mechanics. So I think um we're only

557
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.130
scratching the surface here. I think we need to

558
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.890
get a better understanding of how um People are

559
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.689
using their bodies across these different uh ecological and

560
00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:35.209
cultural contexts, and then kind of the question you're

561
00:28:35.209 --> 00:28:37.650
getting at is like, why, right? Why do we

562
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.770
see this variation? What is um producing it? So

563
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.010
that's all we can say at the moment, but

564
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.209
I think it's gonna be a fun area of

565
00:28:44.209 --> 00:28:45.050
study in the future.

566
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.119
Uh, AND particularly in industrialized societies and that, that's

567
00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:55.520
also the case even for professional athletes. We, we

568
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.000
use shoes, we walk on shoes and run on

569
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
shoes. Uh, DOES that influence in any way the

570
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.359
running technique that we tend to adopt?

571
00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:07.459
Yeah, I think it does. Um, AND some have

572
00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:10.380
even advanced the argument that with the, with the

573
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.310
evolution of footwear technology starting in the 1970s, kind

574
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.699
of driven by Nike with these really thick soles,

575
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:21.670
that actually the, the, the, the marketing, the culture

576
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.630
kind of changed the way that, that people run

577
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.390
because you gave them this really big soul and

578
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.150
so they, they can then overstride. Um, AND that's

579
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.140
had, you know, potentially really interesting impacts on our,

580
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.589
uh, perceptions of what is normal on our, on

581
00:29:36.589 --> 00:29:39.910
our health. Um, YOU know, one thing that maybe

582
00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.750
is obvious, but I didn't exactly mention is that

583
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.550
11 other issue with, with the over striding and

584
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.910
hitting, hitting on your heel is that you get

585
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.790
these higher impact forces that are traveling through your

586
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:54.599
skeleton. And so that can be associated with um

587
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.319
greater musculoskeletal issues, right? You know, the wear and

588
00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:00.520
tear that we talk about, if you run hundreds

589
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.119
or thousands of miles, um, that's the that's the

590
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:05.079
kind of uh reason that the wear and tear

591
00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:08.199
might eventually cause, um, you know, some kind of

592
00:30:08.199 --> 00:30:12.680
injury. Um, SO I think there's uh There's a

593
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.239
lot going on here with uh with the cultures,

594
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.040
and I think it's a good argument that things

595
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.989
have changed relatively recently because footwear used to be

596
00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:24.479
uh relatively minimal. Um, AND it goes beyond running

597
00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:28.020
as well, like I see in Uh, Malaysia, where

598
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.699
I work, that the way that people walk is

599
00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:33.689
kind of different than the way that I walk.

600
00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:37.790
Um, THIS was actually referred to by, um, early

601
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.859
ethnographers writing about 100 years ago that, um, rainforest

602
00:30:41.859 --> 00:30:44.180
people have a springy gate. And so I was

603
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.380
kind of like, you know, what does that mean?

604
00:30:45.489 --> 00:30:46.699
But I kind of know what that is now

605
00:30:46.699 --> 00:30:48.660
because I've seen it, and it's where literally you're

606
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.770
kind of going like this. They're really like bending

607
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.260
their knees as they walk, which in a sense

608
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.030
is kind of a If you're, if you're walking

609
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.010
out in the open, that's kind of a suboptimal

610
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.859
way to walk. Um, BUT if you're walking in

611
00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:04.140
a rainforest that's full of obstacles that you could

612
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.439
fall over at any minute, it actually makes a

613
00:31:06.439 --> 00:31:09.530
lot of sense, uh, to be walking like that,

614
00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:12.819
because you're kind of like protecting yourself against the

615
00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:15.810
lack of stability that could, that could happen as

616
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.910
a result of tree branches or, you know, clutter

617
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.949
in the forest. Um, I'd also seen reports, and

618
00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:23.699
I, I don't know how, how true this is,

619
00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:26.510
but that people in the Middle Ages used to

620
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.790
walk, um, a little bit differently as well in

621
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.579
terms of like walking with pointed toes, um. Again,

622
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.180
I'm not sure how, how true that is or

623
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.660
how we might know, you know, based on like

624
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.140
paintings and art and so on. But um, I

625
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.780
think the point stands is that what we see

626
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.819
now as, as being normal, might actually be tremendously

627
00:31:46.819 --> 00:31:50.459
abnormal from an evolutionary perspective. And as an anthropologist,

628
00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:52.819
those are exactly the kinds of questions that that

629
00:31:52.819 --> 00:31:53.780
really fascinate us.

630
00:31:55.319 --> 00:31:58.250
But then the kind of footwear we use and

631
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.369
how it influences the way we walk and run,

632
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.060
it can also have consequences for, I mean, how

633
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.140
over time, the wear and tear that happens in

634
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.209
our bodies,

635
00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:12.939
right? Well, exactly, and one, and one reason for

636
00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:15.260
that is not only higher impact forces, let's say

637
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.619
if you're a regular runner, but we tend to

638
00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:21.979
shape technologies when it comes to ergonomic design, that

639
00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:24.369
can actually have the effect of making us weaker.

640
00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:26.920
Right? So you can wear these really comfortable shoes

641
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.760
with a high arch, they might feel great, but

642
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.560
this might steadily lead to a degradation of your

643
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.119
intrinsic foot muscles that are, are pretty small, but

644
00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:39.040
they're pretty important in terms of, of you maintaining

645
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.280
your balance and your strength in your foot, and

646
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.770
that can in turn lead to Um, injuries, you

647
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.250
know, when we think about, um, aging and in

648
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.089
older age, how, uh, you know, a catastrophic fall

649
00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:55.170
can often be what leads to someone having really

650
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.969
big health problems or, or even dying. Um, YOU

651
00:32:58.969 --> 00:33:01.369
know, this could possibly be linked with how we

652
00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:04.530
have been using our bodies, um, over the past

653
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:09.589
decades in industrialized society, um, where we're just Uh,

654
00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:12.439
not using them in, in ways that's gonna help

655
00:33:12.439 --> 00:33:15.800
us be healthy into later life, doing more complicated

656
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.109
three dimensional, uh, locomotion that keeps all of our,

657
00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:23.079
of our joints and ligaments, and tendons and muscles

658
00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:25.890
strong, rather than just the ones that we use,

659
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.880
um, you know, just, just walking basically. Um, SO

660
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.239
I think this actually has pretty important, uh, impacts

661
00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:37.229
when we think about musculoskeletal health and aging.

662
00:33:37.439 --> 00:33:41.890
Yeah. And so, at least when possible, do you

663
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.810
think that it could be beneficial for people to

664
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.089
walk and run barefoot?

665
00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:50.790
Yeah, this is a, this is a highly debated,

666
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.319
um, issue, of course. And I think, I think

667
00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:57.680
the answer is a, a qualified yes, because we

668
00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.160
know that it can, that like barefoot running and

669
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.280
walking can help with the development of the structures

670
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.540
that I was just talking about. But the, the,

671
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.958
the problem is, is that, um, when people adopt

672
00:34:08.958 --> 00:34:12.570
it, they tend to do so very, uh, quickly,

673
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.399
right? The kind of zeal of the convert. This

674
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.958
happened to me. I took up barefoot running. Maybe

675
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:19.009
10 years ago. Um, I don't, I don't do

676
00:34:19.009 --> 00:34:20.608
it anymore, but I, I did it about 10

677
00:34:20.608 --> 00:34:23.368
years ago. And I, I took my my Vibram

678
00:34:23.368 --> 00:34:25.849
5 fingers and I went out for a, a

679
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:29.009
3-mile run. And I was in a world of

680
00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:31.168
hurt the next day because my body wasn't used

681
00:34:31.168 --> 00:34:33.029
to that, that way of running. I could barely

682
00:34:33.264 --> 00:34:36.495
Walk. Um, NOW, I didn't get catastrophically injured, but,

683
00:34:36.655 --> 00:34:39.344
but some people actually do. Um, SO I think

684
00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:41.264
the key is that you have to let your

685
00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:44.504
body adjust to the new footwear. But, but then

686
00:34:44.504 --> 00:34:47.745
after that, it could potentially be, um, it could

687
00:34:47.745 --> 00:34:50.080
potentially be beneficial. Yeah. Yeah.

688
00:34:51.188 --> 00:34:53.250
So I want to get into the topic of

689
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.139
hunting, but just before that, one more question and

690
00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:02.050
particularly from an evolutionary perspective, reproductive success is very

691
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:07.050
important. So in non-industrial societies, what are the determinants

692
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.760
of reproductive success?

693
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.850
Yeah, reproductive success is important, right? It's kind of

694
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.850
the currency of natural selection. So when we want

695
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.050
to understand how evolution and and selection have shaped

696
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.679
the, the human body, the, the human, um, psychology,

697
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.050
um, our, our behavior, uh, we want to understand.

698
00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:31.919
Um, WHAT the determinants are of reproductive success in

699
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.250
non-industrialized societies that might better reflect ancestral, uh, conditions.

700
00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:39.280
The answer is that it's a little bit complicated.

701
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.649
Um, IT seems like status, broadly speaking, is something

702
00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:46.689
that has a big role. So whether, you know,

703
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.570
we can talk about that in the broad sense

704
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:53.760
as something, uh, like physical formidability, um, hunting success.

705
00:35:54.149 --> 00:35:59.719
Um, POLITICAL status, um, and influence. These are traits

706
00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:03.639
that, that typically correlate with reproductive success in small

707
00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:06.879
scale societies, and there was a, uh, probably the

708
00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:09.919
most authoritative study by, uh, Chris von Ryden and

709
00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:12.530
Adrian Yage a couple of years ago showing that

710
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.830
this, that there is a positive correlation um across,

711
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.760
I think they studied like 46 non-industrialized societies or

712
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.949
something, um, uh. So yeah, those are those are

713
00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:28.179
generally the uh ways in which this this uh

714
00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:31.709
is is studied. Um, HUNTING success can be, you

715
00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:34.350
know, one of those, right? So if you're a

716
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.870
good hunter, uh, you're bringing back food that is

717
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:42.110
nutritious, it's beneficial to, to your group, um, you

718
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.199
might be seen as someone who's who's highly competent.

719
00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:48.669
I think where the debate really lies is what

720
00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:53.370
is the exact pathway from status to reproductive. Success,

721
00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:57.419
um, because it can get complicated, right? And this

722
00:36:57.419 --> 00:36:59.340
gets you into all sorts of other issues in

723
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.949
human evolutionary studies like, well, why are men bothering

724
00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:04.250
to hunt at all? And that's a whole other

725
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.820
topic, but um we can talk about two general

726
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.409
ways that happens, you know, one might be like

727
00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:12.939
direct family provisioning, right? Uh, LET'S say you're part

728
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:16.120
of a nuclear family. You go hunting, you bring

729
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.719
food back, and you can share it with, let's

730
00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:21.600
say your wife and kids, right? So that means

731
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.520
more food is going into their mouths, they're able

732
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.959
to have the energy they need to fight off

733
00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:30.040
pathogens, to, to put on weight to be healthy,

734
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.479
and then to eventually have their own children. So

735
00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:35.280
there's that route, but then there's also a more

736
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.600
indirect route, um, where you're using hunting as a

737
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.520
way almost of, of showing off, right? Um, AND

738
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.590
in this way, uh, it's been hypothesized that, that,

739
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.320
uh, men hunt, um, in order to show off

740
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.479
and maybe get access to mating opportunities, um, by

741
00:37:55.479 --> 00:37:59.320
showing off their high quality, uh, through hunting, for

742
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.870
example. And so that's another way to, to get

743
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.300
to higher fertility, right, is to is to potentially

744
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.340
get more uh more partners. Um, AND kind of

745
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.709
between those, there's a whole lot of other complications

746
00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:17.419
like, uh, political, uh, status, right? Being able to

747
00:38:17.939 --> 00:38:20.340
influence other people, to have them do things for

748
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.100
you, uh, your role as as a leader, and

749
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.820
being able to influence others, uh, being able to

750
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.350
elicit support. Uh, RIGHT. So if you are at

751
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.189
the center of a network where everyone is helping

752
00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:36.070
you out, your children might benefit from that and

753
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.820
maybe suffer a lower risk of, of, um, mortality.

754
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.870
And so, reproductive success has been studied in sort

755
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.270
of all of these ways, and I would say

756
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.540
that there's um general evidence of, of a relationship,

757
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.860
but um it's a little bit unclear exactly what

758
00:38:53.949 --> 00:38:56.229
uh predicts it, right? There's been studies showing that

759
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.850
Um, this was among the Hadza showing that like

760
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:04.840
lower voice pitch in men predicts, um, reproductive success.

761
00:39:04.879 --> 00:39:07.239
So this has something to do, it's hypothesized to

762
00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:10.209
have something to do with phenotypic, uh, quality, like

763
00:39:10.209 --> 00:39:13.969
in in acquiring mating opportunities. Um, ANOTHER interesting study

764
00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:17.205
from a Years ago showed that in, in, in

765
00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:20.844
the Bayaka group in Africa and the OGTA group

766
00:39:20.844 --> 00:39:26.125
in the Philippines, that measures of network centrality were

767
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:29.804
predictive of reproductive success in, um, in these female,

768
00:39:29.885 --> 00:39:32.995
and the females of these hunter gatherer groups. Um,

769
00:39:33.165 --> 00:39:34.655
SO again, that goes back to the idea of

770
00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:39.485
being able to elicit social support, um, to, to

771
00:39:39.485 --> 00:39:43.300
sort of help, uh, your own reproductive interests. Um,

772
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.469
ONE of the complications with studies of reproductive success

773
00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:51.669
is that humans are a really long-lived species, right?

774
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.469
Um, TO even do a study, uh, of this

775
00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:55.989
kind of thing in the span of a few

776
00:39:55.989 --> 00:40:00.429
years introduces, uh, some real complications because it would

777
00:40:00.429 --> 00:40:05.750
be, uh, inherently cross-sectional, right? Um, SO you can

778
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.649
do all sorts of things, statistically controlling for age

779
00:40:07.649 --> 00:40:10.070
and so on. Uh, THAT, that can help with

780
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.010
this. Um, BUT it's, it's really hard to measure.

781
00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:14.620
We did a study a couple of years ago

782
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.050
where we have access to a data set with

783
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.340
the botte of Malaysia, where, um, we actually were

784
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.459
able to calculate lifetime reproductive success because we had

785
00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:26.540
data on hunting behavior from the 70s, and that's

786
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.209
a very rare, a very rare thing to have.

787
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.320
Um BUT our study actually found no relationship with

788
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.800
anything. So, um We weren't able to, to predict

789
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.919
reproductive success in this population, but that's exactly what

790
00:40:38.919 --> 00:40:41.399
you should expect, right? You expect variation. You expect

791
00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:44.590
that in some populations, that these factors will have

792
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.879
a strong influence, whereas in other populations, maybe they

793
00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:50.159
won't. One of the things that we point to

794
00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:53.879
in our study is that the egalitarian nature of

795
00:40:53.879 --> 00:40:58.399
a lot of hunter-gatherers um might militate against a

796
00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:02.600
strong relationship between Uh, say, hunting and reproductive success.

797
00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:04.969
And one way this can happen is in these

798
00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:08.199
egalitarian societies like food is shared around a lot.

799
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.790
So you come in with a big game animal

800
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.669
that you've killed. Um, AND, and instead of just

801
00:41:13.899 --> 00:41:16.739
giving the whole antelope to your family, there's norms

802
00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:19.290
in place that dictate that you have to share

803
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.899
this with basically everybody, right? And so in that

804
00:41:22.899 --> 00:41:27.439
way, you're kind of militating against the preferential treatment

805
00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:30.179
of, say, your own offspring that could lead to

806
00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:34.899
that relationship with um with uh with RS, um.

807
00:41:35.219 --> 00:41:37.679
So, so there's that, and there's also leveling mechanisms

808
00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:41.209
in terms of of status, right? When a, when

809
00:41:41.209 --> 00:41:44.110
a coon hunter comes into camp with an antelope,

810
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.239
um, something happens called insulting the meat, where uh

811
00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.639
people will say, oh well, we've seen bigger antelope

812
00:41:50.639 --> 00:41:52.830
than that or it's not, it's not fat enough.

813
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.469
So this person that you would think would be

814
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.870
be able to gain status um and prestige from,

815
00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:02.320
you know, being a good hunter, uh, they, what's

816
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.850
called cool the heart of the hunter. Um, AND

817
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.179
again, this could potentially militate that pathway to, to

818
00:42:08.179 --> 00:42:11.280
reproductive success. So the answer is it's complicated, it's,

819
00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:15.169
it's culturally, uh, dependent, but that we, we generally

820
00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:18.050
do see a trend with, with, um, status and

821
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.080
reproductive success.

822
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.590
But in the particular case of hunting, does it

823
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.540
tie to reproductive success for both sexes or mostly

824
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.090
for men?

825
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.189
Yeah, well, that's a good question. Um, AS we'll

826
00:42:33.189 --> 00:42:36.229
probably talk more about, um, in, in traditional societies,

827
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.149
it's, it's mostly men that do much of the

828
00:42:38.149 --> 00:42:41.550
hunting. Um, SO that's kind of how it's been

829
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:45.820
analyzed because there isn't a large sample size of

830
00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:48.229
instances of female hunting that you could correlate with

831
00:42:48.229 --> 00:42:50.270
it. And this is, you know, this compounds the

832
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.310
problems of sample size and long generations that I

833
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.560
mentioned. Um, BEFORE, but what's interesting is that, um,

834
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:01.010
female reproductive success hasn't gotten the same kind of

835
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.449
attention as male, and we kind of pointed this

836
00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:04.810
out in one of our papers from a few

837
00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.330
years ago, and I think it's um unfortunate, um,

838
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.729
it it doesn't really make a whole lot of

839
00:43:09.729 --> 00:43:12.879
sense. Part of the reason I, I think historically,

840
00:43:13.719 --> 00:43:17.600
Is that, um, in, in primates, you generally do

841
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.399
see a higher variance in reproductive success in males

842
00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:24.000
and females, and this is why you, you tend

843
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.080
to see highly ornamented um male primates, um, at

844
00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.350
least in some groups of primates, um, and so,

845
00:43:33.199 --> 00:43:35.399
For that reason, uh, there might be kind of

846
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:38.229
more to explain when it comes to males, but,

847
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.520
uh, what what the data have shown is that,

848
00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:42.120
you know, you have a lot of variation in

849
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.000
female reproductive success too, and I think we don't

850
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.760
have a good explanation of why that happens. So

851
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.000
if we look at the The mirror of the

852
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.959
hunting case, you might expect that maybe, maybe gathering

853
00:43:52.959 --> 00:43:56.520
success, uh, is the thing that predicts female reproductive

854
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.800
success. Hasn't really been tested. We, we did a

855
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.429
test of it, we didn't find a relationship. Um,

856
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:04.840
BUT I think that because scholars are paying more

857
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.600
attention now to what, to what women are doing,

858
00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:10.479
to how they are engaging in cooperative systems in

859
00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:13.709
their societies, um, we're gonna have a better idea

860
00:44:13.709 --> 00:44:15.729
of, of how that works. And One of the

861
00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:18.689
studies I mentioned before was actually on women, showing

862
00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:24.209
that that network centrality basically of um women in

863
00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:28.500
two hunter-gatherer societies did predict reproductive success. And so

864
00:44:28.729 --> 00:44:30.330
that kind of makes a lot of sense, right?

865
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.489
It, it kind of dictates your access to resources.

866
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.489
And so in that sense, being a good cooperative

867
00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:40.689
partner, being, being friendly, being generous, um, probably is

868
00:44:40.689 --> 00:44:44.600
what's gonna Uh, really mediate that path in females,

869
00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:45.840
but I, but I wish I had a better

870
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.229
answer for you. We need to study it more.

871
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.469
Uh, BUT, uh, I mean, when we talk about

872
00:44:51.469 --> 00:44:56.429
hunting, does it include both big game and small

873
00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:58.040
game or just big game?

874
00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.159
Um, YEAH, it depends how, you know, the specific

875
00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:03.979
context in which we're talking about it. But all

876
00:45:03.979 --> 00:45:06.149
of these studies that I've been talking about, they

877
00:45:06.149 --> 00:45:09.830
would, they would be combining them, essentially. I mean,

878
00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:11.750
one of, one of the big differences between big

879
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.629
game and small game is in how it gets

880
00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:18.030
shared out. Uh, LARGE game tends to be shared

881
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.830
out camp wide, and I'm, I'm really generalizing here

882
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.550
with hunter gatherers, but But that's generally what we,

883
00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:27.159
what we see, whereas smaller game, um, may be

884
00:45:27.159 --> 00:45:28.520
the kind of thing that you just kind of

885
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:32.439
consume with your family, um, and so those those

886
00:45:32.439 --> 00:45:37.310
are sometimes kind of treated, treated differently, and um,

887
00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:40.790
we do see that that women do hunt, uh,

888
00:45:41.159 --> 00:45:44.080
small game pretty often in some in some societies

889
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.520
where they don't typically go after uh large game.

890
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.600
And so that's one of these axes of the

891
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.669
division of the sexual division of labor. That we

892
00:45:52.669 --> 00:45:54.149
see in hunter gatherer societies.

893
00:45:55.409 --> 00:45:59.139
But then women, of course, I'm not saying here

894
00:45:59.139 --> 00:46:03.979
that men or women hunt at er at higher

895
00:46:03.979 --> 00:46:06.620
rates or which one of them hunts at higher

896
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.689
rates, but women also participate in hunting them.

897
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.580
Right? Yeah, they do, and it's something that I

898
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.179
think um doesn't receive enough attention. I think it

899
00:46:16.179 --> 00:46:18.179
kind of has recently, as we'll probably talk about.

900
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.840
Um, BUT when we go back to thinking about

901
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.500
like the early study of human origins, going back

902
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.229
100 years ago, or or even more actually, um,

903
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.000
hunting was really the, the centerpiece. It was thought

904
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.489
to be the driving factor that made humans different

905
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.909
from the other primates, right? It's what allowed us

906
00:46:39.909 --> 00:46:43.100
to stand up on two legs, to use complex

907
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.370
tools so that we could hunt them and then

908
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:49.889
butcher them. Um, AND it also was thought to

909
00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:54.979
facilitate, uh, cooperation, especially among males who would be,

910
00:46:55.129 --> 00:46:57.530
you know, going after the, the mammoth or whatever

911
00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.489
it is, um, to, to kill it, and then,

912
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.879
and then share that food with the group. Um,

913
00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:05.520
AND so this, you know, you can refer to

914
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.850
this as like the idea of, of man the

915
00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:10.090
hunter, which is kind of a complicated idea that

916
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.479
links with the, the hunting hypothesis, but it has

917
00:47:13.479 --> 00:47:17.760
been. A relatively male kind of centric idea. And

918
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.110
so, I think for that reason, instances of female

919
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:24.840
hunting in hunter gatherer societies, um, they, they have

920
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.070
been overlooked. And um I think in the past

921
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.090
30 or 40 years, they have gotten some attention.

922
00:47:31.159 --> 00:47:34.159
So if we go back to um the man

923
00:47:34.159 --> 00:47:37.399
the Hunter conference, which uh was a conference that

924
00:47:37.399 --> 00:47:41.030
happened at the University of Chicago in 1966. It

925
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.189
was really the start of modern hunter gatherer studies

926
00:47:44.189 --> 00:47:46.229
where you had this group of people that came

927
00:47:46.229 --> 00:47:49.270
together who had worked with different societies around the

928
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.629
globe and said, OK, what can we learn about

929
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:56.310
prehistory from modern variation in hunter gatherers, and that's

930
00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:58.620
kind of how we think about it uh today.

931
00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.459
And there were a lot of, you know, important

932
00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:03.429
results of that conference, including the idea of the

933
00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:07.000
original affluent society that Um, hunter gatherers don't work

934
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
very hard, that life wasn't this constant struggle for

935
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.699
existence. There is also the, um, The uh finding

936
00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:18.860
by Richard Lee, uh, showing that women produced much

937
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.699
more food than previously thought, mostly in the form

938
00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:25.060
of gathering. So that was highly influential, but what,

939
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.379
what people sometimes forget is that at the Man

940
00:48:27.379 --> 00:48:29.580
the Hunter conference, there was actually a paper that

941
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.929
that was um quite concerned with women's hunting, um,

942
00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:36.939
by a scholar named Watanabe, uh, studying the Ainu

943
00:48:36.939 --> 00:48:40.659
hunter-gatherers of Japan, where he documented quite a bit

944
00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:45.399
of female participation. In, um, in hunting, going after

945
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:48.350
a small game, and then in the years after

946
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.510
that, there were a lot uh more reports of

947
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.350
women's hunting that that came up, and perhaps the

948
00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:58.580
most famous one comes from the Ogta. Of the

949
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.739
Philippines where um the women hunt probably just as

950
00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:03.179
much as the men do, and they use bows

951
00:49:03.179 --> 00:49:05.850
and arrows, which is something you don't see, uh,

952
00:49:05.939 --> 00:49:08.620
I mean, maybe anywhere else. Um, AND so that

953
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.659
was a, that's a really fascinating study, and there's

954
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:13.699
there's been some other examples as well. Um, BUT

955
00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:17.050
I think that's a really important example of um

956
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.020
flexibility in the human sexual division of labor, that

957
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.419
even though it exists, there is this flexibility and

958
00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:26.629
um it's not just only men doing the hunting,

959
00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:30.050
women sometimes do it. Um, AS well, so it's

960
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.959
been a really interesting change in sort of how

961
00:49:31.959 --> 00:49:35.340
we view subsistence and the contribution by the sexes.

962
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:40.379
OK, but what were the main claims coming from

963
00:49:40.379 --> 00:49:44.510
the man the hunter idea? I mean, what did

964
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.550
people say back then?

965
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.909
Well, um, it depends exactly what kind of, uh,

966
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.159
what meaning of Man the Hunter we're talking about

967
00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:56.959
here, right? The, the, the conference man the Hunter

968
00:49:56.959 --> 00:49:58.919
that happened in '66 and then led to that

969
00:49:58.919 --> 00:50:04.110
book in, in '68 was interesting because the title

970
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.629
itself belies the contents of, of the book. Um,

971
00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:12.080
THE, the hunting hypothesis, the kind of classical idea

972
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.320
of man the hunter, there was one chapter in

973
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.760
that book by um Uh, Washburn, uh, Sherwood Washburn,

974
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:23.300
he was very prominent, uh, proponent of this, um,

975
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.949
but it was basically this idea that that male

976
00:50:26.949 --> 00:50:30.030
provisioning was, was super critical, like, you know, mostly

977
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.550
revolving around, um, hunting, and that idea kind of

978
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:37.669
carried with it a few auxiliary claims about women

979
00:50:37.669 --> 00:50:39.629
that that were kind of put out there, but

980
00:50:39.629 --> 00:50:43.310
they weren't really um challenged at the time. And

981
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.590
so one of them was that Well, because women

982
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:50.270
are, and they'll use phrases like burdened by childcare,

983
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:53.979
um, by offspring, that they're not able to leave

984
00:50:53.979 --> 00:50:55.820
a central place. So they have to stay home

985
00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:01.649
all day, essentially, right? Um, SO, OK, well, fair

986
00:51:01.649 --> 00:51:04.830
enough from one perspective, right? Childbearing is, uh, difficult,

987
00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:08.409
it's energetically costly, it's hard to hunt when, when

988
00:51:08.409 --> 00:51:10.820
you have kids, um, but people at the time,

989
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.449
it was kind of a missed opportunity because there

990
00:51:13.449 --> 00:51:16.729
was that focus on On the evolution of male

991
00:51:16.729 --> 00:51:19.169
cooperation, but they weren't looking at the ways that

992
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:23.739
that females were cooperating themselves, that were participating in

993
00:51:23.739 --> 00:51:26.379
subsistence, right? This is what Richard Lee showed, lots

994
00:51:26.379 --> 00:51:29.780
of vegetables coming into camp. And so, if hunting

995
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.739
is the kind of thing that you need long

996
00:51:31.739 --> 00:51:35.540
hours to go out to do, um, where you

997
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.179
can't be disturbed with children, then according to that

998
00:51:38.179 --> 00:51:40.649
idea, women would like never go hunting at all.

999
00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:43.090
It would just be impossible. Um, BUT I think

1000
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.330
what the later work showed is that there are

1001
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:50.050
ways in which you can overcome the constraints of

1002
00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:55.639
having a very expensive and, um, you know, loud,

1003
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.649
uh, child. I, I have kids now and I,

1004
00:51:57.689 --> 00:51:59.320
I couldn't, you know, it's, it's hard to do

1005
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.250
anything with them, um, much less go and like

1006
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.090
do ambush hunting. So, so I think there is

1007
00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.340
definitely some Some truth to that, but we do

1008
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.739
see that women hunt, and so it raises the,

1009
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.389
the kind of more interesting question is like, well,

1010
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.899
how do they do it? What are the ways

1011
00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:16.020
in which um that they do it, that that

1012
00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.500
can overcome these constraints and allow them to kind

1013
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.530
of pursue, to pursue their, their interests and goals,

1014
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.020
and that's what we've, you know, partially been studying.

1015
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.429
So, uh, but, but nowadays, I mean, almost uh

1016
00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:34.250
almost 6 decades after the man the Hunter conference.

1017
00:52:34.669 --> 00:52:39.219
What are people debating nowadays when it comes to

1018
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:43.629
gender differences in hunting and the sexual division of

1019
00:52:43.629 --> 00:52:44.100
labor?

1020
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.729
Uh, YEAH, interesting question. Well, I think, I think

1021
00:52:48.729 --> 00:52:52.010
these days, uh, people have been pointing again to

1022
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.449
instances of women's hunting, um, which I think is

1023
00:52:55.449 --> 00:52:57.989
great. I think it's, it's, it's excellent that people

1024
00:52:57.989 --> 00:53:00.010
are being exposed to this kind of diversity in

1025
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.530
human behavior. I think where a mistake gets made

1026
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.370
though is that this is being equated with the

1027
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.810
lack of an existence of a sexual division of

1028
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:14.679
labor. Um. Now, before talking about this, I think

1029
00:53:14.679 --> 00:53:17.669
it's important to note that um that women's contributions

1030
00:53:17.669 --> 00:53:22.989
have definitely been overlooked or or downplayed um through

1031
00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:24.469
time, and part of the reason for that is

1032
00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:27.949
that many early ethnographers um were male, and so

1033
00:53:27.949 --> 00:53:32.830
they were, you know, observing um male activity more,

1034
00:53:32.949 --> 00:53:35.350
right? They were just sort of seeing their corner

1035
00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:39.389
of, of, of the world, um, and so women's

1036
00:53:39.389 --> 00:53:42.000
contributions kind of writ large, I think we're not.

1037
00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:45.110
Uh, AS paid attention to as they as they

1038
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.149
definitely should have been. Again, Richard Lee is the

1039
00:53:47.149 --> 00:53:49.620
one that kind of, that kind of changed that.

1040
00:53:49.979 --> 00:53:53.550
Um, BUT that being said, uh, if we look

1041
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.669
at the, at the hard data of what people

1042
00:53:55.669 --> 00:53:58.830
do in these societies, what, what you men and

1043
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.830
women do, and I think that there is really

1044
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.629
robust evidence, um, even taking, taking into account some

1045
00:54:05.629 --> 00:54:08.060
of these of these biases we have to acknowledge,

1046
00:54:08.389 --> 00:54:10.459
um, that there that there is still a pretty

1047
00:54:10.459 --> 00:54:14.399
dichotomous pattern. Um, MEANING that men tend to do

1048
00:54:14.399 --> 00:54:17.479
one, certain kinds of activities, and women tend to

1049
00:54:17.479 --> 00:54:20.439
do other kinds of activities. And one of those

1050
00:54:20.439 --> 00:54:22.919
is that men tend to do more hunting, and

1051
00:54:22.919 --> 00:54:25.320
the way that they hunt is different, and women

1052
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.199
tend to do less, while on the other hand,

1053
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.760
they do more gathering. And there's other differences too

1054
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.679
in terms of like, um, the amount of time

1055
00:54:32.679 --> 00:54:36.790
you spend toward like constructing things like building tools

1056
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.129
versus um dealing with children and things like that.

1057
00:54:40.439 --> 00:54:43.510
Um. So it is still possible to talk about

1058
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.699
there being differences while still acknowledging that the border

1059
00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:50.320
is porous, and that given how flexible humans are

1060
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.929
culturally and biologically, we should expect these uh patterns

1061
00:54:54.929 --> 00:54:57.330
to vary around the globe, and that is what

1062
00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:01.580
we see, right? So, um, There's actually a latitudinal

1063
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.459
trend with the sectional division of labor, where it

1064
00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:05.739
tends to be a little bit more similar near

1065
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:09.989
the tropics versus at higher um latitudes. And I

1066
00:55:09.989 --> 00:55:12.820
think this is probably something that's characterized human and

1067
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.810
pre-human existence um potentially going uh pretty far back.

1068
00:55:18.959 --> 00:55:22.060
Um, SO that's kind of what's being debated these

1069
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.520
days, whether that even exists, um, and, uh, women's

1070
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.760
hunting has kind of come to, uh, the center

1071
00:55:29.939 --> 00:55:32.120
of, of that, but, you know, it's, I think

1072
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.179
it's shed an important, uh, you know, spotlight on

1073
00:55:36.489 --> 00:55:39.719
Uh, previous biases that that have existed, but then

1074
00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:44.050
also the ways that scholars um have and also

1075
00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.370
have not been biased in particular ways. Like, we

1076
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.050
have to ask ourselves, when we look at the

1077
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.449
ethnographic record now, um, how biased is it in

1078
00:55:51.449 --> 00:55:53.330
these ways? And I think we actually have ways,

1079
00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:58.169
statistically, methodologically now of actually dealing with uh these

1080
00:55:58.169 --> 00:56:00.169
kinds of issues so that it becomes an empirical

1081
00:56:00.169 --> 00:56:03.929
question, um, to, to actually examine, yeah.

1082
00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:08.040
Right. But do we know or do we have

1083
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.679
a good idea of what are the factors that

1084
00:56:10.679 --> 00:56:14.100
play a role in women's hunting and, I mean,

1085
00:56:14.199 --> 00:56:16.800
the rates they do it, the kinds of hunting

1086
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.459
they participate in, like, for example, large game versus

1087
00:56:20.459 --> 00:56:23.000
small game, what factors play a role there?

1088
00:56:24.649 --> 00:56:27.070
Yeah, so me and um one of my students,

1089
00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:31.889
uh, Jordi Hoffman, uh, recently conducted a study on

1090
00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:34.600
this because I had seen scattered reports of, of

1091
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.919
women's hunting, um, but, um, I really wanted to

1092
00:56:37.919 --> 00:56:40.679
know, OK, if we look cross culturally, what are

1093
00:56:40.679 --> 00:56:43.040
these really big factors. And I think, I think

1094
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.360
to look at this is helpful to go to

1095
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.080
a specific example, um, so I'll go back to

1096
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.879
the Agda, that group I mentioned earlier, where the

1097
00:56:49.879 --> 00:56:52.669
women hunt quite a bit. And when we see

1098
00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.520
them hunting a lot, we can ask, OK, well,

1099
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.290
what is it about the society that uh that

1100
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:59.520
allows them to engage in in so much hunting.

1101
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:04.530
Um, ONE is that they use dogs. OK, OK,

1102
00:57:04.649 --> 00:57:07.889
so there's like this technological element here. Um, DOGS

1103
00:57:07.889 --> 00:57:12.350
can be really helpful in, um, finding game, uh,

1104
00:57:12.449 --> 00:57:15.300
in tracking it down, and then in killing it.

1105
00:57:15.739 --> 00:57:17.729
Uh, SO you have this kind of extra hand,

1106
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.810
this extra aid. Um, NOW, men will use dogs

1107
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:23.620
as well, but you, you sort of see it

1108
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.719
in, in, in nearly all these instances of women's

1109
00:57:25.719 --> 00:57:29.139
hunting, um, uh, using, using dogs. I'd have to

1110
00:57:29.139 --> 00:57:30.280
go back to the paper to look at the

1111
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:34.169
the exact data, but Um, yeah, dogs, um, whether

1112
00:57:34.169 --> 00:57:37.889
it's, uh, the hunting occurs close to camp, OK?

1113
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.239
So this again gets at the, the idea of,

1114
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.649
well, OK, if you, if you have some kids

1115
00:57:43.649 --> 00:57:46.449
that you're taking care of, um, it, it'll be

1116
00:57:46.449 --> 00:57:47.889
much easier to go hunting if you don't have

1117
00:57:47.889 --> 00:57:49.610
to go very far. You can either bring them

1118
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.129
with you, um, or maybe you could leave them

1119
00:57:52.129 --> 00:57:55.159
back at home. And that relates to probably the

1120
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.570
the biggest one, which is Allocare, right? Um, YOU

1121
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.169
know, based on the work of Sarah Hrdy and

1122
00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:03.770
others, we've, we've known now for, for a little

1123
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.229
while that, you know, potentially what what really makes

1124
00:58:06.229 --> 00:58:09.209
us human is our ability to ability to uh

1125
00:58:09.209 --> 00:58:12.419
cooperate and to share the burden of childcare, right?

1126
00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:16.209
uh BETWEEN both men and women. And uh this

1127
00:58:16.209 --> 00:58:20.250
is something that also facilitates women's hunting. So, uh,

1128
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.649
you can leave a kid back uh at the,

1129
00:58:23.659 --> 00:58:25.810
at the home base while you go out hunting,

1130
00:58:26.179 --> 00:58:28.699
that's fine. But we also see cases where groups

1131
00:58:28.699 --> 00:58:34.080
of women go out. Um, TOGETHER in mixed age

1132
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.199
groups, so that you'll have, you know, like a

1133
00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:38.949
14 or 15 year old girl who isn't hunting,

1134
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:41.479
but she actually watches all the kids. So it's

1135
00:58:41.479 --> 00:58:44.959
kind of like having like a daycare, but out

1136
00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:47.679
in the, but out in the jungle, right? And

1137
00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:48.800
and this is what I mean when we talk

1138
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.040
about the early talk about man the hunter, where

1139
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.120
like, washroom is so focused on, well, hunting promotes

1140
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.330
cooperation in men, but It wouldn't, they wouldn't have

1141
00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.139
had to look very far to see this behavior

1142
00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:01.340
already occurring among hunter gatherer societies, and it's a

1143
00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.909
critical behavior that that women are doing, um. So,

1144
00:59:05.919 --> 00:59:09.520
yeah, uh, alo care and then hunting in groups,

1145
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.199
so you don't typically see women out hunting alone

1146
00:59:13.199 --> 00:59:15.870
for, for I think a variety of reasons. Um,

1147
00:59:16.479 --> 00:59:19.560
WOMEN'S hunting, you know, related with the, the other

1148
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.360
points I made about distance, uh, it tends to

1149
00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.840
be like a shorter duration. Um, IT tends to

1150
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.239
occur with husbands a lot, so oftentimes men and

1151
00:59:27.239 --> 00:59:30.399
women. Uh, SORRY, husbands and wives will team up,

1152
00:59:30.719 --> 00:59:34.010
uh, to go hunting, and in most cases it's,

1153
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.179
it's the man who ends up like actually killing

1154
00:59:37.179 --> 00:59:39.219
the animal. So in a sense, he kind of

1155
00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:42.260
gets the glory, but there's so many reports out

1156
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.899
there of of women who are really good at

1157
00:59:44.899 --> 00:59:48.820
tracking themselves. So there's reports of like, uh, you

1158
00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.620
know, men are going out and women are coming

1159
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.889
back from gathering, and they'll say, hey, we saw

1160
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.899
signs of an antelope over there, you want to

1161
00:59:54.899 --> 00:59:57.239
go here and go this way. Right, so they're

1162
00:59:57.239 --> 01:00:00.199
like participating in hunting in a really critical kind

1163
01:00:00.199 --> 01:00:04.250
of informational capacity, um. And that's the kind of

1164
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:05.810
thing that may have been missed in kind of

1165
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.649
earlier, uh, earlier ethnographic studies. Um, SO there's that,

1166
01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:13.129
um, and then they tend to use different kinds

1167
01:00:13.129 --> 01:00:16.530
of, of tools, and they go after, uh, smaller

1168
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.600
game. So they'll go after a game that is

1169
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.010
kind of, you know, less than 15 kg or

1170
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:26.129
so, um, a game that you don't need to

1171
01:00:26.129 --> 01:00:28.449
maybe hunt for 2 or 3 days straight, like

1172
01:00:28.449 --> 01:00:31.479
endurance hunting. Um, ALTHOUGH there are examples of that,

1173
01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:34.610
uh, for, for women, um, but, you know, game

1174
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.169
that might, uh, go and like hide in a

1175
01:00:37.169 --> 01:00:38.889
tree and then you can like burn it out

1176
01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:41.800
or stab it or something like that. Um, YOU

1177
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.600
see, you see a lot of examples of that,

1178
01:00:43.969 --> 01:00:48.439
um. And yeah, they tend to be uh using

1179
01:00:48.439 --> 01:00:51.879
different tool kits and men, so um they'll often

1180
01:00:51.879 --> 01:00:54.719
use their digging sticks to kill animals, right? So

1181
01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:57.639
it kind of, it's a potent weapon that that

1182
01:00:57.639 --> 01:01:00.840
doubles as a hunting and gathering implement. So there's

1183
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.689
all these ways, right, in which it's, it's um.

1184
01:01:04.879 --> 01:01:07.179
Uh, YOU know, these are the ways that that

1185
01:01:07.179 --> 01:01:08.659
women hunt, and it's, it's a, it's a little

1186
01:01:08.659 --> 01:01:10.889
bit different than the way that that men hunt,

1187
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.139
but it's kind of consistent with the constraints of

1188
01:01:13.139 --> 01:01:17.129
their lives that they're, uh, that they're facing, and,

1189
01:01:17.179 --> 01:01:18.899
and, and that's how they do it, yeah.

1190
01:01:20.389 --> 01:01:24.580
Does, does the fact that women get pregnant influence

1191
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.550
rates of hunting in any way?

1192
01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.600
Um, YEAH, well, that's an interesting question. So one

1193
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.159
of the predictions of our study was that we

1194
01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:40.270
would see hunting more often. In the pre-childbearing years

1195
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.949
as well as in the post-childbearing years. Um, I

1196
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.270
think it's a sensible prediction, but we actually didn't

1197
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.229
find a whole lot of evidence for it ethnographically,

1198
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.189
and I should say this is by doing um

1199
01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:52.550
a large scale ethnographic survey using the human relations

1200
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:55.750
area files, which kind of um collects together a

1201
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.429
bunch of ethnographic reports that you can search, right?

1202
01:01:58.469 --> 01:02:00.179
So this is like a, a broad cultural study.

1203
01:02:00.229 --> 01:02:02.870
It's not just one place. So we didn't find

1204
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:06.409
um Much evidence for that exactly. And I think

1205
01:02:06.409 --> 01:02:07.969
it's because it's going back to what I talked

1206
01:02:07.969 --> 01:02:10.489
about a moment ago, which is about alloca is

1207
01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:15.820
that women exist within these cooperative networks, um, in

1208
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.530
which they're they're still able to sometimes Go hunting

1209
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.719
and and do these kinds of things, even when

1210
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:25.020
they have, uh, even when they have kids. I

1211
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.969
mean, there's no doubt that having kids is gonna

1212
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.020
um reduce your foraging effort to some extent, that's

1213
01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.070
actually been widely documented in in forgers, but it's

1214
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:37.340
not impossible, right? And that's an important, uh, that's

1215
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.330
an important distinction.

1216
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.629
Right. And do we know if cultural restrictions, for

1217
01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:49.429
example, social norms against women hunting play any role

1218
01:02:49.429 --> 01:02:54.149
at all in limiting women's participation in hunting across

1219
01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:55.229
human societies?

1220
01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:57.959
Yeah, they do and they don't, and it depends

1221
01:02:57.959 --> 01:03:00.280
where you look. I think in, in kind of

1222
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.129
uh debates these days, there's there's a bit of

1223
01:03:02.129 --> 01:03:05.080
an assumption that, um, women would be doing hunting

1224
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.719
everywhere if only they would be allowed by men

1225
01:03:07.719 --> 01:03:08.959
to do it. And I think that that's kind

1226
01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:11.520
of a dangerous perspective to have. We actually need

1227
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.110
to look at the ethnographic record and see what

1228
01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.120
people are are doing. And so there are some

1229
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.639
cases where there are taboos or rules against women's

1230
01:03:20.639 --> 01:03:25.139
hunting. Um, SO, for example, they might be not

1231
01:03:25.139 --> 01:03:28.110
allowed to touch a spear or touch a bow

1232
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.469
and arrow, right? Um, OR something bad might happen

1233
01:03:31.469 --> 01:03:33.149
or that's the way I think about it. And

1234
01:03:33.149 --> 01:03:37.389
so in those cases, um, you wouldn't have direct

1235
01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:41.199
participation in hunting at least using those implements. Um,

1236
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.689
THERE'S also, well, I, I should note one way

1237
01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:45.889
that that that that they get around that is

1238
01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.469
by simply using different kinds of tools, right? So

1239
01:03:48.469 --> 01:03:52.520
we documented societies where they're, uh, there's taboos against

1240
01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.810
using some kind of implements, but none against using

1241
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:58.409
others, and so they end up hunting, but just

1242
01:03:58.409 --> 01:04:00.449
not with like, for example, a bow and arrow.

1243
01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:05.290
OK. Um, NOW there's also other, um, kind of

1244
01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:09.770
cultural restrictions around menstruation. Uh, THERE'S a, a wide

1245
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.939
variety of, of, of taboos in, in, in small

1246
01:04:12.939 --> 01:04:15.729
scale societies about this, uh, that it might scare

1247
01:04:15.729 --> 01:04:18.169
off animals or something like that. We found that

1248
01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:19.969
in, in some of the study, in in some

1249
01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:22.649
of the populations we looked at, um, but not

1250
01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:25.010
in others. And again, you see the same thing

1251
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:28.649
where there might be some kind of um A

1252
01:04:28.649 --> 01:04:30.649
norm or or taboo around this, but then you

1253
01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:32.929
find that the women are actually like helping their

1254
01:04:32.929 --> 01:04:35.919
husbands get seals or something like that. Right, um,

1255
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.189
so it doesn't completely negate or or dictate, um,

1256
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.169
the, the behavior, um, and I think that's, that's

1257
01:04:45.169 --> 01:04:48.639
kind of the big finding from from our study,

1258
01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:52.199
which is that uh there are some cultural restrictions,

1259
01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:55.000
but it doesn't completely mean that women aren't going

1260
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.100
to be hunting. And what I've pointed to in

1261
01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.179
my work is specifically the case of of very

1262
01:05:01.179 --> 01:05:05.860
gender egalitarian societies where you have um very few

1263
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.459
restriction uh restrictions on what women are allowed to

1264
01:05:10.459 --> 01:05:13.659
do. And yet in these societies, you still see

1265
01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:17.219
very classic divisions of labor, right? Again, it's, it

1266
01:05:17.219 --> 01:05:19.409
works against this point that women would be doing

1267
01:05:19.409 --> 01:05:22.020
exactly what men do, um, if they were allowed

1268
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.840
to, um, and I think it's useful to have

1269
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.000
this perspective of of like in these societies, women

1270
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.159
are are given the freedom to what to do

1271
01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:34.000
what they wanna do, but they don't want to

1272
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.110
be hunting in a lot of cases. In fact,

1273
01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:38.439
they want the men to do the hunting. There's

1274
01:05:38.439 --> 01:05:41.479
a famous uh story from the Kung where uh

1275
01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:45.659
Richard Lee talks about how, uh, You know, women

1276
01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:48.969
are constantly berating the men for not hunting enough.

1277
01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.179
Um, THEY want them to hunt more so they

1278
01:05:51.179 --> 01:05:53.949
can bring more meat back, and the women actually

1279
01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.939
refer to hunting as being boring cause you're out

1280
01:05:55.939 --> 01:05:59.820
all day, it's usually unsuccessful, right? Um, AND that's

1281
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.080
like, that's like the big difference, um, in, in,

1282
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.270
in the sex roles and hunting is that, uh,

1283
01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.790
That that the men in a sense can afford

1284
01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:10.189
the time to be away for hours at a

1285
01:06:10.189 --> 01:06:13.189
time to, to, to fail in hunting, which they

1286
01:06:13.189 --> 01:06:15.750
do like 90% of the time, kind of on

1287
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:18.790
average, um, whereas women tend to go after the

1288
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.620
things that are that are more certain, like, um,

1289
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.620
like gathering or or the smaller prey that we

1290
01:06:24.949 --> 01:06:28.669
that we talked about. Um, SO in these egalitarian

1291
01:06:28.669 --> 01:06:31.189
societies, it shows that, um, women are kind of

1292
01:06:31.189 --> 01:06:33.580
pursuing their own goals and as part of that,

1293
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.790
they're actually not including hunting in their, in their

1294
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.189
behavioral profiles all that much, but it's important to

1295
01:06:39.189 --> 01:06:41.709
note that that is in a big sense, it's

1296
01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:44.899
their decision, right? It's not being foisted upon them.

1297
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:48.709
There's a great anecdote um from the 1970s in

1298
01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:50.959
Kirk Endicott's book, The Head Man Was a Woman

1299
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:54.780
of the Bok, where um There was a 14

1300
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.739
year old girl who got really into blowpipe hunting,

1301
01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.699
and this is something that that women never do

1302
01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:02.409
in the bate, got really into blowpipe hunting, and

1303
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:04.610
no one cared. They thought it was great. Um,

1304
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.979
SHE even caught some things, but as time went

1305
01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:10.129
on, and she got to, you know, be 1920,

1306
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.020
and so on, um, she kind of just gave

1307
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.810
it up. I guess she lost interest in it,

1308
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.830
or, you know, she went into the more sort

1309
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:20.179
of traditional role in botech society had kids and

1310
01:07:20.179 --> 01:07:22.780
so on. Um, BUT, but again, it's not like

1311
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.709
people were telling her, no, you, you can't hunt

1312
01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.350
because you're a woman. Uh, SO I, I thought

1313
01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:30.719
that's a very telling, um, a very telling anecdote.

1314
01:07:31.669 --> 01:07:34.709
Mhm. So let me ask you about a recent

1315
01:07:34.709 --> 01:07:39.229
paper of yours titled Woman the Hunter, Female Foragers

1316
01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:42.229
sometimes Hunt, Yet Gender divisions of Labor are Real

1317
01:07:42.229 --> 01:07:46.110
where you criticize a paper by Abigail Anderson at

1318
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:49.909
all titled The Myth of Men the Hunter, Women's

1319
01:07:49.909 --> 01:07:54.489
Contribution to the Hunt Across Ethnographic Contexts. Uh, AND,

1320
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.530
uh, I mean, I, I'm asking you about this

1321
01:07:56.530 --> 01:08:00.610
mainly because I, I would imagine that the two

1322
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.290
main issues about, that you point out about their

1323
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:08.399
paper. Uh, ARE probably some of the issues we,

1324
01:08:08.439 --> 01:08:12.000
or you think we would see across some of

1325
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.830
these debates. You point to a biased sampling of

1326
01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.720
the ethnographic record and the second one is uh

1327
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.669
mis miscoding. So, could you explain those two issues?

1328
01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.899
Yeah, sure. Um, SO the, so the goal of

1329
01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.979
that paper, uh, was to determine a, a frequency

1330
01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:35.899
of hunting of women's hunting across, um, hunter gatherer

1331
01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:38.620
societies, right? Um, WHICH is an interesting question. I

1332
01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.649
think that's a, that's a cool thing to explore.

1333
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:45.299
Um, NOW, now to, to go about it, um,

1334
01:08:45.339 --> 01:08:48.470
I think that things got a little bit problematic

1335
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.939
because when they want to estimate the, the frequency,

1336
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.379
you have to have, you know, the number of

1337
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.410
societies in which women are hunting. Divided by the

1338
01:08:56.410 --> 01:09:00.490
number of total societies, right? And the point that

1339
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.140
we make in our paper is that is that

1340
01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.609
that's a very difficult calculation to make first of

1341
01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:07.169
all. Um, I think it's great someone is is

1342
01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:10.350
trying, but uh the problem was sort of that

1343
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:14.830
numerator and the denominator. So the denominator, like your

1344
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:18.279
total sample, let's say all hunter gatherer societies, um,

1345
01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:21.649
they use a database called called DPlace, which is

1346
01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:26.330
kind of a repository of Um, information about small

1347
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:31.620
scale societies, including hunter gatherers, and from that, They

1348
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:35.500
wanted to determine um uh the the societies in

1349
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.970
which they were like uh appropriate descriptions of hunting,

1350
01:09:39.129 --> 01:09:41.759
and then of those, which ones had women's hunting.

1351
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.339
So it's um it's a, that's a fine strategy

1352
01:09:44.339 --> 01:09:46.879
as far as it goes, but what we discovered

1353
01:09:46.879 --> 01:09:50.109
in our sort of nitty gritty investigation of that

1354
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.419
is that it ended up being a bias sample

1355
01:09:53.419 --> 01:09:56.299
in the sense that um they weren't including a

1356
01:09:56.299 --> 01:10:00.359
lot of societies in that. DENOMINATOR that probably should

1357
01:10:00.359 --> 01:10:04.830
have been uh included, right? And so that has

1358
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.680
the effect then when you, when you calculate it

1359
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.009
is if the if if the bottom number um

1360
01:10:11.009 --> 01:10:13.720
is kind of artificially reduced in some kind of

1361
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.680
way, it leads to a higher um it leads

1362
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.479
to a higher frequency. And so that's kind of

1363
01:10:19.479 --> 01:10:21.509
one of our main critiques is that you need

1364
01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:25.080
to have a really unbiased sampling strategy to arrive

1365
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.299
at At your frequency, um, value. And again, it's,

1366
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:32.180
it's a really hard thing to do, um, but,

1367
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.310
uh, there seemed to be a few ways in

1368
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:39.240
which the data were selectively chosen to inflate uh

1369
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.990
that value, and I'm and I wouldn't claim that

1370
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:45.470
they were um even doing this, uh, um, in

1371
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:49.970
some kind of unethical or a purposeful way, um,

1372
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.160
but just that this can sometimes happen. And we

1373
01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.600
have methods and sort of cross cultural studies that

1374
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.120
I think may have been useful there, uh, to

1375
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.330
avoid that kind of, of bias. And so they,

1376
01:11:00.399 --> 01:11:05.520
they arrived at the value of 80%, um, which

1377
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.589
is about um 5 to 8 times higher than

1378
01:11:09.589 --> 01:11:12.560
what you saw previous estimates of the societies in

1379
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.720
which women hunt. And this is when we really

1380
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.600
get into, you know, like the devil's the details

1381
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.919
kind of thing, because what does it mean to

1382
01:11:19.919 --> 01:11:22.839
code a society is one in which Women hunt,

1383
01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.680
and this gets into that second point you were

1384
01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.000
asking about of of miscoding. I think that I

1385
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.959
think the the biggest issue with that paper was

1386
01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:32.669
that a society in which there was a report

1387
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:36.390
of a rare instance of of women hunting, um,

1388
01:11:36.399 --> 01:11:38.720
was coded the very same as the Ogta in

1389
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.089
which women hunt. Regularly. So in other words, I

1390
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.669
think that for this to be meaningful, we really

1391
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:48.009
need to have a measure of the frequency at

1392
01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:51.410
which women are hunting for this to be um

1393
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:55.479
useful exercise. And so in our uh response paper,

1394
01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:57.890
that that's what we did is where we actually

1395
01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.569
went back to all the instances that were that

1396
01:12:00.569 --> 01:12:02.450
were coded, and we tried to get some kind

1397
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:08.669
of frequency estimate when when possible, um. And, uh,

1398
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.839
you know, our answer was was very different, which

1399
01:12:10.839 --> 01:12:12.439
was that it's more in line with what we've

1400
01:12:12.439 --> 01:12:16.069
thought previously in which women's hunting is is relatively

1401
01:12:16.439 --> 01:12:19.750
uh rare, but it still does happen, but it's

1402
01:12:19.959 --> 01:12:21.600
very much along the lines of what I was

1403
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.200
saying earlier of like the way in which women

1404
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.120
hunt, whereas this new paper was claiming that big

1405
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.279
game hunting occurred pretty regularly and um I don't

1406
01:12:32.279 --> 01:12:34.200
think the data bear that out. And so when

1407
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.120
we talk about the coding errors, that's kind of

1408
01:12:36.479 --> 01:12:38.600
An example of them of, of, you know, not

1409
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.560
putting frequency in and of miscoding large and small

1410
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.750
game of um double coding societies like the the

1411
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.580
Kun and the Jinwani where they're the same society,

1412
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.120
but they were coded separately with different frequencies of

1413
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.890
hunting. Um, SO, so cases like that I think

1414
01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:57.319
need to really be scrutinized carefully and all of

1415
01:12:57.319 --> 01:13:00.080
this had the effect of making it look like

1416
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.950
women's hunting is really, really common. Um, LEADING to

1417
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.160
newspaper articles that said women in the past have

1418
01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.759
always hunted as much as men. Now, as I've

1419
01:13:09.759 --> 01:13:13.180
said earlier, I would freely grant the proposition that

1420
01:13:13.439 --> 01:13:17.640
um women's subsistence has been undervalued, that women's hunting

1421
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.000
has been undervalued, but at the same time, I

1422
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.439
think we're going uh way too far the other

1423
01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:26.029
way to say that these things have been, um,

1424
01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.879
occurring at equal frequency in these hunter gatherer societies

1425
01:13:28.879 --> 01:13:31.720
or throughout um human evolution, and I think we

1426
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.410
need to Uh, kind of look at the data

1427
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.169
as they are rather than as we, as we

1428
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.770
want them to be.

1429
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:39.709
And by the way, another point that you make

1430
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:42.910
in your response paper is that you say that

1431
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:46.109
focusing too much on hunting diminishes the value of

1432
01:13:46.109 --> 01:13:50.089
other contributions that more commonly come from women. Could

1433
01:13:50.089 --> 01:13:50.950
you explain that?

1434
01:13:51.939 --> 01:13:53.290
Yeah, well, it gets back to this point of

1435
01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:54.810
we need to look at what people are actually

1436
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.529
doing and kind of what they value. Um, MEN

1437
01:13:57.529 --> 01:14:01.279
and women do both very important things in their,

1438
01:14:01.569 --> 01:14:04.240
in their societies, and they're valued to to varying

1439
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.330
degrees depending where you look. Um, WOMEN gather most

1440
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:11.919
of the food, um, in hunter gatherer societies. Uh,

1441
01:14:12.009 --> 01:14:13.930
IN some cases this can be like the main

1442
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:17.745
carbohydrates. Great base. Um, IT'S often what leads to

1443
01:14:18.044 --> 01:14:21.734
hunter-gatherer camps, moving locations, right? Um, TO have a,

1444
01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:24.964
a good base of carbohydrates. Um, SO that's absolutely

1445
01:14:24.964 --> 01:14:28.834
critical to their, to their survival. Um, CHILDCARE is

1446
01:14:28.834 --> 01:14:31.484
absolutely critical, and they do quite a bit more

1447
01:14:31.484 --> 01:14:35.044
of this than, than, uh, than men do. Um.

1448
01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.330
We, we shouldn't downplay that. I think it's, it's

1449
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:41.240
super important in its own right. Um, WOMEN also

1450
01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.930
play important roles as leaders, um, as, as kind

1451
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:48.649
of political influencers, as, uh, gossipers. I mean, in

1452
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:51.439
any kind of way when it comes to Um,

1453
01:14:51.689 --> 01:14:54.490
being in a society, they're just as important as

1454
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.799
men, but in kind of different ways. So, um,

1455
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.330
you know, men and women are equally valuable in

1456
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.450
these societies, um, but let's look at what they're

1457
01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:07.450
actually doing and how they view their contributions rather

1458
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.660
than kind of imposing something, something onto those.

1459
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:14.410
And what do you think are perhaps the merits

1460
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:19.120
of this paper by Abigail Anderson and others, uh,

1461
01:15:19.129 --> 01:15:23.089
and possibly of other papers similar to it. I

1462
01:15:23.089 --> 01:15:25.680
mean, what are the merits and what is positive

1463
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.240
about them?

1464
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.049
Well, I think what's great is that it's leading

1465
01:15:29.049 --> 01:15:31.160
to these conversations, right? It's leading to this conversation,

1466
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.459
it's leading to other, you know, great podcasts that

1467
01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:36.870
have been done with, um, um, with, with folks

1468
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:40.000
who are writing, uh, you know, these articles, um,

1469
01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:42.330
and we should always be kind of questioning received

1470
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.290
wisdom, right? We, we should always be, be questioning

1471
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:48.850
what we thought before, examining our assumptions, um, thinking

1472
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:51.740
about how biases might be leading us toward Um,

1473
01:15:51.779 --> 01:15:55.140
the wrong, the wrong path. And so I think

1474
01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.620
in that sense, it's great to be having the

1475
01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.779
conversation. And as I noted, um, I think it's

1476
01:15:59.779 --> 01:16:02.419
cool that someone had the idea to get a

1477
01:16:02.419 --> 01:16:05.890
robust cross cultural estimate of how much women, um,

1478
01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:08.660
hunt. I think that that it was a harder

1479
01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.779
question than the authors kind of realized at the

1480
01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:13.029
time. Um, IT doesn't mean that it's not worth

1481
01:16:13.029 --> 01:16:15.560
asking or asking again in the future. In, in

1482
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.520
our kind of rebuttal to the paper, uh, we

1483
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.319
kind of essentially threw our hands up and said,

1484
01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:23.870
I mean, until we do a more authoritative study,

1485
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.990
we're not gonna have a good answer on what

1486
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.240
that frequency, um, is. And, and that's OK. We

1487
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.839
just have to, to recognize that that's, um, that

1488
01:16:31.919 --> 01:16:36.089
that's what it is, but, um, Um, yeah.

1489
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.680
Uh, AND just another point that you make there

1490
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.680
at a certain point, you say, we caution against

1491
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.520
ethnographic revisionism that projects westernized conceptions of labor and

1492
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.620
its value on to foraging societies. Uh, WHAT do

1493
01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:53.439
you mean by that?

1494
01:16:54.419 --> 01:16:56.290
Yeah, well, I think the, the headline that this

1495
01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.490
paper got in the newspaper El Pais, uh, kind

1496
01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:02.410
of, um, demonstrates this, where, you know, men and

1497
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:04.720
women have always hunted equally in the past, where

1498
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:08.640
we're taking these modern notions of equity, which come

1499
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.250
from a good place, which come from, um, I

1500
01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:16.279
think, reasonable motivations to correct historical injustices. And they're

1501
01:17:16.279 --> 01:17:20.000
kind of um importing them onto other societies. And

1502
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.740
as anthropologists, me and my colleagues are a little

1503
01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:26.799
bit uh concerned about that because these societies, they

1504
01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:29.240
don't, they don't uh necessarily not, they're not paying

1505
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.799
attention to the kind of things that we're talking

1506
01:17:30.799 --> 01:17:34.319
about. Um, THEY have different norms, they have different

1507
01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:38.040
values, uh, than we do. Um, THEY have different

1508
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.240
views on what men and women should be doing

1509
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.080
or or the way that they're valuable, kind of

1510
01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.680
like I talked about earlier, like some women. Don't

1511
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.439
even want to hunt, um, uh, right? So I

1512
01:17:49.439 --> 01:17:52.189
think we're at a little bit of danger here,

1513
01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:57.339
um, of transferring our beliefs and norms onto these

1514
01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.120
other societies that aren't really having a voice in

1515
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:08.450
this conversation, um, currently, um. I think that Um,

1516
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.089
when we think about prehistory, it certainly becomes complicated

1517
01:18:12.089 --> 01:18:15.259
because we don't want to think about hunter gatherers

1518
01:18:15.259 --> 01:18:19.620
today as being living fossils, right? Um, WHAT they

1519
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.700
do now is what they're doing in response to

1520
01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:26.259
their ecological, uh, systems, in response to their environments,

1521
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.779
and it's very possible, very likely, in fact, in

1522
01:18:29.779 --> 01:18:32.899
some ways that the world is very different, um.

1523
01:18:34.049 --> 01:18:36.549
You know, deeper in, in the past. And so

1524
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.799
there's a big debate now like of, you know,

1525
01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.529
how far back in time does the sexual division

1526
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.479
of, of labor go? And I think it's a

1527
01:18:45.479 --> 01:18:47.479
really interesting question. I would probably fall more on

1528
01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:50.350
the side of, um, that we probably do see

1529
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:54.520
these divisions going farther back um in time. But

1530
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.810
I think what I would question is the inherent

1531
01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.279
um assumption kind of in the conversation that that's

1532
01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:05.100
happening. Um, THAT that is necessarily a, a bad

1533
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.979
thing. It can sometimes be a bad thing, because

1534
01:19:07.979 --> 01:19:11.580
whenever you have differences in behavior, different profiles of

1535
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.259
behavior, this can potentially lead to inequalities, and it

1536
01:19:14.259 --> 01:19:17.100
definitely does, but it doesn't necessarily always have to,

1537
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:20.899
nor is it necessarily um bad from like an

1538
01:19:20.899 --> 01:19:23.259
a priori perspective. And so I think we need

1539
01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:26.520
to kind of broaden our notion about. The way

1540
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.240
that we view male and female contributions and the

1541
01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.669
value judgments that we're putting on them and realize

1542
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:34.959
that, you know, especially as anthropologists that we have

1543
01:19:34.959 --> 01:19:38.930
a duty, uh, to not be projecting our own

1544
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:41.160
views onto these other societies and to let them

1545
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.439
speak for themselves, to let the patterns, um, speak

1546
01:19:44.439 --> 01:19:46.560
for themselves, and it's only through that kind of

1547
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.799
strategy that we will really understand um human diversity

1548
01:19:50.799 --> 01:19:52.479
in all its forms and, and give us the

1549
01:19:52.479 --> 01:19:53.750
ability to appreciate them.

1550
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:58.720
Mhm. And archaeologically, do we have good enough data

1551
01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.890
to make claims about rates of hunting for men

1552
01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:06.529
and women in ancient prehistoric societies?

1553
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.879
Yeah, well, that's a great question. Um, Reconstructing anything

1554
01:20:11.879 --> 01:20:13.919
about behavior in the past can be, can be

1555
01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:16.049
really challenging. You know, one thing that we don't

1556
01:20:16.049 --> 01:20:19.520
want to do is to um assume that only

1557
01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.120
men were doing it, and maybe that's one of

1558
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.399
the really good things to come out of this

1559
01:20:23.399 --> 01:20:25.479
kind of current debate is that that we want

1560
01:20:25.479 --> 01:20:28.390
to get away from these like really strict dichotomies.

1561
01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.080
But at the same time, um, I think that

1562
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.319
we can look at modern hunter gatherers and look

1563
01:20:33.319 --> 01:20:38.609
at the The constraints they face, and the solutions

1564
01:20:38.609 --> 01:20:41.330
that they come up with to solve their constraints

1565
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:43.250
as a way of understanding how humans would have

1566
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:47.200
behaved in the past, right? Um, SO men would

1567
01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.750
have been probably show offs in the past, and

1568
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.919
women would, um, have, have, have dealt with, you

1569
01:20:53.919 --> 01:20:58.279
know, uh, pregnancy and, um, young children in the

1570
01:20:58.279 --> 01:21:02.120
past. Um, THESE, these were constraints that operated then

1571
01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.299
as they do today, and therefore I think that

1572
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.680
you likely would have seen the same divergence in

1573
01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.890
the sex roles. Um, IN the past, not that

1574
01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:14.209
it would be like identical, but it should be

1575
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:17.620
variable, the same way that it's variable among, among

1576
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.089
modern societies today. It's really hard to get a

1577
01:21:20.089 --> 01:21:23.870
value on like, exactly how much. People were hunting

1578
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.660
or gather, um, you know, hunting and gathering, um,

1579
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:28.870
but, uh, you know, this is the role of,

1580
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:32.430
you know, ethnography and, and, and reconstruction, but there

1581
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:37.700
is also fossil evidence. There's archaeological um evidence and

1582
01:21:38.459 --> 01:21:41.140
There was a paper that came out recently, um

1583
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:44.979
by um uh Kara Okebo, Sarah Lacy, uh a

1584
01:21:44.979 --> 01:21:48.180
very thought provoking paper, basically arguing that there's no

1585
01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.299
evidence that there were sexual divisions of labor going

1586
01:21:51.299 --> 01:21:55.299
beyond, um, let's call it the agricultural revolution, right?

1587
01:21:55.359 --> 01:21:58.180
You know, 10 to 15,000 years ago, um, and

1588
01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.419
it's a really interesting claim, but I, I would

1589
01:22:00.419 --> 01:22:03.060
strongly disagree with it, I think, um, because I

1590
01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.790
think we do actually have Um, archaeological and fossil

1591
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:12.750
evidence that that shows, um, differences in skeletal, um,

1592
01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:17.229
patterns, essentially, uh, uh, you know, this can be

1593
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:20.350
like differential development of limbs in response to loading,

1594
01:22:20.479 --> 01:22:22.669
um, you know, the way you use your teeth,

1595
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:24.819
things like that. I actually have a student now,

1596
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:27.979
we're actually compiling all the The information on this

1597
01:22:27.979 --> 01:22:30.580
and should have something coming out soon, but um

1598
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.259
it's a relatively strong trend toward showing that there

1599
01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:38.229
that there are sex differences in activity patterns going

1600
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:40.910
back, um, you know, many tens of thousands of

1601
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:43.259
years. And so this is just one piece of

1602
01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:47.509
evidence among many, along with modern behavioral evidence that

1603
01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:50.350
we can kind of triangulate in on what people

1604
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:52.919
were doing in the past. Um, AND I think

1605
01:22:52.919 --> 01:22:55.069
we need to include all of these kinds of,

1606
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.350
of evidence, and I look forward to kind of,

1607
01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.600
um, you know, ongoing, ongoing debates in this area.

1608
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.640
I think it's, I think it's important and really

1609
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:02.839
interesting.

1610
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:06.919
Yeah, I was going to ask you, uh, that,

1611
01:23:07.259 --> 01:23:10.750
of course, by discussing rates of hunting and whether

1612
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:15.020
women participated in hunting in, particularly in more ancient

1613
01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:18.819
societies, one of the things that people are debating

1614
01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:24.180
here is, uh, how old also are sexual divisions

1615
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.580
of labor, right?

1616
01:23:27.129 --> 01:23:30.390
Yeah, exactly, right? I mean, um, I think recent

1617
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:33.060
arguments, some people have have argued it would go,

1618
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:35.899
like I said, just 10,000 years ago or so,

1619
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:40.180
um, versus, you know, deep back to, let's say,

1620
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:42.790
Homo erectus, which is one of these, these hominid

1621
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.669
species that was kind of starting to look humanlike,

1622
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:48.629
you know, maybe had cooked food, fire, maybe it

1623
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:51.229
was running around, uh, maybe it was like the

1624
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:53.390
first kind of hunter gatherer in some sorts of

1625
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:56.649
ways, um. And you know, it can be it

1626
01:23:56.649 --> 01:23:59.330
can be difficult to to reconstruct these sexual divisions

1627
01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:02.209
of labor, but but as I said, um, there,

1628
01:24:02.279 --> 01:24:07.009
there do tend to be patterns of um Showing

1629
01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:11.060
differences, um, going, going back in time. So, um,

1630
01:24:11.069 --> 01:24:13.029
I, I'll be curious what what research in this

1631
01:24:13.029 --> 01:24:15.689
area, um, reveals,

1632
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:20.520
yeah. Great. So just before we go, where can

1633
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.470
people find you when you work on the internet?

1634
01:24:24.879 --> 01:24:27.959
Um, Uh, SO I'm, I'm based at the University

1635
01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:31.350
of Calgary, so, uh, I run the Vencatrain lab,

1636
01:24:31.529 --> 01:24:34.569
um, we study human evolutionary energetics, so you can

1637
01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:37.290
just, you know, Google me there, um, or on

1638
01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:42.410
Twitter, I think my handle is Vivek_Vassi um VASI,

1639
01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:44.770
um, so yeah, or I guess we call it

1640
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:46.890
X these days, um, so yeah, I, I tweet

1641
01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:50.870
there, um, occasionally, but that's about it. Yeah.

1642
01:24:51.339 --> 01:24:53.919
Great. So I'm adding that to the description of

1643
01:24:53.919 --> 01:24:57.049
