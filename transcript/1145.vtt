00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.359
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.159
Center. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lopes sent

3
00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.920
to the Mgen by Doctor Javier Suarez. He's lecturer

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.520
in the Department of Philosophy at the University of

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.920
Oviedo in Spain. And today we're going to talk

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.309
about his book, uh, which he wrote together with

7
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:24.959
Elizabeth Lloyd units of selection. So, Doctor Suarez, welcome

8
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.950
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.909
Thank you, thank you for having me here. It's

10
00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.389
my honor to be here actually.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.939
Thank you. So, could you, would you like to

12
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:40.110
start by giving a sort of an introduction to

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.270
the discussion surrounding units or levels of selection in

14
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.349
the context of evolutionary biology and philosophy of biology?

15
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.889
Yes, sure. This is an agitated debate. So the,

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.810
the, the current origins are usually set in the

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.000
70s, but really the debate starts when Darwin writes

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.930
the origin basically. And the key problem here is

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.410
that while Darwin postulates the mechanism of natural selection

20
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.250
as the mechanism that produces uh adaptations and the

21
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.660
evolution of life in general. And one of the

22
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.959
key questions is, uh, but what are the types

23
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.599
of entities that natural selection sees? Do they have

24
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.839
to have any kind of cohesiveness or not? And

25
00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:29.230
if so, what type of cohesiveness, how does it

26
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.870
work? So 11 of the questions is empirical is

27
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.839
does it affect two groups, to individuals, to populations?

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.610
And there is another which is, which is also

29
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.279
let's say conceptual or theoretical, which is more biological,

30
00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.449
which is the meaning of the expression itself unit

31
00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:50.050
of selection whether it applies only to one type

32
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.209
of unit or as many things in philosophy, it's

33
00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.650
a plural and it has several meanings. So those

34
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.199
are the two types of questions.

35
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.330
So on the topic of units of selection, what

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.800
are the main questions that it raises and that

37
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.059
people debate the most within that topic?

38
00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:12.309
So within that topic, yeah, as I, as I

39
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:14.820
was saying, is on the one hand, the debate

40
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.800
of whether groups can evolve by natural selection. That's

41
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.479
one of the whole uh debates. So it's very

42
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.199
clear for, for us that I don't know, animals

43
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.759
evolved by, by natural selection, no, so if you

44
00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.039
take lions, why do lions have the type of

45
00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.839
clones they have or the type of, that's very

46
00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.600
clear. The question becomes more convoluted when it goes

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.919
to groups. Why do do groups have the traits

48
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.399
they have? Is it a result for natural selection

49
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.960
or it's simply a result of individual selection and

50
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.600
then simply an aggregate that forms the group? And

51
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.399
that's one of the main debates that people have

52
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.639
in this topic. Um, THE other is a, a

53
00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.990
debate about uh evolution of the biological hierarchy itself.

54
00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.589
So we know that you, we humans and animals

55
00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:07.070
and plants and Are pluricellular or multicellular organisms, we

56
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.149
are made out of several cells. The question is

57
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:14.949
that originally, whenever, when life started, it was only

58
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.429
single cells and the question is how could natural

59
00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:23.440
selection produce. MULTICELLULARS, and that's another hot topic in

60
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.240
the debate on units of selection.

61
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.169
But what is a unit of selection actually and

62
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:36.029
how does this question relate to what natural selection

63
00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:36.639
is?

64
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.089
Yes, that's a very good question. So, uh units

65
00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.490
of selection is, as the name indicates is the

66
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.210
entity that evolves by natural selection where natural selection

67
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.970
is the mechanism. Now, people have different definitions or

68
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.160
different conceptions of natural selection. Some people think that

69
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.360
every trait evolved by natural selection and we need

70
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.279
to find a so and so story that tell

71
00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.399
us how natural selection could have produced this. Others

72
00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.279
think that it's simply, uh, natural selection refers to

73
00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.039
a type of process that occurs in nature and

74
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.509
that gives rise to many different types of products

75
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.480
and it depends on whether it adds all the

76
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.279
time on the same type of unit or not

77
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.170
or it changes, etc. And that's a correlation depending

78
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.820
how you see natural selection, you will see what

79
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.589
the units are. So you have a wider view,

80
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.260
you will have a wider view of units. If

81
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.130
you have a narrow world view, you will also

82
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.459
have a narrower view on units.

83
00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:41.309
So, uh, do we know if all traits are

84
00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:45.549
the result of natural selection and what does that

85
00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:48.029
mean for a trait to be the result of

86
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.489
natural selection?

87
00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.329
Yeah, that's a common, uh, misunderstanding, especially among, uh,

88
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.510
let's say high school students. The, the answer to

89
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.200
the first question is no. Most traits are not

90
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.209
the result of natural selection. So there is a

91
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.890
very famous article from Stephen Jay Gould and Leonin

92
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.720
called The Spandrels of San Marco where they put

93
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.649
the exam, the following example. Let's suppose that you

94
00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.649
want to make a cathedral, no, and you want

95
00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:17.739
to make um Um, this big thing on the

96
00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:20.089
top, I can't remember the name right now, um,

97
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.359
Coppola in Spanish, um. Anyway, so in order to

98
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:27.200
make the columns stable, you need to create certain

99
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.200
holes called spandres that are there because they protect

100
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.790
the surface that it can be built. However, these

101
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.839
traits, these uh structures are there because of a

102
00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.959
physical necessity. Well, with natural selection, it happens the

103
00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.119
same. There are many traits that are there because

104
00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.239
of physical necessity but are not a product of

105
00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:49.109
selection. They are not created by natural selection. What

106
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:51.579
does it need for a trade to be uh

107
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.269
uh a result of selection? Well, the trade needs

108
00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:59.359
to convert higher fitness to the better. And the

109
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.880
trade needs to persist there precisely because it confers

110
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.000
higher fitness and that's when a trade is, is

111
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.279
a result of selection. So not every trade has

112
00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.239
these characteristics.

113
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.760
Mhm. In the book, you talk about two different

114
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.250
approaches to evolution. One is the, or you call

115
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.570
it the adaptationist school and the other, the evolutionary

116
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.119
change school. Tell us about each of them.

117
00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.829
Yes, this distinction comes from Charles Goodnight and actually

118
00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.670
is um it's a distinction between two views of

119
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.480
natural selection. The adaptationists tend to think that every

120
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.200
trait is, uh, every trait they are interested in

121
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.230
is a result of selection, and they will try

122
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.739
to find a so and so story explaining how

123
00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:51.070
this trade could evolve against the odds. What are

124
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.179
the odds? Well, the many contingent factors that can

125
00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:57.790
affect that the. Trade that confers higher fitness, right,

126
00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:02.200
that's against the odds. CHANGE is cool, uh, people,

127
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.450
um, don't think that every trait is necessary an

128
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.529
adaptation and think that many traits are visible to

129
00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.929
natural selection even if they don't get fixed in

130
00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:13.839
the population or even if they don't get engineer,

131
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.769
etc. So they simply focus on the process of

132
00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.209
selection itself, that is how among the many contingent

133
00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:23.390
factors that affect organisms. Some of the factor that

134
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.019
offends them are related to the fitness of their

135
00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.230
traits, and that's the main distinction.

136
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.790
Uh, COULD you explain what is that you call

137
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.989
in the book the disambiguation project? What is

138
00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:40.190
that? This already goes to the core of the

139
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.910
book. So in the book, we focus on one

140
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.250
of the first question I, I mentioned in the

141
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.429
first answer is the question of the meaning of

142
00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:50.709
the expression units of selection and how different people

143
00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:54.339
use it. What we call the disambiguation project is

144
00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:58.779
a project that tries to understand how different researchers

145
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.299
or different research tradition have used expression units of

146
00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:07.679
selection. The disambiguation project postulates that depression is ambiguous

147
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:11.940
because it's used to refer to different concepts even

148
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.049
if the expression is the same. And the key

149
00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:17.309
point of the disambiguation project is to do that

150
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:20.450
is to disambiguate. OK, we know units of selection

151
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.369
is ambiguous. What are the different meanings of depression

152
00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:26.369
kind of and that's the whole core of the

153
00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:26.799
project.

154
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.280
Uh, YOU also talk about the unitary project. What

155
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.260
is the unitary project and how does it differ

156
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.580
from the disambiguation project?

157
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.119
The, the unitary project precisely is the one that

158
00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:43.919
thinks that actually the expression is not ambiguous. Units

159
00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.599
of selection refers to just one type of thing,

160
00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:49.599
just one concept. And what it tries to do

161
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.549
is to investigate the necessary conditions for a thing

162
00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:55.119
to be a unit of selection. And the main

163
00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:57.479
difference is that, yeah, they don't think there is

164
00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:00.239
an ambiguity that simply some people use the concept

165
00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:00.650
wrongly.

166
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.380
Mhm. Uh, TELL us about, uh, what you mentioned,

167
00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:08.559
uh, another thing that you mentioned in the book

168
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:12.609
that is Lewontin's recipe approach to the levels of

169
00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:17.510
selection and how it relates to the disambiguation project.

170
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.000
Yes, uh, Lewontin's, uh, approach to natural selection comes

171
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.119
from a paper that he wrote in 1970, although

172
00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.690
he updated his ideas a bit later. And that's

173
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.369
what it's considered the start of the debate as

174
00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:37.450
we on Junior selection as we currently have the

175
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.780
debate. This recipe approach tries to give the ingredients

176
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.159
that are jointly necessary and sufficient for a thing

177
00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.780
to be a unit of selection. So it's a

178
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.650
type of unitary project. According to this recipient approach,

179
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.979
a unit is a unit of selection when it

180
00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:57.820
belongs to a population where there are, well, there

181
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.090
are traits that show variation between individuals in the

182
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.090
population, so you need to have different traits for

183
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.710
obvious reason. These traits have different fitnesses, so you

184
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.150
can, you have different variations of the same trait,

185
00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:14.349
but also that they confer different fitness and that

186
00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:17.950
these traits are heritable. That means that if you

187
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.340
have a trait that confers your higher fitness, then

188
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.070
your offspring will also have a higher tendency. To

189
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.760
have this trait and the one this approach, as

190
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.880
I say, it starts the debate and it's the

191
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.000
first unitarian approach. How it relates to this ambiguate

192
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.840
to disambiguation project because actually those three ingredients have

193
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.039
to be separated and they give rise to different

194
00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.070
types of units if we analyze each of these

195
00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:47.599
items separately or in certain combinations.

196
00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:54.200
What is your view on debate surrounding the existence

197
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.000
of group selection? Do you think it, uh, it

198
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.390
actually is a thing or not?

199
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.200
Yeah, in line with the disambiguation project, I, I,

200
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:06.919
I would say that the question is ambiguous, right?

201
00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.869
So what do you mean by group selection? And

202
00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:13.280
the, the type of disambiguation project that um this

203
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.650
allo and myself um promote distinguishes at least three

204
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.929
meanings. One means interactor we will talk later about

205
00:11:20.929 --> 00:11:23.929
that I think. The other is manifesto of adaptation

206
00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:28.090
and the other is a reproducer constitutor. Now is

207
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.770
there group selection concerning actors? Probably yes, depending on

208
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.690
the type of group you're looking at. Are is

209
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.010
there group selection confirming manifestos probably as well. There

210
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.250
will be for some cases. Uh, WILL there be

211
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.000
consuming the producers? Probably yes, but you need to

212
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.450
decide the way first. I think there is group

213
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.359
selection clearly, but you need to be clear about

214
00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:51.000
what you mean by the type of unit you're

215
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.719
asking about.

216
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.239
Right, and we're going to talk exactly about that

217
00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:59.599
now, about how the term units of selection might

218
00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:06.440
refer to three different non-coextensional functional concepts. That is,

219
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.200
we have interactor, we have replicators slash reproducer slash

220
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.809
reconstitutor. And also manifester of adaptation slash type one

221
00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:22.539
agent. So how did you arrive at this tripartite

222
00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:26.179
framework and could you explain each of these concepts?

223
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.630
Yes, well, actually, um many years ago in the,

224
00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:33.460
in the 80s when, when Lisa Lloyd wrote her,

225
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.179
her um her first book. Uh, AND a bit

226
00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.619
later when she wrote a chapter in unit selection,

227
00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:43.229
she distinguished 4 meanings, not 3, she distinguished 4,

228
00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:47.539
the, the fourth one being the beneficiary, and, and

229
00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:49.820
she arrived there doing an analysis of the, of

230
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.539
the literature of the time and what people were

231
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:56.200
discussing and, and so on. In my case, uh,

232
00:12:56.299 --> 00:13:00.099
I arrived. Because of reading uh Lloyd's work, of

233
00:13:00.099 --> 00:13:03.210
course, but also because I was working on the,

234
00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.179
on hollows, which is hollows are a symbiotic uh

235
00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:12.070
units composed by an animal and its microbiome. Um,

236
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.989
AND basically there I had many problems because some

237
00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:19.510
people were arguing that um hollows were of selections,

238
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.830
other people were thinking they were not. And then

239
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.590
I realized that they were not talking about the

240
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.229
same for a while, but I couldn't explain very

241
00:13:26.229 --> 00:13:29.229
well how and why, because I was seeing clearly

242
00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:32.830
that in many cases there were manifestos, in many

243
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.590
cases they were interactors. Um, YEAH, I arrived through

244
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.869
this line realizing that they didn't mean the same

245
00:13:38.869 --> 00:13:42.830
and then. Through reading uh Lisa Lloyd's work and

246
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.109
talking to her, um, we kind of put some

247
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:49.109
order in this, in this, um, in this kind

248
00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:53.590
of conceptual mess, so to speak, and I, the

249
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.200
meaning of each of these concepts is the following.

250
00:13:56.549 --> 00:13:59.119
So the interactor is the entity that is directly

251
00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:02.909
visible to natural selection now. That is the entity

252
00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:06.210
that bears the trait. And in virtue of bearing

253
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.349
the re causes reproduction or replication to be differential

254
00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:14.190
at each level or at a different level. Humans

255
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.599
are interactors for probably their eye colors. Why? Because,

256
00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:21.250
well, depending on the eye colors, we will reproduce

257
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.729
more or less, yes. Uh, AND it can be

258
00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:26.890
at the same or at a lower level. So

259
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.289
in many cases, you are an interactor for your

260
00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:32.690
genes, so to speak, for example. What is the

261
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.169
manifesto? Well, the manifesto, it's the manifesto of adaptation

262
00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:40.770
is more complicated because it requires to have interactor

263
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:46.070
at one level repeatedly. Why? Because the manifesto is

264
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.989
the result of a tinkering or engineering process. To

265
00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:54.780
put a typical textbook example, no. So how do

266
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.150
uh giraffes got their long necks? Well, the long

267
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.309
necks is not something that one giraffe one day

268
00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:03.109
appears with a longer neck or whatever, no. Well,

269
00:15:03.229 --> 00:15:05.190
for that you need an engineering process. So you

270
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.030
need the natural selection adds on a specific bones

271
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.239
on a specific muscles and a specific structures of

272
00:15:10.239 --> 00:15:14.599
the neck, generation after generation. And then the neck

273
00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:18.969
becomes an attention and the giraffe becomes a manifesto

274
00:15:18.969 --> 00:15:21.770
of that attention because it's the entity where this

275
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.830
tinkering process has occurred. That's the difference with the

276
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.159
interactor because the interrupor can just last one generation,

277
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.929
can be very ephemeral or it cannot, and then

278
00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.409
it becomes an infesor or not. What is the

279
00:15:33.409 --> 00:15:36.130
reproducer? Well, that's a question of the genetic models

280
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.960
because the issue is that you need to count

281
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.210
units to know that selection has occurred, you need

282
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.650
to count units somehow. What do we normally count?

283
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.650
We normally count genes, those are called replicators because

284
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.200
of the mechanisms of copy, which are almost perfect.

285
00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:55.380
Compared to others, sometimes you simply produce oxygen through

286
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.619
reproduction like it happens with humans or giraffes. To

287
00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:02.780
continue with the example, those are called reproducers and

288
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.539
then the third term is reconstitutor that it's a

289
00:16:05.539 --> 00:16:09.669
bit more convoluted because the reconstitutor actually accounts for

290
00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:15.950
the. A strange reproduction process that occur in groups.

291
00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:19.580
So in some cases of groups, what happens is

292
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.419
that every generation there is like a rearrangement or

293
00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:26.309
a new assortment. And that's what we mean by

294
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:28.880
constituted, but that's basically what you need to count

295
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.549
to realize that natural selection has been occurring, and

296
00:16:32.549 --> 00:16:35.070
that's why you need those three meanings because you

297
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.390
need to distinguish there are 3 different things going

298
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:38.789
on there.

299
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:43.320
So still on the topic of these 3 different

300
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.789
things, 3 different concepts. What kinds of research questions

301
00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:53.400
does each of these types of unit capture? What

302
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.429
contexts are they asked in, and what type of

303
00:16:57.429 --> 00:16:59.549
evidence do we need for each of them?

304
00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:02.820
Yeah, that's also a good question. So then what

305
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.180
we try to do in the book actually is

306
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.020
disambiguate and make this even more clear than it

307
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.319
was before. So. The actor basically asked the following

308
00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.329
question. What is the entity that is interacting as

309
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.900
a cohesive whole with the environment such that the

310
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.348
production is differential. And this being differential in virtue

311
00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:24.180
of the traits that being differential is important. So

312
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.069
what entity bears the traits that causes that reproduction

313
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.589
is differential to how it would occur if it

314
00:17:30.589 --> 00:17:34.410
didn't have this specific variation of the trade. That's

315
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.930
the key question for the interactor for the manifesto

316
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.530
is what is the entity whose traits have been

317
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.890
tinkering of engineering at the level and that, that,

318
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.959
that's a, a difficult question because sometimes we have

319
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.810
when we first approach a system and the system

320
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.010
I mean a biological system, one might have the

321
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.729
impression that the tinkering process has occurred at one

322
00:17:55.729 --> 00:18:01.599
level. But when one investigates this into. You can

323
00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.839
discover that actually natural selection is occurring at a

324
00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:06.000
different level, maybe at a lower level and what

325
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.810
we uh when you see at the upper level

326
00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:12.469
is not a tinkering process, it's simply a result

327
00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:16.680
of selection having occurred at lower levels. So the

328
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.199
manifesto looks for the entity that whose, whose strikes

329
00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.880
are tinkered or engineered or accumulating, let's say a

330
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.880
patients over time. And finally, the replicator reproducer constitutor

331
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.479
applies to the entity that carries the heritability, which

332
00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:34.609
is essential. So it's an essential ingredient to count

333
00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:37.650
for interactors and an essential ingredient to track for

334
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.949
manifestos, which is what are the units that guarantee

335
00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:47.390
the trade trade similarity across generations. And uh where

336
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.250
they are used, well, um, the, the, you have

337
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.349
many different methods, some of them similar, some of

338
00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:55.030
them not in many cases you need to build

339
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.250
models. So for the interactor, you would usually have

340
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.550
to build group selection models or MLS multi-level selection

341
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.949
models. For the manifesto, it's, it's common to build

342
00:19:05.949 --> 00:19:09.109
kin selection models which um they are a type

343
00:19:09.109 --> 00:19:12.339
of group selection model that appeals to the family

344
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.359
relationship between the members of the group. Um, AND

345
00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:18.900
in all cases, and that's very, very, very important,

346
00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:22.619
you need experimental data because you cannot just build

347
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:24.430
a model. You need to go to the field,

348
00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:26.699
you need to accumulate data, you need to show

349
00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.619
the variation in the trade, you need to show

350
00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:31.819
the patterns of reappearance of the trade, and that

351
00:19:31.819 --> 00:19:37.030
requires simply going to the field. Gathering data, um,

352
00:19:37.229 --> 00:19:40.920
yeah, and you would need different, different evidence um

353
00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:43.719
because you need to accommodate all these things together

354
00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:45.709
and use the models differently for each unit.

355
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.829
Right. Uh, I mean, you've already talked about the

356
00:19:50.829 --> 00:19:54.880
differences between the three different kinds of concepts, but

357
00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.410
why is it necessary to distinguish between interactor and

358
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.489
replicator?

359
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.430
Yeah, that case is important because um there is

360
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.270
this general confusion because in the general recipe by

361
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.510
Le one team and, and in evolution in general,

362
00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:14.680
you tend to think that you need, and obviously

363
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.349
you need reproduction because otherwise you can simply not

364
00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:20.910
track things that are going on and reproduction is

365
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.589
one of the basis of life, right? Many definition

366
00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:26.550
of life appeal to reproduction as the differential thing

367
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.390
that life has as opposed to inorganic, um, inorganic

368
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.209
nature. Now, why it's important to distinguish the interactor

369
00:20:34.209 --> 00:20:36.729
to the replicator? Well, because in many processes of

370
00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:41.280
natural selection. The real cause that is the trait

371
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.410
that the environment is seeing and fitness is causing

372
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.569
the differential replication, it's at a different level, normally

373
00:20:48.569 --> 00:20:52.449
higher than the things that are copy making copying

374
00:20:52.449 --> 00:20:54.369
of the cells. And of course if we take

375
00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:58.609
a long evolutionary time, we only see the replicators

376
00:20:58.609 --> 00:21:01.329
or the reproducer, we see the genes or we

377
00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:05.060
see the giraffes, but we are lacking the, the

378
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.199
ephemeral units that are causing that. And that's what

379
00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:10.599
you need to distinguish those because even if the

380
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:15.829
two might overlap sometimes, normally, what is the cause

381
00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:18.400
of select what is being seen by the environment

382
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.630
in the required way for a transition to occur,

383
00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:23.339
it's at a different level from this that is

384
00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:26.560
being copied and that we can track over time.

385
00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:33.369
Would this reframe the way we approach debates surrounding

386
00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:36.770
kin selection versus group selection?

387
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.109
Well, in a sense, it, it, uh, references debates

388
00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:46.030
for the following. People, um, uh, normally researchers in

389
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.489
the kin selection tradition, what they will do is,

390
00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:51.989
they will tend to merge the three questions into

391
00:21:51.989 --> 00:21:56.640
one. Uh, ESPECIALLY conflating manifestos and interactors all the

392
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.119
time, mm, and also because they require manifestos, they

393
00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:05.280
normally require as well replicators, right? Uh, WHEREAS people

394
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.280
working on group selection with normal on many occasions

395
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.479
just be interested in the process of selection itself,

396
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.839
so you are looking for interactors and even if

397
00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:15.550
the two, and that has been argued several times,

398
00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:18.319
some people oppose this, but many people think that

399
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:22.420
group selection and kin selection are mathematically equivalent. For

400
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.650
a specific models, of course, uh, not in general

401
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.430
for specific models you can prove a mathematical equivalent.

402
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.859
That might be so, but the kind of things

403
00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:33.739
you are looking for is different. The kind of

404
00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:36.209
questions you are tracking is different and they will

405
00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:41.660
only be. EQUIVALENT a posteriority never a priority. Posteriority,

406
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.270
you can make the mathematical changes to make them

407
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.310
equivalent, but the causal process that they are. That

408
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.560
they are um let's say investigating and they are

409
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.640
looking for is different and that's why it's important.

410
00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:58.829
Mhm. Uh, AND what do we gain then by

411
00:22:58.829 --> 00:23:05.109
distinguishing interrector from manifester or type one agent?

412
00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:08.109
Yeah, that's very important. We here we avoid a

413
00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:11.430
strong confusion, which is the confusion between the process

414
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.189
of natural selection at a and a very specific

415
00:23:15.189 --> 00:23:17.390
product which is the one that surprised Darwin for

416
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.349
historical reasons. For historical reasons in the 19th century.

417
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.640
Uh, PEOPLE were obsessed to demonstrate that God had

418
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.530
created the world in such a way that organisms

419
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.479
were perfectly adopted and then I don't know, this

420
00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:35.560
animal has this specific structure to do X and

421
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.329
that's what. What Darwin does is naturalizes this. He

422
00:23:39.329 --> 00:23:42.729
basically says, look, that's not true. If you give

423
00:23:42.729 --> 00:23:45.479
history enough time and you take into account this.

424
00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:48.959
Then this tinker trade that you see so sophisticated

425
00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:51.719
because they are actually are simply results of history.

426
00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:57.609
Now, natural selection is a process that sometimes gives

427
00:23:57.609 --> 00:23:59.849
rise to this thinker process, and that's what we

428
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:03.140
call manifestos adaptations when it's only for one trait

429
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.449
and type one agents we need for every trait.

430
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.170
So in humans, for example, all traits have to

431
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.569
more or less coherently evolve, otherwise the species get

432
00:24:11.569 --> 00:24:14.239
extinguished as we know. So that's a type of

433
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:18.050
agent. Now, the interactor doesn't track this, it tracks

434
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:22.540
natural selection acting now. And acting now might be

435
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.619
different from the results it is in the future

436
00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:27.380
because there are many other contingent facts. And that's

437
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.310
very important because many models or um. There are

438
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:35.050
many arguments in the genetic literature saying like, oh,

439
00:24:35.069 --> 00:24:37.349
this model doesn't work because if you apply this

440
00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:40.469
to 3000 generations, the model collapses, of course, but

441
00:24:40.469 --> 00:24:42.949
in tracking interactors. So why do I need to

442
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:46.910
look at 3000 generations or, you know, and that's

443
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.150
important because that's a legitimate question. We need to

444
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.810
know what's happening. Now, um, and yeah, and it's

445
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.770
important to to legitimize a field that it's clearly

446
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.540
legitimate.

447
00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.489
In the book you also talk about a framework

448
00:25:01.489 --> 00:25:07.369
that you call evolutionary transitions in individuality. What is

449
00:25:07.369 --> 00:25:07.849
that?

450
00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:11.239
Yeah, uh, I mentioned this at the beginning as

451
00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:14.780
one of the debates in units. So transitions in

452
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:21.650
individuality is a framework that studies how um groups

453
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.930
evolved from individuals, to put it basically. It starts

454
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.609
from the beginning. So one of the key questions

455
00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:31.410
is how DNA gave gave gave rise to the

456
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:35.069
first cells, how those cells gave rise to multicellular

457
00:25:35.069 --> 00:25:37.569
organisms, how multicellar gave rise to groups, and so

458
00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:40.410
on and so forth. But the most important question

459
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.489
there is how. Groups evolve and how reproduction can

460
00:25:44.489 --> 00:25:47.280
be transferred from one level to the other. The

461
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.859
oceanic transitions in individuality framework is simply the framework

462
00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:53.780
that ask these types of questions. The questions about

463
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.339
how much of reproduction evolve and how singular reproducing

464
00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:01.099
entities become collectives that reproduce as a whole.

465
00:26:02.829 --> 00:26:07.949
And how does the disambiguation project apply to debates

466
00:26:07.949 --> 00:26:09.780
concerning this frameworks?

467
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.500
Yes, in this EI framework, uh, was the transition

468
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.949
in the, the framework, most people have been from

469
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:19.579
the adaptation school, so it's very famous that miners

470
00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:22.099
meet and Samari in 1995 in the first book

471
00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:25.619
on the topic called the Mayor Transitions Individuality. They

472
00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:28.939
claim whatever process give rise to this version at

473
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:31.099
the higher level, it needs to be for the

474
00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:35.859
good of the replicators and that's something extremely surprising

475
00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:39.380
because actually if you come from change the school,

476
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.500
you want to see the naturalization process as a

477
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.489
process. And well, how does the hacker level evolve?

478
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.209
Well, probably because there was natural selection acting on

479
00:26:49.209 --> 00:26:53.050
the group's originally as interactors, and those interactors due

480
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.369
to probably many contingent reasons and that's very important

481
00:26:56.369 --> 00:26:59.880
evolution is contingent in many aspects. It's not direct.

482
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.050
It doesn't have a tail loss or anything similar.

483
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.880
Because of natural selection acting on those um groups

484
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.969
on those interactors or the manifestos of all and

485
00:27:09.969 --> 00:27:12.689
the replication could be transferred to the higher level.

486
00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:16.390
That's why distinguishing those three minutes is important because

487
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.329
sometimes you read papers like, oh this surprising process

488
00:27:19.329 --> 00:27:21.689
could happen if we take into account, if we

489
00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:24.170
take into account what, what these things are interactors.

490
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.079
What other thing could they be? So.

491
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.400
Yeah. Yeah. So I have one last question then,

492
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.219
and I will start with a quote from your

493
00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:39.209
book here. Um, QUOTE, more recently, several authors have

494
00:27:39.209 --> 00:27:43.449
called attention to specific processes in which certain phenotypic

495
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:49.280
traits seem to reappear consistently across generations without replication

496
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.969
or reproducing processes at that specific level. Uh, COULD

497
00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:56.849
you give us examples of this and do we

498
00:27:56.849 --> 00:27:59.930
also need a reconstitutor then?

499
00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:03.380
Yeah, that's, that's a question that actually refers to

500
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.859
my previous work to the book and, and that's

501
00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:08.260
one of the, the reasons why I started collaborating

502
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.250
with Lisa Lloyd and, and that's a very good

503
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.089
question. So, so before I, I started working on,

504
00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:18.459
let's say units only units in a sense, I

505
00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:20.619
was working on hollow s as I said, no,

506
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:24.579
hollow ions are an animal or plant host plus

507
00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:27.540
it's microbiome. And then the debate was whether they

508
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.130
were units of selection and how. In my research,

509
00:28:31.349 --> 00:28:35.189
um, that was during my PhD, I discovered, well,

510
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.030
it was something, there was something very clear, I'm

511
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.790
sorry, that the hollow ion doesn't reproduce as a

512
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.790
single hole. That's something extremely clear. So the microbi

513
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.589
goes on its own. There are many different species

514
00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:49.260
of bacteria they reproduce on their own. The horse

515
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.709
reproduces on its own, and then because of this,

516
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.599
one would say, well, they cannot be manifestos oration.

517
00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:58.829
Recall the definition I said they may be interactors.

518
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.790
But if you don't have iteration of the process

519
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.630
at the same level, then you won't get the

520
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.719
money first. Now, what I discovered is that there

521
00:29:07.719 --> 00:29:10.329
are some cases in which this is not true.

522
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.520
The specific case I, I investigated was the vampire

523
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.180
bat, the evolution of Shaiv in vampire bats. Um,

524
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.800
WHICH is basically the, the fact that bats are

525
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.239
the only animals that can have a strict blood-sucking

526
00:29:25.239 --> 00:29:29.739
diet, and that's something extremely surprising. Uh, AND bloods

527
00:29:29.739 --> 00:29:32.040
having a blood sucking diet is a strong challenge,

528
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.719
uh, physiologically for many reasons related to bladder, kidney

529
00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:39.280
failure, but there are many, many problems with pathogens

530
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.760
that can in blood but wouldn't can you also

531
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.589
with flesh and so on and so forth. There

532
00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:46.829
is a big question there, so how did those

533
00:29:46.829 --> 00:29:50.510
creatures evolve. So the first way of replying to

534
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.750
this question that any bio would do is let's

535
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.829
try tore off the genome and see what kind

536
00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:58.989
of factors they have to cope with this diet.

537
00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:03.000
And then you have surprise. So many of the

538
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.609
attention that the bats needs to have to have

539
00:30:05.609 --> 00:30:08.770
some give that the strict and give diet are

540
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.859
not there. But you have done that. That's, that's

541
00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:15.750
very surprising because you have a strong empirical evidence.

542
00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:18.689
And then when you try to mitigate why and

543
00:30:18.689 --> 00:30:21.489
you go to the source that explains always this

544
00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:25.680
empirical evidence, you get uh an inconsistency. Well, what

545
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.400
is discovered there is that there is positive selection

546
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.160
for the specific traits coping with someivry in the

547
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.040
microbi, you know, the vampi bats. And there it

548
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.239
came my hypothesis. My hypothesis, well, bumper bats are

549
00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:42.959
actually manifestos despite not having reproduction at the focal

550
00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:46.359
level because bats reproduce on the one side, the

551
00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:49.760
micro ion on the other. And then I created

552
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.119
myself a puzzle because as I said, to have

553
00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:56.859
manifesto, you would need inheritance. How could inheritance work

554
00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:00.500
in this case? So what I did for that

555
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.739
um I, I was working with two colleagues, uh,

556
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.420
Sophie Beck and Adrian Stencil from the University of

557
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.939
Vienna and the University Jagaonian in Krakow, respectively, and

558
00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:12.180
then we came out with the following hypothesis. So

559
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.050
let's suppose that or let's start from the beginning.

560
00:31:15.219 --> 00:31:18.300
Inheritance is a functional relationship. So we talk about

561
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.099
inheritance because there is a certain correlation between traits

562
00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:26.939
over generations. Now what mechanism can guarantee that this

563
00:31:26.939 --> 00:31:30.780
correlation was how it should be and then is

564
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.290
when we invented the mechanism of the constitution, where

565
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.979
we invented we didn't invent it. We gave a

566
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:38.459
name to a mechanism that would explain what we

567
00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:41.739
think is happening in Bamba. What happens there is

568
00:31:41.739 --> 00:31:44.619
that simply there is um every generation, there is

569
00:31:44.619 --> 00:31:49.410
a specific assortment of an and a certain selection

570
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.939
of partners between the bat and the bacteria, but

571
00:31:51.939 --> 00:31:54.900
not only that, once the bacteria composes the microbi

572
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.859
of the bat, the selection continues. Now, if you

573
00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:01.979
have this and press the play evolution over millions

574
00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:04.260
of generations, what happens is that you will have

575
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.219
tinkering, tinkering both in the way of looking for

576
00:32:07.219 --> 00:32:10.180
your partner but also in the way of making

577
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.500
your partner change. And that's when we introduced the

578
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.790
concept of the reconstitute. And as I said at

579
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.750
the beginning, 4 units of selection you need. Uh,

580
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.329
WELL, you have interactors, manifestos, and then reproducer replicators,

581
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.119
but some interactors in the case of the hollow

582
00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:31.329
ion that are also manifestos in some specific cases.

583
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.670
The question is how do they reproduce, they are,

584
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.369
they clearly don't satisfy the requirement of replication. But

585
00:32:39.369 --> 00:32:42.410
they also don't satisfy the requirement of rep reproduction

586
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.569
or reproducer as this had been defined previously by

587
00:32:45.569 --> 00:32:50.410
authors such as um Peter Godfrey Smith or or

588
00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:54.770
James Christmer. So then we came the concept of

589
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.489
reconstitution, which is a process in which you don't

590
00:32:57.489 --> 00:33:00.729
have material overlap over generations, but you have a

591
00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:04.170
specific type of assortment due to the active action

592
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.770
of the elements. So basically that's why it would

593
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.099
be, it would be. I always just explain in

594
00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:11.339
the given image, so take a magnet. So it's

595
00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:13.770
like a magnet that creates this kind of attraction,

596
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.500
and once the item pieces go there, it sorb

597
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.689
them in the right way. I hope I I

598
00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:21.920
have explained this clearly. It's a it's a complicated

599
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.310
idea.

600
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:27.010
Yes. Uh, SO, uh, Javier, I'm going to leave

601
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.609
a link to your book, which is again units

602
00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:33.729
of selection published by Cambridge University Press in the

603
00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:36.959
description of the interview. Apart from the book, are

604
00:33:36.959 --> 00:33:40.410
there any places on the internet where people can

605
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.520
find your work?

606
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.239
Yes, I have, uh, um, in my, of course,

607
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.829
my, my university profile and uh if you check,

608
00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:52.569
um, Javier Suarez, University of Oviedo, Javier Suarez philosophy,

609
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.770
University of Oviedo, because my name is uncommon in

610
00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:59.369
the English speaking world, but it's extremely common in

611
00:33:59.369 --> 00:34:02.130
Spain, so we, I'm not the only one in

612
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.650
the University of Oviedo, but just the only philosopher.

613
00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.479
And then I also have a website that you,

614
00:34:07.619 --> 00:34:10.620
you put hybrid started philosophy on, on Google. It's,

615
00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.899
it's relatively easy to find and there I more

616
00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:16.978
or less have links to my research or what

617
00:34:16.978 --> 00:34:19.389
I'm currently working on, what I've been working on

618
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:23.199
in the past, also my publications, and of course

619
00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.060
Google Scholar is a usual good source to, to

620
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.330
find any, any kind of work.

621
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.168
Yeah, great. I will include links to that as

622
00:34:33.168 --> 00:34:35.989
well in the description of the interview. And thank

623
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.969
you so much for taking the time to come
