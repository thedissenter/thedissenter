00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.230
the Center. This time, I'm joined by Doctor Navin

3
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.369
Straus. And we've already had an interview back in

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.689
January this year. I'm leaving a link with in

5
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.449
the description of the, of this one. And today

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.989
we're talking about her latest book or the latest

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.139
edition of her book, defending pornography, free speech, sex

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.969
and The Fight For women's rights there. It is

9
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.309
right. So Naveen, welcome back to the show. It's

10
00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.189
always a huge pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.090
I'm delighted to be back Ricardo. Although I must

12
00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:41.290
say I have very mixed feelings about NYU Press

13
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:44.790
having reached out to me last year and saying

14
00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.509
this old book that I wrote 30 years ago

15
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.790
is still sadly very relevant because of the ongoing

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.840
and indeed increasing attacks on sexual expression under this

17
00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:08.839
stigmatizing term pornography or it's sometimes attacked as obscenity.

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.199
But these are labels that have been applied to

19
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:17.550
a whole range of extremely valuable, important expression including

20
00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:18.970
classic literature.

21
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.529
So let me just ask you by the way,

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.620
because sometimes people like to have some definitions, but

23
00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.470
in the particular case of pornography, do you think

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.569
that there is any proper definition of, of it

25
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.089
or that we even need one to address these

26
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.809
more ethical and legal issues surrounding pornography or not.

27
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.330
This is exactly the right place to start Ricardo.

28
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:48.029
And if I will, if I may, I will

29
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.089
give uh definitions of not only pornography but also

30
00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.650
obscenity. Uh, AND let me throw in yet another

31
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.160
really important term and concept here which is child

32
00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:08.210
pornography. So to start with the term pornography itself

33
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.059
has no specific legal meaning or significance at all

34
00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.009
in American law. And indeed, to the best of

35
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.160
my knowledge, the law of most other countries, it

36
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.820
is, if you look it up in the dictionary,

37
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.770
it is inevitably defined as expression that is sexually

38
00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:37.110
explicit or sexually suggestive that is intended to or

39
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:43.710
has the effect of being sexually stimulating or pleasurable.

40
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.470
That said we tend to use it at least

41
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:53.231
in contemporary American speech as a derogatory term. It

42
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.511
has a rather stigmatizing association, I think. Um, SO

43
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.852
we tend to use it for whatever sexual expression

44
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.611
we find distasteful many years ago. With the, there

45
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:13.082
was a very strong aspect of the feminist movement

46
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.052
in the United States that uh was trying to

47
00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:22.091
crusade for outlawing what they called pornography because they

48
00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:26.992
wanted to create a new legal concept of sexual

49
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.811
expression that they thought should be censored. It wasn't

50
00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:35.152
restricted under contemporary American law and it still is

51
00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:38.682
not, uh, they defined it as sexual expression that

52
00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:43.593
is demeaning or degrading to women. But to try

53
00:03:43.602 --> 00:03:46.013
to make the point that they were not completely

54
00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:52.013
against all sexual expression. They used the term erotica

55
00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:55.692
uh to refer to sexual expression that they thought

56
00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:58.822
was fine. And one of my colleagues in the

57
00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:03.583
feminist anti censorship movement, because there were many of

58
00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:05.733
us and are many of us who are completely

59
00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:10.994
committed to women's equality and safety who therefore oppose

60
00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:14.393
censoring sexual expression. Uh One of my colleagues uh

61
00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:18.963
quoted one of these um pro censorship feminists who

62
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:24.834
literally said, what turns me on is erotica. What

63
00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:30.755
turns you on is pornography showing the inevitable subjective

64
00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:37.195
concepts here. Now in American law, the vast majority

65
00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:41.595
of sexual expression, whether it's explicit or whether it's

66
00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:47.605
suggestive, almost all of it is completely protected under

67
00:04:47.614 --> 00:04:51.484
the constitution. After all, the first amendment says Congress

68
00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:54.834
shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

69
00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:58.065
It doesn't say unless the speech is about sex.

70
00:04:58.316 --> 00:05:04.216
Um There are however two categories of sexual expression

71
00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:08.696
that the Supreme Court has said are excluded from

72
00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.716
first amendment protection. So I think it's really important

73
00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:15.656
for people to understand that. Um THE one that

74
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:20.575
I think is defensible and not controversial is for

75
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:28.420
child pornography that has a very specific definition which

76
00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:36.540
turns on not what the expression depicts or describes,

77
00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:43.059
but rather on how it is produced illegal child

78
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.869
pornography, which is not protected by the first amendment

79
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:53.690
includes a sexually explicit or suggestive depiction of an

80
00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.231
actual child, a minor is actually used in the

81
00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:04.562
production process. So that is a form of child

82
00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:10.541
abuse, child exploitation. And therefore, it's no more protected

83
00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:13.631
than in any other form of child abuse or

84
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.911
exploitation. But it is not defined in terms of

85
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:21.011
what the image is. The Supreme Court made that

86
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:24.954
absolutely clear in a case in which it struck

87
00:06:24.963 --> 00:06:31.463
down a federal statute that purported to outlaw virtual

88
00:06:31.473 --> 00:06:36.533
child pornography. In other words, an actual adult was

89
00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:40.283
used, but it was a young looking adult or

90
00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:44.544
computer morphing techniques were used to make the adult

91
00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:47.683
look younger and so forth. So the harm that

92
00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:51.635
the Supreme Court is considered concerned about legitimately is

93
00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:54.605
the harm to an actual human being of being

94
00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:58.675
used to produce the material, not whatever harm is

95
00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:02.015
feared to occur from an adult or somebody else

96
00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:06.906
seeing an image that appears to depict a young

97
00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:09.235
person, just one other definition and then we can

98
00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:12.696
move on to the, you know, nonlegal questions. Uh

99
00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:16.485
And that is the concept of obscenity. I'm putting

100
00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:20.067
that in quotes. That is actually a legal term

101
00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:25.067
of art that the Supreme Court um defined first

102
00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:30.667
in 1956. Interestingly enough, until that point, the Supreme

103
00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:35.088
Court had not recognized any category of sexual expression

104
00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:39.067
defined in terms of its content, what it depicted

105
00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:42.388
um as being unprotected by the first amendment. It

106
00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:46.709
did that for the first time in 1956. Um

107
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.480
AND it created this concept of obscenity, which consists

108
00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:57.109
of there's a three part definition. Every sexually explicit

109
00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:01.799
material that somebody contends is obscene has to satisfy

110
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:07.839
all three criteria. So it's a relatively narrow concept,

111
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.000
but it's still very dangerous because all three of

112
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:16.171
the elements are inevitably subjective. Um The first element

113
00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:21.492
is that it has to appeal to the prurient

114
00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:27.851
and pr urient, not a very common word, prurient

115
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:33.041
interest in sex. And the Supreme Court literally defined

116
00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:39.380
that in a subsequent case as a sick or

117
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:45.179
morbid interest in sex as opposed to a normal

118
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.070
and healthy interest in sex. All that really helps,

119
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.979
right? Uh And it's defined according to contemporary community

120
00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:58.690
standards. Number two, um the material has to be

121
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:05.760
patently offensive, a patently offensive de depiction or description

122
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:13.200
of sexual or expiratory organs or activities again defined

123
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:18.330
in terms of contemporary community standards. And number three,

124
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.799
this one is usually the one that's hardest to

125
00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:24.825
satisfy. I it is defined in terms of national

126
00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:29.104
standards to make it harder to satisfy. The material

127
00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:37.224
has to lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific

128
00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:40.075
value. I used to tell my con law students,

129
00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:43.755
there's an easy acronym for remembering that the slaps

130
00:09:43.765 --> 00:09:48.585
test no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

131
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.460
And um many, many of works that have been

132
00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:58.210
attacked as illegal obscenity are saved because experts will

133
00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:02.750
testify that they do have some serious value that

134
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.830
said um the obscenity exception lies about as a

135
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.169
proverbial sort of Damocles to chill certain sexual expression

136
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:17.650
and many Supreme Court justices as well as, um,

137
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.630
to the best of my knowledge, just about every

138
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.489
expert on first amendment law has objected to this

139
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.010
exception saying it is completely inconsistent with the language,

140
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.200
history and purpose of freedom of speech.

141
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.700
So let me ask you here because at a

142
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.070
certain point, you mentioned feminists and I know that

143
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.200
when it comes to pornography and also other sex

144
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.070
related uh topics like even sex work in general,

145
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.799
we have, we have two main camps of feminists.

146
00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:55.580
The ones that I, I I'm going to call

147
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.604
here s pro censorship feminists. And on the other

148
00:10:59.614 --> 00:11:04.284
hand, the anti censorship feminists. So could you please

149
00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:07.255
tell us what are some of the claims made

150
00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:12.054
by the pro censorship feminists against pornography? I mean,

151
00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:15.255
for example, things like that people like Andrea at

152
00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:18.575
work and Catherine mckinnon and others have argued,

153
00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:25.789
they have argued that certain sexual depictions are uh

154
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:33.349
stimulate discrimination toward women disrespect toward women and therefore

155
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:39.809
lead to violence against women and discrimination against women.

156
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.530
In fact, their claims go much further and refuse

157
00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:49.094
to distinguish between, let's say a dept of a

158
00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:52.895
rape scene, even in a classic work of art

159
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:57.715
and actual rape. Now, at the time that that

160
00:11:57.724 --> 00:12:01.594
movement was first became ascendant, which was in the

161
00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:05.684
late 19 seventies, early 19 eighties. And I believe

162
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:09.744
it reached a height in the 19 nineties. Um

163
00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:12.854
AT that time, those of us who were feminists

164
00:12:12.864 --> 00:12:20.159
and opposed uh censorship of sexual expression understood those

165
00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:24.960
claims as, as the rhetoric that one makes in

166
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.000
making a strong point. We did not take them

167
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.630
literally. And yet, as I explain in the new

168
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.640
preface to the reissued addition of defending pornography, uh

169
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:43.210
even though this specific effort of the pro censorship,

170
00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:48.969
feminists to outlaw their concept of sexually discriminatory or

171
00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:54.260
degrading pornography that failed, it failed resoundingly in the

172
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.469
courts of law. And I think in the court

173
00:12:56.479 --> 00:13:00.604
of public opinion, including among younger feminists as well

174
00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:06.994
on a larger scale, they have been very successful

175
00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:11.815
because their some of their more general concepts such

176
00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:18.775
as equating expression of violence with actual violence that

177
00:13:18.784 --> 00:13:25.380
has become quite widely accepted in many dominant aspects

178
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.559
of our culture today, including on campus where surveys

179
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.549
that are conducted by fire, the foundation for individual

180
00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:39.489
rights and expression and college pulse and others show

181
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.809
that distressingly high percentages of students and even younger

182
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:52.724
faculty members consider that expression that is violent is

183
00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:59.325
completely indistinguishable from actual violence. And this is very

184
00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:03.525
disturbing because not only does it lead to calls

185
00:14:03.534 --> 00:14:07.755
to censor I mentioned for example, rape scenes at

186
00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:13.125
Columbia University which has a famous core curriculum studying

187
00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:18.184
Classic works of Western literature. Students objected to reading

188
00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:22.799
the metamorphosis, you know, at Greek Classic because of

189
00:14:22.809 --> 00:14:28.559
depictions of rape. Uh BUT even worse than the

190
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:34.080
censorial aspect of this false equation between expression and

191
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.440
conduct in terms of violence is that if you

192
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:43.390
believe that violent words are the same as violent

193
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.034
conduct, then you are justified in responding to violent

194
00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:55.614
words with actual physical violence. And again, these surveys

195
00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:59.484
that are now being regularly conducted on campus show

196
00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:03.715
that distressingly high numbers of students are saying that

197
00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:08.614
they think violence, physical violence is justified as a

198
00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:12.934
response to a speaker whose words they consider to

199
00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:15.755
be violent or to encourage violence.

200
00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:22.400
So, something that the anti porn feminists usually bring

201
00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:26.450
to the table in debates on pornography is that

202
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:32.140
they many times reference uh scientific literature that they

203
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:38.330
say supposedly points toward uh pornography being harmful, psychological,

204
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:42.195
harmful for the viewers in different kinds of ways.

205
00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:45.744
I mean, in my non expert opinion, the studies

206
00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:49.765
I looked at they were not extremely high quality,

207
00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:52.765
but that's besides the point here, do you think

208
00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:56.905
that uh those kinds of arguments should be taken

209
00:15:56.914 --> 00:16:01.820
seriously in the context of uh dealing with pornography

210
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.919
as a form of freedom of expression or

211
00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:08.599
uh yes, not only in the context of pornography

212
00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:12.840
but with respect to every type of expression, Ricardo,

213
00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:18.080
freedom of speech along with other freedoms appropriately is

214
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:24.840
not absolute of the importance of treating a right

215
00:16:24.849 --> 00:16:28.830
as a constitutional right as a fundamental right is

216
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.299
that it creates a strong presumption in favor of

217
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:37.229
the right and imposes a strong, a heavy burden

218
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:43.989
of proof on government to justify any restriction. Uh

219
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.059
And let me just state what that burden of

220
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.830
proof is. And so the question then is, is

221
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.349
there evidence to satisfy it with respect to any

222
00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:57.719
particular type of expression, including pornography or obscenity? Uh,

223
00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:00.520
AND the burden of proof is that the a

224
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:07.079
speech restriction is justified if, but only if the

225
00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:13.959
government can show that the restriction is necessary to

226
00:17:13.969 --> 00:17:21.468
promote a countervailing goal of compa and that, no,

227
00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:23.529
and I'm gonna use quotes because it's a legal

228
00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:30.588
term of art, no less restrictive alternative would suffice.

229
00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:35.189
So if you could arm without restricting speech or

230
00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:39.020
without restricting as much speech, the government has to

231
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.209
use that less you. In other words, you can

232
00:17:41.219 --> 00:17:45.170
punish speech only as a last resort when it

233
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:50.709
is literally necessary. So if there were evidence that

234
00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:56.589
restricting some additional sexual expression beyond child, so child

235
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.359
care gray satisfies that standard, I believe uh because

236
00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:05.859
there is evidence that given the secret and clandestine

237
00:18:05.869 --> 00:18:10.500
nature of the production process, um The only method

238
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.430
that works for stifling the production is to outlaw

239
00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:19.099
the resulting product. That was the burden of proof

240
00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:22.910
that the government had to satisfy. Um But when

241
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.530
you talk about the and so if there were

242
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.770
evidence that the only way to prevent rape or

243
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.890
to significantly reduce the number of rapes or to,

244
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.630
you know, reduce the amount of discrimination against women

245
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:45.180
was to impose further restrictions on sexual expression that

246
00:18:45.189 --> 00:18:48.719
would satisfy me. And more importantly, it would satisfy

247
00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:53.339
the Supreme Court. But the evidence comes nowhere close

248
00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:56.699
to satisfying that bird of proof. I had an

249
00:18:56.709 --> 00:19:01.530
entire chapter in the original book to that point

250
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.219
in which, uh sadly, and ironically, many of the

251
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.300
social scientists who had devoted their whole careers to

252
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.680
trying to see whether there is any connection, especially

253
00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:16.959
between uh violence, actual violence and any kind of

254
00:19:16.969 --> 00:19:21.160
violent depiction, including sexually violent depictions. And they found

255
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.260
no such connection and they complained that their work

256
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:31.310
was being cited and distorted by advocates of censorship.

257
00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:34.030
In the new preface, I wrote for the new

258
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.579
edition, I updated that research and a social scientist

259
00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:41.030
who continue to study the issue is a very

260
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.900
important issue. Continue to say that there's no evidence

261
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.420
of a causal connection. Um And, and some psychologists

262
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.609
and social psychologists and penologists and criminologists say, you

263
00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:57.079
know, at least for some individuals, it, it actually

264
00:19:57.089 --> 00:20:02.619
deflects them from engaging in actual violent conduct that

265
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.589
this can be a relatively safe outlet for any

266
00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:09.729
kind of violent impulses that they have.

267
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.030
I it's very interesting because I've had on the

268
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.930
show, people who study these forms of, uh let's

269
00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:21.589
say uh these forms of expression on the internet,

270
00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:24.099
particularly, I mean pornography on the internet and how

271
00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:28.560
people consume it and the kinds of supposed psychological

272
00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:31.650
effects that it has on them. And there's even

273
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.680
one very interesting thing that is even if there

274
00:20:34.689 --> 00:20:37.640
was a correlation, uh it would be a negative

275
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.989
correlation because over the years, uh, pornography consumption has

276
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.160
gone up and sexual violence has gone down sexual

277
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.119
assault and other things like that.

278
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.839
And I understand that among young people that, I

279
00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:56.010
mean, I hear a lot of complaints that younger

280
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.020
people are being exposed to por, you know, very

281
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.280
graphic pornography at earlier and earlier ages, um, that

282
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.939
they are having less actual sexual contact in their

283
00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:10.310
real life. Now that may be a negative. And

284
00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:14.310
believe me, I'm not here to advocate for certainly

285
00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:18.359
not for pornography in general or any particular depiction.

286
00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:21.439
But to me, it as is true for all

287
00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:24.920
expression. Some of it is positive, some of it

288
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.250
is negative. I, I would assume the vast majority,

289
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:35.069
majority of it. The impact depends on myriad countless

290
00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:38.849
other factors including the person who's looking at it

291
00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:41.910
and how they use it and everything else about

292
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.619
them. I mean, when I, in, as I described

293
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:52.069
in um my book, the most graphic depiction of

294
00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:55.790
a rape that I had ever seen, uh was

295
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.439
in a movie starring Jodie Foster. I'm blanking out

296
00:21:59.449 --> 00:22:01.500
on the name of the movie. Now I wrote

297
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.449
the book in the early nineties. So we're talking

298
00:22:03.459 --> 00:22:06.410
about uh very long ago, but it was a

299
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.359
scene of a gang rape. It was horrible to

300
00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:14.589
watch it. You know, it wasn't completely graphic or

301
00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:18.790
explicit, but it was suggestive enough. And I know

302
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.829
that the reaction that I and many others men

303
00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:26.219
as well as women. People in law enforcement, people

304
00:22:26.229 --> 00:22:31.869
in government had was to mobilize us to crusade

305
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:38.109
for laws that would more effectively prevent and punish

306
00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:41.500
um people who engage in rape. And that led

307
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.359
among other things to the violence against women act

308
00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:49.300
to train, increase increased training of police officers and

309
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.699
prosecutors and uh others in law enforcement to be

310
00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:56.599
more attuned to and more sensitive about women who

311
00:22:56.609 --> 00:23:01.060
were victims of rape. So, you know, seeing something

312
00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:06.150
depicted, it can lead to exactly the opposite real

313
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.810
world impact in terms of the underlying problems. Now,

314
00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:12.060
you know, for me, I would say as somebody

315
00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:14.439
who is very concerned about young people, I speak

316
00:23:14.449 --> 00:23:17.760
on college campus all the time. Uh I really

317
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.550
am concerned that they develop a positive and enthusiastic

318
00:23:22.619 --> 00:23:27.280
uh attitude towards sex and sexuality and of the

319
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.180
role that I can play in their individual lives

320
00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:33.140
and in their relationships. And so when I hear

321
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.349
complaints that, you know, too much online pornography is

322
00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:41.119
likely to give them unrealistic expectations or turn them

323
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.380
off from actual sensitive real world experiences, you know,

324
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.270
that, that raises a concern in my mind to

325
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.270
which the answer as always is not censoring speech,

326
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.500
but more speech, let's have more positive sexual expressions

327
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.989
that are more constructive.

328
00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:03.849
But since we're talking about sexual expression here, uh

329
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:08.319
couldn't it happen that particularly the more the people

330
00:24:08.329 --> 00:24:10.660
who fall more on the conservative end of the

331
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.650
political spectrum, conservative feminists and other kinds of conservatives.

332
00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:20.310
If laws that, uh, that would, uh, uh, uh,

333
00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:23.170
if laws that, uh, if laws where there would

334
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.810
be censorship of pornography were to be passed, couldn't

335
00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:31.150
they also target because it's a form of sexual

336
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.369
expression, sexual education in schools and elsewhere.

337
00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:42.310
Absolutely. And, um, we have seen with, uh, various

338
00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:47.150
measures that have either been enacted or proposed that

339
00:24:47.349 --> 00:24:52.910
the targets have because the concepts are so inherently

340
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:59.560
subjective and the definitions are so vague and overbroad

341
00:24:59.569 --> 00:25:03.079
that any member of the community can make a

342
00:25:03.089 --> 00:25:08.280
complaint about any sexual expression that they find inconsistent

343
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.520
with their values. I, I gave a little legal

344
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.469
lecture at the beginning. Let me add what I

345
00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:18.439
think most of your audience will be familiar with

346
00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:23.314
the most famous statement that a Supreme Court justice

347
00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:26.494
ever made in all of the cases in this

348
00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:30.525
topic was Potter Stewart when he was referring to

349
00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:34.344
illegal obscenity, uh which he referred, he used the

350
00:25:34.354 --> 00:25:39.074
colloquial term, hardcore pornography, which is not a Supreme

351
00:25:39.084 --> 00:25:42.035
Court term, but that many people use. He said

352
00:25:42.045 --> 00:25:46.795
I cannot define it, but I know it when

353
00:25:46.805 --> 00:25:50.250
I see it and the point is that everybody

354
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.439
sees a different it and we certainly have had

355
00:25:54.449 --> 00:26:00.349
experiences of classic works of sexual education. Indeed, from

356
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.770
a feminist point of view, there was a classic

357
00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:05.550
uh at the time that I was writing my

358
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.729
book called Our Bodies Ourselves that was written by

359
00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:13.760
the Boston Women's health collective, you know, a se

360
00:26:13.845 --> 00:26:20.026
positive feminist, positive uh book about women's sexuality and,

361
00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:25.426
and health in general reproductive options. And that was

362
00:26:25.436 --> 00:26:30.666
targeted all over the country as being illegal obscenity.

363
00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.816
You know, at the other end of the spectrum

364
00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:36.852
uh work that would be of great concern to

365
00:26:36.911 --> 00:26:42.112
cultural, political and religious conservatives. The Bible has been

366
00:26:42.121 --> 00:26:45.791
attacked and even sought to be removed from public

367
00:26:45.802 --> 00:26:52.812
libraries because of um graphic descriptions of rape and

368
00:26:52.822 --> 00:26:57.739
violence including gang rape against women. So, you know,

369
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:03.329
nothing in the realm of sexuality or even perceived

370
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:07.859
sexuality is safe. And I say even perceived sexuality,

371
00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:11.739
Ricardo, because in my book, I give examples of

372
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.229
abstract works of art that people would look at

373
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.339
both conservatives and radical feminists and say, oh, you

374
00:27:21.349 --> 00:27:25.760
know, that's sexually suggestive that clearly is indicative of

375
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.180
violence against women are as clearly inconsistent with traditional

376
00:27:30.189 --> 00:27:33.719
family values. You know, I'm smiling, but it's really

377
00:27:33.729 --> 00:27:36.089
it it it's not, it's really no laughing matter

378
00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:39.839
because it led to has led to uh removals

379
00:27:39.849 --> 00:27:43.839
of of, of uh abstract works of art, even

380
00:27:43.849 --> 00:27:45.319
from college campuses.

381
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.079
And by the way, talking about art and even

382
00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:52.599
other areas where we can have sexual expression. This

383
00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:55.430
could also target, I mean this this kind of

384
00:27:55.439 --> 00:27:59.579
laws and this kind of attitudes toward to pornography

385
00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:03.750
could also target LGBT Q people, right?

386
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.530
And not only could but um have always been

387
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:14.084
a major target. Not surprisingly because as with any

388
00:28:14.094 --> 00:28:20.555
censorship law that gives basically, uh, unfettered discretion to

389
00:28:20.564 --> 00:28:25.045
the un enforcing authorities precisely because of the vagueness

390
00:28:25.055 --> 00:28:28.645
and the overbreadth of the concept. I mean, I

391
00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:31.564
know it when I see it, that means whoever

392
00:28:31.574 --> 00:28:35.285
is enforcing the law who is probably gonna reflect

393
00:28:35.295 --> 00:28:38.805
not only his own individual values, but those of

394
00:28:38.814 --> 00:28:45.479
doubt, prominent, powerful community interests, whatever they consider distasteful

395
00:28:45.489 --> 00:28:49.290
is going to be suppressed. So, in defending pornography,

396
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.680
uh, again, 30 years ago, I had an enormous

397
00:28:53.689 --> 00:28:59.150
amount of coverage about uh how often and predictably

398
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.150
the targets were LGBT Q expression. And I think

399
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.135
the most dramatic case study on point was our

400
00:29:08.145 --> 00:29:14.935
neighboring country of Canada, which in 1992 did adopt

401
00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:20.415
the feminist pro censorship concept of illegal pornography. Anything

402
00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:24.334
that is demeaning or degrading. And sadly, the predictions

403
00:29:24.344 --> 00:29:27.614
that the anti censorship feminists had made that the

404
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:32.280
first targets would include feminist and LGBT Q expression.

405
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.239
Sadly, uh that came to roost and all of

406
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.430
the lesbian and gay bookstores in Canada at the

407
00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:43.209
time were immediately targeted. Uh Many of them went

408
00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:47.060
out of business at the US Canada border, Canadian

409
00:29:47.069 --> 00:29:51.369
customs seized all manner of classic works uh by

410
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.270
or about the LGBT Q community. And the real

411
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.795
irony that, you know, again, I she hadn't come

412
00:29:58.805 --> 00:30:04.204
to pass but Andrea Din's own works were suppressed

413
00:30:04.214 --> 00:30:08.025
by Canadians. And I'm talking about not only her

414
00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:11.964
explicitly anti pornography work. So in some way you

415
00:30:11.974 --> 00:30:16.484
would expect because along with other anti pornography crusaders

416
00:30:16.494 --> 00:30:20.905
she depicted and described in great detail exactly the

417
00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:24.064
pornography that she thought was dangerous. But she also

418
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.540
wrote novels. II, I put it in the past

419
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.020
just because sadly, she died a while back. But

420
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.780
her novels com works completely from the imagination were

421
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:38.060
filled with the most brutal graphic sexual violence. So,

422
00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:41.099
uh, under the explicit terms of the law, she

423
00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:44.420
had advocated her own books were, were censored and

424
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.780
she said, well, I think that's a price worth

425
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.819
paying. Uh MANY of her readers did not agree

426
00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:50.339
with that,

427
00:30:50.719 --> 00:30:54.719
right? And then another to think that anti porn

428
00:30:54.729 --> 00:30:59.949
feminists usually do when arguing against pornography is that

429
00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:06.430
they use terms like sexual exploitation, sexual subordination. What

430
00:31:06.439 --> 00:31:08.189
does that mean? Exactly.

431
00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:12.520
So uh before I answer that excellent question, I

432
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.410
want to say one other point in response to

433
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.290
the prior excellent question because I, I answered in

434
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.969
terms of history. But I wanna make very clear

435
00:31:21.239 --> 00:31:24.959
the reason why NYU press reached out to me

436
00:31:24.969 --> 00:31:28.020
and asked to republish the book as part of

437
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.680
its NYU Classic series and asked me to write

438
00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:35.479
a new preface explaining why. Sadly, it continues to

439
00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:40.979
be completely applicable is that there is an anti

440
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:47.510
pornography, anti obscenity movement today. Many of, of the

441
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.810
most dominant, powerful strains of which are continuing to

442
00:31:52.819 --> 00:31:59.469
focus on LGBT Q expression. Most important case in

443
00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:04.010
point are a whole raft of state laws, uh

444
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:10.579
executive orders and local regulations that are attacking library

445
00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:15.569
books in public schools and in public library um

446
00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:20.650
that are said to be pornographic or obscene and

447
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.910
studies have been done. Reports have been done over

448
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.959
the last few years by respected organizations. Um The

449
00:32:28.969 --> 00:32:35.520
American Library Association, Pen America, an organization of writers

450
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.140
that focuses on anti censorship issues. The national coalition

451
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:45.500
against censorship, the major targets of all of these

452
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.719
efforts throughout the country are books that are by

453
00:32:49.729 --> 00:32:54.050
or about LGBT Q individuals. So this is a

454
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.959
very, very serious ongoing issue. Now to your um

455
00:32:57.969 --> 00:33:04.280
most recent excellent question, um sexual exploitation or sexual

456
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:10.989
subordination. That again is a very subjective concept. Uh

457
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.160
OBVIOUSLY, in, you know, abstract legal terms, I should

458
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.250
say it's obvious, but maybe it doesn't go without

459
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:26.339
saying any form of non consensual treatment of a

460
00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:33.979
particular individual is absolutely antithetical to that person's freedom

461
00:33:33.989 --> 00:33:39.449
and dignity and autonomy and is a violation of

462
00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:43.180
criminal law as well as seminal as well as

463
00:33:43.189 --> 00:33:45.560
civil law, which is exactly why we have the

464
00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:49.420
concept of child pornography. Because below a certain age,

465
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:54.109
our legal system appropriately says you are inherently incapable

466
00:33:54.119 --> 00:34:00.130
of meaningful consent. Um The pro censorship, feminists expressed

467
00:34:00.844 --> 00:34:06.714
equated women with Children and said that because of

468
00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:10.833
um our, the sexist society, the patriarchy in which

469
00:34:10.844 --> 00:34:16.475
we live, they contended that women are inherently incapable

470
00:34:16.485 --> 00:34:21.594
of meaningful consent either to look at sexual expression,

471
00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:25.560
to perform in it uh so forth. And therefore,

472
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.978
they said women should be protected along with Children.

473
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:33.330
Those of us who think that we might want

474
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.340
to look at uh sexual expression or even perform

475
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:42.159
for it or even to enjoy sex in general

476
00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:45.750
because this is a movement that was profoundly anti

477
00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:51.139
sex uh in general. Um EVEN beyond commercial, the

478
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:55.797
commercial pornography and industry um basically saying that inherently

479
00:34:55.806 --> 00:34:58.096
women are exploited and those of us who think

480
00:34:58.106 --> 00:35:02.677
we are consenting are victims of false consciousness. So

481
00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:06.707
that's where the concept of exploitation goes way too

482
00:35:06.717 --> 00:35:10.537
far from my perspective as um what I would

483
00:35:10.547 --> 00:35:15.846
call a classical liberal feminist. And I am concerned

484
00:35:15.856 --> 00:35:20.876
that conditions of inequality and discrimination mean that we

485
00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:24.833
do have to be, be very sure uh to

486
00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:31.914
ascertain that there actually is informed and meaningful voluntary

487
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:36.593
consent um that women are not victims of even

488
00:35:36.604 --> 00:35:42.523
more subtle forms of exploitation or coercion. Uh You

489
00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:45.573
know, so I am very attentive to that, but

490
00:35:45.583 --> 00:35:48.354
I will not take the final step that the

491
00:35:48.364 --> 00:35:52.061
pro censorship group does. That says sex or sexual

492
00:35:52.071 --> 00:35:56.510
expression is inherently exploitative of women. You know, in

493
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.730
my uh book, I thought one of the most

494
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.960
interesting examples to me uh of even uh what

495
00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.930
I would consider to be degrading images uh namely

496
00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.831
of uh rape scenes, Nancy Friday, a wonderful feminist

497
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:19.770
writer collected several volumes of women's fantasies about sexuality.

498
00:36:19.989 --> 00:36:24.389
And uh she found to her surprise that one

499
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.679
of the most common forms of fantasy that women

500
00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:30.879
voluntarily had you know, like when they're daydreaming or

501
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:34.639
their dreams at night was rape fantasies. And as

502
00:36:34.649 --> 00:36:38.000
she explained, that did not mean that they wanted

503
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.719
to be raped, but they fantasized in a culture

504
00:36:42.729 --> 00:36:46.443
where good girls were brought up, not be so,

505
00:36:46.452 --> 00:36:50.042
you know, to make sexual advances or to seek

506
00:36:50.052 --> 00:36:53.572
pleasure in sex. You know, and Nancy is about

507
00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:55.812
my age. So we were brought up in that

508
00:36:55.822 --> 00:37:01.443
era that to get have permission to enjoy sex,

509
00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:04.822
you had to be overtaken overcome by the male.

510
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:07.083
And I think we see that uh in the

511
00:37:07.093 --> 00:37:09.822
covers of romance novels, I must admit, I don't

512
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:12.946
really delve behind the cover, but I see them

513
00:37:12.956 --> 00:37:14.855
in grocery stores and I know that they are

514
00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:18.865
really best selling works. You know, it often depicts

515
00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:22.156
uh you know, this powerful man who is overtaking

516
00:37:22.335 --> 00:37:25.726
a woman. And so that gives her permission to

517
00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:30.446
enjoy the sexuality. So it's all very complex and

518
00:37:30.456 --> 00:37:34.966
um I would reject the broad brush concept that

519
00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:37.246
uh uh of exploitation.

520
00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:42.189
So I'm not sure what uh what your thoughts

521
00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:44.750
on the point I'm about to make uh would

522
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.469
be. But I, it seems to me that uh

523
00:37:47.479 --> 00:37:51.250
we have this sort of very emotional and even

524
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.520
sometimes perhaps moral reactions to pornography. And they come

525
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.330
from women that are perhaps a little bit more

526
00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.750
conservative and even men of course, but women that

527
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.489
are more conservative and I, and it's mainly because

528
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.770
they can't imagine themselves being a porn performer doing

529
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.300
those kinds of things that the porn performers do

530
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:18.500
on set and elsewhere. And that's why they are

531
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.860
against it. And sometimes they uh they would like

532
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.449
to prohibit it. I mean, don't you have this

533
00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:28.129
kind of feeling that this is perhaps what it

534
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.530
all boils down to?

535
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.100
Well, uh Ricardo, but I actually have spent at

536
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.370
least as much time debating against and lobbying against

537
00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:41.530
those from the left end of the political spectrum

538
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.469
as well as the right end of the political

539
00:38:43.479 --> 00:38:47.419
spectrum. So, and even so in the starting in

540
00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:52.169
the late seventies, we had this so called radical

541
00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:55.729
feminists who were the including Andrew D work and

542
00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:58.330
Catherine mckinnon, who were the ones that came up

543
00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.110
with this supposedly new fangled concept of illegal pornography.

544
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.840
They were definitely to the left. And today we

545
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.550
still have people who now people on the left

546
00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.969
tend to use the term progressive instead of radical.

547
00:39:12.979 --> 00:39:15.929
But again, to distinguish it from those of us

548
00:39:15.939 --> 00:39:19.510
who are liberal and espouse classical liberal values of

549
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.219
free speech and reducing government power. Um We have

550
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:28.219
progressive feminists who are very concerned about what they

551
00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:35.020
call revenge pornography and uh other are supporting other

552
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:40.459
kinds of restrictions on sexual expression, including age verification

553
00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:43.090
requirements that's coming from the left as well as

554
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.159
from the right. Um And again, the concerns on

555
00:39:46.169 --> 00:39:51.649
the, so even though we have these opposite perspectives

556
00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:56.239
in terms of general feminist values and family values

557
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:00.949
very, very different goals. They do coalesce in agreeing

558
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.830
that sexual expression is dangerous. I think that the

559
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.030
danger that is seen from the left continues to

560
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.669
be undermining women's safety and dignity and equality because

561
00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:17.820
somehow they, they reject the idea from their perspective

562
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:22.360
that a true feminist could really agree to make

563
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.320
her living in the porn industry or even to

564
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.250
look at a porn film. Uh Whereas from the

565
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.080
right, you know, again, they, they, they don't think

566
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.000
that a good woman with traditional family values, you

567
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.520
know, who believes that sex is only appropriate in

568
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.889
the traditional uh for the purpose of having Children

569
00:40:41.899 --> 00:40:45.919
and so forth. Um Those are, but they, they

570
00:40:45.929 --> 00:40:50.409
call less around wanting to restrict individual freedom of

571
00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:56.050
choice and also to project certain values into, into

572
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.399
sexuality. Uh And I, and I must say I

573
00:40:59.409 --> 00:41:04.030
probably had some of those stereotypes myself. I was,

574
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.750
um I assumed that you would not become a

575
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.639
sex worker unless you had absolutely no other options

576
00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:15.979
in life. And um all of us and I

577
00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:21.350
was quite interested through my work in supporting freedom

578
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.110
of choice and meaningful choice, which means and make

579
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.459
sure there are safe working conditions and, uh you

580
00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:32.770
know, no actual physical or even psychological exploitation. So

581
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.479
I met women who were active in, among sex

582
00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:42.379
workers organizing for unions, organizing for workplace protection, you

583
00:41:42.389 --> 00:41:45.750
know, joyously affirming that they could make their living

584
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.689
in other ways. But they had a great deal

585
00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:52.429
of, of satisfaction from doing this. I uh was

586
00:41:52.439 --> 00:41:56.350
quite close with Candida Ra who sadly died a

587
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.260
few a year or two ago, uh who had

588
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:04.409
been a star performer in conventional pornography was a

589
00:42:04.419 --> 00:42:09.580
feminist and formed her own production company to produce

590
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:13.310
pornographic films that she thought had a specifically pro

591
00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:19.385
feminist, pro women um sensibility and she very talented

592
00:42:19.395 --> 00:42:21.475
person who could have made her living in many

593
00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:24.665
other ways. You really got a lot of artistic

594
00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:28.524
and, you know, social satisfaction knowing that this was

595
00:42:28.534 --> 00:42:31.544
so important and meaningful to a large audience.

596
00:42:31.885 --> 00:42:34.985
Uh, BUT I mean, perhaps another aspect to the

597
00:42:34.995 --> 00:42:39.360
point I tried to make previously is that when

598
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.979
it comes to these kinds of ideas, like the

599
00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:46.100
one you mentioned, where people assume that no one

600
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.919
would go into pornography or any kind of sex

601
00:42:48.929 --> 00:42:52.179
work unless they were coerced into it or didn't

602
00:42:52.189 --> 00:42:56.189
have any other economic options or, or work options

603
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:59.199
or, or something like that, uh, that, and the

604
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:03.120
fact that, uh, the anti porn feminists tend to

605
00:43:03.129 --> 00:43:07.080
assume what goes on in the minds of the

606
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:11.219
performers because they assume that it's impossible for someone

607
00:43:11.229 --> 00:43:14.919
to really actually like doing that kind of stuff.

608
00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:17.159
Is, isn't that a bit condescending?

609
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.709
Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's very, um, and I

610
00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:26.639
used the term like, uh, big sister, right? That

611
00:43:26.649 --> 00:43:29.449
we know better than you, what is good for

612
00:43:29.459 --> 00:43:32.370
you and if you think that you want to

613
00:43:32.379 --> 00:43:35.300
do this. You are a victim of false consciousness.

614
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:39.110
So it's a, it may very well be from

615
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.810
a positive benign motive. I'm very happy to give

616
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.949
them the benefit of the doubt that they really

617
00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:49.375
think it is for women's own good to be

618
00:43:49.385 --> 00:43:55.415
protected against um this material. But that kind of

619
00:43:55.425 --> 00:44:01.895
paternalism or maternal is deeply inconsistent with my concept

620
00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:06.014
of uh not only individual rights but also equality.

621
00:44:06.024 --> 00:44:09.364
And in fact, that was the rationale that was

622
00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:12.534
used for all kinds of laws that we now

623
00:44:12.544 --> 00:44:16.340
look back on and say we're deeply discriminatory. Uh

624
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:21.750
WOMEN were protected by laws that um shielded them

625
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.310
from entering certain professions or even shielded them from

626
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.699
jury duty or that imposed a maximum number of

627
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:34.629
hours that women could work and so forth. And

628
00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:39.004
in the very first Supreme Court opinion back in

629
00:44:39.014 --> 00:44:45.064
the early seventies that rejected that rationale justice, William

630
00:44:45.074 --> 00:44:50.084
Brennan had a wonderful line which I learned actually,

631
00:44:50.094 --> 00:44:54.364
he lifted from a brief written by Ruth Bader

632
00:44:54.375 --> 00:44:58.524
Ginsburg in her then capacity as the founding director

633
00:44:58.534 --> 00:45:02.139
of the AC Lu Women's Rights Project. Uh WHEN

634
00:45:02.149 --> 00:45:05.179
he said these laws and I would say including

635
00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:10.260
the feminist pro censorship advocated laws uh reflect an

636
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:17.340
attitude of romantic paternalism which put women. And it

637
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.820
was much more eloquent than my paraphrase, uh which

638
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:25.209
rather than protecting women, put them in a cage.

639
00:45:25.709 --> 00:45:28.280
And by the way, sort of related to my

640
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:34.040
previous question, can censorship also harm in different kinds

641
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.830
of way, even the porn performers themselves.

642
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.860
Oh, absolutely. I mean, I need to take a

643
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.409
drink but I wanna make sure you and your

644
00:45:42.419 --> 00:45:44.739
audience see my favorite mug here.

645
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.570
It's very nice.

646
00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:53.429
Thank you. Um, ABSOLUTELY. Because as is true of

647
00:45:53.439 --> 00:46:00.889
every prohibitionist strategy laws restricting the sex industry and

648
00:46:00.899 --> 00:46:05.780
the pornography industry, uh, do not eliminate it altogether.

649
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:10.060
Rather, they simply force it to go underground, which

650
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.580
means that those who participate in it are subject

651
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:19.379
to exploitation and abuse that they would not be

652
00:46:19.525 --> 00:46:22.595
if it were a legal activity and they could

653
00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:28.535
be protected by unions by OSHA, the occupational safety

654
00:46:28.545 --> 00:46:32.666
and health administration by health laws and, and so

655
00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:36.355
forth. And that's exactly why sex workers have been

656
00:46:36.365 --> 00:46:41.145
so strongly advocating for legalization and um to the

657
00:46:41.156 --> 00:46:46.082
best of my uh amnesty International and perhaps some

658
00:46:46.092 --> 00:46:52.892
other international human rights organizations have advocated decriminalization of

659
00:46:52.902 --> 00:46:56.152
sex work. Uh NOT so much on free speech

660
00:46:56.162 --> 00:46:58.291
grounds that you and I are talking about, but

661
00:46:58.302 --> 00:47:01.072
on the other grounds that you just raised, you

662
00:47:01.082 --> 00:47:05.672
know, the equality and dignity and safety uh uh

663
00:47:05.681 --> 00:47:09.912
of the people who are participating in it.

664
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.080
Uh That's a very interesting point because wouldn't it

665
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:19.659
also apply to some of sometimes when feminists raise

666
00:47:19.669 --> 00:47:24.479
the issue of sex trafficking in pornography and other

667
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.229
and also other kinds of sex work. I mean,

668
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:33.120
wouldn't the legalization or the decriminalization of pornography and

669
00:47:33.129 --> 00:47:37.100
other kinds of sex work? Also, we help fight

670
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.080
against the trafficking.

671
00:47:40.409 --> 00:47:44.979
Yes, absolutely. And um one of the most recent

672
00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:48.419
controversies about this was, and it's a really good

673
00:47:48.429 --> 00:47:50.989
example of both the right and the left ganging

674
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.370
up on sexual expression uh was a law that

675
00:47:55.379 --> 00:47:58.459
was passed a few years ago. The acronyms were

676
00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:02.379
foster and sesta just slightly different versions and uh

677
00:48:02.389 --> 00:48:05.419
the two Houses of Congress, but it was to

678
00:48:05.429 --> 00:48:09.580
uh supposedly to fight online sex trafficking, The federal

679
00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:16.913
online Trafficking Act uh to restrict sexual expression online,

680
00:48:17.163 --> 00:48:22.322
that was advocated by politicians all across the ideological

681
00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:29.683
spectrum and opposed by sex workers organizations and also

682
00:48:29.693 --> 00:48:36.163
opposed by anti trafficking organizations, opposed by LGBT Q

683
00:48:36.173 --> 00:48:39.722
organizations and so forth because they said, you know,

684
00:48:39.732 --> 00:48:44.666
if you, you eliminate these online forums, then that

685
00:48:44.676 --> 00:48:47.025
we're going to be forced to go back on

686
00:48:47.035 --> 00:48:50.456
the street, which is much more dangerous where uh

687
00:48:50.466 --> 00:48:54.236
trafficking actually does occur. And a number of studies

688
00:48:54.246 --> 00:48:58.266
have been done now about the actual impact of

689
00:48:58.275 --> 00:49:02.855
that law that was supposed to protect against trafficking

690
00:49:02.865 --> 00:49:07.815
has, in fact, um the studies consistently show led

691
00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:09.865
to increased trafficking.

692
00:49:10.399 --> 00:49:14.229
I mean, at this debate between the anti porn

693
00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:18.260
feminists and the let's call them pro porn feminists.

694
00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:22.020
Don't you think that it would be easier for

695
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:25.540
people to uh uh uh I mean, for people

696
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.959
to come to a sort of, I, I wouldn't

697
00:49:27.969 --> 00:49:30.699
even say consensus but to agree more with each

698
00:49:30.709 --> 00:49:35.189
other if they just ask reps, pardon? The performers

699
00:49:35.199 --> 00:49:39.540
themselves, how they feel about their work because it,

700
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:42.409
it seems to me that, of course, it's true

701
00:49:42.419 --> 00:49:46.030
that there are a few people there, women and

702
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.909
men that probably do not like it that much.

703
00:49:49.919 --> 00:49:52.860
And so, uh, and, uh, a number of them

704
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.810
are victims of sex trafficking, of co, of course,

705
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.360
but it seems to me that there's still a

706
00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:04.510
big number of performers that, uh, went into porn

707
00:50:04.879 --> 00:50:07.840
from, from their own volition. I mean, it was

708
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.760
their own decision, not worse and they like what

709
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:15.060
they do, right? So, I mean, couldn't, couldn't this

710
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.739
be solved with uh by talking more with those

711
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.139
people, the people who actually do that kind of

712
00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:23.459
work

713
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.879
from my perspective and from your perspective, that would

714
00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:32.620
be effective because we respect individual, freedom of choice.

715
00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:35.179
But from the perspective of those who think that

716
00:50:35.189 --> 00:50:39.300
they are protecting people and that they know better

717
00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.415
than the people themselves, what is good for them?

718
00:50:42.544 --> 00:50:45.024
That's not a solution, right? It goes back to

719
00:50:45.034 --> 00:50:49.745
your earlier question about paternalism or maternal. Uh But

720
00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:53.784
Ricardo, I do want to um uh take issue

721
00:50:53.794 --> 00:50:57.245
with one term that you used, which is uh

722
00:50:57.354 --> 00:51:01.810
uh it pro porn feminist. And it's a little

723
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.399
bit similar to, you know, I don't know anybody

724
00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:06.699
who's pro abortion. I just know people who are

725
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:11.040
pro choice. Uh And so I am provid freedom

726
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.860
of choice. I'm not advocating any particular expression at

727
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.169
all. And that's, I say that not only about

728
00:51:17.179 --> 00:51:20.959
pornography but about hate speech, about extremist speech, about

729
00:51:20.969 --> 00:51:25.909
disinformation, any other form of controversial expression? I'm not

730
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:29.100
endorsing the content. I'm not dis endorsing it. I'm

731
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:32.179
just addressing a different principle which is, it doesn't

732
00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.729
matter what my own view is, that's up to

733
00:51:34.739 --> 00:51:37.820
the individual to decide what, to produce, what to

734
00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:40.500
consume, what not to produce what not to consume.

735
00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:46.889
By the way, the feminists who are against pornography,

736
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:52.590
do they also target the websites for content creation

737
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.280
that the content creation that is done by the

738
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:59.280
performers themselves? Like only fans and other kinds of

739
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.590
platforms? Do they also? Sorry?

740
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.689
Oh, I'm so sorry. I I can't address that

741
00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:09.530
specific example. But if I look at the uh

742
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.330
anti porn laws that were drafted by uh the

743
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.739
pertinent group of feminists and that are advocated by

744
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.580
them or foster and sesta uh which were advocated

745
00:52:21.899 --> 00:52:25.610
by them. It's absolutely irrelevant who is involved in

746
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.620
the creation or the consumption for that matter. Uh

747
00:52:29.629 --> 00:52:33.159
They look simply at the content and the value

748
00:52:33.169 --> 00:52:37.090
judgment they make about whether other people should be

749
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.209
making that content or enjoying that content.

750
00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:43.729
Uh Yes. The only reason why I mentioned that

751
00:52:43.739 --> 00:52:48.570
is because uh many, many of those feminists tend

752
00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:53.300
to argue that because uh uh tend to argue

753
00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:57.560
that women who are performers are exploited by the

754
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.439
producers, the directors and other people in the industry.

755
00:53:01.449 --> 00:53:05.060
But I mean, at least in the specific case

756
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:09.520
of online content creators. That is the, the pe

757
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.100
uh the performers themselves creating their own content that

758
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.159
would be even less relevant.

759
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.610
You know, it's so interesting because I have read

760
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.820
that there are just enormous numbers of people, men,

761
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.179
as well as women who are, you know, engaging

762
00:53:26.189 --> 00:53:30.100
in their own productions. You know, they film themselves

763
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:31.919
and they put it online and they don't even

764
00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:35.399
get paid for it obviously get, you know, and

765
00:53:35.409 --> 00:53:37.790
nobody's putting a gun to their head. They obviously

766
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.540
get a great deal of uh of pleasure from

767
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.689
that. In fact, uh I do a lot of

768
00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:46.540
work on campuses as you know, because uh campuses

769
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.370
have been such an important center of the debates

770
00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:53.179
about free speech and censorship. And one of the

771
00:53:53.189 --> 00:53:56.320
uh recent issues on campus you may be aware

772
00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:01.800
of is a provost at a university in Wisconsin

773
00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:06.560
who he and his wife voluntarily. It wasn't even

774
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:10.739
pornography as, as I recall, they were just um

775
00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:17.300
naked uh videos of themselves cooking, right? And they

776
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.629
got an enormous amount of pleasure from it. Um

777
00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:25.429
But he has now lost his job because that

778
00:54:25.439 --> 00:54:28.860
was seen as being so controversial. And those of

779
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.050
us in the free speech community say, you know,

780
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.629
he had a right to do it and nobody

781
00:54:33.639 --> 00:54:36.510
made any complaints about anything he said or did

782
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:42.000
in his official profe professorial or administrative capacities. But

783
00:54:42.169 --> 00:54:48.433
there is such negative judgment about even nakedness, let

784
00:54:48.443 --> 00:54:52.492
alone um sexual content. And I think some of

785
00:54:52.502 --> 00:54:56.752
that goes back to a puritanical heritage that we

786
00:54:56.762 --> 00:55:01.792
have in this country. Um Many European countries and

787
00:55:01.802 --> 00:55:07.193
other, you know, western advanced democracies are much more

788
00:55:07.202 --> 00:55:10.992
tolerant of sexual expression than we are the united

789
00:55:11.426 --> 00:55:14.916
on the whole has the strongest protection of free

790
00:55:14.926 --> 00:55:18.716
speech. Certainly that's true for speech in the public

791
00:55:18.726 --> 00:55:23.686
policy realm, more protection for defamation about public officials,

792
00:55:23.696 --> 00:55:27.335
more protection for hate speech, more protection for extremist

793
00:55:27.345 --> 00:55:30.125
speech. Uh But my friends in other countries are

794
00:55:30.135 --> 00:55:34.456
mocking me about our censoriousness when it comes to

795
00:55:34.466 --> 00:55:36.315
sexuality or the human body.

796
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.629
Yeah, I live in here in Europe and I

797
00:55:39.639 --> 00:55:44.679
can confirm that. So. Uh OK, so I think

798
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:46.850
that this would be a great point for us

799
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.310
to wrap up the interview one. And again, the

800
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.310
book is defending pornography, free speech, sex and the

801
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.610
Fight for women's rights. There, it is again, uh

802
00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.909
nothing apart from the book. Would you just like

803
00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:02.750
to tell people again where they can find you

804
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.469
and your work on the internet?

805
00:56:05.649 --> 00:56:09.719
I eschew social media. But I do have a

806
00:56:09.959 --> 00:56:14.060
uh profile at the New York law school website

807
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.989
uh where you can find uh a lot of

808
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.540
materials including footnotes for my recent books and several

809
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.560
and a whole list of all of my other

810
00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:27.870
publications and I do answer emails and my email

811
00:56:27.879 --> 00:56:29.949
address is also on that website.

812
00:56:31.199 --> 00:56:34.729
Great. So thank you so much again for coming

815
00:56:38.949 --> 00:56:42.689
very informative and fun conversation. So, thank you so

816
00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:43.060
much.

817
00:56:43.439 --> 00:56:45.800
Thank you so much, Ricardo. I look forward to

818
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.179
