00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.650
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob. And

3
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.329
today I'm joined by Doctor Patrick Hassan. He is

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.810
a lecturer at the School of English Communication and

5
00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.720
Philosophy at Cardiff University in the UK. His primary

6
00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.309
areas of interest are moral and existential philosophy. And

7
00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:22.809
today we're focusing on his book, Nietzsche's Struggle Against

8
00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.790
pessimism. So, Doctor Hassan, welcome to the show, it's

9
00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.010
a big pleasure to have everyone.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.020
It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.510
having me.

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.900
So let's start perhaps with this. Uh What is

13
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.509
pessimism? I mean, when philosophers specifically talk about pessimism,

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.439
what, what are they exactly referring to? When is

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.900
there just one type of pessimism or are there

16
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.770
varieties of pessimism?

17
00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:52.209
Good. Yeah. So I think it's really important to,

18
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.529
to distinguish as you just did between how we

19
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.810
might use this term colloquially and how philosophers use

20
00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.970
this term, right? So, um outside of academic philosophy,

21
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.910
when people talk about pessimism, they usually mean something

22
00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:08.970
like it's a psychological disposition to maybe expect the

23
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.440
worst, the worst to happen or to see the

24
00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:15.830
glass half empty as it were. Um But in

25
00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.250
philosophy, pessimism, it, it can be used in a

26
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.440
variety of different ways, but it tends to be

27
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.629
the view that life is not worth living or

28
00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:30.519
that nonexistence is preferable to existence. And this might

29
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:33.580
be because whichever things we find to be the

30
00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:37.080
most valuable, like our, our ultimate values, values, which

31
00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:41.400
give us meaning and direction, which demand responses from

32
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.690
us. These things are unrealizable or, or unreachable. Um

33
00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.029
So I think that's the definition which most people

34
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.730
have in mind in, in philosophy, when they talk

35
00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.819
about pessimism. Um It's certainly the definition which became

36
00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:00.440
the de facto definition of pessimism in the 19th

37
00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:02.440
century, which we'll, we'll talk a lot about today,

38
00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:06.029
I'm sure. Um But yes, it i it probably

39
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.610
is, is appropriate to just say that there are

40
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:12.630
like a lot of philosophical terms, pessimism can be

41
00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.580
used to refer to a few different views. Um

42
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:20.029
So this might be, for example, a historical thesis

43
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.860
that is just a claim that um contemporary culture

44
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.929
has fallen from some golden age or some ideal

45
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380
of humanity. Um So it was again in the

46
00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.839
19th century, quite popular to think that the ancient

47
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.979
Greeks in the fifth century was the pinnacle of

48
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.660
human culture and society and creativity. Um All the

49
00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:45.360
Italian renaissance. Uh And that since then, we've degenerated

50
00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.850
and declined in various ways in, in political, moral,

51
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.699
aesthetic domains. OK. So that, that's one version of

52
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.779
pessimism is a historical claim that uh we've fallen

53
00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.979
from some ideal. And again, there's stronger versions of

54
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.809
that too. So maybe the, the AAA claim about

55
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.809
the future that we will continue to decline or

56
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.229
degenerate in some way. And you see versions of

57
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.070
this in a lot of contemporary discourse outside of

58
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.850
academia that um for systemic reasons, perhaps there will

59
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.899
be political catastrophe. Uh You see this in discussions

60
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.130
of nuclear deterrence, for example, um political catastrophe with

61
00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.979
ongoing wars over resources, environmental catastrophe uh in climate

62
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.360
change debates. So uh this kind of doomsayer predictive

63
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.880
pessimism is, is again a kind of um view

64
00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.830
where the label pessimism might get used. Um Another

65
00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.160
version might be the a modal claim which is

66
00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.940
just the inversion of the Leibniz and claim that

67
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.240
this is the best of all possible worlds, right?

68
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.169
And actually, some pessimists have defended a view like

69
00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.320
this, that this is not just a, a bad

70
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.839
world, but it's the worst of all possible worlds,

71
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.039
right? Um So Schopenhauer, someone who we're gonna talk

72
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.289
about probably in quite some detail. Um HAS it

73
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.600
at least in one place in the second volume

74
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.559
of his major work, the world has won representation

75
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.619
offers us kind of inverted fine tuning argument for

76
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.600
this view that this world is as bad as

77
00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:23.149
it possibly could be if it was to exist

78
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.670
at all because of the the delicate nature of

79
00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:29.640
the elements which which um give rise to life.

80
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.890
So that could also be described as pessimism. But

81
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.200
Id, I do think that the primary position which

82
00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:38.390
people have in mind in philosophy, when they're talking

83
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.679
about pessimism and which has generated most of the

84
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.429
dispute has been this evaluative claim that life is

85
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.200
not worth living um that the, the values that

86
00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:54.279
we endorse are unrealizable and so nonexistence is preferable

87
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.200
to existence.

88
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.920
Mhm There, there are many interesting ideas there and

89
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.230
uh let me just comment that for example, when

90
00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:04.279
it comes to the political side of things, as

91
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.170
you mentioned briefly there. Yeah. Uh ON social media

92
00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:11.950
and elsewhere, nowadays, we see a lot of discourse

93
00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.804
particularly from people on the right wing, but sometimes

94
00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.464
also people on the left wing, the more traditionalist

95
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:23.644
primitive types, uh sometimes even wanting to go back

96
00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:27.355
to the Roman Empire, not just the Rens, but

97
00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:30.954
even the Roman Empire and saying that we particularly

98
00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.755
in the West are all a bunch of the

99
00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.904
gens. But

100
00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:35.765
you're right. Yeah.

101
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:40.119
Yeah. Yeah. And then uh I mean, I, I

102
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.869
guess that one thing that we might come back

103
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.079
to later uh is that, I mean, uh it's

104
00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.269
interesting because when it comes to pessimism, sometimes people

105
00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.010
are referring to life or existence itself. But other

106
00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:59.890
times like in those particular political examples, they are

107
00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:05.220
referring more to particular kinds of cultural and social

108
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.649
trends and not exactly about life as it is,

109
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.700
let's say. Yeah,

110
00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.059
I think that's a good distinction. So um yeah,

111
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.450
some of the most of the debates about pessimism

112
00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:20.000
in, in philosophy, in particular, in the 19th century

113
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.059
were um focused upon this kind of much broader

114
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.619
pessimism about life itself about um existence as such

115
00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.709
and our, our relation to the world as individuals.

116
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.390
Um But I think you're right that there are

117
00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.859
these kind of more local versions of pessimism which

118
00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:44.700
are making claims about a particular um era, particular,

119
00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:50.440
particular kind of cultural um formation. Um And, and

120
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.820
I think that you're right, this has leaked into

121
00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:57.070
um contemporary discourse in the, in the so called

122
00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.859
cultural wars. Um I do think you find it

123
00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:02.049
on in, in both left wing circles and right

124
00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:05.109
wing circles, but um you're absolutely right that, yeah,

125
00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.929
there's a, there's a dominant trend within um yeah,

126
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.130
the particularly these right wing circles which harken back

127
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.480
to a kind of bygone age, a kind of

128
00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:19.640
an age where um our values were realized and

129
00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.579
that we may or may not be able to

130
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:25.809
recapture um in some way. But um yes, that

131
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.480
could be the Roman Empire that could be sort

132
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:30.660
of some period in the middle ages. It does

133
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.829
vary depending upon one's one's values. But I mean,

134
00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.019
the, the precedent is set for that by figures

135
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.130
in the 19th century, um particularly those like um

136
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.179
Jacob Burkhardt, um Bach Hoven as well who were

137
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.109
at Basel and were big influences upon Nietzsche who

138
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:50.309
will come to talk about. Um So not just

139
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.390
in, in the academic domain but also in the

140
00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.769
the cultural domain there. I mean, this is this

141
00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.910
kind of historical or cultural pessimism is running through

142
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.200
uh a lot of Wagner and, and other cultural

143
00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.570
figures and artistic figures that had a profound influence

144
00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:08.070
uh and still have a profound influence on, on

145
00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.029
European thought.

146
00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.600
So we're going to focus for obvious reasons on

147
00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:15.989
the 19th century here today because it's the century

148
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that Nietzsche lived in and uh his major influences,

149
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.799
let's say, but do we know how old pessimism

150
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:29.440
is in intellectual history? And of course, we're focusing

151
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.659
here on Western intellectual history.

152
00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.078
Yeah, that's a good question. So, um there are

153
00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:40.837
elements of what we would consider pessimistic thought. Um

154
00:08:40.847 --> 00:08:42.587
YOU know, as a, as far back as the

155
00:08:42.597 --> 00:08:48.320
sort of third century BC. Um So, uh Heus

156
00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:53.869
of Cyrene uh was a philosopher who is reported

157
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.619
to have pessimistic views um or at least elements

158
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.510
of, of what we recognize as pessimism um in

159
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.200
the middle ages. Uh You find uh even outside

160
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.599
of, of the Western tradition, you find um Sufi

161
00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:14.000
poets in the Islamic world like Omar Khayyam, um

162
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.849
Alma Ari have views which reflect the kinds of

163
00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:21.210
positions which those like Schopenhauer are developing in, in

164
00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:27.900
more sort of philosophically rigorous ways. Um And you

165
00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:30.369
will also find pessimistic thought. And again, this is

166
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.219
something Copen tries to draw attention to. You'll also

167
00:09:33.229 --> 00:09:37.820
find strands of pessimistic thought, not necessarily in philosophers

168
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.359
but in poets um in, in the vast literature

169
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:45.679
produced by um uh those in, in, in the

170
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.989
western tradition, also in, in various religious traditions as

171
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.679
well. So famously, Schopenhauer thinks that, you know, pessimism

172
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.880
is not a new thing at all. What he's

173
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.770
trying to, to capture philosophically is a sentiment or

174
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.419
a at least a hunch that there's something about

175
00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:07.510
the world which we should be regretting rather than

176
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.840
celebrating. And he finds that, you know, entertained in

177
00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:15.669
the world's great religions. So early Christianity, in particular,

178
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:19.440
the early church fathers, he reads Augustine as having

179
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.409
a kind of pessimistic outlook. Um BUT also in

180
00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:27.059
non western traditions, most famously Buddhism, um he looks

181
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.750
at Buddhism and, and, and sees the seeds for

182
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.820
pessimistic thought that he's trying to draw out in

183
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.289
a more philosophically robust manner. Um And as we,

184
00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:37.710
we'll probably talk about as well. I mean, a

185
00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:40.739
lot of these later pessimists also looked back to

186
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.890
Socrates, right, controversially as a developer of this kind

187
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.070
of pessimistic outlook, um as someone who thought of

188
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.729
the material world as something that we need to

189
00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:54.039
be saved from, we need to be liberated from

190
00:10:54.049 --> 00:11:00.419
in some way. So there are um yeah, intellectual

191
00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:04.320
predecessors to pessimism as a philosophy, but it really

192
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.159
comes to fruition as a, as a matter for

193
00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:11.320
philosophers to dispute um in the 19th century

194
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.380
and why the 19th century exactly? I mean, were

195
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.239
there a specific circumstances back then? And I'm not

196
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.510
talking about any specific kind of circumstances. It could

197
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.489
have been social, political or simply intellectual. It could

198
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.090
have been just in the intellectual realm for some

199
00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:34.479
reason that led to the rise of pessimism in

200
00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:35.840
two centuries ago.

201
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.469
Yeah, that, that's a really good question. And then

202
00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:42.799
of course, it's, it's, there's no uncontroversial answer to

203
00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:44.979
that. So let me, let me make a distinction

204
00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:48.780
here. So, uh at the time and I think

205
00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:52.880
still today, um there is a view that look

206
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.950
pessimism as a philosophy is really a product of

207
00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.510
the social and economic circumstances of the 19th century.

208
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.919
In Germany, the turmoil, the political turmoil um in

209
00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:10.830
terms of internal revolutions, the attempt for unification of,

210
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.140
of the German states wars with, with surrounding countries,

211
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.640
um cholera epidemics, economic crashes failure, the failure of

212
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.090
kind of the previous enlightenment, optimism that really we

213
00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:26.830
could unite everyone and we could improve people's lives

214
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.820
significantly. Um A lot of people have pointed to

215
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:35.200
those, those facts and thought. Well, it's, it's not

216
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.520
a coincidence that philosophical pessimism begins to be popular

217
00:12:39.729 --> 00:12:42.440
and begins to spread throughout society, not just at

218
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.789
the academic level, but throughout society begins to be

219
00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:50.140
entertained and endorsed. At the same time as these,

220
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.760
these events. It's a little bit too coincidental. So

221
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.380
there has been at the time and still today,

222
00:12:55.489 --> 00:12:59.390
an attempt to reduce philosophical pessimism to really just

223
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.880
a symptom of the social circumstances. I'm happy to

224
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.380
go into a bit more detail about this, but

225
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.929
I feel like that, that that's a little bit

226
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.219
too simplistic. Um I think that the story has

227
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:13.210
to be a little bit more complicated than that.

228
00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:18.590
Um There were features of the 19th century which

229
00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:21.239
were remarkably uh which gave ri rise to a

230
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.049
lot of hope with people in Germany in the

231
00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:25.830
19th century. The again, the uni final unification of

232
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.210
the of, of Germany as a state in the

233
00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:32.229
18 seventies, huge scientific advances. So I think the

234
00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:34.049
story is gonna be a little bit more complicated

235
00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:37.469
there. And Nietzsche definitely weighs in on this. I

236
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:41.280
think what's more interesting is the intellectual circumstances which

237
00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:45.059
give rise to pessimism, right? So what you've got

238
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.820
happening in the 19th century following on from, from

239
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.590
the the latter half of the 18th century, where

240
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:56.770
people start openly challenging arguments for the existence of

241
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.820
God and the place of religious institutions um in

242
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.130
society, right? So you had human cans pretty devastating

243
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.679
critiques of the traditional arguments for the existence of

244
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.510
God and of metaphysical speculation more broadly, right? That

245
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.710
is speculation about unconditioned reality, that reality is not

246
00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:22.010
filtered through our experiences, skepticism about if, if we

247
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.750
can have any kind of knowledge of, of those

248
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.979
matters, you had also the explosion of progress in

249
00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:30.590
the empirical sciences and the and the the growth

250
00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:32.820
of interest in materialism, which is one of the

251
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.940
the greatest philosophical disputes in the 19th century was

252
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.239
over materialism, this idea that everything could be explained

253
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:44.030
in terms of physical matter um that had implications

254
00:14:44.039 --> 00:14:48.469
for how we might be able to deflate or,

255
00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:53.020
or give reductionist accounts of things like the, the

256
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.429
soul of free will of morality, God, all of

257
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.450
these other things which we might have anchored our

258
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.679
sense of meaning or value in um these, these

259
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.130
kinds of things begin to affect people's consciousness. Um

260
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.190
And really challenge where we get our values from.

261
00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:19.159
Um So, not only just the the explosion of

262
00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.549
progress in the empirical sciences and the the um

263
00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:26.609
the the criticism of the exist uh the arguments

264
00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:30.159
of the existence of God, but also you have

265
00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:32.770
the development of anthropology as well, right? So the

266
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.299
discovery of massive cultural difference, which again, I think

267
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:41.669
started to um become apparent in the 18th century

268
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:44.270
and just continued on to the 19th century discovery

269
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.940
of different cultural practices, which m which started to

270
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.719
shape this idea that the values we have here

271
00:15:49.729 --> 00:15:53.049
in, in Europe or in, in northern Europe specifically

272
00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:56.400
might not be the correct ones. Um They might

273
00:15:56.409 --> 00:15:59.539
not be as so safe and secure as we

274
00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:02.330
thought, there's all this diversity of, of belief in,

275
00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:06.330
of beliefs and values, what accounts for that? Um

276
00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:09.359
And then of course, you also had the development

277
00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:15.250
of philological investigations into the nature of scripture, right,

278
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.030
in investigating texts like the Bible as natural phenomenon,

279
00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:25.030
not as these divinely inspired um gifts from God,

280
00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:30.690
but rather as um sort of a mismatch of

281
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.950
different traditions, often contradictory very human texts. Um And

282
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.419
then lastly, of course, and certainly not least the

283
00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:45.210
development and um propagation of Darwinian evolution, right, which

284
00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:47.750
had profound effects in m in multiple ways, right?

285
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.429
Not only that we could explain the origins and

286
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.409
complexities and apparent um purposes in nature without appeal

287
00:16:56.419 --> 00:17:01.510
to a divine creator, but also just the pervasiveness

288
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.829
um and systematic nature of suffering in the animal

289
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.209
kingdom which humanity was then placed into not as

290
00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:12.010
something special, um not as something which has been

291
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.420
given Dominion over life, but actually just as one

292
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.089
species among others. So I think that all of

293
00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.939
this contributes to an intellectual context which starts to

294
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.848
provoke people into thinking, OK, well, if these are

295
00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:26.930
the things we value, how have we come to

296
00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:29.880
value them? And are they actually reachable? Are they

297
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.400
actually something that we can genuinely obtain? We've, as

298
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.479
we've sort of sort of assumed that whatever we

299
00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:38.280
think is good and right in the world we

300
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.229
can have. Um BUT people I think start challenging

301
00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:44.910
that in this intellectual context. And I think one

302
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.989
fruitful way of um having a general gloss on

303
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.760
this, which has been entertained by some, some people

304
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.489
in the secondary literature is that pessimism as people

305
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.329
like Schopenhauer developed, it was almost a reconfiguration of

306
00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:02.770
the traditional problem of evil, right? So it's no

307
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.849
longer how could the world be so full of

308
00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:08.310
suffering, um, and have a, have a kind of

309
00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.949
all powerful and, and, and good God to, to

310
00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:13.900
allow this to happen. But more how could there

311
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.410
ever be value or how could be anything good?

312
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.079
Right, in a world which is so violent and,

313
00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:24.760
and, and so, um, seemingly hostile to our human

314
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.550
interests. So, I think that might be one kind

315
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.329
of nice general way of framing this as a

316
00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:32.910
kind of secularization of a traditional um problem problem

317
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.709
of the Odyssey.

318
00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:37.829
Mhm. And of course, we're focusing here mostly on

319
00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:40.969
the intellectual side of things. But you also mentioned

320
00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:43.520
at a certain point, there are possibly some of

321
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.199
the social and economic circumstances having played the role

322
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:50.140
back then. And of course, I would imagine that

323
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.410
if they haven't played any role at all, it

324
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.770
would be very weird because it's not that ideas

325
00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.390
pop out of nowhere, right? I mean, people live

326
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.052
in a particular social, political economic context and so

327
00:19:04.062 --> 00:19:07.192
on. And, and also I would imagine that another

328
00:19:07.203 --> 00:19:10.603
factor that would have played the role and would

329
00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:15.723
also help explain why it was specific philosophers having

330
00:19:15.733 --> 00:19:20.103
this tendency toward pessimism. And this is probably a

331
00:19:20.113 --> 00:19:23.322
point that Nietzsche would be happy to engage with

332
00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:27.093
is that they have their own psychological predispositions as

333
00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:30.255
well, right? I mean, shop and our uh if

334
00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:34.296
I remember his family history correctly, even at several

335
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:39.095
ancestors who themselves committed suicide. So even from a

336
00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:43.186
clinical psychology slash psychiatric perspective. I guess that he

337
00:19:43.196 --> 00:19:48.306
probably was already a little bit innately predisposed toward,

338
00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:51.635
uh, pessimism. I mean, that, that's just a comment.

339
00:19:51.645 --> 00:19:52.666
But anyway.

340
00:19:52.806 --> 00:19:54.816
Sure. Sure. And, yeah, and I think this is,

341
00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:57.786
um, you're absolutely right that this was certainly a,

342
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.949
uh, a popular way of trying to understand why

343
00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:06.939
this deeply provocative and counterintuitive view came to such

344
00:20:06.949 --> 00:20:10.560
prominence. Um, YOU start thinking, ok. Well, if this

345
00:20:10.569 --> 00:20:12.479
is, this is very, this is a very strange

346
00:20:12.489 --> 00:20:15.479
view. How could this have been produced? What kind

347
00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:18.729
of psychology leads to this kind of view? Um

348
00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:23.619
And particularly 19th century and since then, where there

349
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.449
is a kind of, there's a tendency to psychologize

350
00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:28.900
and even pathologize a lot of our beliefs and

351
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.709
values. This was particularly pronounced in the case of

352
00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:35.550
pessimism. And if and even other pessimists did this

353
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.199
to Schopenhauer, they thought, wait a minute. Um This

354
00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:41.219
is a, this is a guy that um clearly

355
00:20:41.229 --> 00:20:46.489
has some kind of um you know, deep deeper

356
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.689
neurosis or even pathological brain disorder or something like

357
00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:52.630
this. And this is what's leading him to have

358
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.859
these views. Um And his, even his style of

359
00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:58.849
writing that you would claim gives a way that

360
00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:03.209
he was more um motivated by these, yeah, by

361
00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:07.160
personal resentment or uh you know, towards, towards, for

362
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.959
his mother, for example, who he had a very

363
00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:13.300
kind of tense relationship with um his resentment towards

364
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.260
maybe, yes, his, his father who who most likely

365
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.560
committed suicide. Um These were thought to explain why

366
00:21:21.569 --> 00:21:26.060
he had these pessimistic views. Um And, and also

367
00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:29.020
the social circumstances, but Schopenhauer was aware of this

368
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.229
though and he, he tried to get ahead of

369
00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:36.630
that by uh formulating particular arguments that he thought

370
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.829
would force people to rationally engage with. Um And

371
00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:44.310
again, he writes a letter to one of his,

372
00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:47.420
one of his uh close friends towards the end

373
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.040
of his career where he attacks um Ko Fischer's

374
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.099
history of philosophy where Fisher tries to say that.

375
00:21:55.109 --> 00:21:58.119
Well, Schopenhauer's philosophy, his pessimism is really a product

376
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.699
of its time. Um You know, if he lived

377
00:22:00.709 --> 00:22:02.630
a few centuries earlier, he would have, he would

378
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.150
have been an optimist and Schopenhauer Ridic ridicules this

379
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.920
and he's very angry and he says, you know,

380
00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:10.219
this person really does believe that if I was

381
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:13.219
born sort of 40 years earlier, I'd be alive,

382
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.599
NZ and optimist. Um YOU know, this is, this

383
00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:19.589
is how ridiculous uh the influence of Hegel's philosophy

384
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:23.839
can be on people, right? Um And uh and

385
00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:25.829
he, he even gives reason. He says, look, uh

386
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.170
the time that I was writing was actually one

387
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.310
of optimism, it was one of hope. Um And

388
00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:34.560
yet still I offered AAA reasoned account for um

389
00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:37.130
his world view. So, yeah, I, I perhaps we'll

390
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.640
come on to this later when we talk about

391
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.949
Nietzsche. But um certainly, uh there is, there was

392
00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:44.130
a tendency and I think there still is a

393
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.959
tendency to psychologize or, or pathologize um individual pessimists.

394
00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:53.040
Um And what is motivating them to defend this

395
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.109
provocative view.

396
00:22:54.569 --> 00:22:57.089
So let's get into Nietzsche then and since we're

397
00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:01.910
talking about pessimism here specifically, when did Nietzsche first

398
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.630
engage with pessimism philosophically?

399
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.140
Good? Yeah. So I think he starts engaging with

400
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.329
pessimism really in the 18 sixties when he becomes

401
00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:16.010
aware of Schopenhauer. And he, he really becomes obsessed

402
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.060
with Schopenhauer. He sits down with the, with the

403
00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:21.469
world as one of representation and, and devours this

404
00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:25.550
text and, and really becomes an, an ardent schopenhauerian.

405
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.579
I wouldn't say a wholly uncritical schopen Harian because

406
00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:32.520
there he writes a short essay in 1868 called

407
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.430
on Schopenhauer, where he gives some pretty sophisticated criticisms

408
00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:39.250
of his metaphysics, but he certainly is, is thinks

409
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.989
of himself as a Schopen Harian and intends to

410
00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:47.290
develop connections with other people uh interested in Schopenhauer

411
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.750
and even to sort of propagate Schopenhauerian philosophy. Um

412
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.869
And so he becomes exposed to, to pessimism there

413
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.079
for the first time, he becomes sympathetic to it.

414
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:04.280
Um He reads eventually other pessimists um like Eduard

415
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.469
Von Hartmann, uh who was the, the probably the

416
00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:11.140
most famous pessimist during the pessimism dispute, the pessimist

417
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.180
must strike of the, from 1860 to 1900. Mhm.

418
00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:19.660
Um And so he becomes, he, I think Nietzsche

419
00:24:19.729 --> 00:24:24.319
is sympathetic to, to pessimism. He's concerned about its

420
00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:26.900
implications. And I think that when he comes to

421
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:32.420
write the birth of tragedy in 1872. Um He

422
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.599
really does believe the descriptive component of, of Schopenhauer's

423
00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:39.300
world view, namely that suffering is ubiquitous. And it's,

424
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.619
it's simply naive to think that we can significantly

425
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.689
reduce suffering in the world. And he does think

426
00:24:46.699 --> 00:24:50.530
that if one seriously believes this, um one will

427
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.410
be led to the, the view that life is

428
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.969
not worth living, but it would be better if

429
00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:56.660
we were just not born in the first place.

430
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.160
And like Schopenhauer, he sees elements of this entertained

431
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.260
by the writers of Greek tragedy, right? Eur Euripides

432
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:10.020
Sophocles. Um AND he's very concerned with in, in

433
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.890
his early philosophy, he's very concerned with the implications

434
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.099
of pessimism, right? What would, what would happen, what

435
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:20.579
would be the consequences if we were to look

436
00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:23.750
honestly and deeply at the world um and see

437
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.619
its suffering. And one of the things he thinks

438
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.609
will happen is this danger of, of what he

439
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:33.729
calls quietism. And this was, this was already a

440
00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:37.030
debate during a pessimism dispute that pessimism would lead

441
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.479
to a kind of resignation or withdrawal from the

442
00:25:39.489 --> 00:25:42.270
world. A complete lack of interest in trying to

443
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.709
improve people's lives. So what you'd get is a

444
00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:50.430
kind of unacceptable level of um conservative inertia, right?

445
00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:52.520
Where you, there's just no point in trying to

446
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.780
improve anything. It's a kind of worst kind of

447
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.920
apology for the status quo. This was the in

448
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.050
the social domain. What a lot of people worried

449
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.410
about pessimism. Um Nietzsche has a slightly different take

450
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.420
on that. He's worried about quietism, but it's not

451
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.209
from any moral position. He's not worried about, you

452
00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:14.699
know, how, how this would prevent improving people's lives

453
00:26:14.709 --> 00:26:17.530
and caring for the poor, but rather it would

454
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.089
be a kind of existential paralysis. People would be

455
00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:26.030
gripped by the horror of existence and negate from

456
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.829
this world. They would, they would turn away from

457
00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:29.219
it. They would have this kind of what he

458
00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:32.170
calls a Buddha like denial of the will. They'd

459
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.280
be like Hamlet, they'd stare at the world in

460
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.459
horror and be paralyzed. Um That's what he's concerned

461
00:26:38.469 --> 00:26:40.729
about. And I think his, in his early work

462
00:26:40.739 --> 00:26:42.699
and the birth of tragedy is really an attempt

463
00:26:42.709 --> 00:26:47.530
to find some way of resisting that implication.

464
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.989
Right? Mhm. But could we say that Nietzsche was

465
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.819
a pessimist himself in any way, or at least

466
00:26:56.829 --> 00:27:01.300
that he had a pessimistic phase in his intellectual

467
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.699
life?

468
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.689
I think it would be fair um to say

469
00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:08.390
that he, in his early phase, he was a

470
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.260
pessimist. And I think this is the sort of

471
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.189
dominant view in the secondary literature as well that,

472
00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:16.719
that schopen Harian themes and, and particularly his pessimism

473
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.069
is a sort of fundamental assumption or presupposition of

474
00:27:21.079 --> 00:27:24.800
the birth of tragedy. Um And he does accept

475
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.540
this idea that suffering is ubiquitous and that this

476
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.329
has profound implications for the value of life. And

477
00:27:30.339 --> 00:27:32.859
he takes it to be a truth. Right? Pessimism

478
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:36.939
to be a, something that is verifiable. Ok. And

479
00:27:36.949 --> 00:27:38.920
that's a, that's a key point I think of

480
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:39.729
his early. So

481
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.579
at least with the premises he agrees with.

482
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.449
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But at the same

483
00:27:46.459 --> 00:27:50.050
time I think that he is in some way

484
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.170
still trying to resist pessimism. Right. And, and the

485
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.510
way you could cash that out is to say

486
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.079
it's really the implications of it, which he thinks

487
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.819
um are quite literally life threatening, right? If you

488
00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:06.339
take this view seriously, um there is a, a,

489
00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:10.349
a big existential price to pay. Um And he's

490
00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:12.750
trying to figure out if there's some kind of,

491
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.989
has there been any way of resisting the implications

492
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.619
of this? And of course, he's looking to ancient

493
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:25.150
Greek tragedy as something quite peculiar and spectacular. Um

494
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.089
A sort of healthy way of looking at life,

495
00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:30.109
not through turning away and pretending that there's no

496
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.680
suffering, but by staring it in the face and

497
00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:39.420
then somehow channel channeling the um energy or the

498
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:44.869
sort of affirmative affect um dispositions that the, the,

499
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.890
the ancient Greeks were able to channel um through

500
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.400
witnessing all of this suffering and, and, and perceiving

501
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.599
it in this, in this certain kind of artistic

502
00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:56.979
way. He's wondering if there's any way that that

503
00:28:56.989 --> 00:29:00.410
could be recaptured um in his modern day for

504
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.790
the contemporary Europeans um of his day. Um And

505
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.449
again, that's part of what the project of the

506
00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.380
birth of tragedy is, is really to try and

507
00:29:07.729 --> 00:29:10.479
trying to recapture that um if possible

508
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.619
recapturing some of the Dion Asian spirit. Right.

509
00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:18.640
Exactly. Yes. And he uses this kind of, he

510
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.410
has this rapturous tone where he's using this terminology

511
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.079
which of course horrified um his fellow academics in

512
00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:28.660
philology who are expecting a very kind of dry

513
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.719
and boring uh kind of strict analysis of Greek

514
00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:36.079
tragedy where instead they got this almost uh religious

515
00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:40.969
um sort of approach to uh uh to, to,

516
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.109
to the effects of Greek tragedy and this kind

517
00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:46.849
of cultural rejuvenation project that he's interested in, uh

518
00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:50.189
which really ruined his reputation among academic philologists. But

519
00:29:50.199 --> 00:29:54.189
um yeah, Nietzsche wasn't really concerned about that and

520
00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:58.829
he was, he was more concerned about how outside

521
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:04.550
of academic philosophy, um pessimism is a genuine concern,

522
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.510
right? It's not, it's not a problem that is

523
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.569
reserved for people studying in the university, lecture theaters

524
00:30:10.579 --> 00:30:14.170
and libraries, right? This is a cultural issue. Uh

525
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.420
And this brings out Nietzsche, not just as someone

526
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:21.069
who in my view can engage with the intellectual

527
00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:23.319
discourse of the age, but also someone who is

528
00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:27.030
deeply concerned with the he, he's a culture critic

529
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.560
at the end of the day, he's interested in

530
00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:32.250
how different cultural trends move in different directions and

531
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.479
for what reasons and, and importantly, the existential implications

532
00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:40.189
of those. And I think that that's right, he's

533
00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:43.880
looking at the Ancient Greeks and thinking what kind

534
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.729
of cultural circumstance, social circumstances produced this kind of

535
00:30:48.739 --> 00:30:52.750
healthy affirmative attitude towards life. How did they harness

536
00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.459
art to do that? And do we have any

537
00:30:55.469 --> 00:30:59.660
kind of cultural, um, apparatus to be able to

538
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.150
do that same thing today?

539
00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.290
Mhm. So, I would imagine. And that's something that

540
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.089
you actually go through in the book that over

541
00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:13.199
the course of his intellectual life, Nietzsche, it changed

542
00:31:13.209 --> 00:31:16.189
a little bit over time, the views that he

543
00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:19.849
had on pessimism, right? So, uh but at the

544
00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:24.729
very beginning when he started engaging with pessimism, what

545
00:31:24.739 --> 00:31:28.790
were perhaps the main questions he grappled with? So

546
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.640
we've already established here that at least with some

547
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.949
of its premises he agreed with. But then what

548
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:39.010
did they think were the most important questions to

549
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.339
address regarding the possible consequences of pessimism?

550
00:31:44.579 --> 00:31:46.979
Yeah. Good question. So I, I think that um

551
00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:50.099
I in my view in that early period in

552
00:31:50.109 --> 00:31:55.630
the birth of tragedy, um he's really interested in

553
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.790
trying to map out the possible responses to honest

554
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.739
reflections upon uh uh upon the world about the

555
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.229
nature of reality. So I, I should say as

556
00:32:05.239 --> 00:32:07.359
well just to make this the context uh for

557
00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:12.800
just to make this context more uh comprehensible, he's

558
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.790
responding to pessimism in its most popular hedonic form,

559
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.750
right? So it's all about suffering, right? The ubiquity

560
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.510
of suffering, whether that is in principle reducible, um

561
00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:28.920
uh what kind of interpretations we could give to

562
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.349
suffering, to give it some kind of meaning both

563
00:32:31.359 --> 00:32:33.630
of these questions I think he's interested in, right?

564
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:37.229
So just to clarify in its sed donic form,

565
00:32:37.239 --> 00:32:41.520
then that means that if people who, who espouse

566
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.660
that kind of view would perhaps think that life

567
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.880
would be, would be good or worth living if

568
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:54.849
it was mostly or just about pleasure, happiness or

569
00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:56.180
something along those lines.

570
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.250
That's right. Yeah. So th this is the form

571
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.150
which I think dominates the pessimism dispute is that

572
00:33:01.239 --> 00:33:05.229
um life would be worth living if pleasure was

573
00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:09.939
some or satisfaction of desires, perhaps was something lasting

574
00:33:09.949 --> 00:33:13.670
and achievable and something which outweighed the, the pain

575
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.000
and suffering which we experience. But for systematic reasons,

576
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.540
the pessimists argue that's just not possible, right? We're

577
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.979
always left in a, in a hedonic deficit where

578
00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:25.619
where there's just suffering and pleasure can never in

579
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:32.140
principle outweigh it. Um And Nietzsche, it is because

580
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.859
that was such that was the dominant view in

581
00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:36.150
the dispute. He's taking that as his starting point,

582
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.750
I think. Um But he's also interested in the

583
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.949
question of what kind of meaning we give to

584
00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:43.060
suffering, right? Can we conceive of it, of having

585
00:33:43.069 --> 00:33:47.500
some kind of um purpose that we maybe even

586
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.750
just project to it some kind of narrative we

587
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.150
can give for our struggles. I think that that's

588
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.619
very prominent in his later work, but it it's

589
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.560
still there in his early work. But um yes,

590
00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.920
so for Nietzsche, the primary questions, I think he's

591
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:05.060
interested in the birth of tragedy are what are

592
00:34:05.069 --> 00:34:07.930
the implications of honestly looking at the world, seeing

593
00:34:07.939 --> 00:34:11.918
the ubiquity of suffering, the pervasiveness of suffering. Um

594
00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:14.688
What are the implications of that? And he starts

595
00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.429
off by saying that, you know, there's a number

596
00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:19.739
of possible responses people could have to this, right?

597
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.290
They're not all gonna be, they might initially take

598
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.050
their Hamlet's view of things, right? And be paralyzed

599
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.810
with horror and disgust at the world. Um But

600
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.260
there are a few different ways of, of responding

601
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.520
to this like one for that he, he entertains.

602
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.080
Um IS this idea that people would be so

603
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:45.159
horrified that they would commit suicide or even perhaps

604
00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:48.830
um kill other people out of mercy, right? And

605
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.840
he talks about this, it's this passage where he

606
00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.040
talks about the people would strangle others out of,

607
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.719
out of, you know, their family members and friends

608
00:34:55.728 --> 00:34:57.419
out of mercy because they wouldn't want to put

609
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.159
them through the misery of life. You know, he

610
00:34:59.169 --> 00:35:01.540
talks about how the Fiji Islanders do this and

611
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.070
it actually recurs in his notebooks as well. He

612
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.439
must have read some anthropological note about it, but

613
00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:10.719
this is perhaps one response to pessimism is suicide

614
00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:14.060
or perhaps even killing other people. Um And I

615
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.459
think that this is actually a reference to Edward

616
00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:21.669
Von Hartmann who thought that ultimately, the later down

617
00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:23.270
the line, there would be a kind of what

618
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.989
he calls a cosmic universal negation of the will

619
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.850
where there would just be a collective resignation from

620
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.949
life, a kind of ceasing of life um refusal

621
00:35:32.959 --> 00:35:35.510
to, to reproduce the end of humanity as we

622
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.060
know it. So that, that's one thing that I

623
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.070
think Nietzsche think there's a possibility if people start

624
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.590
to take pessimism seriously. Um But the one that

625
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.110
really interests him and the one that he thinks

626
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.540
is culturally embedded is quietism, right? This, this idea

627
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.580
that one would re just refrain from engaging with,

628
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.090
with life at all. One would turn against their,

629
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.810
their dispositions for, you know, uh desires for sex,

630
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.830
for food, all of our fundamental desires, one would

631
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:16.139
see them as um sort of lacking any value

632
00:36:16.149 --> 00:36:20.030
but almost evil, right? Producing suffering.

633
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:24.939
This quietism connect in any way to asceticism.

634
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.780
Y Yes, I think it does for Nietzsche. Yes.

635
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:33.620
So quietism um is the the practical form of

636
00:36:33.629 --> 00:36:36.270
that the practical manifestation of this kind of disposition

637
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.479
is to cease indulging in your most fundamental dispositions

638
00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:45.159
or as as Nietzsche call it later hit their

639
00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:49.199
drives, right? So an aesthetic is someone who feels

640
00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:51.550
enlightened by their knowledge of the world. And as

641
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.949
a result, their practical response is to do things

642
00:36:54.959 --> 00:36:58.229
like fasting, to abstain from what they see as

643
00:36:58.239 --> 00:36:59.699
the cause of their suffering,

644
00:36:59.709 --> 00:37:03.209
a kind of behaviors that basically we would see

645
00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:05.600
among monks and people like that.

646
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.760
Yes, generally. Yeah. And, and, and also Nietzsche shares

647
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:12.550
schopenhauer's diagnosis of Buddhism as advocating this as a

648
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.620
kind of pessimistic view, which sees asceticism as a

649
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.060
um a, a positive thing, which is the result

650
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.729
of a profound insight, an appropriate practical response, but

651
00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:27.040
they obviously just have a very different evaluation of

652
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:31.689
that, right? Um So, so Nietzsche's primary concern, I

653
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:36.139
think is how to try and avoid quietistic despair.

654
00:37:36.149 --> 00:37:38.949
And again, not, I think for the reasons that

655
00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:41.139
other people in the in the dispute were worried

656
00:37:41.149 --> 00:37:45.600
about quietism, namely as a moral or political problem,

657
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.780
right? Where people thought that this would actually be,

658
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.699
this would be an affront to morality uh because

659
00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:53.739
people would cease to engage in trying to improve

660
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.659
the lives of their, their peers and fellow citizens

661
00:37:56.669 --> 00:38:00.360
and fellow humans. Um Nietzsche doesn't seem all concerned

662
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.239
by that in the birth of tragedy, he's more

663
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:07.179
concerned that this would have profound existential implications for

664
00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:14.399
the individual and the implications for cultures broadly as

665
00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:17.439
being a culture of, of despair and and um

666
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.989
sort of uh yes resignation from from any endeavors

667
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.189
for creativity or anything like this. So he contrasts

668
00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:32.389
that kind of quietistic response with the want, the

669
00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:34.449
sort of what he calls a Socratic response, which

670
00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:36.780
would be, this reflects just a modern kind of

671
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.679
enlightenment view that actually suffering is an accidental feature

672
00:38:40.689 --> 00:38:43.070
of the world. And that with the right kind

673
00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.409
of development of scientific progress, social engineering, the use

674
00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:51.290
of technology, um good governance, we can eradicate most

675
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.030
forms of material suffering and improve people's lives. Um

676
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.290
There are a lot of people in the dispute

677
00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.330
who thought something like that. Um But Nietzsche thinks

678
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.969
that this is hopeless for schopen haren reasons. He

679
00:39:02.979 --> 00:39:05.820
thinks that it's futile to try and eradicate. Suffering

680
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:10.340
nature is intrinsically violent and unjust as he says,

681
00:39:10.649 --> 00:39:13.840
um And what you'll do, you'll maybe get rid

682
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.540
of one form of suffering over here, but it'll

683
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.300
just resurface as another form. Um And here's a

684
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.449
few, few arguments for that. But um he ultimately

685
00:39:22.459 --> 00:39:26.010
thinks that this Socratic sort of rationalistic attitude to

686
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.300
suffering is ultimately futile. So you're left either with

687
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:33.800
quietism ultimately or hopefully. And this is the, the

688
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.469
later parts of the text, some other alternative which

689
00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:42.379
tries to harness aesthetic experience and art in order

690
00:39:42.389 --> 00:39:49.679
to affect our, our dispositions or emotional dispositions towards

691
00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:52.939
the world to find suffering, not an objection to

692
00:39:52.949 --> 00:39:56.550
life, but something invigorating and life affirming. That's, that's

693
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.729
his the third option which he's hoping to um

694
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.209
give some credence to in the birth of tragedy.

695
00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:07.870
Mhm So uh a book of his that you

696
00:40:07.879 --> 00:40:11.149
get into in your own book is human, all

697
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:14.850
too human. So what kinds of arguments did they

698
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.500
develop there against pessimism? Why is this book so

699
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.830
important when it comes to understanding his approach to

700
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.570
pessimism?

701
00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:26.689
Yeah. So, II, I think that the human all

702
00:40:26.699 --> 00:40:29.520
too human in the pessimism in the context of

703
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:33.840
the pessimism dispute has been sort of unjustly overlooked

704
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.850
really in terms of its importance because there are

705
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.830
major changes there in Nietzsche's philosophical um position, which

706
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.270
have huge ramifications for how he thinks of the

707
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.139
attempts to evaluate life, generally, how we should think

708
00:40:47.149 --> 00:40:51.080
of suffering. Um What the role of science should

709
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.800
be, what the role of religion should be. Um

710
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.159
So he writes this book in 1878 and that,

711
00:40:56.169 --> 00:41:00.149
that's significant because it really, this is, he writes

712
00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:02.379
this at a time where he's really broken from

713
00:41:02.389 --> 00:41:08.270
his personal and philosophical allegiances to Wagner, who he

714
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.580
at one time shared a enthusiasm for Schopenhauer and

715
00:41:12.629 --> 00:41:15.429
Schopenhauer in worldview with. And he also, you know,

716
00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:20.550
venerated Wagner for his potential ability to rejuvenate German

717
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.520
culture in this affirmative way that he was describing

718
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.459
in the birth of tragedy. He gives that up

719
00:41:25.469 --> 00:41:29.360
in 1878. And what you find there, particularly in

720
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.899
the first book is a enthusiasm for the ability

721
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:38.189
of the empirical sciences to offer knowledge. Um AND

722
00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:43.270
to um speak to some of the traditional concerns

723
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.570
that, that, that, that occupied people in this, in

724
00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:52.250
the pessimism dispute. So the Empirical Sciences, right? Um

725
00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:57.189
NATO Wizen Shaft and the Natural Sciences. Um He,

726
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.979
he thinks have the ability to completely reform how

727
00:42:00.989 --> 00:42:04.350
we think of the human, how the human being

728
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.399
engages with the world and our place within the

729
00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:13.449
world. Um He comes to think of art, right?

730
00:42:13.459 --> 00:42:16.169
The artistic response to the world as, as you

731
00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:18.219
know, this idea that we need aesthetic experience to

732
00:42:18.229 --> 00:42:22.209
almost um give us a kind of useful illusion

733
00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:26.530
that actually things are beautiful and, and sublime. Um

734
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.790
He, he comes to think of this as really

735
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.199
a distraction from, from the root problem. Um And

736
00:42:32.209 --> 00:42:37.409
that science could in fact be harnessed to alleviate

737
00:42:37.419 --> 00:42:40.179
suffering to a significant degree. This is a massive

738
00:42:40.189 --> 00:42:42.649
change in his in attitude towards suffering. In my

739
00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:45.699
view. There's multiple passages where he thinks that, you

740
00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:48.639
know, religion and art share the same kind of

741
00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:52.270
defect in that they actually prolong um a kind

742
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.300
of suffering in so far as they, what they

743
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.629
do is really put a bandage over a a

744
00:42:56.659 --> 00:42:59.899
AAA kind of severed artery, right? They can kind

745
00:42:59.909 --> 00:43:03.080
of temporarily deal with it with this issue of

746
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.850
existential dread in the face of suffering, but really,

747
00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:07.239
they don't get to the root of the the

748
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.770
problem, they don't even get close to it. And

749
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:15.020
this is where he thinks that understanding um the

750
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:18.370
role of science and, and harnessing scientific power could

751
00:43:18.379 --> 00:43:20.580
in fact do this. Um So he's in a,

752
00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:24.739
a fairly kind of um hopeful um error of

753
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.770
his thought where he really does think. So, you

754
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.419
know what he was saying in the birth of

755
00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:31.780
tragedy was, was not right at all. But he

756
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.100
he more directly goes after pessimism by harnessing what

757
00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.889
some people call a frame of reference argument, right?

758
00:43:37.899 --> 00:43:40.989
So what he tries to do is to say

759
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.689
that hold on a minute, this whole pessimism dispute

760
00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:47.649
is premised upon a mistake. We can't give evaluations

761
00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:50.830
of life as such. That's just a, a wholly

762
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.040
mistaken enterprise, right? Pessimists want to say life is

763
00:43:56.459 --> 00:43:59.790
itself a bad thing. Optimists want to say that

764
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.330
life is itself a good thing. Um Nietzsche comes

765
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.379
to think um that this is, this is a

766
00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:08.209
mistake and his argument is something like the following

767
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.040
like can and the neo neo canteens, he thinks

768
00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:18.000
that our experience of the world is filtered through

769
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:22.469
our sensory apparatus and our drives, right? Drives are

770
00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:26.489
these kinds of patterns or dispositions towards certain kinds

771
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.229
of, yeah, patterns of behavior, um sort of a

772
00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:35.350
pressure to act in certain ways and affects are

773
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.050
these kind of first personal experiences of those drives,

774
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.629
right? So we have all of these various drives

775
00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:42.860
and each of things which are competing in various

776
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.919
ways and they, they structure and or give a

777
00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:50.139
sort of orientation of our experience to the world.

778
00:44:50.149 --> 00:44:52.469
They reg you know, things register our attention more

779
00:44:52.479 --> 00:44:55.129
than others, depending upon the calibration of our drives.

780
00:44:55.639 --> 00:44:59.020
Everything we experience is almost filtered through this apparatus,

781
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.290
this cognitive apparatus. Now, Nietzsche thinks this has quite

782
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.760
big implications for how we think of values, right?

783
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:12.229
So for him, uh values are going to be

784
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.239
things which we have in accordance with our, with

785
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.219
our drives, right? We'll have an experience of uh

786
00:45:19.229 --> 00:45:23.330
say we'll have a drive towards sex, for example,

787
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.209
our X will sort of have a sort of

788
00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:29.389
positive or negative appraisal of this drive. And this

789
00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:31.610
the pattern of these, the stable pattern of these

790
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.540
drives, he thinks give rise to our values, these,

791
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.129
these kinds of things we take to be good

792
00:45:36.139 --> 00:45:40.110
or bad because our values are so deeply entwined

793
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.219
with our psychology. And he thinks along with the

794
00:45:43.229 --> 00:45:46.469
neo canteens that we can't really ever get behind

795
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:51.000
right? Reality, uh We can't understand reality outside of

796
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.520
our drive orientation. Um We can't really say anything

797
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.689
about unconditioned experience or the thing in itself, right?

798
00:45:58.959 --> 00:46:02.139
We can't really say anything about how, how, how

799
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.659
reality or existence is as such. We only ever

800
00:46:05.669 --> 00:46:08.969
have our perspective of it. And of course, this

801
00:46:08.979 --> 00:46:11.860
gives rise to his later very famous perspective is

802
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:14.300
which people have debated quite a lot about in.

803
00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:14.550
So

804
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.870
at least when it comes to Kan Metaphysics, he

805
00:46:17.879 --> 00:46:21.350
agrees with that distinction between the noon and the

806
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:21.989
phenomenon

807
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:25.080
at this point, he has a sort of naturalized

808
00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.000
version of that. Yeah. So he doesn't have the

809
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.520
same canteen arguments, but he thinks that he can

810
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:34.360
give a sort of physiological um psychological account of

811
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.090
this same distinction that there, there might be some

812
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.979
kind of thing in itself or unconditioned reality that

813
00:46:39.989 --> 00:46:42.669
might be different to how we, how we perceive

814
00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:44.879
things in the world. But we can't know that

815
00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:48.600
in principle because we're always working with this cognitive

816
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.649
apparatus that we have everything everything is filtered through

817
00:46:51.659 --> 00:46:55.949
that. So he one way of interpreting here is

818
00:46:55.959 --> 00:46:59.649
a kind of naturalized Neo canteen. And he thinks

819
00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:02.530
this has big implications for evaluations of life as

820
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.449
such because we just can't make those kinds of

821
00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:10.679
judgments. Our valuations are always prejudicial and idiosyncratic. And

822
00:47:10.689 --> 00:47:13.790
here he's drawing a lot upon the debates from

823
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.280
Neo canteens like Langer uh who he, he read

824
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.530
and, and very much admired um Vinal Band and

825
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.120
also positivists like Algo Ding, right? They, they had

826
00:47:24.129 --> 00:47:27.040
this kind of idea that valuations are in some

827
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:31.070
sense, impure or unjust. These are terms Nietzsche uses

828
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.370
straight from during. Um And that because we have

829
00:47:34.379 --> 00:47:39.500
this p perspective or prejudicial perspective, when we're evaluating

830
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.760
things, it just doesn't really make any sense to

831
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.209
say life as such is good or life as

832
00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:47.879
such is bad, right? The whole pessimism dispute is

833
00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:50.060
premised on a mistake. And so this is a

834
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.850
major turn away from the position of the birth

835
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.810
of tragedy where he was quite happy to say

836
00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.959
that it's you can verify pessimism as something being

837
00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:02.290
true or false, right? There's a truth condition to

838
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.449
it, I think in a in human or to

839
00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:07.199
human, we see him shift away from that quite

840
00:48:07.209 --> 00:48:11.379
dramatically because of his enthusiasm for the empirical sciences

841
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:16.120
here, what they're able to achieve. Um And yes,

842
00:48:16.129 --> 00:48:21.229
the implications of that for thinking about human psychology

843
00:48:21.239 --> 00:48:23.760
in this, in this kind of more naturalistic fashion.

844
00:48:24.189 --> 00:48:26.870
Um So I think that's the, the major argument

845
00:48:26.879 --> 00:48:28.659
I think, which lays a foundation for a lot

846
00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:30.590
of what he wants to do in his mature

847
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.250
work, this kind of frame of reference argument, which

848
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.820
says that, you know, pessimistic valuations really, uh they

849
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.969
don't, they're either incoherent um or they, they just

850
00:48:42.979 --> 00:48:45.659
make a claim that is just epistemic unavailable to

851
00:48:45.669 --> 00:48:47.449
us. And so the, the, the whole debate is,

852
00:48:47.459 --> 00:48:48.949
is premised upon a confusion.

853
00:48:49.389 --> 00:48:52.929
Mhm So you probably already touched on this point.

854
00:48:52.939 --> 00:48:55.879
But one of the things that you point to

855
00:48:55.889 --> 00:49:00.030
in your book is one of his critics of

856
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.760
pessimism was a psychological one, a psychological critic of

857
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.209
pessimism. So what is it really about? What is

858
00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:09.610
he referring to there?

859
00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:13.120
Good. Yeah. So again, and this is something I

860
00:49:13.129 --> 00:49:14.810
try and emphasize in the book is that the

861
00:49:15.229 --> 00:49:20.320
this very famous kind of Nietzschean critique of various

862
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:25.739
kinds of moralities um or evaluative outlooks in terms

863
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:29.689
of the assertive psychology um in the context of

864
00:49:29.699 --> 00:49:32.939
the pessimism dispute, this is not an original argument

865
00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:38.169
of Nietzsche's, he's actually developing existing psychological criticisms um

866
00:49:38.179 --> 00:49:41.580
of pessimism. So the view is something like this

867
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.860
and, and I think this frame of reference argument

868
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.209
from human to human really does lay the groundwork

869
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:48.989
for this because it allows him to say, well,

870
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.739
ok, if pessimism is not really, if it's premised

871
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.750
upon a confusion, what leads people to make these

872
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.810
evaluations, right? And he eventually comes to this idea

873
00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.530
because of his drive psychology that when someone makes

874
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.280
an evaluation about the world or any kind of

875
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:09.449
um allegedly descriptive metaphysical view about the world, you

876
00:50:09.459 --> 00:50:12.469
know, that it's a manifestation of a contradictory will

877
00:50:12.479 --> 00:50:15.270
or, or whatever it is, um this can be

878
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.040
explained in terms of one's moral values, right? So

879
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:21.409
your metaphysical world, worldview, descriptive worldview can be explained

880
00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:24.120
in terms of the asserted moral world, uh moral

881
00:50:24.129 --> 00:50:27.229
values and those moral values can be explained in

882
00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:30.949
terms of the assertive psychology or even physiology, right?

883
00:50:30.959 --> 00:50:36.129
That's a classic Nietzschean strategy for approaching various kinds

884
00:50:36.139 --> 00:50:40.199
of, of worldviews. He comes to think of pessimism

885
00:50:40.209 --> 00:50:46.310
as constituted by at least two psychological dispositions, right?

886
00:50:46.649 --> 00:50:50.020
So the first one is, he thinks of pessimists

887
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.850
as led to endorse their view to, to endorse

888
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.800
this, this view of the world because they are

889
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:59.709
they suffer from a kind of exhaustion or weakness

890
00:50:59.719 --> 00:51:01.689
of will, right? And the view is something like

891
00:51:01.699 --> 00:51:05.649
this, the human being is a battleground of various

892
00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:09.520
competing drives that are constantly vying for supremacy. They're

893
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:14.510
pulling us in all these directions and this can

894
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.919
cause a a large degree of suffering, especially if

895
00:51:17.929 --> 00:51:21.939
you lack the self control to sort of um

896
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.870
calibrate these drives and refine them and sort of

897
00:51:26.879 --> 00:51:29.760
harness them for some kind of unified goal. He

898
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.830
thinks that special kinds of people have the sort

899
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.649
of strength of will to be able to do

900
00:51:33.659 --> 00:51:35.600
this. And he sort of gives examples like Goethe

901
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.270
and Julius Caesar and Cesare Borger and whatnot. But

902
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.489
most people are not able to do this. So

903
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.060
what, what does a person in that kind of

904
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:48.050
position? What is the phenomenal quality of, of this

905
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.370
kind of um situation, right? Where you've got all

906
00:51:50.379 --> 00:51:53.550
these drives vying for supremacy. He thinks this is

907
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.850
inevitably going to lead to a certain kind of,

908
00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:03.810
yeah, exhaustion, um kind of uh fatigue or painful

909
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:07.620
frustration where you're at, the the person is just

910
00:52:07.629 --> 00:52:10.419
at the, at the whims of these various drives.

911
00:52:10.429 --> 00:52:15.679
Ok? Inevitably, he thinks this is going to lead

912
00:52:15.689 --> 00:52:19.179
to a an effective condition where you see life

913
00:52:19.189 --> 00:52:22.469
as a chore. Everything registers, registers to this person

914
00:52:22.479 --> 00:52:24.350
as a task to be done as a chore

915
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.250
to be done. Another thing which produces this toil

916
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.610
and yearning for peace. Ok? And he comes to

917
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.719
have this view that this is one way in

918
00:52:33.729 --> 00:52:37.719
which pessimism can look very attractive and can lead

919
00:52:37.729 --> 00:52:40.260
the person in this position can be led to

920
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.760
uh endorse this, this worldview that actually, yeah, life

921
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:47.600
is, is, is the problem. Life is against me.

922
00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:53.479
Um And so it's a kind of vindication, right?

923
00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:56.679
Of this person's experience of the world that oh,

924
00:52:56.689 --> 00:53:00.550
it's, it's not because I'm particularly, you know, vulnerable

925
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.040
or weak. It's because the world is deficient, right?

926
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:07.969
It's, it's, it's, it's contradictory. It's, it's kind of

927
00:53:07.979 --> 00:53:12.000
faulty in some way. Um And so what he

928
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.800
eventually thinks happened is that look this pain of

929
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:19.989
exhaustion leads to what this very famous Nietzschean um

930
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.199
concept of rezoning on. Right? This idea that someone

931
00:53:24.209 --> 00:53:27.159
who is harmed and becomes very vengeful and wants

932
00:53:27.169 --> 00:53:30.419
to take revenge on their perceived oppressor, but can't

933
00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:32.439
because they don't have the strength, they get this

934
00:53:32.449 --> 00:53:35.560
kind of bottled up, seething resentment. And Nietzsche thinks

935
00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:39.060
that something quite interesting can happen creatively when someone

936
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.760
suffers from this most famously in the genealogy of

937
00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.439
morals. He thinks that this is a social condition

938
00:53:44.449 --> 00:53:47.580
where a particular class of people can be oppressed

939
00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.300
by uh sort of an aristocratic class and they

940
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.060
can their res Ryon on towards that class can

941
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.360
produce a new set of values in this context.

942
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.139
He thinks that you can have ryste on not

943
00:53:59.149 --> 00:54:01.550
in a socially directed way but in a world

944
00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:04.810
directed way, right? So you have him on towards

945
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.300
life itself and it sounds quite irrational. But this

946
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.270
is exactly what Nietzsche thinks is going on with

947
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.360
the psychology of these, these people is that they're

948
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.459
pushed and pulled in all these directions. They suffer

949
00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:19.449
a result, they need someone to blame, but there's

950
00:54:19.459 --> 00:54:22.270
no one to blame. So they blame life itself.

951
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.610
And this manifests as a sort of what philosophical

952
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.469
pessimism is in niche's view is a sort of

953
00:54:28.479 --> 00:54:31.699
post hoc rationalization of those feelings of rossant t

954
00:54:31.929 --> 00:54:35.330
on you. They, these pessimists like Hartmann and Banter

955
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.399
and Mainlander, all of the people that came after

956
00:54:37.409 --> 00:54:41.929
Schopenhauer. Um All of their philosophies are really just

957
00:54:41.939 --> 00:54:46.219
ways of coping with their, their conditions, right? Their

958
00:54:46.229 --> 00:54:51.290
conditions of weakness which produce these, this suffering which

959
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.530
leads to resent him on. Ok. So he, he

960
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.770
thinks that philosophical pessimism is a very elaborate and

961
00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:03.709
very clever sort of concoction for dealing with or

962
00:55:03.719 --> 00:55:06.879
satisfying these feelings of roon on. So that's one

963
00:55:06.889 --> 00:55:10.760
kind of psychological reduction he gives of pessimism in

964
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.979
his mature work is that this really isn't a

965
00:55:12.989 --> 00:55:15.689
philosophy at all. You can, you can really explain

966
00:55:15.699 --> 00:55:19.389
philosophical pessimism as a product of one's psychology or

967
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:20.229
physiology.

968
00:55:20.909 --> 00:55:25.729
Mhm. And what is the relationship then between pessimism

969
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:30.649
and nihilism specifically? Because nihilism, I, I mean, of

970
00:55:30.659 --> 00:55:33.750
course, there's a relationship there and we're just about

971
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.139
to talk about it, but Nietzsche also worried specifically

972
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.610
about nihilism,

973
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:43.209
right. That's, yeah, that's absolutely right. And, um, you

974
00:55:43.219 --> 00:55:48.300
know, in his mature works, in particular, um Nihilism

975
00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:51.489
becomes the, seems to be the central theme, right?

976
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.899
He, he starts thinking of the pessimism dispute as

977
00:55:54.909 --> 00:55:59.939
something that really, people are spilling ink over. But

978
00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:02.379
really it, it's, it's a pointless endeavor. You can't

979
00:56:02.389 --> 00:56:05.540
convince someone with reasons out of their pessimism, it's

980
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.020
futile. Um, YOU know, this is why he, he

981
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.139
sort of almost reverts back to the aesthetic position

982
00:56:12.149 --> 00:56:13.899
of the birth of tragedy because, you know, you

983
00:56:13.909 --> 00:56:18.649
can't just like you can't treat a physi physiological

984
00:56:18.659 --> 00:56:23.520
disease like cancer or something by refuting it, right?

985
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:25.429
You need to treat it in various ways So

986
00:56:25.439 --> 00:56:27.709
he thinks the the pessimism dispute as a philosophical

987
00:56:27.719 --> 00:56:30.469
phenomenon is a waste of time. And he starts

988
00:56:30.479 --> 00:56:35.340
to focus more effort on responding to nihilism. And,

989
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.149
and again, this is an important point which I

990
00:56:38.159 --> 00:56:42.199
think is sometimes lost nihilism at the time. And

991
00:56:42.209 --> 00:56:45.669
I still think today did not have a generally

992
00:56:45.679 --> 00:56:49.219
understood fixed definition in the way that pessimism did.

993
00:56:49.229 --> 00:56:52.729
So during the pessimism dispute, it was well understood

994
00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:54.540
that this was the view that life is not

995
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:57.560
worth living, right? Nihilism can be used in a

996
00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:00.110
variety of different ways and there's no kind of

997
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.550
fixed de facto definition of that. And I think

998
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.270
even Nietzsche uses it in a variety of ways.

999
00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:08.600
So I'll, I'll give you sort of one way

1000
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.770
of understanding the relation. So not, whereas pessimism is

1001
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.719
the view that look, there are genuine meaning conferring

1002
00:57:16.729 --> 00:57:20.129
values. Um But it's just that the world is

1003
00:57:20.139 --> 00:57:22.399
such that it doesn't allow us to realize them.

1004
00:57:23.229 --> 00:57:25.850
Nihilism is the view that, that it's, there's nothing

1005
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.050
wrong with the world as such, but rather it's

1006
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.770
that there are no meaning conferring values, right? So

1007
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.520
it's a, it's a very different, a this version

1008
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:37.449
of Nihilism is a very different um d different

1009
00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:40.050
position um with respect to the the existence of

1010
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.389
values, right? So Ni Nihilists typically think that whatever

1011
00:57:43.399 --> 00:57:46.179
the values are, which give us meaning and demand

1012
00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:50.139
our as ascension, demand our response to them. Um

1013
00:57:50.149 --> 00:57:52.540
They just don't exist. And so we're left in

1014
00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:57.649
this kind of position of um yeah, despair about

1015
00:57:57.659 --> 00:58:00.110
uh despair about um the state of the world,

1016
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.750
right? So the the version of Nihilism, which I

1017
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.639
think Nietzsche is most interested in is not so

1018
00:58:04.649 --> 00:58:08.100
much a cognitive belief. It's not necessarily a belief

1019
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.709
that there are no values, but it's more an

1020
00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:15.219
affective condition. It's this condition that life is something

1021
00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:18.860
that one feels revulsion or disgust at. And this

1022
00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:24.169
provokes this practical response of resignation. So he describes,

1023
00:58:24.179 --> 00:58:30.280
for example, Christianity as being a intrinsically nihilistic perspective

1024
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.129
on the world, right? And of course, Christianity thinks

1025
00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:37.649
that there are genuine values. Um BUT it's just

1026
00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:41.000
that they can't be, they can't be realized. But

1027
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.989
the the effective condition that the Christian has Nietzsche

1028
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.449
thinks is that they, they have this kind of

1029
00:58:46.459 --> 00:58:50.280
disgust towards life with themselves, to with their most

1030
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:54.870
fundamental natures as sort of um striving and you

1031
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:58.840
know, particularly sexual beings. Um OUR most fundamental drives

1032
00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.090
are demonized. These are claims. Um AND this is

1033
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.850
a kind of nihilism where we're disgusted by life.

1034
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.610
Our attitudes to life are are one of a

1035
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.919
completely negative appraisal we yearn for some kind of

1036
00:59:10.929 --> 00:59:13.870
better world beyond. And in this case, the Christian

1037
00:59:13.879 --> 00:59:14.560
version, it's, yeah,

1038
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:19.610
it's basically a revulsion toward worldly things, right? I

1039
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.050
mean, because I the ideal is to go to

1040
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.709
heaven and then in heaven probably you can fully

1041
00:59:26.719 --> 00:59:30.540
realize your values. I mean that that's actually something

1042
00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:34.010
that also, um, that it's an idea that can't

1043
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.830
also add in the critique of practical reason. That,

1044
00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:42.070
uh, I mean, when it comes to the antinomy

1045
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.889
of reason, one of them was that we can't

1046
00:59:44.899 --> 00:59:49.010
be sure if, um, life is, uh, if there's

1047
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.530
life after death actually. But, uh, yeah, I mean,

1048
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.729
a according to his moral views, there had to

1049
00:59:56.739 --> 01:00:01.409
be one because it was only in uh eternal

1050
01:00:01.419 --> 01:00:03.949
existence. Let's say that we would be able to

1051
01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:07.169
fully realize ourselves morally.

1052
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.340
That, that, that's right. Yeah, it's a practical question

1053
01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:11.590
as he describes it, we have to sort of

1054
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.800
take it for granted that there could be because

1055
01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.209
that's the only way that there could be a

1056
01:00:15.219 --> 01:00:19.850
genuine meeting of the demand for value. Um And,

1057
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.530
and I think that again, this is one of

1058
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.189
Nietzsche's insights that there's, there's really not that much

1059
01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:30.110
of a fundamental distinction between Christianity, um contemporary European

1060
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:36.100
morality canteen, um Metaphysics, uh Platonic Metaphysics, right? What

1061
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:37.729
all of these things have in common for Nietzsche

1062
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.979
and what makes them all Nihilistic is that they

1063
01:00:40.989 --> 01:00:45.020
all have some conception of a better world beyond

1064
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:49.399
which both explains the value, the earthly value that

1065
01:00:49.409 --> 01:00:51.000
uh uh uh sorry, the earthly world that we

1066
01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:54.610
inhabit. And also not only does it explain it,

1067
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.610
but it evaluates it, right? It debases in, in

1068
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:01.689
Nietzsche's view, the material physical world that we inhabit,

1069
01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:05.129
this becomes something that we're just waiting to leave

1070
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.050
and that we need salvation from, right.

1071
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.159
It's a form of negation of life, at

1072
01:01:10.169 --> 01:01:13.179
least to some extent. Yeah, I think that this

1073
01:01:13.189 --> 01:01:16.489
is right that um you know, we become, we

1074
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.840
become disgusted with this life because we see it

1075
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:23.030
as subordinate to some kind of world behind or

1076
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.000
world beyond. Um THIS world that we experience. Yeah.

1077
01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:29.290
So I think that that he comes to have

1078
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.959
an interest in nihilism partly as it as it's

1079
01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:37.580
expressed through these kinds of worldviews, right? Um And

1080
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:42.280
this, this comes eventually to, to replace his interest

1081
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:45.850
in, in the, in philosophical pessimism. But the point

1082
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.149
I try and make in the book is that

1083
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.449
we can only really fully appreciate that point as

1084
01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:54.209
it's a, as a as this has come to

1085
01:01:54.219 --> 01:01:56.429
be as part of a sort of process in

1086
01:01:56.449 --> 01:02:01.310
Nietzsche's thought through engaging with philosophical pessimism through debates

1087
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.610
which were already going on in the 19th century.

1088
01:02:04.149 --> 01:02:05.969
Um This is how he gets to nihilism and,

1089
01:02:05.979 --> 01:02:08.530
and to be fair, he there's even points in

1090
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.350
his, his writing in the, in the notebooks where

1091
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.060
he's just talks about pessimism as a preliminary form

1092
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:18.090
of nihilism, right? He sees it as a kind

1093
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.149
of early manifestation of this nihilistic position, which is

1094
01:02:22.159 --> 01:02:27.250
primarily an effective kind of yeah, disposition or attitude

1095
01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.510
towards life as something to be disgusted by. Yeah.

1096
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.560
So earlier, we talked a little bit about hedonic

1097
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:40.590
pessimism. But what were Nietzsche's ideas about hedonism itself?

1098
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.780
And did they link it to pessimism in any

1099
01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:44.060
way.

1100
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.750
Yeah. Good. That's a good question. Um, SO certainly

1101
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.850
in the mature works, um, he is openly hostile

1102
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.770
to hedonism as an account of value. Right. So

1103
01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.610
he takes positions which endorse a hedonic outlook. So

1104
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:07.530
utilitarianism and, and other views similar, um, to be

1105
01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:11.649
not only sort of confused about human psychology, but

1106
01:03:11.659 --> 01:03:15.100
also to be wrong headed about the kinds of

1107
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:18.760
things which are good and ought to be pursued.

1108
01:03:19.179 --> 01:03:21.729
Um There's a question here about how this links

1109
01:03:21.739 --> 01:03:24.219
up with Nietzsche's meta ethics. But I'll, I'll put

1110
01:03:24.229 --> 01:03:25.939
that to the side just for the purposes of

1111
01:03:25.949 --> 01:03:28.770
this. Um He comes to be highly critical of

1112
01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.580
hedonism as a position in its own, right? But

1113
01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:36.360
also as it, as it, its role um in

1114
01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:41.649
legitimating pessimism, right? So he, he sees pessimists like

1115
01:03:41.659 --> 01:03:46.449
Eduard Von Hartmann, Philip Mainlander. Um AND, and to

1116
01:03:46.459 --> 01:03:52.209
an extent Schopenhauer as endorsing this idea that, well,

1117
01:03:52.469 --> 01:03:54.979
pessimism is simply the matter that, you know, you

1118
01:03:54.989 --> 01:03:57.060
look at the world. If there's more suffering than

1119
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.409
pleasure, then then it's bad. And it's just this

1120
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.989
kind of weighing game where you figure, figure out

1121
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.110
how much pleasure there is in the world. And

1122
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.060
he comes to really have a sort of disdainful

1123
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.989
attitude towards this and, but for different reasons, right?

1124
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.649
So one of the reasons I think he has

1125
01:04:12.659 --> 01:04:17.479
a problem with hedonism is that he ch he

1126
01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:21.739
tries to provoke his reader into looking at the,

1127
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.159
what the pinnacle of a hedonic life would be

1128
01:04:24.169 --> 01:04:27.959
like someone who's experiencing maximal pleasure, doesn't have to

1129
01:04:27.969 --> 01:04:30.209
struggle with any toil or anything like this. And

1130
01:04:30.219 --> 01:04:32.149
he's trying to provoke in his reader a sense

1131
01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:35.159
of disgust at that ideal. He says, you know,

1132
01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:36.959
look at these kinds of people who would be,

1133
01:04:37.199 --> 01:04:40.909
you know, basically like herd animals like cows in

1134
01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.409
the field, just wandering around eating grass and, and

1135
01:04:43.419 --> 01:04:46.209
grazing and not doing much. This really ought to

1136
01:04:46.219 --> 01:04:49.929
provoke disgust if you have this artistic creative disposition.

1137
01:04:49.939 --> 01:04:53.129
So I think that Nietzsche cares, he's inviting his

1138
01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:56.310
readers or specific readers to care about the values,

1139
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.090
the perfectionist values, which I think Nietzsche himself cared

1140
01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:05.600
about the most, which is artistic creativity, um achievement,

1141
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.919
overcoming obstacles tends to cash this out in terms

1142
01:05:08.929 --> 01:05:11.800
of will to power. Um But he certainly thinks

1143
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.659
that pessimism and hedonism are, are related, right? This

1144
01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:17.580
kind of, he sometimes describes it as sort of

1145
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:20.300
pessimism of sensibility. This kind of, well, if, if

1146
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.639
pessimism is really just weighing up pleasure and pain

1147
01:05:22.649 --> 01:05:25.340
and you find the world wanting, um you know,

1148
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.459
this is no world view for someone who has

1149
01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:30.629
the sort of artistic creativity, um these kind of

1150
01:05:30.639 --> 01:05:35.139
protect perfectionist values that Nietzsche tends to entertain. Um

1151
01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:38.179
So he attacks pa uh hedonism on these grounds

1152
01:05:38.189 --> 01:05:42.010
that it's just not a suitable. Um EVEN the

1153
01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.639
ideal of hedonism is not a life worth living

1154
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:50.239
um for the sort of i the admirable um

1155
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.979
human being, right? And he tends to try and

1156
01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:56.620
try and provoke the reader into a just, you

1157
01:05:56.629 --> 01:06:02.429
know, distancing himself from hedonism through affective means. So

1158
01:06:02.439 --> 01:06:08.219
he harnesses again, revulsion and admiration, right? As elements

1159
01:06:08.229 --> 01:06:10.209
that he wants to, to evoke in his readers

1160
01:06:10.219 --> 01:06:12.290
to try and get them to steer away from

1161
01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:14.939
these kinds of these kinds of outlooks. And so

1162
01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:17.719
certainly he thinks hedonism is a important part of

1163
01:06:17.729 --> 01:06:21.060
at least a form of pessimism um or the

1164
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:23.810
dominant forms of pessimism. But he really thinks that

1165
01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.340
this is contrary to his conception of a, of

1166
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.209
a well lived life, which is one in terms

1167
01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:29.370
of creativity.

1168
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.850
Well, I would imagine that you would also not

1169
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.760
be very fond of utilitarians then.

1170
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:38.919
That's right. Yeah, he certainly has very little positive

1171
01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:42.500
things to say about utilitarians and he particularly reserves

1172
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.820
his uh most potent scorn for Jon Stewart Mill

1173
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.719
um in this respect. So, I mean, there's a

1174
01:06:47.729 --> 01:06:50.520
passage in there's 225 of beyond good and evil

1175
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.590
where he puts pessimism and utilitarianism in the same

1176
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.899
bracket in the same sentence, he dismisses it and

1177
01:06:56.909 --> 01:06:58.929
sort of says, look, their attitude to suffering is,

1178
01:06:58.939 --> 01:07:03.570
is despicable because as soon as suffering arises, they

1179
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.360
don't see any value in it. No, they don't

1180
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.600
see it as an opportunity for growth, for creativity.

1181
01:07:08.659 --> 01:07:10.340
They want to s to stamp it out as

1182
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:12.530
soon as it, it rears its head. And this

1183
01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.929
really does an injustice to suffering's power to be

1184
01:07:16.939 --> 01:07:21.570
harnessed. Yeah, in creative achievement in various domains. So

1185
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.969
he says that the discipline of suffering, of great

1186
01:07:23.979 --> 01:07:27.129
suffering has created all of the enhancements of man

1187
01:07:27.139 --> 01:07:29.399
so far, he says in that passage, and um

1188
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.770
really his problem with hedonism and as you said,

1189
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:35.989
utilitarianism is that they have a kind of wholly

1190
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.050
mistaken understanding of how suffering arises and its causes,

1191
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.830
but also what its potential value can be.

1192
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.080
So that is then the value that Nietzsche attributes

1193
01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:50.840
to suffering in life in the later stages of

1194
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.520
his intellectual life.

1195
01:07:53.139 --> 01:07:55.449
That's right. Yeah. So in the, in the mature

1196
01:07:55.459 --> 01:08:00.370
works, um there's multiple passages where he's trying to

1197
01:08:01.379 --> 01:08:05.580
invite the reader to see, to, to, to sort

1198
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:09.739
of completely change their attitude to suffering which we've

1199
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:14.040
inherited through, you know, thousands of years of conditioning

1200
01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:16.850
in, in, in contemporary morality, right? Seeing suffering as

1201
01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.899
an objection to life as something that we need

1202
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.700
to stamp out. He's inviting his readers to try

1203
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:24.560
and have a sort of quite radical cognitive shift

1204
01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:27.959
to see suffering as a potential opportunity for growth

1205
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.200
as some kind of some kind of yeah, evaluative

1206
01:08:31.209 --> 01:08:34.859
opportunity for achievement. Um And I I don't think

1207
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:37.310
that Nietzsche thinks this is something everyone can do.

1208
01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.549
I think he's really thinks this is something that

1209
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.160
specific individuals will be able to achieve because it's

1210
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:46.839
not easy to look upon suffering as yeah, potentially

1211
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:48.819
a good thing and, and maybe even not just

1212
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:52.259
wholly instrumentally right? So many people think that suffering

1213
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.020
can help them achieve something, but it's still a

1214
01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.959
regrettable feature like it would have been better to,

1215
01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:01.020
you know, write the novel, you always wanted to

1216
01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:03.069
write without the suffering and the toil that you

1217
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.439
went through. I think Nietzsche's even challenging that view

1218
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:09.529
and thinking that suffering is not just instrumental to

1219
01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:12.799
great achievements, but it is actually constitutive of them.

1220
01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:14.669
So part of what makes a great of a

1221
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.310
great achievement is the suffering, right? And the overcoming

1222
01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:22.180
of the process of harnessing that suffering for a

1223
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:25.109
creative end. Um So yes, I think he's in

1224
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.790
the later works, trying to say that, you know,

1225
01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:32.470
in the context of the pessimism dispute, suffering can

1226
01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:35.129
have value and we can come to have an

1227
01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:42.059
affirmative cognitive um shift, yeah, a cognitive shift in

1228
01:09:42.068 --> 01:09:45.538
our effective attitudes towards life in a positive way

1229
01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.019
by changing our attitudes towards suffering and seeing it

1230
01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:50.417
as as having some value. And this is what

1231
01:09:50.429 --> 01:09:54.108
he sometimes describes as a the pessimism of strength,

1232
01:09:54.118 --> 01:09:56.759
right? The abi it's a kind of a kind

1233
01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:59.279
of attitude, it's not a sort of um theory

1234
01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:01.819
per se, but an attitude, the ability to see

1235
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:05.649
suffering as an opportunity as having potential value,

1236
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.000
right? Mhm And I would imagine that when you

1237
01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:12.689
refer there to the fact that he probably thought

1238
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.959
that it would only be certain kinds of people

1239
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.609
that would be able to deal with suffering in

1240
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.529
life in a positive productive way, let's say, uh,

1241
01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.250
he would probably, uh, refer to people with certain,

1242
01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:31.370
it would probably be people with certain psychological traits.

1243
01:10:31.379 --> 01:10:35.330
Right. Because that's something that he, he talked about

1244
01:10:35.339 --> 01:10:37.180
a lot. Right. I mean, you, you had to

1245
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:43.109
have a certain psychological predisposition toward, uh, life, moral

1246
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.910
values and so on to really be able to

1247
01:10:45.979 --> 01:10:50.020
be, um, let's say someone that would understand Nietzsche's

1248
01:10:50.029 --> 01:10:50.979
writings.

1249
01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:53.220
That's right. I think this is just a general

1250
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:55.746
feature. His writing is that he, I mean, he

1251
01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:59.366
constantly warns people against reading him. And this is

1252
01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:02.485
quite a sort of strange feature as an author

1253
01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:04.726
that he, he, he's constantly warning people saying this

1254
01:11:04.735 --> 01:11:07.545
isn't necessarily for you, you know, you need to

1255
01:11:07.585 --> 01:11:10.516
really think through whether this is what I'm saying

1256
01:11:10.525 --> 01:11:12.145
is really getting through to you. And, and I

1257
01:11:12.155 --> 01:11:15.591
think Nietzsche really does think that he's for people

1258
01:11:15.602 --> 01:11:19.501
who share some of his dispositions and values. And

1259
01:11:19.512 --> 01:11:22.432
that might be people who are suffering from some

1260
01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:25.111
kind of false consciousness that, you know, think that

1261
01:11:25.122 --> 01:11:27.691
maybe Christian morality might be, you know, they might

1262
01:11:27.702 --> 01:11:29.852
be ensnared by it, but really they have this

1263
01:11:29.861 --> 01:11:32.751
kind of psychological disposition to break free of that

1264
01:11:32.762 --> 01:11:36.412
and be a more affirming life affirming individual. And

1265
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:38.691
I think Nietzsche's trying to tap into some of

1266
01:11:38.702 --> 01:11:42.939
our psychological dispositions for that. Um And again, yeah,

1267
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.669
speak to some potential figures who could, could have

1268
01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.089
this kind of strength of will really to calibrate

1269
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.689
their, the orientation of their drives in such a

1270
01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:56.939
way that they could find life worth living in

1271
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.740
this very pragmatic sense. Right. So, it's not necessarily

1272
01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:03.160
that it's, they'd find ra uh j life to

1273
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:06.129
be good in a sort of rational, rational way.

1274
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.330
But they're necessarily, they wouldn't necessarily have that, but

1275
01:12:09.339 --> 01:12:13.709
they would come to see life as being worthy

1276
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.089
and beautiful and worthy. Yeah. Worthy of affirmation. Um,

1277
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.910
PURELY pragmatically. And I, yeah, I think, I think

1278
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:23.319
you're right that Nietzsche doesn't think that I think

1279
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:25.270
it doesn't think that everyone is capable of that.

1280
01:12:25.279 --> 01:12:27.370
There has to be a kind of right? Psychological

1281
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:32.359
and uh yeah, psychological um um predisposition, predisposition or

1282
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:34.080
framework in place for that. Yeah.

1283
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:37.410
Yeah. OK. So let's get into the last question

1284
01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:40.740
of our interview here today. So we've already went

1285
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.740
through some of the main ideas, at least the

1286
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:49.370
ni had about pessimism. What about solutions and antidotes

1287
01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:52.770
to pessimism according to him. What can we do

1288
01:12:52.779 --> 01:12:55.620
about it? How can we approach it in a

1289
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:56.569
positive way?

1290
01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.759
Good. Yeah. So one of the things I, I

1291
01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.419
try and get out in the book and I

1292
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:04.149
think it's quite interesting is that the mature Nietzsche,

1293
01:13:04.919 --> 01:13:08.919
his answer to this question is really a coming

1294
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:12.879
back full circle to the project uh or at

1295
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:15.240
least the fundamental essence of the project in, in

1296
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.620
the birth of tragedy, right? So he, I think

1297
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:20.310
one of the things he tries to do is

1298
01:13:20.319 --> 01:13:23.560
to say that, ok, it, it's hopeless trying to

1299
01:13:23.569 --> 01:13:27.549
convince pessimists, um, out of their pessimism with reasons

1300
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.750
and arguments for the reasons that we've talked about.

1301
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.609
Um, WE need to instead try to engage their

1302
01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.100
psychological and emotional faculties. This is the only way

1303
01:13:37.109 --> 01:13:38.950
that you can free, at least with the people

1304
01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:42.779
with the, the psychological predisposition to, to, to do

1305
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:44.089
something else. Um,

1306
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:47.459
I guess that's also another one of the reasons

1307
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:50.160
why he wrote the way he did.

1308
01:13:50.169 --> 01:13:54.370
Right. Absolutely. I think it's impossible really to divorce

1309
01:13:54.379 --> 01:14:00.810
his philosophical views from his stylistic uh approach because

1310
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:05.009
you're not gonna find, you know, standard form arguments

1311
01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.919
and, and, you know, deductive inferences necessarily in Nietzsche

1312
01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:10.459
precisely because he thinks they're not really gonna have

1313
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.810
the purpose, they're not gonna serve the purpose. Um

1314
01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:16.490
It's basically to try to engage with your emotions,

1315
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.330
your psychology more directly.

1316
01:14:18.509 --> 01:14:20.410
That's right because he, he's of the view, which

1317
01:14:20.419 --> 01:14:22.470
is a lot of empirical evidence to support these

1318
01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:26.250
days is that you're far more likely to change

1319
01:14:26.259 --> 01:14:28.430
your mind and be jolted out of your views

1320
01:14:28.439 --> 01:14:32.430
through engagement with your emotional faculty. So he'll deploy

1321
01:14:32.879 --> 01:14:36.950
um techniques like trying to shame you or just,

1322
01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:40.390
you know, disgust you or entice you into admiring

1323
01:14:40.399 --> 01:14:44.140
something which contemporary morality says you really shouldn't because

1324
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:46.220
he knows that this has far more of a

1325
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:49.580
profound effect, right? Good. So, so he, with that

1326
01:14:49.589 --> 01:14:54.149
view in mind, he thinks that, you know, what,

1327
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.529
what, what is one very profound way? Uh 11

1328
01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:03.240
profound kind of human experience uh which can be

1329
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:08.479
induced uh through human creativity. Um And that's aesthetic

1330
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:11.200
experience and experience of art in particular, right? So

1331
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:17.870
he thinks that aesthetic experience um is interest his

1332
01:15:17.879 --> 01:15:20.040
version of it is interesting because it's quite anti

1333
01:15:20.109 --> 01:15:24.879
Schopenhauerian, right? So for Schopenhauer, our aesthetic experience is

1334
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:28.700
will this contemplation of some platonic idea or form?

1335
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:31.899
Right. So you, you what's pleasure about, about aesthetic

1336
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:35.160
experience is that you're temporarily released from the pressure

1337
01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:37.959
of willing, right? So willing is painful and suffering

1338
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:41.069
and striving and all that. Uh WHEN you see

1339
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.359
something beautiful, you sort of look at the Mona

1340
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:47.069
Lisa, for example, you forget your ordinary self as

1341
01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.680
a striving individual and you're pure, purely contemplating, right?

1342
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:52.430
And that the pleasure of it is from the

1343
01:15:52.439 --> 01:15:55.879
relief of that suffering. Nietzsche doesn't have that view

1344
01:15:55.890 --> 01:16:00.089
at all, right? He actually associates aesthetic uh experience

1345
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.029
with um a sort of activation of the will,

1346
01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.250
right? He describes it as a form of intoxication,

1347
01:16:07.259 --> 01:16:09.779
right? Rausch uses this term, it's almost like a

1348
01:16:10.259 --> 01:16:12.370
yeah, like a a like a drug rush or

1349
01:16:12.379 --> 01:16:14.500
something like this, you become in your will, becomes

1350
01:16:14.509 --> 01:16:18.540
enticed and excited and stimulated. And he thinks that

1351
01:16:18.549 --> 01:16:23.700
why is this important? Because if you present features

1352
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:26.819
of the world which in individually look ugly and

1353
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:30.950
and revolting, right? Like suffering if you present them

1354
01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:33.589
in a way which can make them appear beautiful.

1355
01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:39.370
It gives you this kind of distorted perspective, right?

1356
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:42.439
Um Which is, which is strange because it's not

1357
01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:45.600
like it's, it's the painting or whatever depicting the

1358
01:16:45.609 --> 01:16:48.120
scene of suffering is distracting you from suffering. In

1359
01:16:48.129 --> 01:16:50.029
fact, many of these paintings can be very gory

1360
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.879
and, and, you know, horrific. So you're, you're confronted

1361
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.100
with it, but it's presented in such a way

1362
01:16:56.109 --> 01:17:00.100
through, through artistic finesse and skill that it's enticing

1363
01:17:00.109 --> 01:17:02.740
and stimulating to the will. And so what he

1364
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:06.319
thinks is going on is that aesthetic experience can

1365
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.759
almost sort of bring you back to affirming life

1366
01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:12.919
because it, it, it, yeah, invigorates your will, it

1367
01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:16.439
stimulates it rather than tries to suppress it. Um

1368
01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:18.330
And so aesthetic experience for him is gonna be

1369
01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:21.620
crucial in combating pessimism. Um BECAUSE not only would

1370
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:24.200
it maybe present things which we typically take to

1371
01:17:24.209 --> 01:17:28.319
be objectionable in sort of a beautiful manner, but

1372
01:17:28.819 --> 01:17:32.290
it will actually have a physiological effect, right? And

1373
01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:34.049
this is this is if that's what gives rise

1374
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.319
to pessimism, ultimately, that's gonna be the way that

1375
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:39.180
you combat it by invigorating the will, finding your,

1376
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:43.040
so trying to sort of effectively reattach your will

1377
01:17:43.879 --> 01:17:47.100
to life, right? Finding it as something beautiful. And

1378
01:17:47.109 --> 01:17:49.939
of course, for the strongest types of people, he

1379
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:51.779
thinks that they will be able to take up

1380
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:54.729
a kind of aesthetic perspective on life in some

1381
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:59.140
kind of stable, broad, broad manner, right? And I

1382
01:17:59.149 --> 01:18:01.939
think that this is again, probably only gonna be

1383
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:05.220
reserved for the few. But um something which he,

1384
01:18:05.759 --> 01:18:08.279
he, he um thinks is i it is a

1385
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:11.450
possible way of responding to, to pessimism. Yeah,

1386
01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:14.709
great. So I think this is probably a good

1387
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.810
point to wrap up our conversation on and the

1388
01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:21.779
book is again, Nietzsche's struggle against pessimism. Of course,

1389
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:23.779
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1390
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:27.279

1391
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:29.500
