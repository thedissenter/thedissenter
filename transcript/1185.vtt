00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.109
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:06.300
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.060
today I'm joined by Doctor Giovanni Rolo. He's professor

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.430
of philosophy at Federal University of Bahia in Brazil,

5
00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.260
and today we're going to talk about in activism,

6
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:23.979
ecological psychology, and embodied cognition and the combination of

7
00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:27.409
them. So, uh, Giovanni, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.780
a huge pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.979
Thank you so much, Ricardo. It's uh lovely to

10
00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.810
be here. I'm very glad that you invited me.

11
00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:36.939
It's uh an amazing opportunity to talk about my

12
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.619
work and I am so glad to be here.

13
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.680
Sure, it's my pleasure. So, let me ask you

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.659
first about an activism. So what is an activism

15
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.200
and by the way, what got you interested in

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.680
an activism as an approach in cognitive science?

17
00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.369
OK, so, well, to put it simply, an activism

18
00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:03.009
is a relatively recent approach to the cognitive sciences

19
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.010
and philosophy of the mind, let's say in the

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.440
last 30 years, a little bit more. And it

21
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.919
emphasizes the continuity between life and mind, autonomous action,

22
00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.480
and consequently bodily morphology in its account of cognitive

23
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.889
phenomenon, phenomena. So, um, This is the, the, the

24
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.919
general picture of course there are different branches of

25
00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:27.019
an activism we can talk about that later, but

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.800
in general an activists claim that in order to

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.000
understand how the mind works we gotta understand how

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.480
the organism acts in, in its environment and how

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.480
it maintains the dynamics with its, uh, environmental setting.

30
00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.000
So and how those dynamics matter for said organism

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.220
matter at a very fundamental biological level. So whereas

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.050
a more traditional account would explain the cognitive states

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.879
as processes uh that have uh let's say semantic

34
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.309
content and carry information for the for the organism

35
00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:06.309
of information about the digital sources of stimuli and

36
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.559
activism takes a different approach and I got into

37
00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.850
it because I was. Well, I was interested in

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.419
understanding, uh, let's say how, how we could naturalize

39
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:24.750
perceptual states, uh, how to naturalize perceptual states, and

40
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.710
I saw that as a viable opportunity to, to

41
00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.149
let's say to, to, to deal with this issue

42
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.210
from a philosophical standpoint but also a philosophical standpoint

43
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.410
that has scientific uh a very, uh. Let's say

44
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.350
a solid scientific background.

45
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.779
Mhm, BUT I mean since you mentioned that in

46
00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.690
activism is a fairly recent approach in cognitive science,

47
00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:55.059
how would you compare it to the more traditional

48
00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:59.600
approaches there and I mean, uh, uh, how much

49
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.020
scientific support would you say it has?

50
00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.309
OK, so, basically, I think that. The the main

51
00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.429
difference is about. The The foundational question for the

52
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.949
cognitive sciences, which is what is the mind, whereas

53
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.570
a more traditional approach would take it as essentially

54
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.869
a matter of representing the external world and it

55
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.970
is how it is the, the, the outcome of

56
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.839
the, the cognitive revolution in the 50s. And uh

57
00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.419
as a way to move beyond behaviorism which would

58
00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.940
neglect the kind of internal states that the mind,

59
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.919
the mind supposedly has and that is the, the,

60
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.259
the general picture for the traditional approach that the

61
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.179
mind is a computation machine that uh represent the

62
00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:52.820
external world and this has been the ongoing mainstream

63
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.479
cognitive sciences in the last months. 70 years, 80

64
00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.949
years, and in activism, well, it's fairly recent. We

65
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.949
used to say that, uh, the Embodied Mind, the,

66
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.110
the book by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor

67
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.899
Rush is the, the locus Classicus of the negative

68
00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.070
Approach, but also you have earlier work by Francisco

69
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.970
Varela and uh, uh, even before that you have

70
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.559
Gibson working on ecological psychology which is against the

71
00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:24.100
me. The mainstream of the cognitive sciences and from,

72
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.119
well. From the philosophical standpoint, and activism suggests that

73
00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:31.609
change of picture that that's not what the mind

74
00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:34.489
is supposed to do. And then when you look

75
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:37.630
at the evidence of how organisms behave and how

76
00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:42.130
we could not imple implement and uh. Build artificial

77
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.899
agents based on the. Ancient picture, the cognitivist picture

78
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.609
with the same success as we do in navigating

79
00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:53.260
our environments, this counts as a kind of empirical

80
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.660
evidence, but the, the, the, the turning point is

81
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.480
to think of the mind as not, uh, as

82
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.579
our cognitive systems in general, not as representing the

83
00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:08.940
external world, but as enabling the organism to act

84
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.559
in its environment and for this you need to.

85
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.769
To, to have a body that is, uh, that

86
00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:20.279
sustains a certain dynamic with its environment, so. In

87
00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.470
terms of empirical uh support, I would say that

88
00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.609
most empirical support comes from the experiments that were

89
00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:30.010
conducted by the ecological psychologists. They are not an

90
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.279
activist, of course, they are in the neighboring, uh,

91
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.390
they, they are a neighboring approach in a way,

92
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.010
but I think that the large amount of evidence

93
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.070
that they have, they have gathered in the last.

94
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.079
Uh, 40 years or so could be used to

95
00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:48.480
support also an activist approach to the cognitive science

96
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.079
because I think cognitive, uh, uh, an activism is

97
00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:58.690
a philosophical, uh, it's an attempt to change the,

98
00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:00.390
the, the point of view of the cognitive science

99
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.559
from the philosophical, uh, point of view. So that's

100
00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.519
the, that would, that I would say it's the

101
00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:07.239
main difference.

102
00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:10.459
Mhm. Yes, and we're going to get also into

103
00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:14.859
ecological psychology later in our conversation, but so do

104
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:17.920
you think then that an activism has the potential

105
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.329
to provide us with a stronger or more robust

106
00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:28.290
explanatory framework of the mind than uh cognitivism and

107
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.779
computational slash representational approaches to the mind?

108
00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:35.980
I think at least it has the potential to

109
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.429
offer a different picture. OK, and maybe we will

110
00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.109
need, uh, to assume a pluralist stance and try

111
00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:46.839
to, to analyze different aspects of cognition from different,

112
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:50.510
uh, standpoints, but at the very least I think

113
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.630
an activism raises important questions about, well, what were

114
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.950
we neglecting in the, the, the old school cognitivist

115
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.700
way of thinking about mind, but Maybe this is

116
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.000
not something that will be settled empirically, I guess

117
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.649
it's something about uh the foundational concepts of well

118
00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.059
defining what the mind is and uh defining what

119
00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.839
cognition is and of course we can search for

120
00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:20.399
partial evidence that support either, either one of those

121
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.910
those views, but I think. Thinking of the mind

122
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.230
as a computation, uh, a machine that computes information

123
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.970
about the external misses a lot of important things,

124
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.790
and that's what in activism tries to, to bring

125
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.450
forth in this debate.

126
00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:40.450
Oh, OK. And what are some of the things

127
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.160
that, uh, the more traditional approaches miss? Could you

128
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.929
give us some examples just for people to have

129
00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:51.049
a better understanding of what you are talking about

130
00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:54.130
here? Of course, yeah, so when we think about

131
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.279
the mind that way as a machine that computes

132
00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.970
information about the external world, we are assuming a

133
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.049
metaphor that the mind is a comp uh computation

134
00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:08.690
machine. It's like a computer, so essentially a computer

135
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.170
with a different. Hardware, let's say a biological hardware

136
00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:17.890
and that would require us to think that limitations

137
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.470
in implementation of this kind of framework in artificial

138
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.850
agents. Uh, SO limitations of implementation in, in this

139
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.910
case would mean that, well, we just need more

140
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.369
processing capacities and that's not it as we have

141
00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:39.169
seen time and time again. Artificial engines, they do

142
00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.650
not become more like human when you add more

143
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.070
computation capacities to them because there are a lot

144
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.609
of stuff that we do in our everyday scenarios

145
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:51.080
like picking up stuff, walking around the busy street

146
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.460
or stuff like that. That is not exactly a

147
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.780
matter of computing external information but also it's a

148
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.780
matter of attuning to environmental dynamics and as I

149
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.500
said in the beginning, in order to do that

150
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.090
you need to have a a embodied agent that

151
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.580
has physical capacities and has to um explore those

152
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.700
possibilities for action and what I think is. If

153
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:23.390
that was Uh, if Um, Computing external information is

154
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.270
all that we are doing in such cases, then

155
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.989
more processing capacities would be needed to, to deal

156
00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:33.479
with the kind of case that we actually, the,

157
00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:35.510
the kind of stuff we actually do in our

158
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.309
everyday scenarios, but I think that's something that's the

159
00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:41.669
misguided point of view. So that's one point. The

160
00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:44.229
other thing is that when we talk about representing

161
00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:47.710
an external reality, representing an external world, we often

162
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.059
assume, scientists often assume that that's the, the role

163
00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:55.320
of the brain. However, if you look at how

164
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.659
narrow no states. They are activated with. Uh, LET'S

165
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.539
say the execution of a simple task, let's say

166
00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:07.539
perception and picking up some object or opening a

167
00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:11.090
door and stuff like that. Well, neuronsthesis do not

168
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.969
have this semantic capacity of representing something else. They

169
00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:19.750
just, they are, uh, they lit up with, uh,

170
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.650
electrochemical signals, but they are not standing for something

171
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.489
else. This is a conceptual issue. So scientists often

172
00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:30.770
use this vocabulary that is inherited from not only

173
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.250
cognitivism but way before that from modern scientists of

174
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.239
rep of brain states representing the world, but. I

175
00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.159
don't think that is also, I don't, I don't

176
00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:43.000
think that's actually correct. I don't think that brain

177
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.679
states represent the external world. I think that they

178
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:51.469
might covary with certain actions and uh possibilities for

179
00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:53.880
action, but to say that they represent is adding

180
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.489
something more. So in most textbooks you can uh

181
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.000
switch representation of parlance as in brain states represent

182
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.890
external realities. Or brain states representing language or stuff

183
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.690
like that with just activation of neural patterns without

184
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.049
any loss of meaning. So I think that's another

185
00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:19.630
problem, another conceptual problem that people usually import is,

186
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:24.390
um, metaphysical claim about how the brain works, about

187
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.369
the possibility of having semantic states in our neuronal

188
00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:33.190
patterns of brain activation and stuff like that. Without

189
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.710
actually considering the, the, the implication that, well, physical

190
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.169
matter do not, does not represent the external world.

191
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:46.489
Mhm. Do you also consider the other three E's

192
00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:52.390
in 4E cognition? I mean, uh, embodied cognition, uh,

193
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.469
extended cognition, and embedded cognition. Of course, uh we're

194
00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:59.989
going to talk more about embodied cognition in a

195
00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:03.429
bit, but do you also consider the other two

196
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:04.690
E's or not?

197
00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:08.770
Well, I think, uh, usually when you think of

198
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.349
foreign cognitive sciences, we are thinking about embodied cognition

199
00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:18.710
and active cognition embedded and extended, right? So, um.

200
00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:22.049
Some people also had ecological cognition and I don't

201
00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:24.299
know if that was what you were thinking about,

202
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.229
and I've seen talk about emotional cognition in some

203
00:12:27.229 --> 00:12:32.130
places that would make it sexy and also. Um,

204
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.650
I, I, I don't know if we ever get

205
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.330
to 70, but anyways, I, I, I don't like

206
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.530
that label very much because I think that in

207
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.450
activism already implies some variety of embodied cognition, namely

208
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.770
radical embodiment, which is basically this eliminative stance on

209
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.450
mental representations that I was talking about. And on

210
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.489
the other hand, some, some embodied theorists defend a

211
00:12:54.489 --> 00:12:59.919
more conservative view on embodiment, which is. Embodied, uh,

212
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.690
which comprise embodied representations. Think for instance in Barcelo's

213
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.140
work in linguistics that we have embodied representations, but

214
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.690
this goes against an activism. So there's, um, there,

215
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.020
there are fine distinctions that we should make, I

216
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.320
think. And the same thing goes for extended cognition.

217
00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:19.659
If you take for instance Clark and Chalmers' original

218
00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:23.049
work on extended cognition, it is functionalist at score

219
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.500
because it doesn't matter what the hardware is made

220
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.830
of, let's say. It matters how it functions and

221
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.030
so that's why you can have like an external

222
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.369
notebook as a memory instead of only your brain,

223
00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:39.950
but this isn't comfortable with the embodied approach because

224
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.030
the embodied approach rejects functionalism and it claims that

225
00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:47.109
well, the mother, the, the, the, the body is

226
00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:52.929
um fundamental essential for. For cognitive states it's, it's

227
00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:56.729
a constitutive of cognitive states and that the same

228
00:13:56.729 --> 00:14:00.429
thing goes for an activist so. Uh, I try

229
00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:04.119
not to use the term for it anymore. And

230
00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:09.619
uh I think they are more or less. The,

231
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.500
the, the thing is they came about more or

232
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.119
less simultaneously and that's why I think people used

233
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.780
to think that of a single program, but I

234
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.739
think there are many different and I think it's

235
00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:19.700
more important to draw out those lines more clearly.

236
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.080
OK. And uh in your work in cognitive science,

237
00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:30.270
how do you combine them in activism, ecological psychology,

238
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.719
and embodied cognition? I mean, what is the relative

239
00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:39.169
role that each of those frameworks brings into the

240
00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:39.650
picture?

241
00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:44.729
OK, so, um, because I'm a philosopher of cognitive

242
00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:49.090
sciences and, uh, I don't do science myself unfortunately,

243
00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:51.289
much, much agree and I, I'd love to, but,

244
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.539
uh, one thing that I've done in several occasions

245
00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.460
is sort of, uh, to look over the shoulder

246
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.369
of what scientists are doing and how they think

247
00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:05.580
certain experimentscorfume or refute certain philosophical claims. Uh, WHICH

248
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.869
is might not be clearly stated to themselves. Sometimes

249
00:15:08.869 --> 00:15:10.780
that's not usually that's not the, the main goal

250
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.140
of the, the scientists to, to refute the philosophical

251
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.460
claim, but sometimes that's the implication, and then I,

252
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.460
uh, I annoyingly say, well, that's not actually right.

253
00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:22.539
You haven't proved that, you haven't refused that. There

254
00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:25.640
is another explanation, and so on. And in doing

255
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.150
so I try to open some theoretical space to

256
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.239
consider alternative explanations for what seems to be settled

257
00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:35.559
phenomena that seemingly can only be explained in one

258
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:40.669
way or another, so, um. The same thing goes

259
00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:42.710
for embodied cognition. I think embodied cognition goes in

260
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.090
the same direction as a general term for uh

261
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.010
approaches that reconsider the role of the body in

262
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.750
explaining cognitive states and as for ecological psychology, as

263
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.190
I said, I think it's much more empirical than

264
00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:02.140
an activism. And uh it is. Uh, THERE is

265
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.619
a, they, they share some fundamental agreements, of course,

266
00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:09.099
ecological psychologists and activists, they have the same concerns

267
00:16:09.099 --> 00:16:11.780
about what is a viable explanation of how the

268
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.140
mind works in different cases, and it has loads

269
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.500
of empirical evidence to back it up, so which

270
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.239
is always great, and I think ecological psychology, it's

271
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.179
an ally for an activism. Sometimes I have written

272
00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:27.520
in terms of an ecological and active approach or

273
00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:31.799
an active ecological approach whatever. But um. I think

274
00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:34.840
they build a certain picture that can be put

275
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.280
to work together, a very pragmatist picture of how

276
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.280
the mind works that reconsiders the role of the

277
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.799
body and the action of the organism in experimentation.

278
00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:48.929
AND so, uh, earlier you mentioned when I asked

279
00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:53.169
you about who, who, to what extent would, do

280
00:16:53.169 --> 00:16:56.950
you think an activism would be supported by science.

281
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:02.489
You mentioned that ecological psychology would be the framework

282
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:07.108
to provide uh an empirical support for an activism.

283
00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:12.290
So what are ecological and active approaches to cognition

284
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:12.530
then?

285
00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:17.818
Well, OK, so the, the ecological and active approach

286
00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:21.318
tries to combine activism, of course, which is the

287
00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:24.958
claim that cognition emerged from the dynamics between organism

288
00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.999
and environment, and from the ecological view you have

289
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:31.949
the idea that cognitive states. Uh, DETECT or they

290
00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:34.589
involve the detection of information for action and that's

291
00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:38.180
how you can test the, the, the claim, uh,

292
00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:40.390
together they imply that cognition is not in the

293
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.489
head but in the dynamics between the agents and

294
00:17:42.489 --> 00:17:47.430
the environment and to explain these dynamics you use,

295
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.189
you can use the idea of possibilities for action

296
00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:53.239
or affordances and solicitations and that's how you can

297
00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.310
test those views by looking at how agents behave

298
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.130
differently in settings where the affordances changes. Uh, THE

299
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.329
furthest has changed and one very famous case, the

300
00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:07.250
experiment where, uh, subjects are, uh, they, they, they

301
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.869
are given backpacks with certain different weights on it

302
00:18:11.329 --> 00:18:15.969
and, uh, the subjects perceive a slope, it's the

303
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:19.319
same slope for all subjects, but. They perceive it

304
00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:21.810
differently according to the weight of their backpacks, so

305
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.290
that's a very famous, famous kind that you have

306
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.780
several experiments. Uh, THAT that's for instance, the perception

307
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.180
of gaps in the floor if you can jump

308
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.780
then if they are walkable and this relates to

309
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.520
how, um, if I'm not mistaken, of how, how,

310
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.939
uh, elastic is your musculature in your legs or

311
00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:45.579
stuff like that, not your height as one would

312
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:49.869
suppose, and that's how you can see that the

313
00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:53.140
whole, the, the role of the body in cognition

314
00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:56.650
as changing how objects perceive possibilities for action. And

315
00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.489
that's the importance of the ecological and active approach

316
00:18:59.489 --> 00:19:04.010
that uh highlights these aspects so we perceive things

317
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.670
in certain ways because they allow us to act

318
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.609
in certain ways which in turn are constrained by

319
00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:13.530
our bodily morphologies, our current interests and abilities and

320
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.609
this is not to say of course that the

321
00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:19.119
neurodynamics are not important but. They are not the

322
00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:23.119
whole story when we try to understand the mind

323
00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:26.430
and we cannot neglect, neglect the, the, the, the

324
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.439
extra neural body.

325
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.849
Mhm So let me ask you about a topic

326
00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:35.290
that I know you've explored in your work. What

327
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.329
is information in cognitive science? What does it mean

328
00:19:39.329 --> 00:19:44.270
for a cognitive system to acquire information about its

329
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.489
surroundings?

330
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.170
Well, the, the, the notion of information is a

331
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.930
disputable notion because it depends on how you understand

332
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.609
the function of a cognitive system. I mean, it

333
00:19:55.609 --> 00:19:59.140
changes everything, so. A classical view would say that

334
00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.699
the function of cognition of a cognitive system. Is

335
00:20:03.699 --> 00:20:07.859
to represent the external world, uh, and in that

336
00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:11.939
view information could be understood as the semantic content

337
00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:15.260
carried by mental representations about the distal source of

338
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.540
stimuli. So when I perceive something, I have a

339
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.939
distal source of stimuli that the, the, the thing

340
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.619
that causes certain representation, certain stimuli in my, let's

341
00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:28.060
say visual perception of my brain, uh, processes this

342
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.630
as information about that thing. So on that view,

343
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.609
a cognitive system acquires information about something, let's say

344
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:38.750
a given state of affairs. If it has mental

345
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.959
representations that Uh, were acquired through very specific means.

346
00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:48.060
As in this example of visual stimulation. Information would

347
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.180
be the semantic content of mental representations in that

348
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.780
field that takes the mind as a computer that

349
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.260
represents the external world and that would be the

350
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.339
classical view which I think activism has a strong

351
00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:06.020
case to to reject for very specific reasons. I

352
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.219
don't want to uh to enter those reasons, but

353
00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:11.489
basically it's, as I said in the beginning, it's

354
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:16.109
very hard to. Naturalize this notion of mental representation.

355
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.089
It's very implausible that we, we will ever be

356
00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:24.109
able to do that, and it requires rethinking about

357
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.890
the, the rethinking the role of information for, for

358
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.689
an activism, or we can, I don't think we

359
00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.829
should, but some people say that we should, uh.

360
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.680
Uh Forego this notion altogether. I don't think that's

361
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.439
correct. I think we can talk about a plausible

362
00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:44.930
view of information that is not committed to, uh,

363
00:21:44.989 --> 00:21:48.040
uh, semantic content of the excel mode.

364
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.000
OK, and what would such a view be? I

365
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.560
mean, is there an inactive ecological approach because that's

366
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.170
the kind of approach you bring into your work,

367
00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:02.880
uh, to information.

368
00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:06.569
So, um, what I take from radical and activism,

369
00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.949
which is one branch of, uh, an activism, the,

370
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.260
the recent branch by Danhuto and Narik Min, is

371
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.979
that information is a matter of covariation between states

372
00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:18.780
of affairs. So my perceptual state of readines to

373
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.719
action, let's say, of grasping an object. Covaries with

374
00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:27.369
the affordances for that object. When I perceive a

375
00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:31.790
cup of water, I have this redness, uh, to

376
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.869
action that varies with my perceptual state. And this,

377
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.989
of course, involves a specific pattern of neuron activation.

378
00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:42.380
But the idea is that nowhere in this picture

379
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.739
we are forced to assume that they stimulate calls

380
00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:48.500
in the representations of external states and uh all

381
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.380
we have here so far is a matter of

382
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:58.140
covariation and this is scientifically viable. So, assuming that

383
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.060
the environment is favorable to my perception that there

384
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.699
is no, uh, if everything goes all right, let's

385
00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:07.900
say, and that my skill set is sufficiently well

386
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.569
developed. Um, THAT'S the, the part that I developed

387
00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:15.930
with my very good friend Eros Carvallo. I minimize

388
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.569
uncertainty by enacting a certain sensory model scheme, let's

389
00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:22.469
say, uh, extending my arm and grasping that object.

390
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.640
So I see a cup of water and I,

391
00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:27.689
uh, had this redness to action, and I, I

392
00:23:27.689 --> 00:23:29.530
want to grab, this is in my interest to

393
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.040
grasp and to drink the water. I extend my

394
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.209
arm and grasp the, the cup of water. I

395
00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:41.089
am minimizing, uh, uncertainty because. The the action of

396
00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:45.010
that sensor motor scheme. Covaries with the end goal

397
00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.660
grasping the object. That's how I, I know that

398
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.900
if I do this, of course I don't need

399
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.219
to represent that consciously. I don't need to think

400
00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:55.859
about that. I just do it, but I know

401
00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:59.089
that, or I have the know-how of extending my

402
00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:01.300
arm and grasping the, the cup of water and

403
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.900
bringing it to my mouth is sufficient to, to,

404
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.099
to my goal. And of course there are many

405
00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:10.650
different actions I could take. In that scenario that

406
00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.410
would not lead to the success of drinking the

407
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.770
water. I could just, I could drop it, I

408
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.369
could miss, I could do a lot of stuff

409
00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:23.489
and um. The, the importance of uh embodying know-how

410
00:24:23.489 --> 00:24:25.939
is to minimize uncertainty in this case.

411
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.359
Uh, Tell us more about know-how. I mean, what

412
00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:34.500
is know-how and particularly what is embodied know-how?

413
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:38.140
OK, so, um. You know how is, of course,

414
00:24:38.189 --> 00:24:43.400
the type of knowledge, it's uh. It, it has

415
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.680
been distinguished from knowing that propositional knowledge. So for

416
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.339
those who are not familiar in, in this literature,

417
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.829
propositional knowledge has been the, the. The main kind

418
00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.069
of knowledge is studied in the philosophical debate in

419
00:24:57.069 --> 00:25:01.069
the last 100 years or so, and that is

420
00:25:01.069 --> 00:25:04.510
knowing that something is so and so. Now how

421
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.869
on the other hand, is practical knowledge in principle

422
00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:09.510
at least it seems to be so. It's the

423
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.790
kind of knowledge that implies having an ability to

424
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.739
do something and propositional knowledge, on the other hand,

425
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:18.150
is a knowledge that something so and so, as

426
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.790
I said, and they seem to be different kinds

427
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:25.719
of knowledge. However, some have tried to, to reduce

428
00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:27.520
one kind of knowledge to the other. Some have,

429
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.459
some have argued that know-how is no different from

430
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.979
knowing that, and some other philosophers have argued that

431
00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:38.880
those are in fact distinct kinds of knowledge, but

432
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.900
the idea is that. In my take that know-how

433
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.390
is not about representing the world with accuracy and

434
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:48.910
justification as propositional knowledge, and one example for that

435
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.189
is knowing how to practice a sport. If you

436
00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:56.400
acquire and refine the relevant sets, set of skills,

437
00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:59.119
you don't, you do not need to, to hold

438
00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:01.150
any particular belief about the stuff you are doing.

439
00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:05.050
You just Exercise those skills in playing that sport,

440
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:11.189
let's say. Uh, FOOTBALL or whatever, tennis, whatever you

441
00:26:11.189 --> 00:26:15.219
think. Of course you can enter that reflective stage

442
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:18.099
if you are sufficiently proficient in that activity. You

443
00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:20.660
can think about stuff while you are doing, but,

444
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.180
and this actually helps athletes in some cases, but

445
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.599
it is not necessary for you to have that,

446
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.420
uh, it's unnecessary to have success in engaging in

447
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.739
that activity to have this this reflective state. All

448
00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:37.150
you need is the relevant know-how in most cases.

449
00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:42.479
So know-how is practical knowledge and, um. I think

450
00:26:42.479 --> 00:26:45.479
there is no fundamental difference between maybe a matter

451
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:48.979
of emphasis between know-how and and body know-how because

452
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.260
I think all know-how is ultimately embodied, but it

453
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.800
might seem not to be the case in some

454
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.760
particular cases when we think about, for instance, our

455
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.839
ability to master symbols using a language. It seems

456
00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.780
to be disembodied at first glance. It seems that.

457
00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:07.489
It doesn't matter the the body you have in

458
00:27:07.489 --> 00:27:09.780
order to understand a given language, but I think

459
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.160
that misses the bigger part of the picture because,

460
00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:15.930
well, you have to emit sounds and you have

461
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:20.920
to, to grasp objects and manipulate objects to, to,

462
00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:25.060
to write symbols, so it's not entirely true that

463
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.939
it's not true that, uh, mastering a language is

464
00:27:27.939 --> 00:27:32.979
a matter of disembodying of how so. However, First

465
00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:38.079
appearance, I think that all know-how is embodied. Uh,

466
00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:41.020
IF you take the, the that, well, you need

467
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.619
to have a body to exercise the abilities that

468
00:27:43.619 --> 00:27:48.489
are relevant for know-how. Uh, WELL, please go on.

469
00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:51.069
Uh, NO, I, I mean, do you want to

470
00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.569
have something, or?

471
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.989
Well, I mean, I think that's that that's a

472
00:27:57.989 --> 00:28:02.770
bit more, um, it's a bit more bold, but

473
00:28:03.189 --> 00:28:06.589
I think that propositional knowledge also involves know-how, so

474
00:28:06.589 --> 00:28:11.609
propositional knowledge, knowing that er something is the case

475
00:28:11.989 --> 00:28:15.380
involves knowing how to articulate symbols. So I also

476
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.660
think that very indirectly propositional knowledge is also embodied

477
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.680
in a way, but that's very speculative. I, I,

478
00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:25.619
I, I don't have enough uh uh well articulated

479
00:28:25.619 --> 00:28:28.449
reason to. To defend that view, but I think

480
00:28:28.449 --> 00:28:32.530
that ultimately even propositional knowledge is embodied, but in

481
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.569
an indirect manner.

482
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.050
Yeah, uh, tell us about this an activist conception

483
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.939
of bringing forth a world. What does that mean?

484
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.050
Well, OK, so, um, the, the, this phrase bringing

485
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.349
forth a world, it occurs. Uh, AS far as

486
00:28:51.349 --> 00:28:53.619
I can tell, the first time in the, in,

487
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.589
in the Embodied Mind, that book by Francisco Varela,

488
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.770
Evan Thompson, and Eleonor Rush. And it is used

489
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.849
to explain how the inactive conception evades both a

490
00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:08.880
certain realistic climate and then. Uh, uh, uh, AN

491
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.319
idealist inclined views in the, the cognitive science, both

492
00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:16.719
realist and idealist takes in the that that there

493
00:29:16.719 --> 00:29:19.280
are certain undertones in the cognitive sciences of the

494
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.040
day that could go either way. So, uh, the

495
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.199
kind of realism that the authors of The Embodied

496
00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:30.280
Mind were concerned about. Is the view that cognitive

497
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.109
systems, they simply capture the outside world through inner

498
00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:36.680
models or mental representation. So you have the outside

499
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.040
world and the, the role of the cognitive system

500
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.520
is to capture it so that's it, to represent

501
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.839
it to, to, to receive information and rebuild it

502
00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:51.699
in internally as to mirror the outside world. And

503
00:29:51.699 --> 00:29:55.709
the idealist inclined view on the other hand, assumes

504
00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:59.550
that cognitive systems project the inner structure onto the

505
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.550
world. So as they do that, they not only

506
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:07.819
receive. Information from the outside they also projected onto

507
00:30:07.819 --> 00:30:12.859
how they structured this stimuli. Both are very prevalent

508
00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:15.319
in the cognitive sciences to this day, and you

509
00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:17.530
can see the curse shifting either way depending on

510
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:22.650
the, the case, so. The point is that in

511
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.819
virtue of the fact that living beings, they explore

512
00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:28.699
the relevant features of the environment as an activists

513
00:30:28.699 --> 00:30:33.069
claim. Uh, THEY bring forth a world of significance.

514
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.729
And this is often understood metaphorically. In most literature

515
00:30:39.729 --> 00:30:42.939
about an activism, this phrase is understood as a

516
00:30:42.939 --> 00:30:47.050
metaphor for perceiving what matters for the organism and

517
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.770
indeed at the time of the embodied mind there

518
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.849
were not many references in evolutionary biology to back

519
00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:56.319
up a more literal control of that claim. But

520
00:30:56.319 --> 00:31:01.160
now we have evolutionary, uh, synthesis, extended evolutionary synthesis,

521
00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:05.160
the view that other factors beyond trait selection should

522
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.439
be accounted to explain evolution, and one of those

523
00:31:08.439 --> 00:31:12.520
factors is niche construction. Uh, THE idea is that

524
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.469
organisms. Affected surroundings by their doings and in doing

525
00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:21.109
so they, they shape their reality by building their

526
00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:25.770
niche, and this changed reality, this cumulatively changed reality

527
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.300
of the world. It, it, it is brought forth

528
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.739
by previous generations and it's a non-generic inheritance that

529
00:31:33.739 --> 00:31:37.959
affects future generations. So it's, uh, this is the

530
00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:43.000
kind of evolutionary dynamics that we, uh, Nara Figueredo,

531
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.400
a good friend of mine and I argued that

532
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.599
it provides some basis for a literal construct of

533
00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:54.510
bringing forth a world. Organisms actually shape the reality,

534
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.959
and this is a fact, this, this is in

535
00:31:56.959 --> 00:31:59.800
fact a matter of not a naive realism, but

536
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.719
a, let's say a constructivist realist, uh, constructivist realism.

537
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:09.709
That could be understood as the metaphysical, uh, import

538
00:32:09.709 --> 00:32:13.420
of the negative approach to cognitive sciences that we

539
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.699
actually bring forth a world, not only metaphorical but

540
00:32:16.699 --> 00:32:17.199
literally.

541
00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:21.849
Mhm. Uh, ON the topic of evolution, I mean

542
00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:25.890
evolution by natural selection, and you also mentioned there

543
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.290
the extended evolutionary synthesis and Uh, phenomenon like niche

544
00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:35.209
construction. What is evolution as natural drift and tell

545
00:32:35.209 --> 00:32:40.189
us about this idea of how structural couplings between

546
00:32:40.189 --> 00:32:44.650
organism and environment trigger viable pathways of maintenance and

547
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:50.290
reproduction instead of, uh, simply selecting the most adapted

548
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.949
traits to a pre-given environment.

549
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.380
OK, so, uh, the claimed natural drift, I think,

550
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.260
is the, the, the, the, the phrase natural drift,

551
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.579
the label is the idea that Maturan and Empodos

552
00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:05.939
is developed. I think they, they did so first

553
00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:09.680
in Spanish if I'm not mistaken. And which later

554
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.239
Evan Thompson called an active evolution. And it's a

555
00:33:13.239 --> 00:33:17.160
very programmatic idea that evolution is not the passive

556
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.380
selection of the fittest. But the evolution makes room

557
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.520
for general constraints within which organisms develop the structural

558
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.089
couplings or as I, I've been using the term

559
00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:33.069
dynamics more loosely, but their dynamics with the environment

560
00:33:33.069 --> 00:33:36.510
that allow them to strive and I think natural

561
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.550
gift is an interesting idea. It is underdeveloped, I

562
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:45.750
think, in the literature, um. It's very programmatic, as

563
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.310
I said, but, uh, to my mind, I, I

564
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.619
think the latest work on it is Evan Thompson's

565
00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:56.589
2007 book that has, it dedicates a few chapters

566
00:33:56.589 --> 00:34:01.369
or sections on it, but, um. The idea is

567
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:04.609
interesting to account for evolution in a similar way

568
00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:11.389
that. Autopoetic theory accounts for, uh, life in general,

569
00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.020
so that's what Matuan and and Podols were trying

570
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.168
to do. But um we try to fit that

571
00:34:17.168 --> 00:34:20.858
in our argument, Na and I. Uh, TO some

572
00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:24.178
success, I think that we recognize that, well, there

573
00:34:24.178 --> 00:34:27.739
is also something here that leads to the inactive

574
00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:33.300
idea that organisms are not simply. Passively, uh, under

575
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.719
environmental constraints they are, they are also acting upon

576
00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.080
the environment. So this is how we try to

577
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.120
fit in with the discussion of niche construction, which

578
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.510
is very clearly the idea that the organisms, they

579
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.510
act upon the environment and in so doing they

580
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:52.300
affect their evolutionary pathways. And it is, of course,

581
00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:55.080
the authors that defend ni niche construction are not

582
00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.340
originally concerned with the inactive uh approach or the

583
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.250
debate in the cognitive sciences. Um, AS you look

584
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.850
at work by Laland and others, but even though

585
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.370
they do not use the term an active approach

586
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.600
to evolution, it's very clearly consistent with the stake.

587
00:35:15.459 --> 00:35:18.189
They come from a different background from the evolutionary

588
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.570
biology, but it seems that it is, they are

589
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.169
working in a similar direction as Maura and Empatosis

590
00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:27.689
and later on Varela and Thompson when they were

591
00:35:27.689 --> 00:35:29.090
talking about an active evolution.

592
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.830
And what is then more broadly the link between

593
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.350
in activism and evolutionary dynamics?

594
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:45.860
Well, um, the, the core activist idea is to

595
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.260
bring the organism, the, the living organism to the

596
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.179
center of the cognitive sciences, which means to think

597
00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:56.300
of living systems not as. Passive recipients of external

598
00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.389
forces. And external stimuli, but as creatures that act

599
00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:04.969
upon their environments. So if we extend that view

600
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.340
of life as some people use the term adaptive

601
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.189
autonomy from the cognitive sciences to evolutionary biology, the

602
00:36:12.189 --> 00:36:15.669
idea is that Uh, to think of living systems

603
00:36:15.669 --> 00:36:20.399
as particularly responsible for their evolutionary pathways, of course,

604
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:24.370
not as if living systems know the end goal

605
00:36:24.419 --> 00:36:26.110
of the evolvolution, of course they do not know

606
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.790
that, but the way they act upon their environment

607
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.629
affects their evolutionary pathways, meaning that they are not

608
00:36:31.629 --> 00:36:37.429
simply subject to evolutionary pressures as the modern evolutionary

609
00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:41.290
synthesis. Would, uh, would claim that we only select

610
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:47.300
traits that enable survival. Mhm. So, as I said,

611
00:36:47.379 --> 00:36:49.419
I think niche construction is one way to meet

612
00:36:49.419 --> 00:36:53.020
that condition, and I find a lot of similarities

613
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.110
between niche construction theory and the general lines of

614
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.070
the actual an active, uh, theory of evolution and.

615
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.050
That's one way to cash out this idea that

616
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.050
we are. Partially responsible in a, in a sense

617
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.449
that what we do matters for our evolutionary pathways

618
00:37:10.449 --> 00:37:13.010
in the same way that what we do matters

619
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.939
for our self-maintenance as individual systems or uh living

620
00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:17.750
organisms.

621
00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:24.780
Mhm. So, uh, another different kind of topic, do

622
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:31.340
pre-linguistic infants have representational abilities, and if so, what

623
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.540
do you think would be the implications of that

624
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.699
for an an activist approach to cognition?

625
00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:42.649
OK, so yeah, uh, regarding the, the, the, the

626
00:37:42.649 --> 00:37:46.199
first part of this question. Uh, WELL, if they

627
00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:49.199
did that, would be a problem for those theories

628
00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:53.370
that claim that the language precedes representational abilities. Which

629
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.290
means that our capacity, capacity to represent internally a

630
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.929
given state of affairs is an outcome of mastering

631
00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:03.610
a language. That's my, my view and, and it's

632
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:08.629
also something that other activists have, have claimed. Um,

633
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.870
In contrast, some cognitivists or most cognitivists would say

634
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.149
that we have an innate ability to represent the

635
00:38:15.149 --> 00:38:19.959
world. This is actually what defines cognativism. So, uh,

636
00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:23.239
some psychologists have tried to show that pre-linguistic children

637
00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:28.239
have. Innate mechanisms to represent the world and they

638
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.290
supposedly have shown that by registering the reaction time

639
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:37.000
of children when observing normal versus unusual scena scenarios,

640
00:38:37.379 --> 00:38:43.570
uh, they can prove that children have this, uh,

641
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:48.590
innate mechanisms for physics and, uh, intuitive physics and

642
00:38:48.979 --> 00:38:52.459
stuff like that, so they create very unusual scenarios.

643
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.969
And they and and normal variant of those scenarios

644
00:38:56.969 --> 00:38:59.850
and they register how long it takes children to

645
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.370
observe paralinguistic children 3 or 4 months old, uh,

646
00:39:03.379 --> 00:39:05.810
for how long they, they observe the, the unusual

647
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:09.280
scenarios in comparison to the usual normal scenarios and

648
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.179
what they noticed is that, um. In normal situations,

649
00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:16.179
the reaction time doesn't change across the board, but

650
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.340
in very, in very unusual scenarios which are designed

651
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.040
by the scientists. To, to be physically impossible, let's

652
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.780
say, by, by, by a matter of trickery they,

653
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:34.239
uh, use, uh, a very elaborate, uh, settings. The

654
00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:36.360
children keep looking at the scenario for a longer

655
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.110
time, for much longer. So, the interpretation, the the

656
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:46.689
empirical data is that they are surprised. Uh, BECAUSE

657
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.159
according to the cognitivist, uh, reading of this empirical

658
00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:56.560
data. They. The, the fiscally impossible stuff violates their

659
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.530
expectations, so it means that they can only have,

660
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.439
that it's only possible to explain that by appealing

661
00:40:03.439 --> 00:40:08.800
to certain innate mechanisms that. Are manifested long before

662
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.610
mastering a language. So in a recent paper I

663
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.820
argued that an activism and in body cognition more

664
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.300
generally have the tools to explain that this difference

665
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.780
in reaction time and it undercuts the representation and

666
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.100
its interpretation of the empirical data. One of these

667
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.540
ways is to argue that in those experiments children

668
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:36.189
must be habituated with the. Then, then Normal scenario,

669
00:40:36.409 --> 00:40:41.070
the, the usual circumstance where nothing magical happens. Before

670
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:45.620
you measure the difference in uh reaction time and

671
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.820
this habituation that happens over several expositions to that

672
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.699
normal scenario creates a certain pattern, a habitual pattern

673
00:40:52.699 --> 00:40:56.419
of sensor motor schemes if you will, and when

674
00:40:56.419 --> 00:41:00.100
you introduce something radically different, they break this pattern.

675
00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:03.760
This borrows from the work by, by Sel 10

676
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.770
and others. But this is one way to say

677
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.989
that, well, this is not what's happening right now.

678
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:13.649
It's not a matter of um. Uh, REPRESENTING, uh,

679
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:17.620
the, the innate mechanism for representation being alert it's

680
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.500
actually the fact that we are breaking the habit

681
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.300
that were that was introduced in the, the experimentation

682
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.709
in the, in the previous phase of the experimentation,

683
00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:27.620
and this is one way to claim that the

684
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.520
other way is to say that well. And I

685
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.560
was following the work by that Nan and I

686
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.820
did together a few years before that that well

687
00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:41.760
we bring forth a very fiscally stable world and

688
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:46.520
we select by in virtue of that um. Uh,

689
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.500
COGNITIVE, uh, mechanisms to engage with, with a fiscally

690
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:57.169
stable world. So when something. SEEMINGLY physically impossible happens.

691
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.010
Our cognitive states and our cognitive capacities are not

692
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.330
endowed with, with the, the means to deal with

693
00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.489
that, so it's, it's, it's plausible that we even

694
00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:11.719
before mastering a language, there's something. Uh, AWKWARD in

695
00:42:11.719 --> 00:42:15.459
that that, uh, draws our attention, but that's mainly

696
00:42:15.459 --> 00:42:20.199
because over our evolutionary history, the, the, the world

697
00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:22.199
we have been dealing with is very physically stable.

698
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.719
So if one object simply disappears at one end

699
00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:28.600
of the disciplinary and reappears at the other, then

700
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.679
something must be amiss. And this is the kind

701
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:32.639
of experiment that the psychologists were doing in the

702
00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:36.239
80s. They were doing several different experiments where children

703
00:42:36.239 --> 00:42:41.050
would look at this. Elaborate scenario where things would

704
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.590
disappear or reappear or be um cut in half

705
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.290
and uh and you wouldn't notice that they are

706
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.929
different parts of the same object or stuff like

707
00:42:49.929 --> 00:42:53.500
that. And well, these are the, the two main

708
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.479
explanations that go. Against the mainstream literature in the

709
00:42:58.479 --> 00:43:00.439
cognitive sciences that would say that well of course

710
00:43:00.439 --> 00:43:03.959
they have innate mechanisms to represent the world because

711
00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:06.280
they are surprised and are and my my attempt

712
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.959
is to say well that's it doesn't follow you,

713
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.840
you can have alternative explanations that do not appeal

714
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.439
to representational abilities even in paralinguistic children so it

715
00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:19.739
might still be the case that our representational abilities,

716
00:43:20.239 --> 00:43:24.060
they show up. After we have developed a language

717
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.800
and mastered the public symbols that characterize the language.

718
00:43:28.389 --> 00:43:32.239
Yeah, that's, that's really interesting. So, uh, you mentioned

719
00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:37.570
several times during our conversation, uh, radical inactivism. So

720
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.439
tell us more about that. What is radically inactive

721
00:43:41.439 --> 00:43:42.040
cognition?

722
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:47.870
Well, the, then the, the, the phrase radical and

723
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.830
active cognition comes from Hutu and Dan Hutu and

724
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:56.629
Eric Me's work of the book on, uh, radicalizing

725
00:43:56.629 --> 00:44:00.310
activism that was released in 2013 and draw a

726
00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:05.429
lot of attention because. Therein they argue that. Uh,

727
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.189
EVEN some activists, uh, and activists are not being

728
00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:12.520
as radical as they claim because they are making

729
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.989
concessions to, uh, cognitive, cognitivism in their work. So

730
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.449
Hutu and Min, they argue that. They defend the

731
00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:27.850
an eliminative stance on representational content because they argue

732
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:31.090
that it is impossible to naturalize. Basically the idea

733
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:36.000
is that, well. Um, I think, I, I said

734
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.149
that at the beginning, but. Representational content implies that

735
00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:47.090
patterns of neuron activation have semantic content and you

736
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.010
cannot find that in nature. You cannot find semantic

737
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.530
content in nature in a way semantic content is

738
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.810
in the eye of the beholder. We ascribe it

739
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.530
to neuron neuro states. We see a pattern of

740
00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.969
neuron activation and see the execution of a certain

741
00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:03.969
task or perception of an object, whatever, and we

742
00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:07.209
say that this represents that, but that's our description.

743
00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:10.300
Because we are endowed with a language to do

744
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.080
so and radical and activism is the claim that

745
00:45:13.379 --> 00:45:17.580
even some other activists are actually doing something similar

746
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.580
when attack, for instance, of sense making, which is

747
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.820
a core concept in traditional and activist literature and

748
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.500
this, as I said, drew a lot of attention

749
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.979
because, uh, it is in a way a kind

750
00:45:29.979 --> 00:45:33.580
of friendly fire in the in the activist trenches

751
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:40.580
against cog cognunitivism because. Well, um, it tries to,

752
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.159
to sanitize an activism from implicit cognitive bias, and

753
00:45:46.159 --> 00:45:48.439
I do not think that that's the case for

754
00:45:48.439 --> 00:45:51.719
sense making exactly. I think we can defend the

755
00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:54.800
idea of sense making as the notion that organisms

756
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.209
perceive. And engage in their environment according to how

757
00:45:59.209 --> 00:46:03.639
those engagements matter to them. And I think that

758
00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:07.080
we can preserve sense-making as something that is in

759
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.149
principle compatible with radical and activism. But some other

760
00:46:12.149 --> 00:46:16.310
works from an activist adjacent literature such as Alva

761
00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:21.469
Know's work on sensory motor and activism. That I

762
00:46:21.469 --> 00:46:24.669
think is more complicated because he claims that perception

763
00:46:24.669 --> 00:46:29.229
is a matter of understanding how. The world would

764
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.310
unfold through my actions and this understanding how even

765
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.169
though it's not at surface level a matter of

766
00:46:36.379 --> 00:46:40.870
propositional knowledge seems to be understanding that the world

767
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.189
will behave so and so if I act so

768
00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:50.189
and so so. Radical activism and activism. Tries to

769
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.810
clean the, the nativist literature from that language and

770
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.729
in so doing, of course, it, it takes a

771
00:46:57.729 --> 00:47:04.149
very. Strong stance against some other and activist approaches.

772
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.909
But basically the idea is that we have no.

773
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.360
Um, We do, we do not have good grounds

774
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.540
to defend, uh, the existence of mental representations, and

775
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.689
we should. Uh, RECTIFY our scientific language from this

776
00:47:23.689 --> 00:47:24.209
usage.

777
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.580
And how about high cognition? Do you think it

778
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.100
can be explained by an activism and embodied cognition?

779
00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:39.860
Well, I think so because uh higher higher cognition

780
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.939
is. Uh, IT depends on how you cut the,

781
00:47:43.989 --> 00:47:46.909
the, where you draw the line between basic or

782
00:47:46.909 --> 00:47:49.949
low and higher cognition, but basically the idea is

783
00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:54.639
that certain aspects of human cognitive performance are radically

784
00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.800
different from how other animals behave in their environments,

785
00:47:59.229 --> 00:48:03.979
and the idea of, uh, explaining higher cognition through,

786
00:48:05.429 --> 00:48:09.020
uh, an activist means is. To take a bottom-up

787
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:14.090
approach that begins with the relation between. Basic biological

788
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.850
processes and basic cognition, basic intentionality, basic, basic kind

789
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:23.979
of directness to the world. And work upwards toward

790
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.639
towards more complex cases of cognition such as um.

791
00:48:29.939 --> 00:48:35.280
Language use and uh influential abilities and. Reasoning and

792
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.429
counterfactual reasoning and stuff like that, stuff that does

793
00:48:38.429 --> 00:48:42.320
not involve the immediate environment so of course we

794
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.709
are capable of doing those things. I can think

795
00:48:44.709 --> 00:48:48.399
of what I will uh do this weekend or

796
00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:52.340
what I have done in the past or if

797
00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:55.280
something happens I will do something else. So all

798
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.080
of these cases they are at surface at least

799
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.020
very different from. Picking up stuff from my desk

800
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.360
or writing in the computer where the physical environment

801
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.780
is the object of my engagement, but in most

802
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.780
of those cases I mentioned, there is no physical

803
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.139
environment environment to engage with, so the attempt to

804
00:49:18.139 --> 00:49:21.979
explain those other cases of cognitive processes that are

805
00:49:21.979 --> 00:49:25.199
seemingly different. From that there are more than one,

806
00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:29.110
there are different approaches to do that, but the

807
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.469
one that I favor is that once, and this

808
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:35.189
is not something that I created again, I defer

809
00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:36.739
to the work of Dan Huto and Eric Min,

810
00:49:37.469 --> 00:49:40.969
but once we managed to master symbolic use by,

811
00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:46.429
uh, engaging in socio-cultural exchanges, something that we do

812
00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:49.959
when we are very little. We enter this capacity

813
00:49:49.959 --> 00:49:53.870
to manipulate symbols and symbols allows us to, uh,

814
00:49:53.879 --> 00:49:57.889
symbols allow us to replace. Absent targets in our

815
00:49:57.889 --> 00:50:03.110
cognitive performances. So, again, coming back to the, the,

816
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:09.629
the question about um how language is, uh, it

817
00:50:09.629 --> 00:50:14.189
precedes representational abilities. The idea is that once we

818
00:50:14.189 --> 00:50:19.530
manage to, to master symbolic uh structures, we can

819
00:50:19.939 --> 00:50:23.340
use them as surrogates for absent targets. And this

820
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:27.280
is something that explains cognition from the bottom up

821
00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:31.659
because we need to explain how certain engagements allow

822
00:50:31.659 --> 00:50:34.899
for the mastering of of a language and how

823
00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:37.780
those exchanges happen at a very young age and

824
00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.260
this of course must happen before we have any

825
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.639
sort of language so the idea is to explain

826
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:53.250
higher cognition, um. Not by assuming innate representational mechanisms

827
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.530
by, uh, which is of course would, which would

828
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.489
be much easier if we're doing that, but from

829
00:51:00.489 --> 00:51:02.810
the bottom up and I think there are tools

830
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.870
to do that. I think we can, uh, explain

831
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:09.729
how we are capable to direct ourselves to absent

832
00:51:09.729 --> 00:51:16.870
stuff by engaging in, uh. Uh, BY, by using

833
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.379
symbols as surrogate songs we have mastered though, they,

834
00:51:19.429 --> 00:51:21.530
they use, the uses of those symbols.

835
00:51:22.669 --> 00:51:25.199
OK, so I have one last question and I'm

836
00:51:25.199 --> 00:51:27.879
still on the topic of higher cognition and to

837
00:51:27.879 --> 00:51:31.580
explore one example of it here. How do you

838
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.989
approach rationality from a radically inactive cognition perspective?

839
00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:43.699
Well, uh, this is, that's a That's a very

840
00:51:43.699 --> 00:51:46.050
interesting question, thank you, Ricardo, because, uh, I came

841
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.780
up with the idea of radically inactive rationality as

842
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.070
a label. Uh, FOR something that I have found

843
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.909
is, is sparsely in the literature before. Uh, Susan

844
00:51:55.909 --> 00:52:00.149
Hurley, 20 years before me. She had asked whether

845
00:52:00.149 --> 00:52:03.209
the pragmatic turn in the cognitive sciences, the negative

846
00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:06.770
turn, had any implications for what we call rationality,

847
00:52:07.199 --> 00:52:11.489
and I believe it has, uh, implications for rationality

848
00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:14.209
and as she did as well in her own

849
00:52:14.209 --> 00:52:19.010
terms. So the idea is that philosophers are used

850
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:22.729
to think of rationality as a symbolic language-based procedure

851
00:52:22.729 --> 00:52:26.810
that happens at the surface level of consciousness and

852
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.219
functions to motivate or justify decisions and beliefs. I

853
00:52:31.219 --> 00:52:35.399
think this is only partially correct. Because it appeals

854
00:52:35.399 --> 00:52:37.600
to a level of rationality that we become endowed

855
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.199
with. To the extent that we master, as I

856
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:45.590
said before, symbolic structures. But if that were the

857
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.510
case, if rationality is this, let's say the tip

858
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.050
of the iceberg phenomenon. Then much of what we

859
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.530
do cannot be considered rational according to the rational,

860
00:52:57.649 --> 00:53:01.250
the, the, to the inactive approach because much of

861
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.250
what we do is not. Symbolic is not contentful,

862
00:53:05.419 --> 00:53:07.699
it's a matter of direct engagement with the environment,

863
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.760
so. It creates a certain problem. Of matching those

864
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.840
two ideas, the, the, the classical idea of rationality

865
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.750
and what an activist, an activism claims that we

866
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.600
actually do when we engage with our environment, so

867
00:53:23.879 --> 00:53:27.080
I suggest that we should reconceive rationality as a

868
00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.239
kind of math ability that enhances adaptive behavior, one

869
00:53:31.239 --> 00:53:34.739
that is not necessarily symbolic. But might be in

870
00:53:34.739 --> 00:53:38.439
some cases that involve reasoning. Reasoning allows us to

871
00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:43.419
enhance our socio-cultural adaptive behavior in order to defend

872
00:53:43.419 --> 00:53:45.500
ourselves and motivate our point of view, but this

873
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.550
is again the tip of the iceberg. And this

874
00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:53.750
mean ability to coordinate multi-level structures allows us, allows

875
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.729
organisms in general to optimize their engagements with the,

876
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:01.229
the environment. That was the idea in very broad

877
00:54:01.229 --> 00:54:09.229
strokes. So To some extent rationality is a tool

878
00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:13.489
that uh allows us to adapt to unforeseen circumstances,

879
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.949
and that's something we excel at, but we are

880
00:54:16.949 --> 00:54:19.330
not the only living means capable of doing so

881
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.229
and the consequence for this is that if this

882
00:54:22.229 --> 00:54:26.149
is correct, rationality is not something exclusively human, which

883
00:54:26.149 --> 00:54:29.260
I, I, I think is a positive consequence because

884
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:36.669
it allows. To situate rationality in this naturalization, uh,

885
00:54:36.679 --> 00:54:43.310
continuum where, well, other organisms adapt in. Sort of

886
00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:47.300
ways that we would consider them partially or almost

887
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.750
as rational as us and it works if you

888
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.580
consider for instance other large primates and other uh

889
00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.649
sufficiently complex organisms and also on the other hand

890
00:54:58.649 --> 00:55:01.699
if you have an organism that is critically unable

891
00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:05.550
to overcome environmental circumstances that are outside of its.

892
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.389
It is, uh, immediate set of abilities. It, it

893
00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:13.830
is fated, fated to, to, to die in there.

894
00:55:13.989 --> 00:55:17.629
So you wouldn't say that it is highly rational.

895
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.850
It is very limited. I think about, for instance,

896
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.909
if you surround the snail with salt, it cannot

897
00:55:23.909 --> 00:55:26.070
go either way. It's stuck there and it is

898
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.709
going to, to die eventually, but more complex organisms

899
00:55:29.709 --> 00:55:34.550
develop ways to. To counteract the environmental circumstances, and

900
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:37.050
I think this is a very minimal account of

901
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:41.439
rationality that is not, well, it's not. Mainstream, of

902
00:55:41.439 --> 00:55:44.590
course, but I think it accounts for. Different problems,

903
00:55:44.669 --> 00:55:48.830
conceptual problems, and allows for a naturalization of rationality

904
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:51.860
as well, so. That's how I understand it.

905
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:57.129
Mhm. Great. So, Doctor Rolla, just before we go,

906
00:55:57.209 --> 00:55:59.520
would you like to tell people where they can

907
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.010
find you and your work on the internet?

908
00:56:02.879 --> 00:56:07.520
Well, um, you can find my website, which is,

909
00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.280
uh, well, I'll give you the address and you

910
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.679
can put on the link description. Uh, THAT'S where

911
00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:16.510
I put all my latest work and some, uh,

912
00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.560
thoughts, some non- philosophical thoughts as well, and that's

913
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.560
where, uh, basically all my, my stuff is.

914
00:56:23.629 --> 00:56:27.110
OK, great. I will include that in the description

915
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:29.669
