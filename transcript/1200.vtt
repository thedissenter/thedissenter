00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.090
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Vicky

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.529
Olse, and today we're going to talk about some

5
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.090
work that she's done, anthropological work on the Atlantic

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.475
and transatlantic slave trade. Which also includes a site

7
00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.504
here where I live in Portugal. So Doctor Oso,

8
00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:25.825
welcome to the show. Welcome back to the show,

9
00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:26.524
actually. Thank,

10
00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:29.174
thank you so much for being on again.

11
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.674
Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you for inviting me and

12
00:00:31.674 --> 00:00:34.115
for giving me the, the opportunity to talk about

13
00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.619
this, this project and this site. Mhm.

14
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.779
So let's start perhaps with a broader question and

15
00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:45.020
get, and then get into specifics here. So, uh,

16
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.200
as I said, we've done work on the Atlantic

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.380
and transatlantic slave trade, particularly through the study of

18
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.540
African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations. I mean, could

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.740
you tell us about that? What did you study

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.540
there specifically? How did you do it and what

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.500
did you learn?

22
00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:09.098
Yeah, um, so the, the basic foundation for, uh,

23
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.499
me as a, you know, biological anthropologist and an

24
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:16.878
isotope nerd, uh, to, to get engaged in, in

25
00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:20.079
the archaeology of the transatlantic slave trade was to

26
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.018
build a foundational isotope map for the African continent,

27
00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:30.360
uh, more specifically for sub-Saharan Africa. And the isotope

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.080
system that I love working with because it's extremely

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.800
powerful is strontium isotope analysis. So where you look

30
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.800
at the uh radiogenic um isotope of strontium, which

31
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.199
is strontium 87, and relate that to the stable

32
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.440
isotope of strontium, strontium 86. And so the strontium

33
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.930
is a, is a trace element that is. Abundant

34
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.050
in nature like everywhere, you know, even here in

35
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.250
the, in the dust in my office here and

36
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.290
it is in your body and my body it

37
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.769
is uh in the in the mouth that I

38
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.760
have here in front of me, uh, but in

39
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.369
trace amounts and uh strontium is a really powerful

40
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.190
tool in bioarchaeology, um, to reconstruct the origin of

41
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.059
an organism. On the planet, particularly based on a

42
00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.419
very geological fingerprint that we can look at with

43
00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.539
strontium. So strontium isotopes primarily relate to the age

44
00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.580
of bedrock, but also to many other factors that

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.699
influence the weathering of this trace element out of

46
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.380
the bedrock and making it. Available to living things,

47
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.740
primarily like first plants and then the animals that

48
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.690
eat those plants and then eventually the humans that

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.389
eat those plants and or those animals in a

50
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.869
given region. And so a local strontium isotope fingerprint,

51
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.589
so to speak, um, will embed in every body

52
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.309
tissue that you have in your um in your

53
00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.289
any tissue pretty much that contains uh particularly calcium

54
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:14.130
because we're very lucky that uh strontium actually biochemically,

55
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.820
um, or yeah, looks very similar to calcium. We

56
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.399
consider it bioequivalent, so the body will just like

57
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.649
accidentally or involuntarily every now and then incorporate an

58
00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:32.619
atom of strontium into the skeleton, for example, just

59
00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.419
instead of calcium without any negative side effects of

60
00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.130
that. That's just like the beauty of nature being

61
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.020
a little bit more flexible in sourcing its building

62
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.020
blocks, so to say. But um this is a

63
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.779
method, so strontium isotope analysis is really an important

64
00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:54.440
method in archaeology to trace the migration or movement

65
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.860
of humans across larger scale. So like there's incredible

66
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.779
archaeological research that has involved this technique and looking

67
00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:06.889
at movements of like early Neolithic farmers or uh

68
00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.320
migration period uh sites or, you know, Belviro complex,

69
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.690
you, you name it. And also in the study

70
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.570
of the transatlantic slave trade, this method has been

71
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.290
used specifically in archaeological sites in the African diaspora,

72
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.070
so archaeological sites that are in the Americas largely,

73
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.160
uh, so we're speaking, uh, mainly sites in Brazil,

74
00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:33.929
uh, in Brazil, but also the Caribbean and North

75
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:40.440
America. And used strontium isotope analysis to basically identify

76
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.579
the presence of first generation victims of the slave

77
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:53.059
trade in so-called slave cemeteries in the Americas, right?

78
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.720
And so there's like, um, often in, in those

79
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.739
sites, often they're like, you know, rescue excavations, or

80
00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:03.500
like, you know, there's like some development. Uh, OF

81
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.019
like a new, uh, a new road or like

82
00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:09.700
a new parking lot or, you know, a kindergarten

83
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.579
being built or what you name it, um, in

84
00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.440
the case of Brazil it was just some people

85
00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:18.380
that were wanting to do some earthwork in their

86
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.179
backyard and then they encounter like these long term

87
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:30.339
forgotten cemeteries of African individuals that were forcefully brought

88
00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.720
to the Americas. And so then archaeologists are interested

89
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.750
in the question like who of these individuals are,

90
00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.480
you know, locally born and raised, no matter if

91
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.619
we're talking about the Caribbean or South America or

92
00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:47.859
North America, and do we actually like, um. Detect

93
00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:50.739
some individuals that were actually born and raised in

94
00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.779
Africa, and so are like basically survivors of the

95
00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.059
so-called Middle Passage, right? Like that actually are among

96
00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.019
those that that survived that horrific trip from the

97
00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:04.500
old world to the new world, right, where there

98
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.399
were incredibly high mortality rates on those slave ships.

99
00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:11.850
Um, AND so that was the research that was

100
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.700
already existing when I got interested in this sphere,

101
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:19.269
uh, sphere, um, and I got really interested in

102
00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.570
doing a little bit more than just saying, OK,

103
00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:27.470
an individual here at a very coastal, uh, site

104
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.589
in, let's say, South Carolina, uh, is likely coming

105
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.170
from Africa. I think that's already very, very, you

106
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.119
know, valuable information. But if we would just have

107
00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:41.500
like a more detailed understanding of how strontium isotope

108
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.579
ratios are actually distributed across sub-Saharan Africa, there must

109
00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.559
be regions where we have really high strontium isotope

110
00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.829
values because we have really, really ancient bedrock in

111
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.880
a lot of parts of Africa, and then there

112
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.200
will be regions where we have very low isotope

113
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.130
values. So then we could actually not just identify

114
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.869
a person as coming from sub-Saharan Africa, which is,

115
00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:10.269
you know, a very, very gigantic landmass, but more

116
00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:13.989
specifically, well, where exactly is this person from, which

117
00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.089
says a lot about like that person's like identity,

118
00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:21.179
um, you know, and just cultural background, which. Forms

119
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:25.299
a lot of the identity of communities in the

120
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:29.649
African diaspora today and so that is exactly what

121
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.359
we did in this project. So we went ahead

122
00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:37.309
and built a strontium isotope map for sub-Saharan Africa

123
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:40.500
for exactly this application and actually many more that

124
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.350
I'd also be happy to talk about.

125
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.940
Sure, but then tell us then about the work

126
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.220
you've done at Valdo de Gaferia in Lagos here

127
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.380
in Portugal. I mean, what did you find there

128
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.769
and what motivated you to study that site specifically?

129
00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:01.519
Yeah, so, um, most people don't even know about

130
00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.000
Baladaga Fia as a, as an archaeological site, which

131
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.989
is, I consider as one of the most important

132
00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:12.480
archaeological sites that has been discovered so far in

133
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.959
the last like 20 years or so. Um, IT

134
00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.760
is the only mass burial site that we have

135
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.399
in all of Europe that's associated with the slave

136
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.630
trade. Um, AND we're talking here about the very,

137
00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:31.959
very beginning of the transatlantic slave trade that was,

138
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.429
uh, initiated by the, the Portuguese, like starting to

139
00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.590
like, um, checking out like the West African coast,

140
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.429
right, uh, and coming back with enslaved individuals from

141
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:46.270
like different parts of the uh West and later

142
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.250
Western Central African coastline. And so this site is

143
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.809
unparalleled in Europe. There's no site that is comparable.

144
00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:59.450
We don't even are aware of any burial sites

145
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.469
of enslaved Africans like anywhere in the UK, in

146
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:07.200
France, or in Spain, or in Portugal elsewhere, right?

147
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.640
Though they. Must be there. We know that they

148
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.159
exist, but often they're covered by some buildings or

149
00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.919
structures that are also very old by now and

150
00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:22.349
are normally, you know, protected from, you know, being

151
00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:24.979
destroyed just so you can excavate like those so-called

152
00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:28.950
slave cemeteries, but they exist. Valle dega Fia is

153
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.070
special because it was unknown that there is this

154
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.380
site. Uh, IT is located in the Algarve, um,

155
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.469
town of Lagos, uh, in southern, uh, Portugal, and

156
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:47.349
Lagos is a very beautiful, uh, town. Uh, I've

157
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:50.710
been, I, before I started working in this realm,

158
00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:52.869
I, I have been there myself as a tourist.

159
00:09:52.909 --> 00:09:56.255
It's a very, very pretty, um. Very touristy place,

160
00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:58.554
uh, and the motto of the city is like,

161
00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:01.195
you know, we, we're like the city of the

162
00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:04.114
center of discoveries, right, because like back in the

163
00:10:04.114 --> 00:10:07.765
days, um, at the beginning of like the, the,

164
00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:12.275
the Portuguese expansion of uh checking out the West

165
00:10:12.275 --> 00:10:17.075
African coast, um, they, uh, they largely like left

166
00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:21.034
from the port in Lagos because it's perfectly situated

167
00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:24.599
down in the Algarve. Uh, AND Lagos became very,

168
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.789
uh, an important place because of that, right, uh,

169
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.349
with a lot of very important figures that, that

170
00:10:30.349 --> 00:10:36.429
were based in, in Lagos. So in 2009, the

171
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.630
city um uh started, uh, or it's not the

172
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.250
city, it's like probably like a company that started

173
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:49.510
excavating an area just outside of the medieval historical

174
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.950
downtown area, which is kind of like enclosed by

175
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.869
a really cool old medieval city wall. And just

176
00:10:56.869 --> 00:11:00.849
outside of the city wall, they did an excavation

177
00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:03.229
that went really, really deep because they were building

178
00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:06.669
a parking garage. So like an underground parking garage,

179
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.909
it goes like 2 floors down, and then I

180
00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:11.679
think it has like 2 stories on top, um,

181
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:15.049
or at least 1. Um, AND so they were

182
00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:19.450
excavating the site and they bumped into not just

183
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.630
like foundations of historical structures, which they later identified

184
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.500
as the structures that were associated with the leprosarium.

185
00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:31.210
So, like outside of the city of Lagos, like

186
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.369
they had a place where they would like treat

187
00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:38.409
and store, you know, people that had, uh, were

188
00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:42.559
infected with leprosy. As in many other places in

189
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:46.119
Europe, uh, was very, very, uh, custom, uh, and

190
00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:47.679
so there are a couple of human remains that

191
00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:51.320
are associated with, with local, um, people that have

192
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.539
came down with, with leprosy and died there. But,

193
00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:58.200
um, the excavation, the main discovery of the excavation

194
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.119
is that they found, uh, a mass burial in

195
00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:07.559
the cities or in the historical city's trash pit.

196
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:10.390
So we have like outside of the city wall,

197
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.429
like a big ditch where people were throwing their

198
00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:17.229
trash in, right, like literally just normal garbage, late

199
00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:22.309
medieval garbage. And within this deposit, you find the,

200
00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:26.669
they found the human remains of 158 men, women

201
00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:31.140
and children of African origin. And so we know

202
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.719
that they were of African origin because a lot

203
00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:38.359
of them have dental modifications, so these intentional modifications

204
00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:43.309
of often, particularly the anterior teeth. So filing in

205
00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:46.429
like different shapes and so these are the many

206
00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:49.710
reasons why people have historically done that, not just

207
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.219
in, in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in other places

208
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:54.969
in the world, uh, it can be like medicinal

209
00:12:54.969 --> 00:12:58.909
or um can be an initiation rites and stuff

210
00:12:58.909 --> 00:13:01.349
like that, right? So many reasons why people have

211
00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:06.030
done that. Um, AND so that already hinted at

212
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.510
them being from sub-Saharan Africa, and then a few

213
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.659
individuals also have objects with them that are, um,

214
00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:16.270
you know, interpreted to be of African origin, such

215
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.590
as like some beads and some like little carved

216
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:25.840
figurines, um, and, um. You know, the biological anthropologists

217
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.030
also like, I think, like, thought like from the,

218
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.960
from the morphology of the human remains that they

219
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.789
looked African. We know that that is um pretty

220
00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:36.440
much pseudoscience, like that, that kind of approach is

221
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.700
like nowadays, like abandoned that you like look at

222
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.739
the skull and say like, oh, that person looks

223
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.580
African or Asian. Uh,

224
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.020
YEAH, that's, that's science, right?

225
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.169
Exactly, exactly. And we know that that is actually

226
00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:52.250
pseudoscience and it is actually holding up like scientific

227
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:57.169
scrutiny, right? But still, people, um, rightfully, uh, had

228
00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.969
from the get-go, a strong, strong impression that these

229
00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:02.530
might be African individuals, which was a couple of

230
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:07.000
years later confirmed by some genetic analysis of a

231
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.630
handful of individuals that identified them as sub-Saharan African.

232
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.880
So, OK, so you have like a very, very

233
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.349
interesting situation here where you have folks that want

234
00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:20.799
to build a parking garage and they bump into

235
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.909
almost 160 individuals from a historical context, and they

236
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:29.950
look. Like they're coming from Africa, like how on

237
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.000
earth did they get to Lagos? Well, the answer

238
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.179
is very, very simple. It is that they were

239
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.479
among the very, very first victims of what we

240
00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:42.299
in the beginning called the Atlantic slave trade, that

241
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.859
the Portuguese then later expand with other European nations

242
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.520
to what we refer to as the transatlantic trade,

243
00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:52.919
right? Like bringing. Um, LIKE sailing down to, uh,

244
00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:57.359
to different parts of Africa, uh, you know, capturing

245
00:14:57.359 --> 00:15:03.440
and buying African people, and then crossing the Atlantic,

246
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.219
selling them there and then coming back with produce

247
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.830
from the Americas, right, like sugar, cane, sugar and

248
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.309
stuff like that, cotton later. So, um, we're at

249
00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:18.469
the very beginning of this that like enslaved Africans

250
00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:22.309
are brought to Portugal and are sold in Lagos.

251
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.950
Actually Lagos, uh, we have historical records that the

252
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:31.070
first slave market and the first auction of enslaved

253
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.109
Africans in all of Europe is exactly here in

254
00:15:35.109 --> 00:15:38.559
Lagos. I think the first reported. Uh, AUCTION that

255
00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:42.159
we know of, uh, of African people is in

256
00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:49.359
160008. So very, very early, OK. Uh, SO really,

257
00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:51.919
uh, incredibly early and like some, some of the

258
00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:55.280
radiocarbon dates that we have from these individuals, they're

259
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.960
not very, very accurate, and we also like don't

260
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.119
know from the literature, um, how these dates were

261
00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:04.000
actually obtained, which is a little bit problematic for

262
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.005
us to actually know. How accurate they are, but

263
00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:09.125
they, they look like they're falling into like the

264
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:14.125
first half of the 15th century, so 1640s, something

265
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.484
like that, uh, and that is when we know

266
00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:19.325
that a lot of more ships were actually landing

267
00:16:19.325 --> 00:16:23.804
in Lagos with enslaved Africans on board, um, and,

268
00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:26.565
and having them in the local slave market and

269
00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:30.229
selling them, right? And then about in the beginning

270
00:16:30.229 --> 00:16:34.020
of the 15th 16th century, there's actually a royal

271
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.640
decree that sees like how much money is actually

272
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.960
flowing into Lagos because of the, the, the trafficking

273
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.309
of human lives, uh, and then it's banned in

274
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:47.460
Lagos and moved actually to, to Lisbon, right? So

275
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.780
that the, the authorities there have a little bit

276
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.789
more of a say of that nice source of

277
00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:56.799
income, right? OK, so we're, we're in this, this,

278
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.840
uh, crazy position that again there is no site

279
00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:03.840
in all of Europe that is anywhere similar to

280
00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:07.260
the site that is called Valleda Garia that refers

281
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.219
to or can be translated to Valley of the

282
00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:14.500
Leprosarium, which is because there was this, uh, leprosy

283
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.640
there. Sorry, my dog is playing with himself here.

284
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.880
And um and it's also like very interesting, so

285
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.479
it's not only the only site of its kind

286
00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:27.510
in all of Europe, it is actually also the

287
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.810
oldest site that we know of in the entire

288
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.650
world. So we don't have any site that is

289
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.770
this old associated with the slave trade anywhere in

290
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.890
the Americas, right? Um, AND so that makes this

291
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:46.290
site extremely unique and actually studying the, the ancestors

292
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.449
that were discovered at this site. Not all have

293
00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:53.449
good skeletal preservation, but many do, uh, is actually

294
00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:57.890
giving us a very unique insight into where these

295
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.920
people came from, who they were, and. Gives us

296
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.160
also like a lot of responsibility to actually communicate

297
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.060
that to the public, particularly to folks, um, our,

298
00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:14.040
our colleagues and, uh, um, you know, communities like

299
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.000
in the African diaspora uh at large, but also

300
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.839
like uh in, in their home countries where these

301
00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.420
individuals came from in Africa.

302
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.739
So, uh, and tell us about how the Portuguese

303
00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:32.699
authorities have dealt with this discovery. I mean, because

304
00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:34.790
I, I mean, I'm Portuguese, I live in Portugal,

305
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:37.550
and, and if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't

306
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.369
have heard of it at all.

307
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.469
So yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks for, for bringing that

308
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:44.109
up. I think like this is, uh, this is

309
00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:47.750
actually something I, uh, I never thought that me

310
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.579
as a scientist that I would, um, you know,

311
00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:57.689
like. Have like a much, much bigger uh energy

312
00:18:57.689 --> 00:19:00.910
input now like rather than like publishing the, the

313
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.670
research that I'm doing. I'm actually right now investing

314
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.569
so much more time and, and, and energy in

315
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.349
communicating my findings with the Afro-descendant community in Portugal

316
00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:13.949
and also with the public because of exactly this.

317
00:19:13.989 --> 00:19:18.609
I cannot believe that this site is remaining invisible

318
00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:21.270
to the public. And so I'm not the only

319
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.270
one who's like really putting an effort into, you

320
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.170
know, raising awareness of this site, uh, and, uh,

321
00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:31.189
you know, making people aware of its existence, but

322
00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:35.050
also like what the impacts of ignoring this site

323
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.949
uh are to African descendant communities in Portugal today,

324
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.910
they're like extremely offended by the fact that uh

325
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:48.050
governmental institutions and also the local municipality is. Um,

326
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.050
NOT giving much attention to this site, right? So

327
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.089
the interesting thing is, uh, first of all, if

328
00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:58.530
you would tell anyone who works in the archaeology

329
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.589
of the African diaspora context that, that this discovery,

330
00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.530
it had a couple of news articles, so like

331
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.459
Reuters reported about it. There was like a. In

332
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.739
an article in National Geographic Portugal as well. So

333
00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:17.290
it was not completely missed by the media, um,

334
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.819
and there was a press release obviously about it

335
00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:22.459
because the folks that excavated the site, there was

336
00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:28.339
a private excavation company, they, they very, very quickly

337
00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:32.900
realized the importance of this site. However, although there

338
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.060
were like quite some discussions about like, what should

339
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.939
happen after the discovery, the local municipality just went

340
00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.939
ahead and gave the company that wanted to build

341
00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:46.780
that, that parking lot, they gave them the go,

342
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.319
and they just, you know, got all the human

343
00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:52.020
bodies out, out of the lot that they had

344
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.060
excavated, and then they built a parking lot on

345
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.689
top of it. Um, AND the city even, uh,

346
00:20:58.729 --> 00:21:01.869
confirmed that they could go ahead and, uh, put

347
00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:04.390
a mini golf course on top of that parking

348
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.550
structure. And so. Uh, A lot of people in

349
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.050
the community, including myself, like I consider myself like,

350
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.170
uh, part of the community who really deeply cares

351
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:20.020
about, um, these ancestors from, from Lagos. Um, WE'RE

352
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.060
very offended by the fact that instead of making

353
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.209
the site visible as an absolute unique opportunity to

354
00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:34.400
commemorate the, the fatalities of the transatlantic slave trade,

355
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:39.099
um, and to also be transparent about Portugal's involvement

356
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.489
in it, to then just like completely erase the

357
00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:45.449
site and just build up a parking garage with

358
00:21:45.449 --> 00:21:47.939
a mini golf course where people have fun. You

359
00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:51.260
know, it's like a very, very bizarre decision, and

360
00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.459
I know that there was some debate about it

361
00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:56.170
back in the days when this decision had to

362
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.979
be made, but um I don't think that many

363
00:21:59.979 --> 00:22:03.500
voices were heard, uh, or, or, or also like

364
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.239
gave any kind of like informed consents. The community,

365
00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:08.880
for example, the African descendant community was never consulted

366
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.579
in any way or form, which is very unusual

367
00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:14.790
in a context like this. Um, IF you compare

368
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.219
it with the rest of the world, if you

369
00:22:16.219 --> 00:22:18.819
would find a site like this. So the one

370
00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:23.619
thing that the local municipality actually did was to

371
00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:27.420
put a plaque, like a little brass plaque, up

372
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.209
in front of the parking garage, and the plaque

373
00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:35.180
is incredibly bizarre. It is, uh, it has text

374
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.030
in Portuguese and also in English on it. And

375
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.569
basically talks about like the, the foundation of that

376
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:45.969
leprosarium building that were found and you can still

377
00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:47.839
see them. So that's probably why they talk a

378
00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:50.329
lot about that. So it's multiple lines, like a

379
00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:53.130
whole paragraph about like these weird stones that, you

380
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.510
know, who cares, right? Like, it's like, you know,

381
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.829
it's a, it's a historical structure, yes, but OK.

382
00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:05.890
And then the fact that almost 160. Tortured and

383
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.130
like killed people from sub-Saharan Africa and these individuals

384
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.869
were, you know, the, the way that they were

385
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.810
treated, we can see that in the, the human

386
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.569
remains of these individuals. They were in horrific condition

387
00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:22.510
and I'd be happy to elaborate more on that.

388
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.689
So the plaque is basically referring that the remains,

389
00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:32.410
the skeletal remains of people with negroid features were

390
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.239
found. And then the plaque ends. And the language

391
00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:41.079
is so incredibly offensive that um it was actually

392
00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:44.319
showcased in a recent film, uh, an incredible film

393
00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:48.079
that I highly recommend by the filmmaker Dulce Fernandez.

394
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.790
It's a film called Tales of Bolivian, Tales of

395
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.880
Oblivion. Um, IT'S actually screening, I think, like in

396
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.280
New York City, like next week, uh, and it's

397
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.670
showcased like this summer, uh, it was released in

398
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.709
Portugal. Um, IT'S a really, really incredible film that

399
00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:09.319
is dedicated to this site and like how these,

400
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.130
the story of the site is basically made invisible,

401
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.739
uh, and they, they showcased like, uh, or Luche

402
00:24:16.739 --> 00:24:19.469
like the filmmaker showcased in this film like that

403
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:22.709
the how insulting this language and how violent this

404
00:24:22.709 --> 00:24:25.150
language on the plaque is that actually the local

405
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:30.260
municipality took it down. Earlier this year or later

406
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.119
last year,

407
00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:33.540
I mean, I mean, I guess it's not only

408
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.109
insulting but offensive, but it's also unscientific,

409
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:42.689
right? Absolutely, absolutely, exactly, thank you. Exactly, but I

410
00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:44.660
think they put the plaque up before there was

411
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.199
any actual data like publications, so they just went

412
00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:52.140
with the first assessment that was pretty much unscientific,

413
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:57.569
exactly. Um, SO now the plaque is gone and

414
00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:01.910
now the site is invisible entirely, right? It's a

415
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.530
parking garage with a mini golf course on top

416
00:25:05.829 --> 00:25:10.069
and there's some, the European Union actually gave a

417
00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:12.790
lot of money, uh, I think we're talking about

418
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:18.310
millions to the municipality to update or renovate the

419
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.385
so-called slave. Market museum that is in downtown Lagos

420
00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:24.204
because they actually the slave market, this place that

421
00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:26.444
I mentioned earlier that is the oldest of its

422
00:25:26.444 --> 00:25:29.165
kind in all of Europe is literally a 3

423
00:25:29.165 --> 00:25:32.354
minute walk away from the mass burial site, right?

424
00:25:32.645 --> 00:25:36.405
It's right around the corner and this museum received

425
00:25:36.405 --> 00:25:39.765
a lot of funding to be updated and be

426
00:25:39.765 --> 00:25:43.045
brought up to speed in terms of museum pedagogy

427
00:25:43.045 --> 00:25:49.130
and things like that. And the museum fails incredibly

428
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.469
in mentioning the site and really giving updated details

429
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:56.540
about the site. They mentioned that there is a

430
00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.189
site nearby where they were found, uh, not really

431
00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:05.560
saying anything about like the extent, right, like 158

432
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:09.890
humans. You know, it's like, you know, you can

433
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.089
leave the, you can leave the museum feeling like,

434
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.569
oh, maybe like they, they found like some, you

435
00:26:14.569 --> 00:26:16.770
know, 5 individuals or something like that. It's not

436
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.489
a big deal. Um, AND generally, like I, I

437
00:26:20.489 --> 00:26:23.969
just visited the museum this summer with uh about

438
00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:27.010
100 people from all over the world, including a

439
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.569
lot of African colleagues and friends and colleagues from

440
00:26:30.569 --> 00:26:34.449
the African diaspora, and um they were very, very.

441
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.180
Very shocked by the museum and like how the

442
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.609
museum is kind of speaking about like, oh yeah,

443
00:26:40.729 --> 00:26:46.140
Portugal was involved in initiating the transatlantic slave trade,

444
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.040
but then it still goes very much on to,

445
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.229
you know. How, how impressive these ships were and

446
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:57.760
how impressive, uh, impressive this whole endeavor was, right?

447
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.050
And so it really doesn't have the, the tact

448
00:27:02.109 --> 00:27:06.270
and the, the humility and humanity that we would

449
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.670
rather like to see in a, in an exhibition

450
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.890
like that, that is there to inform the public,

451
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.790
uh, rather than just, you know, uh, whitewashing it

452
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.829
for the tourism there.

453
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.790
Right, and so there was this ancestor tribute. I

454
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.869
mean, tell us about it. What was it and

455
00:27:24.869 --> 00:27:27.910
why did you decide to participate in it?

456
00:27:28.489 --> 00:27:31.650
Oh yeah, so, um, so this was, this, this

457
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:36.599
summer, um, so we, we organized the event, um,

458
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.079
to bring awareness, uh, to the site and to

459
00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:43.569
honor the, the ancestors that, that lost their lives

460
00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:46.130
in, in Lagos, you know, more than 400 years

461
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.689
ago, um, but, uh, this was a, uh, a

462
00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:57.469
collaboration with, um, the so-called African, uh, sorry. Ancestor

463
00:27:57.469 --> 00:28:02.630
Tribute Collective, which is a group of Afro-descendant activists

464
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.150
from Lisbon. Most of, you know, folks of color

465
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:12.589
live in Lisbon these days, and they have been

466
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:16.540
organizing ancestor tributes like commemorating the victims of the

467
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.430
transatlantic slave trade for almost a decade now. So

468
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.550
that's an annual beautiful event that is hosted in

469
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.790
downtown Lisbon. Uh, WHERE, uh, the ancestors at large,

470
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.589
you know, not just like those that were brought

471
00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:33.939
to Portugal, but also, uh, any, any victims that

472
00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:38.430
were, um, trafficked by the Portuguese, um, and the

473
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.109
Portuguese colonies, um, and they do this event every

474
00:28:42.109 --> 00:28:44.829
year and it's like associated with music and art

475
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:48.270
and, you know, giving flour and water offerings to,

476
00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:50.609
to the ocean, right? Because, you know, you can

477
00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:54.579
be at the waterfront in Lisbon. Um, AND so

478
00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:58.239
I, I was contacted by the Ancestor Tribute Collective,

479
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.250
uh, leadership, um, and, uh, we started, you know,

480
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.819
talking like how we can actually like work together

481
00:29:04.819 --> 00:29:08.459
and like how, uh, I can also share the

482
00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:12.000
results of my research uh with the Afro-descendant community

483
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.984
in Lisbon. So, um, I'm not just collaborating with

484
00:29:15.984 --> 00:29:18.905
the Ancestor Tribute Collective but also with Jazz, which

485
00:29:18.905 --> 00:29:21.905
is the association of uh Afro descendants that is

486
00:29:21.905 --> 00:29:24.444
based in Lisbon as well so there are many

487
00:29:24.545 --> 00:29:28.185
or there are several different community groups that are

488
00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:33.910
very, very active in, um, you know. Generally, like,

489
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:38.469
um, you know, fighting against like, um, discrimination, um,

490
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.189
but also like bringing kind of like the, the

491
00:29:40.189 --> 00:29:43.650
black community together in, in Portugal, particularly in Lisbon.

492
00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:48.829
Um, AND so, I mentioned to my collaborator from

493
00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:53.449
the African, from the ancestor tribute collective Kadimba, Aristotelis

494
00:29:53.449 --> 00:29:56.209
Kadimba, I mentioned to him that I will be

495
00:29:56.209 --> 00:30:00.650
actually in the Algarve this summer because there's a

496
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:06.069
huge Africanist archaeology conference where We were kind of

497
00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:08.949
anticipating at least 500 people from all over the

498
00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:12.010
world are coming together that are working in Africa,

499
00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.030
a lot, most of them are a lot of

500
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.949
them actually archaeologists from different African nations, uh, and

501
00:30:18.949 --> 00:30:21.489
we're all going to be in the Algarve, and

502
00:30:21.949 --> 00:30:25.109
it would be an absolutely incredible opportunity to actually

503
00:30:25.109 --> 00:30:30.180
showcase the site and bring. These many, many people

504
00:30:30.589 --> 00:30:33.709
with a key, keen interest actually in, in a,

505
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.630
in a site like this that is so um

506
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.430
uh nobody, none of them have ever heard about

507
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.619
it, right? So we did a session at the

508
00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:45.709
conference actually talking about the site and more broadly

509
00:30:45.709 --> 00:30:50.780
about the archaeology of the transatlantic slave trade. Um,

510
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.750
AND then so with the conference, with the uh

511
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.069
ancestor Tribute Collective, and then also with a lot

512
00:30:57.069 --> 00:31:01.310
of support, uh, through funding from the National Geographic

513
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:06.369
Society, um, that funded an explore community uh grant,

514
00:31:07.229 --> 00:31:12.670
um. We, we just organized, organized this event, uh,

515
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.680
on a Saturday afternoon, that was like on the

516
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:20.239
26th of July, and we arrived in Lagos with

517
00:31:20.239 --> 00:31:22.729
about 100 people, I think we were around 115,

518
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.479
120 people. Uh, AGAIN, from all over the world,

519
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:32.579
um, and went to the site. Um, WE, um,

520
00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:37.300
you know, gave different speeches about the site, so

521
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.380
like that, you know, really informing people, looking down

522
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.375
onto this parking garage. So we were in the

523
00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:44.734
park on the other side of the street, looking

524
00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:48.415
down onto this parking garage, um, just basically like

525
00:31:48.415 --> 00:31:51.775
informing everybody who joined us, like, what actually happened

526
00:31:51.775 --> 00:31:55.135
there, uh, what is the scientific evidence that we

527
00:31:55.135 --> 00:31:58.165
have about what these individuals went through and who

528
00:31:58.165 --> 00:32:00.949
they are. Right, like the where they're from, it's

529
00:32:00.949 --> 00:32:05.130
kind of like my, uh, my contribution here. And,

530
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.670
um, and then we kind of like, uh, went

531
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.670
through several different ceremonial aspects of honoring them, like

532
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.064
they're in the very creative ways. So one way

533
00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:19.464
was actually that um the ancestor tribute collective, I

534
00:32:19.464 --> 00:32:24.064
can show you this, um, actually suggested names for

535
00:32:24.064 --> 00:32:27.984
some of these ancestors. So, um, all of these

536
00:32:27.984 --> 00:32:33.574
individuals that are now stored in plastic containers um

537
00:32:33.574 --> 00:32:37.760
in the basement of a. Uh, ARCHAEOLOGICAL company, their,

538
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.800
their numbers, right? They are like, they're, they have

539
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.280
like, you know, it's not even that they have

540
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.270
burial numbers, they actually like the individuals themselves are,

541
00:32:45.349 --> 00:32:48.119
are listed only as numbers. And so the ancestor

542
00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:53.390
Tribute Collective, um, Uh, suggested names for two individuals

543
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.130
where I could share some, uh, information about them.

544
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.410
Uh, SO one individual, uh, we suggested the name

545
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.219
Kalemba, uh, and the other one, Mbanza, and, uh,

546
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:08.344
according to my Uh, isotopic data, it looks like

547
00:33:08.344 --> 00:33:10.185
these two individuals could have come from what is

548
00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:13.545
today Angola, and so these are, uh, names that

549
00:33:13.545 --> 00:33:18.864
are, uh, Kikongo, uh, and, uh, Kimbundu, so both

550
00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:24.140
languages that are, um, typical for Angola, um. And

551
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.500
so that the naming suggestion that was very, very

552
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.900
powerful because these names also carry a lot of

553
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.969
meaning, uh, and Aristotleus Kadimba is specialized in, in,

554
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.160
and he wrote a book about Angolan names, so

555
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.699
it's very, very well versed to actually select names

556
00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:44.260
with the help of the community. And then the

557
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.713
next step. WAS to lay down a wreath, like,

558
00:33:46.782 --> 00:33:48.662
so we brought a big flower wreath, and so

559
00:33:48.662 --> 00:33:53.103
where this very offensive plaque was before, um, we

560
00:33:53.103 --> 00:33:55.463
actually put up a big flower wreath that was

561
00:33:55.463 --> 00:33:59.353
dedicated to the individuals that were found there. Um,

562
00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:02.142
AND then we did a procession into the parking

563
00:34:02.142 --> 00:34:05.422
garage with music and all attendees, so more than

564
00:34:05.422 --> 00:34:10.385
100. People, um, to actually like walk on the

565
00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:16.226
sites where these human remains had been laying for

566
00:34:16.226 --> 00:34:19.426
400 years and then we went down to the

567
00:34:19.426 --> 00:34:23.456
waterfront and did like a very traditional ancestor tribute,

568
00:34:23.585 --> 00:34:26.226
again, like doing flower offerings and water offerings to

569
00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:30.879
the ocean. And had like a wonderful batu music

570
00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:33.879
group there from um this kind of music and

571
00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:36.879
dance style from Capo Verde, uh, so very much

572
00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:40.399
like based in the cultural legacies of, of the

573
00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:44.429
slave trade and like multiple different uh ethnic groups,

574
00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:48.399
like, you know, forming new music and new, um,

575
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:53.120
uh, new dances. Um, SO it was an absolutely

576
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.280
incredible, incredible afternoon. It took the whole afternoon. And

577
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.760
there was a lot of very strong emotions, and

578
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.540
we all felt very, very empowered and very um.

579
00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:10.340
The whole event felt extremely meaningful uh to most

580
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.219
of us, um, and, uh, yeah, it was very,

581
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.100
very moving, particularly when we had the moment of

582
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.610
silence at the parking garage. Um, YOU know, a

583
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.199
lot of, uh, a lot of our colleagues, uh,

584
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.929
you know, they, they, they, you know, had, had

585
00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:27.050
tears in their eyes, uh, that, you know, it

586
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.429
takes a group of archaeologists and local community activists

587
00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:33.750
to actually honor the people that were found there

588
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.129
more than, you know, 15 years ago, and an

589
00:35:37.129 --> 00:35:39.770
event like this has not taken place, which is

590
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.260
crazy.

591
00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:45.270
Right. So, uh let me ask you then, uh,

592
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.479
just a final question that will be like a

593
00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:52.860
two-part question. So the first part is, uh, do

594
00:35:53.149 --> 00:35:56.280
you know at all what will happen to the

595
00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.149
remains then? And the second part is uh related

596
00:36:00.149 --> 00:36:04.389
and is about, so, um, of course, sometimes it

597
00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:10.709
happens, uh, frequently when anthropologists, uh, take, uh, remains

598
00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:14.159
like this to study them in the lab or

599
00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:17.709
some uh some other place and then, uh, I

600
00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:22.040
mean, they either have to They, they, they either

601
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.959
keep them or give it, give them back to

602
00:36:24.959 --> 00:36:29.360
their respective communities if there's that kind of communication

603
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.600
and I mean sometimes there are a few scientists,

604
00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.919
anthropologists that I, I'm not, uh, want, uh, I

605
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:41.760
don't want to call them necessarily racist but they

606
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.449
take issue. With the communities having the remains back

607
00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:49.159
because they say, oh, it's science, I mean, whatever,

608
00:36:49.169 --> 00:36:52.110
and the, the same thing happens sometimes also with

609
00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:57.909
uh museums in Western countries where they basically keep

610
00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:00.649
some of the things they took from their former

611
00:37:00.649 --> 00:37:03.610
colonies and then they don't want to give them

612
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.449
back. I mean, it's the same kind of dynamic.

613
00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:08.780
I mean, why do you think, uh, as an

614
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:11.699
anthropologist, I think that you probably have a good

615
00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:15.500
understanding of this. Why is it important for uh

616
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.159
people to, to get back the remains of their

617
00:37:19.419 --> 00:37:25.000
ancestors? I mean, why should, uh, people as scientists

618
00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:27.459
take that into consideration?

619
00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:30.870
Mhm. Yeah, so that is a really, really important

620
00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:33.159
question and that is one that is actually uh

621
00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:38.929
surprisingly difficult to work around or to try to

622
00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:43.370
contribute to in the Portuguese context because, uh, unlike

623
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.520
other places, uh, in the diaspora, in the African

624
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.750
diaspora, you don't have like any rules or regulations

625
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:55.399
in this framework, right? So in, uh, in, uh,

626
00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:58.300
I think generally there's an. Istanding in North America

627
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.280
that uh working with indigenous human remains undergoes a

628
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.600
lot of scrutiny and there are a ton of

629
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.840
laws since the 1990s, right, like inhibiting any kind

630
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.320
of research on the ancestral remains of indigenous peoples

631
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.280
here from, from what we're, for example, in right

632
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.780
now in the United States. States but also in

633
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.659
Canada with First Nations, right? So there are laws

634
00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:24.060
on the books that are prohibiting that and also

635
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.300
there's more and more scrutiny when we work with

636
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.280
uh the human remains of enslaved Africans uh in

637
00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.580
in the Americas, right? And not just like here

638
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.889
in the United States but also in other places.

639
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:37.620
Brazil is taking this very, very serious with the

640
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.169
sites that they have. In Portugal, there's no such

641
00:38:42.169 --> 00:38:47.010
laws or regulations or community or like scientific community

642
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.929
consent on this, which is understandable because like this

643
00:38:49.929 --> 00:38:53.489
is the only site we have, right? So you,

644
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.510
you cannot really um expect that there are regulations

645
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:02.010
and guidelines, you know, ethical guidelines for a site

646
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.949
that is as unique as this one. So the,

647
00:39:06.149 --> 00:39:10.189
the archaeologists and biological anthropologists that have, um, you

648
00:39:10.189 --> 00:39:13.870
know, studied these human remains now since their excavation,

649
00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:16.669
there have been like dozens of publications that have

650
00:39:16.669 --> 00:39:23.050
come out studying these human remains. They basically think

651
00:39:23.229 --> 00:39:28.760
that any kind of community engagement. So communicate, community

652
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.969
engagement in this case would be uh primarily with

653
00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:37.790
the Afro-descendant community in Portugal, right? Um. Uh, THEY

654
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.729
think it's political, and that is, hence it's political

655
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:49.459
and as political, it's unscientific. Um, IN different parts

656
00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:51.379
of the world we have a different perspective on

657
00:39:51.379 --> 00:39:56.580
that as scientists, so I personally have been raised

658
00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:01.139
and educated that science, yes, should be apolitical, should

659
00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:04.274
not be politically. Motivated but uh it should also

660
00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:07.195
not be racist uh ideally it should be anti-racist,

661
00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:09.435
right? Um, AND so that's what we try to

662
00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:11.895
do when we're educating our students uh to be

663
00:40:12.155 --> 00:40:16.254
um sensible about these things, to be sensitive, right?

664
00:40:16.594 --> 00:40:20.330
Um. And so when I actually started working on

665
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.010
this site, uh, I was very much shocked from

666
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.570
the, from the beginning to see how, um, how

667
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.570
hostile the Portuguese colleagues were towards the idea of

668
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.570
community engagement. So then I said like, OK, then

669
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.989
I'm going to do communicate community engagement. So before

670
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.040
I started sampling any human remains, I had a

671
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.489
meeting with representatives of the African Southern community, particularly

672
00:40:43.489 --> 00:40:46.804
with jazz, which are absolutely. Wonderful people to, to

673
00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:49.925
work with and communicate with, and they brought together

674
00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:52.834
people that were very interested in like, what, what

675
00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:56.084
is this lady, this weird German lady that works

676
00:40:56.084 --> 00:40:58.274
in the US like what is she going to

677
00:40:58.274 --> 00:41:00.725
do with these ancestors and what are, what, you

678
00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:03.304
know, what is she going, or what are the

679
00:41:03.304 --> 00:41:07.064
bioarchaeologists doing at all because they were never, um,

680
00:41:07.524 --> 00:41:12.034
they were never consulted or informed in any way,

681
00:41:12.125 --> 00:41:16.919
right? And so the, the, the Portuguese colleagues, they,

682
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.540
they, they don't really like that at all, right?

683
00:41:19.639 --> 00:41:22.560
Uh, AND it actually almost like jeopardized the whole

684
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.810
project of me doing that. But um, You know,

685
00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:31.929
we, we have made progress, I think, so like

686
00:41:31.929 --> 00:41:35.530
now the, the, the Afro descending community is actually

687
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.010
very well informed about what's going on. So this

688
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.310
summer, I gave 4 talks um uh in Portugal,

689
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.409
um, uh, or, or, or events, right, like community

690
00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:51.129
outreach events, uh, 2 of which were in Lisbon.

691
00:41:51.439 --> 00:41:53.679
And reached like really like a lot of people

692
00:41:53.679 --> 00:41:56.979
and we had incredible discussions with the audience after

693
00:41:57.399 --> 00:42:00.469
each presentation where I really summarized like, this is

694
00:42:00.469 --> 00:42:03.439
what we know, uh, and also make clear that

695
00:42:03.439 --> 00:42:06.500
people understand that we have no say in what

696
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.709
was actually going to happen with the human remains

697
00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:12.000
because we as a community of care, like, so

698
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.080
like as a group of people, a large group

699
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.110
of people. Portuguese citizens but also international citizens, um,

700
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.110
we don't really have a say in what is

701
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.629
going to happen to these human remains. Um, THEY

702
00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:28.629
are in boxes in, uh, in a, in a,

703
00:42:28.689 --> 00:42:32.429
in a private excavation company in Coimbra, so very

704
00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:35.139
far away from, from, from Lagos, like more in

705
00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:38.189
the central of, of Portugal, and they're still being

706
00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:42.229
studied and they're still in plastic containers and they

707
00:42:42.229 --> 00:42:47.909
are still just labeled with numbers. And the Afro-descendant

708
00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:54.290
community considers that as continued violence towards these ancestors,

709
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.860
and it would actually not take much. To reduce

710
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.300
the level of violence, for example, by acknowledging that

711
00:43:02.679 --> 00:43:04.979
they should maybe get like a little bit more

712
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.000
care and consideration of the way that they are

713
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.040
stored. So that is like some of the discussion

714
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.679
we had this, this summer, right? People would actually

715
00:43:13.679 --> 00:43:15.439
be much more comfortable if we would know that

716
00:43:15.439 --> 00:43:18.330
they, the individuals were not in plastic crates, but

717
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:24.342
rather in coffin-like wooden boxes. Maybe uh blessed by,

718
00:43:24.481 --> 00:43:28.001
um, you know, with, with certain rituals, there's like

719
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:30.582
a lot of like ritual uh that can happen

720
00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:35.322
associating music or offerings and blessings that would just

721
00:43:35.322 --> 00:43:38.501
like take away some of like this really neutral

722
00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:43.362
ice cold way of treating these ancestors and why

723
00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:48.364
it's important is because these ancestors. Never got a

724
00:43:48.364 --> 00:43:51.724
funeral, right? They were never properly buried. They were

725
00:43:51.724 --> 00:43:54.924
thrown into the trash. So that makes them quite

726
00:43:54.924 --> 00:43:58.843
different from uh some ancestor, no matter from what

727
00:43:58.843 --> 00:44:01.204
time period that was buried and put to rest

728
00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:03.763
by their family or their community, right? These people

729
00:44:03.763 --> 00:44:06.644
were torn out of their communities and thrown away,

730
00:44:06.854 --> 00:44:09.124
right? And so we think that they should just

731
00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:11.924
get a little bit more or a lot more.

732
00:44:12.006 --> 00:44:15.625
For affection and care in death, now that we

733
00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:17.986
know who they are and what happened to them,

734
00:44:18.946 --> 00:44:21.795
however, you bring up a very, very important point,

735
00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:25.246
which is, um, should they go back to where

736
00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:28.926
they're coming from and like who, who, who would

737
00:44:28.926 --> 00:44:31.845
receive them, right? So that's a huge question that

738
00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:35.186
we also debated with community members all like in

739
00:44:35.186 --> 00:44:39.889
July in, in Portugal. So according to my research,

740
00:44:39.899 --> 00:44:43.199
and I did not only contact, uh, conduct strontium

741
00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:46.550
isotope analysis with, with a team of students, international

742
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.669
students, but uh also the, the colleagues from University

743
00:44:49.669 --> 00:44:52.120
of Coimbra who were involved and, and assisted us

744
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.949
with sampling the human remains, um. So we found

745
00:44:55.949 --> 00:44:59.250
that like the, the vast majority of the individuals

746
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.389
apparently comes from different parts of West Africa. So

747
00:45:02.389 --> 00:45:06.270
that's combined strontium isotopes combined with oxygen isotopes, carbon,

748
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:09.010
nitrogen, sulfur. So we did the whole suite of

749
00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:13.310
isotopic techniques that you can throw at a human

750
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:17.429
skeleton at this point in order to investigate a

751
00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:24.389
person's origin. And um it's um. So, with my

752
00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:26.629
work, I can like kind of limit it or

753
00:45:26.629 --> 00:45:32.209
limit the region of origin to some very discrete

754
00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:36.469
areas within West or Western Central Africa, um, but

755
00:45:36.469 --> 00:45:39.350
we can often not pin it down to like

756
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.540
11 place where they should go back. And then

757
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.280
like, ideally, there would be like still a community

758
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.459
today that you could return the these ancestral remains

759
00:45:49.459 --> 00:45:52.100
to. So this is not how it works, OK?

760
00:45:52.459 --> 00:45:55.860
So repatriation of these ancestors would be very, very

761
00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.820
difficult, um, because the receiving nations would, you know,

762
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.699
would need to want to receive them, right? So

763
00:46:03.699 --> 00:46:08.739
like different from ranging from Senegal and The Gambia

764
00:46:08.739 --> 00:46:10.580
all the way to Angola, you would have to

765
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:17.219
have, you know. Uh, GOVERNMENTAL representation that wants to

766
00:46:17.219 --> 00:46:21.310
receive these ancestors and, you know, repatriate them, rebury

767
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.929
them in their country of origin, and obviously the

768
00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:27.100
countries we have in this region today did not

769
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.739
exist back then when these people were kidnapped, right?

770
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:34.719
So that's one. But, um, so it, it is

771
00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:38.979
a little bit more complicated than just sending people

772
00:46:39.159 --> 00:46:41.520
back or these individuals back to where they came

773
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.439
from. However, it's not impossible and we're making real

774
00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:50.639
steps towards um progress here because there are a

775
00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:56.080
lot of cultural heritage, um, um, colleagues that are

776
00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.625
working in the space of cultural. Heritage in many

777
00:46:58.625 --> 00:47:02.065
different West African countries, for example, that would be

778
00:47:02.065 --> 00:47:05.906
very interested in an opportunity like this, right? A

779
00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:08.966
lot of West African countries are heavily investing in

780
00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:14.266
memorializing and commemorating um what happened during the slave

781
00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:16.775
trade, right? And not just like, you know what

782
00:47:16.775 --> 00:47:19.986
happened to them, but also the role of a

783
00:47:19.986 --> 00:47:23.372
certain ethnic groups. Groups and, and, and, and kingdoms

784
00:47:23.372 --> 00:47:26.092
within Africa that contributed to the trade, right? So

785
00:47:26.092 --> 00:47:30.662
Benin is really like clearly um emphasizing that uh

786
00:47:30.662 --> 00:47:33.572
that role here um so there are, there are,

787
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:36.362
there are, we already like have conversations with some

788
00:47:36.362 --> 00:47:40.122
um with some people across, for example, Western African

789
00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:45.979
nations that could be partners in this pursuit. Other

790
00:47:45.979 --> 00:47:48.580
people, and we had this debate too, other people

791
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.760
think like maybe it is also a good idea

792
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.110
or or reasonable to repatriate these ancestors in Lagos,

793
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.959
and just like have them in Lagos like itself,

794
00:47:59.379 --> 00:48:03.060
to have like um a beautiful burial where they're

795
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.500
each, each ancestor gets a coffin and their skeletal

796
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.260
remains gets, you know, blessings and a proper funeral

797
00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.560
with, with, with love and respect. Um, ALTHOUGH they

798
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.520
never wanted to come to Portugal, obviously, right, because

799
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.850
they were trafficked. Um, AND this is like something

800
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.169
that like some sites like, uh, in the, in

801
00:48:24.169 --> 00:48:28.320
the Americas have, have chosen. For example, we, um,

802
00:48:28.449 --> 00:48:31.090
this summer we had uh several colleagues from the

803
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.610
Annson Street African Burial Ground Project from Charleston in

804
00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:38.250
South Carolina, which was also a so-called slave cemetery

805
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.209
that had to be excavated. Um, AND they did

806
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:45.149
strontium and also other, uh, you know, genetic analysis

807
00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:47.229
on these ancestors to find out where they were

808
00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:50.870
actually from, and that community like had, you know,

809
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.030
many community meetings and conversations with the, with the

810
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:58.520
black community to, to decide. Well, what shall happen

811
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.989
to these ancestors, and they decided that these ancestors

812
00:49:01.989 --> 00:49:05.159
had been together for about 400 years in the

813
00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:07.639
ground, and that they should stay together, you know,

814
00:49:07.719 --> 00:49:09.979
that they're a burial community. So you might want

815
00:49:09.979 --> 00:49:12.899
to say that too about Valladaga Fia, you know,

816
00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:16.739
um, maybe like honoring them with a respectful burial

817
00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:19.870
and like, you know, building a monument, uh, or,

818
00:49:19.879 --> 00:49:22.010
or some kind of memorial site that people can

819
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.280
visit and be informed about what happened there, that

820
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.659
would already be. Uh, A huge step in the

821
00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:32.939
right direction, uh, I think. The thing is just

822
00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:37.040
that apparently the local municipality is, is, um, planning

823
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.219
on, on building some kind of a memorial site

824
00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:44.959
or monument there in the park, but without any

825
00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:51.090
consultation of the Afro descendant community in Portugal. Which

826
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.570
is, and you know, I'm, I'm in touch with

827
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.550
a lot of people and none of them are

828
00:49:55.919 --> 00:49:58.290
being, you know, none of them are involved in

829
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.510
this endeavor. So it will probably be some kind

830
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:05.110
of monument that is being built. Uh, NOT with

831
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.709
the community, but maybe even against the wishes of

832
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:10.510
the community, and that would be just detrimental because

833
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.469
it's like such a missed opportunity to work hand

834
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:18.939
in hand if the goal is to right, like

835
00:50:18.939 --> 00:50:20.669
some of the wrongs of the past, you know,

836
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.709
even if it's just like a tiny little bit.

837
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.149
Yeah,

838
00:50:24.699 --> 00:50:28.020
OK, so Doctor Olza, uh, would you like to

839
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.889
tell people again, like you did in our first

840
00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:35.260
conversation, where, where they can find your work on

841
00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.780
the internet and also where they can perhaps learn

842
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.050
more if they're interested about, uh, the. Site at

843
00:50:44.699 --> 00:50:48.800
Yeah, totally. So, um, you can always find me

844
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:56.379
under my lab's website, which is www. PA lab.com.

845
00:50:56.469 --> 00:51:00.040
That's like my, my lab's website. Uh, BUT I

846
00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.560
also have recently started building a website actually for

847
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:13.719
Valladaga Faria, um, with the URL www. Valladagafaria.info. And

848
00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:16.840
so, uh, I'm still building that one, but uh
