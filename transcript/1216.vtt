00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.329
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lobsson. Today

3
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:10.399
I'm joined by Laura Carroll. She's a nonfiction author,

4
00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:15.329
expert on the child-free choice and pro-natalism, and an

5
00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.610
advocate for reproductive rights and ethics related to reproduction

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.010
as well. She's the author of The Baby Matrix

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.670
Why Freing Our Minds from Outmoded Thinking about Parenthood.

8
00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.389
And reproduction will create a better world. And today

9
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:36.709
we're talking about mostly about child-free choices and prenatalism.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.689
So Laura, welcome to the show. It's a huge

11
00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:39.849
pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.590
Thanks for having me on.

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.259
OK, so let's start with the basic question here.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.310
So what is it to be child-free? What does

15
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.819
it mean?

16
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.090
Well, you know, that word was termed in a

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.569
textbook going as far back into the 70s, and

18
00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.130
um really, it still means what it meant then

19
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.209
is it's a, a, that a person who does

20
00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.849
not want to parent, they don't want to have

21
00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.180
children, you know, it's the desire not to To

22
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.139
have children. So, and it is the word child-free

23
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.779
with no hyphen, no child space-free online, you see

24
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.419
all kinds of things now where in, and it's

25
00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:23.139
a muddled definition uh of different versions of the

26
00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:26.080
word depending on the article that you read, but

27
00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.260
that's the way um I, I term it and

28
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.180
how I use it, and that's, you know, historically,

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.720
that's how it's been used and spelled.

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.949
Uh, WOULD it be any problem at all if

31
00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:39.339
it have a hyphen, or, I mean,

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.400
well, if it has a hyphen, sometimes it does

33
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360
mean the same. It's synonymous, but in other pieces

34
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.940
and other. Articles I read, it could mean that

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.540
it's a person who just doesn't have children right

36
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
now. Uh, IT, it, it could mean whatever the

37
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.419
article is about. So it gets confusing. So, and

38
00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.089
you also see it with a space in between,

39
00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:05.540
which can also mean parents who currently aren't with

40
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.339
their kids. So I just like to say, put

41
00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.779
it all together, and that's the word that consistently

42
00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.699
means it's people who really choose not to have

43
00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.100
children.

44
00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:20.619
OK, so let's address right away one question that

45
00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:25.169
probably people will not be very fond of this

46
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.419
conversation will want to ask. So does it have

47
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.860
anything to do with being anti-children?

48
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.199
You know, no, it really doesn't. Um, I think

49
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.949
that, um, I mean, it can, where there are,

50
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.869
I would maybe recharacterize it a little, there are

51
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.789
some child-free people who would say that, you know,

52
00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.470
children in general are not their favorite thing. Now,

53
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.910
it's not that they hate them, but, um, you

54
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.710
know, they just, it's not their favorite thing, and

55
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.750
they don't want to raise them. So it's, it's

56
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.630
not that they're anti-children. Some of them have jobs

57
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.050
that involve children, you know, so, There's a small

58
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.330
percentage who would say that they dislike them, but

59
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.089
that's certainly not the majority. And I think this

60
00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.009
anti-children messaging we hear a lot more of, of

61
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:18.279
late. HAS to do more with antenatalists and antenatalism,

62
00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.979
which is a whole other philosophy where you can

63
00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.539
be, you could be, um, you know, it's a,

64
00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.500
it's more of a philosophy that is, um, of

65
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.259
people who believe it's not, uh, they don't like

66
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.339
to see children come into the world, babies to

67
00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.380
come into the world because of the suffering that

68
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.419
they will incur, and they didn't choose that. So

69
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.520
someone who holds that philosophy could be someone who

70
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.710
is child-free, but not necessarily. Let me tell you,

71
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.539
there's a lot of child-free people who don't even

72
00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.279
know what that word means, let alone the philosophy.

73
00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.820
So I would say that, uh, no, uh, does

74
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.460
it have anything to do with being anti-children? Generally

75
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.800
speaking, absolutely not.

76
00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.660
And let me just add, because I've spoken with

77
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.899
antenatalists on the show, antenatalism also does not have

78
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.339
anything necessarily to do with being anti-children. It's

79
00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.449
just that not necessarily, no.

80
00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.640
Yeah, because there are many antenatalists that say that

81
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.608
we should take care of children who are already

82
00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:20.079
born,

83
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.970
who are already here. Exactly right. Yes, it's just

84
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.369
that the word anti-children, just because we don't want

85
00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:29.890
to raise them doesn't mean we're anti them or

86
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.929
that we hate them. It's just that we don't

87
00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:34.970
want to raise them. So that's a distinction.

88
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.880
Yeah, uh, so is a child free choice something

89
00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.559
that people try to impose on others?

90
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.589
I, in my 25 year plus experience, I've not

91
00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.790
seen that there's no, um, I don't know, they

92
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.619
don't try to impose it on others. They don't

93
00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.630
necessarily advocate it either. I think what I've seen

94
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.230
more in just the two generations, the digital revolution

95
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.070
that I've witnessed since the year 2000 that, uh,

96
00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.980
That online has allowed more people to become educated

97
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.619
about the choice, more people to be aware of

98
00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:18.070
it, and the people who, who make the choice.

99
00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.260
In my, one of my first books, Families of

100
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.140
Two, which was interviews with happily married couples who

101
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.739
were child-free, um, before Google and all this time,

102
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.940
you know, they, they were people who felt like

103
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.359
they lived in the tributaries, you know, really of

104
00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:38.910
society, and Fast forward 25 years, there's so much

105
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.190
now online to, to learn and to be aware

106
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.109
of and to see these people. They're just like,

107
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.309
you know, you and me, they're very normal people.

108
00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.709
So it's not so much about advocacy advocacy or

109
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.070
um pushing it on others. It's more just to

110
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.739
say, here we are, and we're just like you,

111
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.769
we're normal people, and we've just made a choice

112
00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:59.649
that's different than, than others.

113
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.160
So let me ask you, because sometimes, I mean,

114
00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:07.059
I've heard this personally, but also sometimes I hear

115
00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.200
and read people on the internet, people who are

116
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.279
child-free complaining about having to hear some, I mean,

117
00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:19.220
I mean unpleasant things to say the least from

118
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.600
people who have. Children in regards to their choice

119
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.489
to not have children, I mean, where do you

120
00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:27.769
think that this comes from and why do you

121
00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.109
think that if someone, there are many people out

122
00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:34.529
there that if they learn that someone is child

123
00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.959
free, that they feel the need to moralize them

124
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.670
so much.

125
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.440
Well, I think I go into that, into the

126
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.119
baby matrix because it's a, it's, it's foundationally speaking,

127
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.309
it boils down to pro-natalism, and they're holding some

128
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:54.600
pro-natalist beliefs that, uh, makes it easy to judge

129
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.000
that choice. For example, a very common one is

130
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.160
that people might see others who are child-free, that

131
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.000
they're selfish because they don't want to raise kids.

132
00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:07.109
They don't want to have parenthood be the central

133
00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:09.320
focus of their life. So somehow that makes them

134
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.890
a selfish person. Um, AND other things, is there's

135
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.489
something wrong with people who don't want to have

136
00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:20.089
kids. So, but because they hold the belief that

137
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:23.010
normal people want them, and, you know, to do

138
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.329
the most selfless thing to do is to have

139
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:28.149
a child, those beliefs, when they see people doing

140
00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:31.440
the opposite, it's easy to judge them, but the

141
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.609
foundational element of it is, uh, pro-natalism, which I'm

142
00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:36.149
sure we'll talk more about.

143
00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.839
Mhm. Yeah, so let's address another elephant in the

144
00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.230
room because this is something that I also hear

145
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.410
a lot from pro-Natalist people. They say that most

146
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:55.769
people without children, child-free people, are childless, not. Exactly

147
00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:59.489
by choice but by circumstance and then they get

148
00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:05.170
into some pseudo critiques of feminism like saying that

149
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.290
oh it is because for example this is just

150
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.369
one thing that they say they say others as

151
00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:15.679
well. Uh, IT is, for example, uh, because women,

152
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.579
uh, want to have a career and they want

153
00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:21.179
to study, they go, they want to go to

154
00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:24.570
higher education, and then they postpone, they postpone, they

155
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.100
postpone having children, and then they arrive at their

156
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.744
40s or late 30s. And and then they say,

157
00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:34.765
oh my God, I can no longer have children.

158
00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:37.984
I'm no longer in a proper state to have

159
00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:41.183
children or something like that, but they regret the

160
00:08:41.183 --> 00:08:43.445
choice. That's what they mean by that, that they,

161
00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:46.695
they would, they in fact wanted to have children,

162
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:50.465
but they regret not having children and they are

163
00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:54.544
just childless by circumstance. I mean, do we have

164
00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:57.385
good data on that? And if so, what does

165
00:08:57.385 --> 00:08:58.505
the data tell us?

166
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.340
We really don't have good data on that specifically.

167
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.909
Now, while that could be, uh, a woman's story,

168
00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:11.789
it's very logical, it's feasible, but, uh, it's very,

169
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.840
in my opinion, the most people who end up

170
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.599
without children, uh, they, it's, it, it's very hard

171
00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:23.390
to generalize. And so it, it's it, for most

172
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.020
women, it's a story that evolves over time. Now,

173
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:28.669
for some, it could be that, that they end

174
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.750
up when early in their lives, they have, they

175
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.590
think they want them, they have a career, their

176
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.909
life goes on, and many end up realizing they

177
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.190
don't want them. They end up having a, making

178
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.570
a child-free choice. So over time, Their feelings shift,

179
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.349
or it could be the opposite, or it could

180
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:50.309
be some mix of it in between when they're

181
00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:53.960
in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. So, it's, Every

182
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.880
woman has their own story, and uh I looked

183
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.789
into that when I did a longitudinal study with

184
00:09:59.789 --> 00:10:04.099
uh 25 women who, they were in their twenties

185
00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:06.950
when we started and they were decidedly child-free, and

186
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.359
I watched them for 10 years, and I interviewed

187
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.400
them once a year for 10 years and watched

188
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.159
how their lives unfolded, how their feelings about their

189
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:21.039
child-free choice remained the same, or sometimes they had

190
00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:24.885
shifts. Insureness about that. And then at the end

191
00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:27.205
of the 10 years, the story ends with, well,

192
00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:29.924
do they still have kids? Did they not? And

193
00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:32.405
there was a variety of stories. So I think

194
00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:35.284
it's really hard to just say this is the

195
00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:37.885
one thing that happens and that women, you know,

196
00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:41.164
they regret it. There, that can happen, but there's

197
00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:45.085
a whole host of other stories, how women navigate

198
00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:47.945
um their reproductive choice and whether they have children

199
00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:50.184
of their own, they adopt or not.

200
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.510
Right, I mean, but we shouldn't assume unless there's

201
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.000
good data to support that, that people who are

202
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.080
child-free are just childless by circumstance and that they

203
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.669
regret that

204
00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:11.669
decision. See, to me, definitively, if you're child free,

205
00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:15.630
you don't feel regret. So if you're childless by

206
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.989
circumstance, that might, uh, that more indicates that, yes,

207
00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:22.869
gee, I really wanted them, but I, for, for

208
00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:27.070
reasons, I don't have them. A child-free person would

209
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.549
say, I'm in my 40s, 50s, and I can

210
00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:32.830
no longer have kids. Whoopee. I'm happy about that.

211
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.400
I don't want them. And like I say, many

212
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.239
women's journeys, they end up, they begin thinking they

213
00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:45.159
want them, but over time, they realize for a

214
00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:48.630
whole host of reasons that uh they feel their

215
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.359
life is going to be more fulfilling without that

216
00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:54.520
parental role. That's a lot of what I see

217
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.330
when it's delayed. So now there is research to

218
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.890
to support the fact that women who know early

219
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.309
in life that they don't want to have kids

220
00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:06.809
and they're very sure about that from a younger

221
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.669
age, they tend not to change their mind. Ever,

222
00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.010
OK. They don't, and they don't get into that

223
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.760
regret space or this, or the evolution of the,

224
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.559
of the choice over time. It's, it's less so.

225
00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:22.609
However, that percentage of people who know that early

226
00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:25.130
in their life is, is small. That's a, that's

227
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.809
a minority, but there is some tracking there that

228
00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:30.710
we see across some studies.

229
00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:34.409
OK, and I mean this is something that I've

230
00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:38.119
I've, I've also heard a lot from pro-natalists. Is

231
00:12:38.119 --> 00:12:42.820
it true that people with children are happier on

232
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.619
average than people without children?

233
00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:48.799
Oh, this one really gets me going. I've been

234
00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:51.359
writing about this probably uh since I had my

235
00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:55.400
Lov Child Free blog that I started in 2009,

236
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.080
cause there are these studies that come out that,

237
00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:00.919
you know, people with children are happier, people without

238
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:04.080
children are happier, and then it, over time, there,

239
00:13:04.729 --> 00:13:07.200
there's one way or another, there's, the jury is

240
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.960
out. Now, what isn't out is that most of

241
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.479
the studies have flaws in the sense that they

242
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:20.270
don't Um, they don't have samples that, um, dissect

243
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.849
out a person who's child-free, uh, a person who

244
00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:28.510
wanted kids but didn't have them. That might be

245
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.849
a different correlation to happiness than a child-free person.

246
00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:36.099
So, they don't have these different situational samples, um,

247
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.409
and they don't often, hardly ever, uh, operationally define

248
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.520
happiness. So, if we don't really know what it

249
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.039
is, how can we really say that it's so?

250
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:51.799
So, so, one thing that I like to say

251
00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:55.119
is because the jury's out on most of these

252
00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:56.960
studies, I can't think of one where I can

253
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.760
point to and go, now, that one was done

254
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.590
well, um, is that maybe the question isn't so

255
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.520
much this about whether kids make you, uh, fulfilled

256
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.090
and happy. Maybe it's something else. And it's not

257
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.369
just whether you have kids or not. I'd like

258
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:15.929
to see more focus on that. Yeah,

259
00:14:16.049 --> 00:14:19.710
we wouldn't necessarily have to have more detailed data

260
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.289
and break down the data more to really know

261
00:14:23.289 --> 00:14:26.729
what's the main factor at play there and not

262
00:14:26.729 --> 00:14:30.530
simply assume that it's having children or not having

263
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.030
children.

264
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.049
And how do you operationally define happiness, and that

265
00:14:34.049 --> 00:14:36.809
should be a realm of the research study too

266
00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:40.010
of what's What's most important that equals, you know,

267
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.200
meaning in life for me, um, that, that's, that's

268
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.200
hard to get to in, uh, experimentation. Um, SO,

269
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.090
you know, quantitative data. So I just say that

270
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.130
it's one factor. It can be one factor, parenthood,

271
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.770
but, you know, in the end, it's more complicated

272
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.289
than that.

273
00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:01.919
I mean, don't even get, yeah, I don't think,

274
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.929
don't even get me started on happiness. Yeah, because

275
00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:08.890
they are so, so flawed. I have a conversation

276
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.369
with Doctor Owen Flanagan, a philosopher, because back in

277
00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:16.369
2023 he released an edited book and edited with

278
00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:18.570
a few of, uh, book edited with a few

279
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.409
other authors that's titled Against Happiness, and I mean

280
00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:26.929
just to say in a quick sentence that happiness

281
00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:30.200
studies are absolutely flawed because they don't even take

282
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.039
into account. Cultural diversity in terms of how people

283
00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:37.700
understand happiness in their own cultural context.

284
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.440
So for sure, for sure,

285
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.450
you know, yeah,

286
00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:44.200
and religious context too across countries globally, it's very

287
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200
different, yeah,

288
00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:48.799
yeah, and I mean one interesting thing is that

289
00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:55.330
pro-natalists are always talking about these awful regret that

290
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.599
supposedly people would feel if they, uh, postpone having

291
00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:02.195
children. And then eventually, eventually get to a point

292
00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.525
in their lives that for some reason they can

293
00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:08.335
no longer have them, but they never tell us

294
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:11.494
about another kind of thing that we now know

295
00:16:11.494 --> 00:16:14.575
is true thanks to the work of sociologists like

296
00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:19.914
the Israeli Arna Donev that people can also regret

297
00:16:20.094 --> 00:16:21.434
having children.

298
00:16:21.655 --> 00:16:25.335
That's right, and it's very taboo, which is why

299
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.844
until recently there's not a lot of talk about

300
00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:32.020
that. Uh, THAT too points to pro-natalism. Why? Because

301
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.479
there's the belief in that behemoth set of pro-natalist

302
00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:39.159
beliefs that we shouldn't feel regret. It should be

303
00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:41.200
the best thing that ever happens to us. And

304
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.559
so if we, oh, if we don't feel totally

305
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:49.159
110% positive about it, what? Something's wrong with you.

306
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.619
Because that's the way it's supposed to be. So

307
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:55.460
in Orna, she does some great qualitative research to

308
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.580
get women to talk more about it, and it

309
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.020
has helped uh more women talk about it online,

310
00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:04.449
but they're still, you know, they're like closed forums,

311
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.219
the ones that are that are most candid because

312
00:17:06.219 --> 00:17:09.880
that taboo is still so powerful, unfortunately.

313
00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:14.329
Yeah, right, and I mean, let's talk about a

314
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.689
little bit about biology here because um I mean

315
00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:22.689
there might be some misunderstanding going around here in

316
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:26.250
terms of what we have evolved to want. Have

317
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.089
we really evolved to want children or and to

318
00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:33.589
reproduce or simply to have sex?

319
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.560
Well, one thing that the research tells us and

320
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.479
scholars across we that have dug deeply into this

321
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:47.719
is there is no evidence to support there's anything

322
00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:51.420
in our biology that creates the desire, like to

323
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.719
want children. There's biology involved in being pregnant at

324
00:17:55.719 --> 00:17:59.650
the time of delivery, things happen. Uh, BUT the

325
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.540
biology that would create the desire to have them,

326
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:07.099
it's not there. So that too, just to think

327
00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:10.300
that that desire is innate, that is a strong

328
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.660
pronatalist belief that we've been fed for centuries and

329
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.420
so, so long that we just tend to, most

330
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.099
people think it's true, when really, that is not.

331
00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:24.510
Now, the urge to have sex. You could say

332
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.099
it's more innate because we do have that desire.

333
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.339
Yet at the same time, I want to leave

334
00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:31.579
that to the experts because there's people out there

335
00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:34.060
who are asexual. They don't have the desire to

336
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.099
want sex. So if it were innate, we'd all

337
00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:39.859
want to be doing it a lot, you know.

338
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.000
So, and it does happen, but, you know, so.

339
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.979
Is it innate? It's a, that's a whole another,

340
00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:49.430
another like question on both sides. But what I

341
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.040
do know is our biology, our capacities are such

342
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.439
that as humans, as Homo sapiens, it's given, it's

343
00:18:57.439 --> 00:19:01.199
such that we, our, our cognitive and brain capacities

344
00:19:01.199 --> 00:19:05.640
gives us the choice. To have them animals, they

345
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.989
just do what they do instinctually, and they, they

346
00:19:07.989 --> 00:19:10.680
reproduce to have more, but we have the capacity

347
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.829
to go, wait a minute, do I wanna do

348
00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:16.680
that? So that's where some of our biology comes

349
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.469
in, in my opinion. That's where to go.

350
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:21.770
Yeah, so let me just have a couple of

351
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.089
things and then you can comment on them to

352
00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:26.369
that to the instinct to have sex or the

353
00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:29.810
instinct to reproduce. I mean, I would buy more

354
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.849
the argument that we have an instinct to have

355
00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:36.005
sex, OK, so at least from puberty on. Words

356
00:19:36.005 --> 00:19:39.165
that at the very least we feel attracted a

357
00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:42.405
lot to the opposite sex or the same sex,

358
00:19:42.444 --> 00:19:46.324
I mean, whatever, but we, we have that impulse

359
00:19:46.324 --> 00:19:48.665
from a certain point in our lives on to

360
00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:52.689
at least feel attracted to someone and. Uh, OF

361
00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:56.849
course, the details about whether we really have an

362
00:19:56.849 --> 00:20:00.569
instinct to actually have sex, OK, that's more debatable

363
00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:04.010
because there's a good reason why we also have

364
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.209
sex education in schools because that is not something

365
00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:11.729
that people are born with that kind of knowledge

366
00:20:11.729 --> 00:20:15.194
either. So, uh, I mean. But, but when it

367
00:20:15.194 --> 00:20:18.594
comes to reproducing and uh having children, I mean,

368
00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:22.915
I read a recent study that points to a

369
00:20:22.915 --> 00:20:27.714
strong possibility that from uh very early on in

370
00:20:27.714 --> 00:20:33.175
our revolution as Homo sapiens, we learned that sex

371
00:20:33.194 --> 00:20:37.920
is connected to reproduction. But that's still a cultural

372
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.780
thing. I mean, you still have to teach people

373
00:20:41.959 --> 00:20:44.640
that there's that connection. I mean, that connection does

374
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.400
not come installed in our sort of evolved software

375
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.640
that we are born with that knowledge either. So

376
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.520
I mean I would agree with you there. Yeah,

377
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.239
that's why sex education is so important so that

378
00:20:57.239 --> 00:21:00.400
young people know if you do this, this might

379
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.479
happen, and here's how it happens. It's not just

380
00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:05.599
the pleasure of the moment.

381
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.280
So yeah, so just to say that even if

382
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.359
uh Homo sapiens have known for even if it's

383
00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:15.760
from the very beginning, from the very beginning of

384
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.359
our existence, that there's that that link between having

385
00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:23.540
sex and Uh, children, uh, I mean that's still

386
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.699
cultural. It's not biological, it's something that people propagate

387
00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:33.140
culturally from generation to generation, that kind of knowledge

388
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.959
is not something that a baby is born knowing.

389
00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:41.300
And certainly you could, uh, argue too that that

390
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.900
evolution is still happening where we have now, we

391
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.859
have, uh, identity, uh, gender identity is evolving, which

392
00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:52.969
then leads to what kind of partnering and evolving

393
00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:58.030
sexual orientation. And the cultural, social lifestyles that are

394
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.910
as a result, and that too is, you know,

395
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.469
binary or not, asexual or not, romantic. So we're,

396
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.560
we're dissecting it out even further as we go

397
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.880
along as, as humans. So, but I think the

398
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.199
core of it though is back to, is the

399
00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:19.560
desire to want children, that's not innate. That I'm

400
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.719
clear about. It's social and culturally, uh, been fed

401
00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:25.439
to us for centuries such that we think it

402
00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:29.199
is, we think it's hardware wired, but it's really

403
00:22:29.199 --> 00:22:32.760
not. It's just old messaging that, uh, we think

404
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.819
is true. That's one reason I did the baby

405
00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:38.180
nature is I want people to see through this,

406
00:22:38.209 --> 00:22:40.739
to like, no, this is not true. So once

407
00:22:40.739 --> 00:22:42.739
you know what the truth is, it can help

408
00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:46.900
people make better decisions about reproduction. So that's, that's

409
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.280
largely what I was after.

410
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:52.530
OK, so just before we get in directly into

411
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.109
pro-natalism, even though we've already been talking about it

412
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.689
throughout our conversation, let me just ask you one

413
00:22:59.689 --> 00:23:02.469
more question. I mean, this is something that I've,

414
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:07.650
uh, heard in the Birth Gap documentary by Stephen

415
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.270
J. Shaw, which is apparently making the rounds again

416
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.530
in some podcasts across the internet and elsewhere. I

417
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:21.790
mean, do people who reproduce really tend to want

418
00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:24.609
large families? I mean, because one claim that he

419
00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:27.209
makes, I'm going to paraphrase, I don't have the

420
00:23:27.209 --> 00:23:31.369
exact citation here, the exact quote here, but one

421
00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:35.410
claim that he makes is the hardest step for

422
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.810
people to take is to have the first child,

423
00:23:37.969 --> 00:23:40.800
and once they have the first, the first child,

424
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.130
then they go on to have the 2nd, the

425
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.520
4th, the 4th, the 5th, and so on. I

426
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.160
mean, is there, there, is there really evidence to

427
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.760
support that?

428
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:53.680
Absolutely not. That, I mean, that's uh one of

429
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.920
just so many assertions that he makes in the

430
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.560
film that, uh, the website that uh a cadre

431
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.260
of us have developed called Birth Facts or Birthgapfacts.org

432
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.479
that we address that, uh, it's, this is, there's

433
00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:10.609
no evidence to support that people desire a specific

434
00:24:10.609 --> 00:24:12.209
number. Number of children. I mean, you could, we

435
00:24:12.209 --> 00:24:15.020
could sit here and argue for a while about

436
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.420
why, why they want fewer. And it's, there's a

437
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.140
lot of practicality involved in that. I mean, who

438
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.260
can have 5 children? OK, that's maybe it's in

439
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.660
a, you know, different cultures. It's culturally, it's based

440
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.209
on cultural, social norms that You know, that's related

441
00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:33.729
to the number of kids, so, uh, it's, it's

442
00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:37.589
so not just the way it is. Look around

443
00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:39.410
and uh that's not what people are doing and

444
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.530
that's not what they really want to do. That's

445
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.890
what he might want to see happen, but I

446
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.270
don't, there's no evidence to support those assertions.

447
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.180
And by the way, we also have to keep

448
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.540
in mind that uh for example, in poorer countries

449
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.900
where the birth rates are still at least higher

450
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.770
than they are in the, in most developed countries,

451
00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:05.819
11 of the reasons why that happens is not

452
00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:09.099
necessarily because people plan on having that high number

453
00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:12.219
of children, it's, it's because it just happens. I

454
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:14.719
mean, it's. Just because people do not have access

455
00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:19.420
to proper parent planning and sex education and contraception,

456
00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:22.890
and they have sex, they have sex, and children

457
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.619
happen. I mean, it's not planned.

458
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.819
That's right, yeah, they have lack of access to

459
00:25:26.819 --> 00:25:30.089
birth control or education about that, and, you know,

460
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.219
culturally, some of in there too, some of it

461
00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:37.989
is. Using birth control during sex is culturally taboo

462
00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:41.069
in some countries, so the, the women have to

463
00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:44.709
face that and how to figure that out. Uh,

464
00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:47.729
SO yes, it's, uh, it's, it's cultural in nature

465
00:25:47.729 --> 00:25:50.869
and, uh, social, uh, driven often as well and

466
00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:53.550
just access and education, yeah.

467
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.270
So we've been talking about pro-natalism, but, but what

468
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.849
is pro-natalism exactly and what are the kinds of

469
00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:05.939
ideas that they put forth, the pro-NATOists.

470
00:26:07.209 --> 00:26:10.770
Well, I would say that pronatalism, that word is

471
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.729
a set of beliefs, and it's big. It's, I

472
00:26:13.729 --> 00:26:15.650
like to call it a behemoth because it's so

473
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.569
big, but it's a set of beliefs that all

474
00:26:18.569 --> 00:26:22.530
have in common that they're pro-birth, they encourage reproduction,

475
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.439
and they exalt the role of parenthood. So, uh,

476
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.530
in the Baby Matrix, I go into 7 big

477
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.250
pro-natalist assumptions that have driven society for, for a

478
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.589
long time. So, there's just some their beliefs. And

479
00:26:38.589 --> 00:26:41.780
so, I would say that saying the word, uh,

480
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.510
like, who is a pro-natalist? A pro-natalist is somebody

481
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.069
who believes some, all of those beliefs, you know,

482
00:26:49.189 --> 00:26:51.270
to the, to the extent that you have, you

483
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.619
believe pro-natal beliefs. You're the same, you're a strong

484
00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:56.939
pronali, or if you, you know, believe some of

485
00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:00.219
them, not so strong. So, we're throwing the word

486
00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:02.739
around pro naus these days that just because, you

487
00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:04.660
know, I might, uh, uh, as a pro nali,

488
00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:06.660
I might think that everybody should have 5 kids,

489
00:27:06.739 --> 00:27:08.540
that makes me a pro natalist. Well, that just

490
00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.079
means I have this one belief. That's related to

491
00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:16.400
some other beliefs in the behemoth of prenatalism. So,

492
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.660
but some of the biggest foundational ones, I think,

493
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.239
um, just 3 that I talk about a lot.

494
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.319
One is, uh, what I call the destiny, pronatalist

495
00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:29.920
destiny assumption in, in the baby matrix where we're

496
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.000
all destined to want to have children. We've discussed

497
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.880
that already and I, in, in the book, then

498
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.079
I dissect that and say, here's really what the

499
00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:41.119
truth is. The second one I call the normality

500
00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:44.640
assumption that somehow if you don't want kids or

501
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.880
you don't end up with them, there's something wrong

502
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.939
with you. You're, you know, you're not mature enough.

503
00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:52.119
I mean, there's a litany of what could be

504
00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:55.295
judged about what's wrong, what's not normal. And And

505
00:27:55.295 --> 00:27:57.415
the third, that a big one that there's a

506
00:27:57.415 --> 00:28:00.094
lot of other beliefs attached to it, that somehow

507
00:28:00.094 --> 00:28:03.854
having kids equals true fulfillment in life. Like, if

508
00:28:03.854 --> 00:28:06.775
you don't do it, you're not gonna have what

509
00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:11.275
it really, really means, you know, in life. So,

510
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.839
So there are just, and there's not, they all

511
00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.989
don't have to do with not having kids. It

512
00:28:16.989 --> 00:28:20.119
relates to, uh, if you have an only child,

513
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.500
this is a pro-natalist belief, oh, if you only

514
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.099
have one kid, that kid's not gonna grow up

515
00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:30.260
to be socially, you know, adjusted, uh, that biology

516
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.050
or having a bio biological child is best. Like,

517
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.219
as a woman, if I don't have my own

518
00:28:37.219 --> 00:28:40.380
biological child, then I have to feel shame, something's

519
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.040
wrong with me. If IVF doesn't work, I should

520
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.369
feel shame. Something's wrong with me. If I don't

521
00:28:47.369 --> 00:28:49.250
have, you know, a boy and a girl, I

522
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.250
have to keep going till I have a boy

523
00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.069
and a girl, and that's what makes a family.

524
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.150
I mean, it's just It, it affects all of

525
00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.869
us, this pro-natalism, um, set of beliefs that we

526
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:03.770
drag around for centuries, that, um, I have to

527
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.510
point out that it's not just about not having

528
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.709
kids or thinking kids are the, the be all

529
00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:12.219
end all. It's all these other things that are

530
00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:14.510
attached to people who do have kids and have

531
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:18.979
families. So it's, it's all of us, everywhere. It's

532
00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:19.479
big.

533
00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:23.060
OK, OK, wait a minute. I have to address

534
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.900
two of the things you said there. So you

535
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.020
said that one of the things they say is

536
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.780
that you should have more than one child because

537
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.339
if you only have one, they will grow up

538
00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:36.430
socially unadjusted. Uh, uh,

539
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.890
YEAH, there, well, that has come from just like,

540
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.680
again, because It's a pronatus belief that you should

541
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.979
have a lot of kids, and so if you

542
00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:50.180
only have one, there's gonna be social messaging around

543
00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.459
that. Now, for a while, uh, there was research

544
00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:56.739
supposedly that supported that, but when it was dissected

545
00:29:56.739 --> 00:30:00.839
later by Different researchers, they debunked it, and it

546
00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:04.160
was by a, a guy who, Stanley Hall, I

547
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.520
think his name was, and he was a guy

548
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.469
who came from a large family, and you, you

549
00:30:09.469 --> 00:30:11.520
could tell by reading the research, all of his

550
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.800
stereotypes were in there. There was debunked so easily.

551
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.510
But by then, It was in the social stratosphere

552
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.430
that people believed that. Even to this day, I

553
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.930
can't tell you, I hear people, oh yeah, how

554
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.150
many kids do you have? Only 10, so are

555
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.430
you gonna, you know, is, is Sally gonna have

556
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.670
a sister? Are you gonna, you know, keep trying,

557
00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:33.109
like, get it, give her a brother or sister.

558
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.920
It's so ingrained. So it's, uh, But the research

559
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.439
doesn't support that, really that they're not well adjusted,

560
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.719
that boils down to good parenting, but um the

561
00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:46.439
stereotypes are there. They, they still are.

562
00:30:47.229 --> 00:30:50.060
And I mean, the other thing is that you

563
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:55.119
say that they they sort of shame women who

564
00:30:55.489 --> 00:31:00.780
have difficulty reproducing, yeah, I mean, why, there are

565
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.560
women out there who just are infertile. I mean,

566
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.180
right, and yes, and that points to something is

567
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.819
wrong with you and you should feel bad about

568
00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:15.530
that. I mean, that's a prenatalist notion, yeah, that

569
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.640
you should feel shame, feel bad that you can't,

570
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.770
you can't do what a woman, a woman's supposed

571
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.170
to do, which is to have a child reproduce.

572
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.089
So, that too gets it a foundational, foundational pronatalist

573
00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:29.689
belief that the role of a woman is to

574
00:31:29.689 --> 00:31:32.670
become a mother, period, and stop.

575
00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:36.550
OK, so are we getting now into that sort

576
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.949
of silly argument that one of the things that

577
00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:43.500
defines a woman is the ability to reproduce? So

578
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.989
if you don't have that ability, you're no longer

579
00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:47.579
a woman. Is that the argument?

580
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.310
Well, you're still a woman, but you're flawed, and

581
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.790
you should feel bad. And you should feel shame

582
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.890
about that. And that's also what drives the fertility

583
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.069
industry. It's big business, you know, what women will

584
00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:02.510
go through to try to have their own kid

585
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:06.560
is amazing. But that's, you know, again, it's, it's

586
00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.930
that social and cultural pressure that, that, uh, with

587
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.810
that belief that I'm supposed to be able to

588
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.109
do this, and if I can't, oh, you know,

589
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.050
meanwhile, women that get pregnant, they miscarry all the

590
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.770
time, you know, our bodies are, they're smart. When

591
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.689
it's not right, the body says, mm mm, and

592
00:32:24.689 --> 00:32:27.150
then that we're supposed to hide that too, that

593
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.000
that's supposed to be wrong, and really, it's, it's,

594
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:32.750
it's really right biologically.

595
00:32:33.569 --> 00:32:36.449
No, look, I, I, I was starting to laugh

596
00:32:36.449 --> 00:32:40.310
because, because it came to my mind that the

597
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.420
pro-natalists who are religious and they say that, for

598
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.900
example, that God is against abortion, if they looked

599
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:56.599
into the numbers of embryos that get expelled by

600
00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:59.660
the woman's body in the first few weeks, the.

601
00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:03.489
Percentages, I guess that they would change their minds

602
00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:08.010
about God being against abortion because it's just insane.

603
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.540
Those numbers are just insane.

604
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.689
You gotta be against abortion in the church because,

605
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.160
you know, pro-natalist dogma is you need more people.

606
00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.609
We need to have more people having more babies,

607
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.449
so I have more people who are in my

608
00:33:20.449 --> 00:33:24.810
religious structure so that my religion can, can keep

609
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.770
and grow its power. And that's been going on

610
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.510
for centuries.

611
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:35.030
So For sure, so, um, let's talk about this

612
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.819
idea that pro-Natalists are some of them at least,

613
00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:43.329
now we're getting into more of the, er, um,

614
00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:49.219
political and, er, political I would say mostly political

615
00:33:49.219 --> 00:33:53.500
ramifications of pro-NATalism because some people take it a

616
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.520
step further and it's not just, oh I'm going

617
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.800
to spend my life advocating for. Pro-NATalism, no, I'm

618
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.479
going to try to politically impose pro-natalism based on

619
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.679
certain, uh, claims that they make, and one of

620
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.120
them has to do with this idea of that

621
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.760
we are headed toward population collapse. Uh, I mean,

622
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.639
what does population collapse mean and is there any

623
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.120
evidence to support that?

624
00:34:25.418 --> 00:34:27.819
The evidence is that there's no collapse going on.

625
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:32.099
I mean, you just gotta go to population clock.org

626
00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:33.819
and I mean, the last I looked at the

627
00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:36.809
United States, it's like one net person is born

628
00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:40.309
every 14, sometimes it's 16 seconds. I mean, we're,

629
00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:44.599
new babies are coming into the world. I mean,

630
00:34:44.678 --> 00:34:46.978
every so many seconds. So, and what is it?

631
00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.438
Globally, I think the fertility rate for women is

632
00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:53.250
like 2.3. Do the numbers. It's gonna keep growing.

633
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:59.199
So the population collapse is related to the pro-natalist

634
00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:04.110
belief that we need to continue to grow the

635
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.120
population, and if we, and, and a, a growth-oriented

636
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.320
economy is the way we need to exist as

637
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.800
humans, which, why? Because it pretends that we need

638
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.159
more and more people. It depends on that growth.

639
00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:23.919
So, to get people scared, they will, they will

640
00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:26.000
say, oh my God, there's not enough of us,

641
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.520
we're gonna, we're gonna become extinct. You gotta, you

642
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.879
gotta get going, you gotta have some kids. It's

643
00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:35.320
just another social device, as an early feminists called

644
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.879
it. It's like a social device that tries to

645
00:35:37.879 --> 00:35:41.000
get us to believe we should be fearful somehow

646
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.080
and get us to act in a reproductive way

647
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.639
that, uh, that the some power structures would like

648
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:49.020
us to. So I think it's, again, I think

649
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.080
it's all propaganda. You just look at the numbers

650
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.100
and we're growing exponentially. If anything, it's the opposite,

651
00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:57.739
where we have Earth overshoot, like we use up

652
00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:03.010
the Earth's resources annually, sooner and sooner every year,

653
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.639
because there's more and more of us using more.

654
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.739
And now there are people who would argue, well,

655
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.100
we have to just, you know, lower our consumption.

656
00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:13.899
Well, I want to see that, you know. How

657
00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:15.979
are we gonna figure that out? And even if

658
00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:19.540
we found high-tech ways to solve that, you know,

659
00:36:19.659 --> 00:36:21.620
what I read and research that I've read is,

660
00:36:21.739 --> 00:36:26.179
is just because the technology gets better on greening

661
00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:28.540
up industry, etc. AND all these things we can

662
00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.899
do, all that it ends up with that we

663
00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:33.500
continue to keep consuming. It doesn't end up in

664
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.179
less consumption, it ends up in more consumption. So

665
00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:42.080
more consumption, more people, If anything, it's overpopulation crisis,

666
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:46.239
not collapse. So that's my camp. That's my, my

667
00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:49.209
spiel. I'm in the overpopulation. I'm concerned about it

668
00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:49.649
camp.

669
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.489
Yeah, yeah, and I mean, where's the population collapse

670
00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:57.350
if the world population will grow until it reaches

671
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.969
1011 billion? I mean, I mean, the numbers are.

672
00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:05.686
Not precise, but it's around 10 or 11 billion

673
00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:08.395
that people put the cap off, the cap on,

674
00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:11.605
and then it will stabilize. Some people say maybe

675
00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:14.206
it will go down a little bit, maybe not.

676
00:37:14.325 --> 00:37:14.946
I don't know,

677
00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:17.555
but we know what's going to happen. We could

678
00:37:17.555 --> 00:37:20.845
have resource wars that could, you know, disseminate populations

679
00:37:20.845 --> 00:37:24.446
in different parts of the world and nobody really

680
00:37:24.446 --> 00:37:25.375
knows.

681
00:37:25.562 --> 00:37:29.142
And and and then the thing is, what kind

682
00:37:29.142 --> 00:37:32.922
of, I mean, what number would be enough for

683
00:37:32.922 --> 00:37:38.322
these people to be satisfied? 40 billion, 50 billion,

684
00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:43.471
100 billion, 500 billion, I mean, because after a

685
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:47.832
certain point, we're just completely destroying the planet.

686
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:53.979
That's right. Yet Pro-natalism is all about growth, more

687
00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:57.469
people, more this, more, more, more, more growth-oriented economy,

688
00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.090
and there are a lot of people that are

689
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.030
really concerned about it on how do we unravel

690
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:08.020
that and try to um demographically, um, figure out

691
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.060
how all of us can live here and how

692
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.500
many is that, and there's varying numbers, which I'm

693
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.790
sure you're aware of them. I've seen it as

694
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.600
low as 2 billion to, to create a sustainable

695
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.975
world economy that we takes enough resources. Sources for

696
00:38:21.975 --> 00:38:24.175
us, but we don't destroy the planet as we're

697
00:38:24.175 --> 00:38:28.094
going. Some say 34. It's a, it's, it's not

698
00:38:28.094 --> 00:38:30.695
really decided, but one thing for sure is when

699
00:38:30.695 --> 00:38:34.054
you think of sustainability and as an economy, it's

700
00:38:34.054 --> 00:38:36.054
a heck of a lot less than 8 billion

701
00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:40.229
and counting. So that I, that I will, I'll

702
00:38:40.229 --> 00:38:40.959
buy into.

703
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.070
And I mean then there's also, we can also

704
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.989
talk about the benefits of having fewer people on

705
00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:52.260
the planet that they never address because for example,

706
00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:56.659
fewer people correlate with higher wages for the average

707
00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:01.115
worker, fewer, fewer. Where people correlate with uh I

708
00:39:01.115 --> 00:39:06.145
mean uh less housing crisis for example as well,

709
00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:11.756
so and they never address that, never ever address

710
00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:16.815
that they're always uh freaking out about the supposed

711
00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:21.761
imminent collapse of Social Security, but they never. Address

712
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:22.781
those benefits.

713
00:39:22.922 --> 00:39:25.281
That's right. That's what I would say is they're

714
00:39:25.281 --> 00:39:28.152
all about the baby matrix. They all, you know,

715
00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:30.001
I love the movie and that's why I called

716
00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:33.521
the book that because they're, they're not, they're only

717
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:36.642
telling you what they want you to believe, and

718
00:39:36.642 --> 00:39:39.241
it's not the truth. So, you know, you see

719
00:39:39.241 --> 00:39:40.882
beyond it and once you do, you can't really

720
00:39:40.882 --> 00:39:44.030
unsee it, so. Yeah, it's a, it's, it's a

721
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.110
scary, I think that too many people and grow,

722
00:39:46.189 --> 00:39:48.429
grow, grow at all costs, the, the way we're

723
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:51.350
going, it's, um, it's a scary thing for those

724
00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.459
of us who are already here and for people

725
00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:55.429
who do bring children into the world, you know,

726
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.310
and they're gonna be here in these next generations

727
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.989
to come, and I, I really don't know what

728
00:39:59.989 --> 00:40:01.949
they're gonna have to face if we keep on

729
00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:03.090
this, on this road.

730
00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:08.590
Yeah, yeah, the prospects are already very dire because

731
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.989
of climate change and all of that, even with

732
00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:14.270
the population we have now, so even adding 2

733
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.669
or 3 more billion as we're going to inevitably

734
00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:20.669
add to the world population, I mean, you know,

735
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.149
so, uh, but, but I mean, uh, just to

736
00:40:23.149 --> 00:40:28.709
address shortly, uh, the social security thing. So the

737
00:40:28.709 --> 00:40:31.790
aging populations need more babies?

738
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.399
I think the operative word there is need. I

739
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.479
don't think we need uh more babies. I think

740
00:40:38.479 --> 00:40:40.840
what we instead need to do more is to

741
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.030
try to figure out how to manage the, the

742
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:48.320
demography, as it were, and, um, and that will

743
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.840
require, uh, getting off, you know, grow at all

744
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.110
costs. So, again, it's to try to shift the

745
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.500
focus to How do we care for everyone who's

746
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.540
here and, and get off the, the only, the

747
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.959
only idea that's there is to create new people,

748
00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.820
to take care of the old people. That has

749
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.850
to be only one way to go and the

750
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.820
rate, again, the rate we're going on it, um,

751
00:41:13.899 --> 00:41:15.899
it's, it's not a good ending. So we need

752
00:41:15.899 --> 00:41:19.320
to look at other ways to Manage all of

753
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.610
us here and the economy. So, and I think

754
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.489
there are ways to do it. There are demographers

755
00:41:23.489 --> 00:41:26.689
out there and experts that I am sure could

756
00:41:26.689 --> 00:41:29.989
figure it out, but we don't have the will.

757
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.229
We've got governments that are pro-natalist in nature. They

758
00:41:34.229 --> 00:41:37.370
are grow, grow, grow at all costs. They want

759
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.510
that. So this is a, uh, um, another way

760
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.070
to approach it that they're not behind yet.

761
00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:46.820
Yeah, and I mean even in terms of social

762
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.060
security, another thing yet again that they never talk

763
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.580
about is that it's not an inevitability that Social

764
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.879
Security will collapse because er productivity can go up.

765
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:06.070
And then fewer people can sustain a growing aging,

766
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.250
uh, uh, aging population.

767
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.949
So, and I think a lot, there's a lot

768
00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:13.550
of discussion too of looking at Social Security, what

769
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.060
its original intent was, what is it doing today?

770
00:42:17.149 --> 00:42:19.899
How could it be amended beginning with, you know,

771
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.510
people that are younger that start paying into it.

772
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.500
How do we restructure it so that in the

773
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.659
end, it takes better care of all of us.

774
00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:30.560
It, it, it needs to, it needs to grow

775
00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:34.379
itself, uh, because it's been around now for a

776
00:42:34.379 --> 00:42:37.260
long time and it's still operating under the same

777
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.540
premises that it was in the beginning and we're

778
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.209
in a different world now. So, uh, I think,

779
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.899
I hope to see some amendments and things that

780
00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:46.820
change for the, for the better over time.

781
00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:50.989
Yeah, I mean, because we have uh examples all

782
00:42:50.989 --> 00:42:53.979
over the world from last century. The exa the

783
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:57.600
the US is a very good one where uh

784
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.879
Franklin Roosevelt basically created Social Security and the system

785
00:43:02.879 --> 00:43:06.260
didn't collapse. I mean there were a bunch of

786
00:43:06.439 --> 00:43:11.320
uh suddenly new people getting Social Security benefits and

787
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.340
the. The System didn't collapse and then after World

788
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.739
War II and I mean the decades after that

789
00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:22.540
when people from the so-called silent generation retired, I

790
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.300
mean uh because uh productivity again kept kept going

791
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.899
up, there were a ton of new people getting

792
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:34.760
Social Security benefits and the system never collapsed.

793
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.310
Of course, of

794
00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.719
course, there's the caveat that you wet the baby

795
00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:40.199
boom. There's

796
00:43:40.199 --> 00:43:42.919
that caveat, but you did have more people, yeah,

797
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.560
and in the beginning, people did not live as

798
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.120
long. There's a reason why it's set at 65,

799
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:50.879
and now people live a lot longer. So there

800
00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:53.219
too, that's another argument for wait, let's look at

801
00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:55.479
the, the reality right now and structure it so

802
00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:57.790
it works better for everybody. Um, I think it's,

803
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.919
it's more than time.

804
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.449
Yeah, and then there's the other aspect they never

805
00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:06.129
talk about, and this is perhaps a way of

806
00:44:06.129 --> 00:44:10.330
calling the bluff of some of these pro-Natalists that

807
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.969
get that get involved in politics is that they

808
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:19.959
never ever mention the possibility of increasing the tax

809
00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:21.169
for rich people,

810
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.060
right?

811
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:22.770
They

812
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.290
never

813
00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.250
talk about that.

814
00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:28.209
And there's also people who are, who studied this,

815
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.429
who are arguing if only we Raise the age

816
00:44:32.429 --> 00:44:35.669
at which you can start taking Social Security, how

817
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:38.750
that would impact it very positively. I'm no expert

818
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.389
about that, but people are, oh my God, you

819
00:44:41.389 --> 00:44:44.909
know, but if we started it earlier, uh, and

820
00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:48.270
made that one change, it might also help the

821
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.030
future of the system, but all of this is

822
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.629
to say that we have to stop relying on

823
00:44:54.629 --> 00:44:57.669
the only theory is we have to create more

824
00:44:57.669 --> 00:45:01.739
humans to keep it going. But it's still dusty

825
00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:03.709
old for people to get off of it because

826
00:45:03.709 --> 00:45:06.189
that's, that's just the reality we've lived with for,

827
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.729
for a long generational time.

828
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.459
OK, so another thing that is sort of related

829
00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:17.159
to this idea that we need more babies is

830
00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:21.879
that er what about immigration? I mean, do these

831
00:45:21.879 --> 00:45:24.939
people have something against the immigrants?

832
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.899
Well, I would have to say there again, it's,

833
00:45:28.949 --> 00:45:32.590
it could be that some people might hold a

834
00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:38.669
pro-natalist belief that, that's nationalistic in nature, where we

835
00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:40.229
want to make a lot of babies, but we

836
00:45:40.229 --> 00:45:43.250
only want a certain kind. I,

837
00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:47.679
I, I've actually heard that argument, to be honest.

838
00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:51.719
I've heard that. I've heard the argument that, oh,

839
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.320
OK, I, I, uh, the argument I've heard from

840
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.399
a pro-natalist is that, oh, OK, certain kinds of

841
00:45:58.399 --> 00:46:03.879
immigrants are fine, but some other immigrants that, uh,

842
00:46:03.959 --> 00:46:07.080
I mean, conveniently tend to breed tend to have

843
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:13.389
a browner. Uh, uh, uh, SKIN, uh, those are

844
00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:15.459
not, yeah, those are not fine.

845
00:46:16.169 --> 00:46:18.629
So, well, even there, is it, is it really

846
00:46:18.629 --> 00:46:22.699
a pro-natalist or is it someone who has, uh,

847
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:27.590
racial biased views such that who do they think

848
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.629
is normal, right? So there's an intersection there, but

849
00:46:30.629 --> 00:46:33.989
because there could be people who hold some strong

850
00:46:33.989 --> 00:46:37.439
pro-natalist beliefs who Who are fine with immigrants coming

851
00:46:37.439 --> 00:46:40.479
into the country, right? And hey, have babies here,

852
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.340
you know, we need more workers and to do

853
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.120
X, Y, and Z. So it's not so clear

854
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.610
cut that, you know, it's, it's pro-natalist is an

855
00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.879
anti-immigrant. It's, it's again, it's very, it's more nuanced,

856
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.689
but If there is an anti-immigrant, um, stance, you

857
00:46:58.689 --> 00:47:02.889
know, there, hey, Roosevelt, he did it policy-wise years

858
00:47:02.889 --> 00:47:04.530
ago. What was it like? I forget, like in

859
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.760
the early 1900s, he, he was Afraid that they

860
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.719
were gonna, the whites were gonna be outnumbered, you

861
00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:13.070
know. So he, he was kind of a eugenicist,

862
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.199
and he didn't want immigrants here. Uh, SO it's

863
00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:18.899
not like it's a, a new way of thinking.

864
00:47:19.479 --> 00:47:23.780
However, Generations ago, you know, in the times of

865
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.100
the Romans or Augustus, I would, I would maybe

866
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.340
theorize it would have been less so because you

867
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.139
had civilizations, and they were all trying to fight

868
00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:35.489
to be the dominant situation. They weren't going like,

869
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.820
hey, you can't come over here. They were busy

870
00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.909
building their own civilization. But today, that there's a

871
00:47:41.909 --> 00:47:45.020
lot more factors involved, and, um, like I say,

872
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.540
there's a lot of people who hold pro-natalist views

873
00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.649
who they want the immigrants to be here. But

874
00:47:50.649 --> 00:47:52.969
then there are those who, you know, they want

875
00:47:52.969 --> 00:47:56.290
a lot of babies, the new tech, you know,

876
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.969
tech bro, prenatalists, they make it sound like this

877
00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:02.570
is like a new thing, like the prenatalists are

878
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.570
new, given this, wanting to have IVF screenings to

879
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.010
make the perfect white babies and, you know, all

880
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.370
that. The only difference is we have better technology

881
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.870
today. So to me, it comes around in Waves,

882
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:18.310
where this anti-immigrant thing coupled with pro-natalism. It's, uh,

883
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:21.610
yes, it's partly propaganda, but it's just something that

884
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.290
comes to, um, we got to put the spotlight

885
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:26.090
on it now and wait a year from now,

886
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.010
it'll be something else, Ricardo. So we'll be.

887
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.729
Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, the kind

888
00:48:32.729 --> 00:48:36.030
of argument I was making is not that there's

889
00:48:36.129 --> 00:48:39.860
necessarily a link between being pro-Natalist and being an

890
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.129
anti-immigrant. That link is not always there, but for

891
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:48.409
some people and for some very prominent people, it

892
00:48:48.409 --> 00:48:48.909
is

893
00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:52.629
right. And I would argue attaching to that, that

894
00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.949
what we're not saying is that there is a

895
00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:58.909
racial bias. There's racism involved there. And whether you

896
00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:01.439
want to say that's, you know, pro-natalist in nature,

897
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.270
they're two, it's, it's two separate things, but they

898
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.870
can coexist, unfortunately, yeah,

899
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:13.030
as well as some other eugenicist takes like for

900
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.949
example, I've heard some pro-Natalist people, very prominent ones,

901
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:25.510
even people who have pro-Natalist movements and institutions, associations

902
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.570
and Stuff like that, uh, talking openly about things

903
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:34.570
like IQ, having kids with higher IQ and selecting

904
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:38.850
against certain kinds of psychological traits or, uh, in

905
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.639
favor of certain kinds of psychological traits, uh, uh,

906
00:49:42.649 --> 00:49:46.169
and, and other kinds of diseases and things like

907
00:49:46.169 --> 00:49:46.370
that,

908
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.090
right? Yep, I see it too. Yeah, there's definitely

909
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.229
more talk about it because the technology is, uh,

910
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.090
it's more there to, uh. Maybe be used, but

911
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:58.169
that's also an ethical, um, discussion too of how

912
00:49:58.169 --> 00:50:00.449
much do you want to use it and to

913
00:50:00.449 --> 00:50:02.610
design babies, how, how, how much do we want

914
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.689
to get into that, uh, so there'll be different

915
00:50:05.689 --> 00:50:08.370
camps on that one too, for sure, pro-natalist and

916
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:08.850
not.

917
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:13.409
Yeah, so I have one last question slash topic

918
00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:15.409
I would like to ask you about. So do

919
00:50:15.409 --> 00:50:20.489
you think that, uh, pro-natalism represents or can represent

920
00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:23.729
a threat to women's reproductive rights?

921
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.649
I think so. I think we've seen it through

922
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:31.889
different generations. Uh, CERTAINLY. Beliefs that back to the

923
00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:34.489
belief that, you know, mother, uh, a woman's role

924
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:40.000
is, uh, as, as mother drives other, uh, beliefs

925
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.929
and policies from birth control access to making it

926
00:50:43.929 --> 00:50:48.929
harder to, uh, positions on abortion. That's, you study

927
00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:51.530
that over time and it's, it's a moving target.

928
00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.429
It was not illegal in times past, but now

929
00:50:54.429 --> 00:50:57.409
we're Back to where we're fighting about whether it's,

930
00:50:57.419 --> 00:50:59.459
uh, the baby, you know, it's, it's a human

931
00:50:59.459 --> 00:51:03.729
from the moment of conception. So, these, the, uh,

932
00:51:03.739 --> 00:51:07.620
these core beliefs that we're, a woman's here to

933
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.229
be a mother, these little tentacles come. Out to

934
00:51:11.229 --> 00:51:15.389
these other beliefs that then have policy ramifications depending

935
00:51:15.389 --> 00:51:17.889
on where you are and who's leading the government

936
00:51:17.889 --> 00:51:20.550
and what they believe. So I, I think the

937
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.350
answer is yes, and it's, it goes in cycles,

938
00:51:23.469 --> 00:51:25.149
but it's very much related.

939
00:51:25.929 --> 00:51:28.850
I mean, particularly when it comes to abortion and

940
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.370
even going beyond abortion because for example, now in

941
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:36.050
the US there are talks to uh limiting the

942
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:41.510
access to anti-conception medicine to women.

943
00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:42.669
It's like the,

944
00:51:43.689 --> 00:51:46.129
like the, like the pill and so on. I

945
00:51:46.129 --> 00:51:48.310
mean basic things

946
00:51:48.669 --> 00:51:50.929
and it's a lack of access to birth control.

947
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.090
That's, that's what's uh the main point of it

948
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.560
is they want to make it more difficult. To

949
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.709
get access to birth control, get access to, um,

950
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.510
a way to abort the child without any hospital,

951
00:52:03.669 --> 00:52:07.959
uh, being necessary. They, uh, wanted to make, make

952
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:10.199
it hard to even go anywhere to get an

953
00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:14.360
abortion. So, yes, I think what it points, points

954
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.919
directly back to what the leaders think about why

955
00:52:17.919 --> 00:52:20.010
women are here. I,

956
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.620
I, I, I, I, I mean, and when I

957
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:27.899
mean, and I mean, uh, the, the anti-abortion, I

958
00:52:27.899 --> 00:52:30.300
don't like to call them pro-life because I think

959
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:35.300
that's just propaganda. I call them the anti-abortion people,

960
00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:38.330
uh, I, I mean, there are so much silly

961
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:44.120
silly arguments that they make because they ignore, uh,

962
00:52:44.649 --> 00:52:47.222
sometimes they don't know. About it other times they

963
00:52:47.222 --> 00:52:53.143
just straight out lie about, for example, anti-abortion uh

964
00:52:53.143 --> 00:52:57.462
laws uh reducing the number of abortions. That's not

965
00:52:57.462 --> 00:53:01.663
true. The countries where with uh where abortion is

966
00:53:01.663 --> 00:53:04.843
legal actually see the number of abortions go down,

967
00:53:05.103 --> 00:53:09.143
so it's the opposite and then, and then they

968
00:53:09.143 --> 00:53:13.426
assume that just because. They ban abortion. Women, if

969
00:53:13.426 --> 00:53:16.426
they really want, are not going to take steps

970
00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:20.065
to do the abortion anyways, but in less, much

971
00:53:20.065 --> 00:53:23.746
less safe circumstances. They still, they still have the

972
00:53:23.746 --> 00:53:26.726
abortion. It's just that it's not in a safe

973
00:53:27.186 --> 00:53:30.625
environment in a hospital, in a clinic, or something

974
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:31.156
like that,

975
00:53:31.466 --> 00:53:35.545
right? That's right, yep, yep, that's very right on.

976
00:53:35.825 --> 00:53:36.746
I agree with you.

977
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.939
Yeah. Yeah,

978
00:53:40.889 --> 00:53:42.370
I, I, but the good, I think the good

979
00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:46.729
news there too is, uh, more of us now

980
00:53:46.729 --> 00:53:49.449
see through some of this propaganda, and yes, there

981
00:53:49.449 --> 00:53:53.070
are people who believe it and also hold religious

982
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.570
positions that help support believing some of these things

983
00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:00.199
you're talking about, but I do think that the

984
00:54:00.199 --> 00:54:04.469
younger generations, they see through some of this stuff,

985
00:54:04.479 --> 00:54:06.520
and they, they know what is true and what

986
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.000
isn't, so they're not as easily fooled by some

987
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.620
of these, this messaging that's just, you know, ridiculous.

988
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.870
Uh, I, I mean, let me just, uh, uh,

989
00:54:17.879 --> 00:54:20.159
let me just say, and this might sound a

990
00:54:20.159 --> 00:54:24.310
bit cynical, but I left a bit when in

991
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.280
early Jan in early 2025, I think it, it

992
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.665
was in January, uh, news came out in The

993
00:54:30.665 --> 00:54:36.784
Guardian that uh once abortion got banned across different

994
00:54:36.784 --> 00:54:40.304
states in the US, uh, the rate of young

995
00:54:40.304 --> 00:54:44.185
people, both men and women, wanting to have uh

996
00:54:44.185 --> 00:54:45.665
vasectomies, uh

997
00:54:45.665 --> 00:54:50.350
and. Yeah, yeah, and women, women went up that

998
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.870
they wanted to get their tubes tied or some

999
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:56.340
kind of birth, permanent birth control, so it was

1000
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.949
exactly the opposite effect that, that, that, that was

1001
00:54:58.949 --> 00:55:02.860
wanted. So. Yeah,

1002
00:55:03.189 --> 00:55:07.639
so, so you know, maybe you're so pro-natalist that

1003
00:55:07.639 --> 00:55:12.350
you're actually contributing to people being permanently child-free.

1004
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.699
Yeah, so that, you know, the beliefs really, they

1005
00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:21.489
do, that they're held by people in power, um,

1006
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.260
we see it, we've seen it in history, and

1007
00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.300
we see it now, that policy that can be

1008
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.899
made, um, to make it harder for women to

1009
00:55:29.899 --> 00:55:33.560
have control over their reproductive lives, you know, policies

1010
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:39.090
that instill incentivize having kids. You get tax breaks,

1011
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:42.139
the more kids you have. See, I would, if

1012
00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:43.620
it were me and I were in power, I'd

1013
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.580
do just the opposite. I would incentivize people to

1014
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.189
take like a parenting course before they ever get

1015
00:55:51.189 --> 00:55:55.070
pregnant so they, they can help them decide whether

1016
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.070
they're, they want to be in the first place

1017
00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.429
and if they do, how, what they need to

1018
00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:02.850
learn to be good parents and then, then and

1019
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.600
only then would they get the incentivized, you know,

1020
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.229
I mean, I, I mean this is one of

1021
00:56:08.229 --> 00:56:11.393
the reasons why I don't. Call them pro-life and

1022
00:56:11.393 --> 00:56:14.572
I say that's just propaganda because once the child

1023
00:56:14.572 --> 00:56:16.603
is out of the womb they don't care about

1024
00:56:16.603 --> 00:56:19.913
it at all. I mean where where are they

1025
00:56:19.913 --> 00:56:24.593
um being for maternity leave, paternity leave, and why

1026
00:56:24.593 --> 00:56:28.272
are people who are Republicans in the US, for

1027
00:56:28.272 --> 00:56:32.532
example, voting against free lunches in school for children

1028
00:56:32.532 --> 00:56:37.575
they don't. ABOUT children and, and where are they

1029
00:56:37.575 --> 00:56:43.176
proposing stronger laws against child labor in the US

1030
00:56:43.176 --> 00:56:46.355
because it's gone up in recent years. I mean,

1031
00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:47.176
they're not,

1032
00:56:47.756 --> 00:56:50.595
they're not doing that. And we have a society

1033
00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:53.166
where a woman who doesn't want the child can

1034
00:56:53.166 --> 00:56:55.555
just drop it off at a fire department house,

1035
00:56:55.635 --> 00:57:00.615
a firehouse. They, women can leave the hospital without

1036
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:04.989
the baby. And not get any repercussions, the mother

1037
00:57:04.989 --> 00:57:09.300
or the father. So we allow People to have

1038
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.209
kids, and then when the kid, the baby is

1039
00:57:11.209 --> 00:57:15.659
here, so often, we, we don't do right for

1040
00:57:15.659 --> 00:57:17.729
them. They end up in foster care, it's harder

1041
00:57:17.729 --> 00:57:20.860
to get adopted, the adoption system is very difficult,

1042
00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:24.860
so lots of negative impacts as a result of,

1043
00:57:24.939 --> 00:57:28.179
you know, these pro-natalist beliefs that we can, we

1044
00:57:28.179 --> 00:57:29.570
should be able to have as many kids as

1045
00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:32.219
we want when we want, um, that we pay

1046
00:57:32.219 --> 00:57:35.179
a lot of costs for that, so, and one

1047
00:57:35.179 --> 00:57:36.780
huge one is we have a lot of parents

1048
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.729
who aren't ready to be parents. The kids are

1049
00:57:39.729 --> 00:57:42.489
the ones that suffer. Yeah, that really gets me

1050
00:57:42.489 --> 00:57:43.169
going too.

1051
00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.850
And that's the thing, because as we talked about

1052
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:51.129
at the beginning, since most child-free people are not

1053
00:57:51.129 --> 00:57:55.330
trying to impose their beliefs on other people, contrary

1054
00:57:55.330 --> 00:58:00.570
to pro-Natalist people. I mean, child-free people are perfectly

1055
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:04.040
OK if someone wants to have 10. Children, I

1056
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.320
mean if you want to have 10 children, go

1057
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.790
ahead and have 10 kids, whatever, do whatever you

1058
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:14.219
want, right? And and child free people are probably

1059
00:58:14.439 --> 00:58:17.699
even more in favor of those kinds of policies

1060
00:58:17.699 --> 00:58:22.199
like maternity leave, paternity leave, uh, free lunches in

1061
00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:28.139
school, whatever, to really. Take care of uh children

1062
00:58:28.139 --> 00:58:31.149
who are actually born into this world.

1063
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.669
Yeah, despite the stereotype, people who don't raise children

1064
00:58:34.669 --> 00:58:37.510
of their own really do care about the kids

1065
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.790
who are already here and many from my interviews

1066
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.000
back to the late 90s, many are in occupations

1067
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.350
that help families, help kids, whether it be schools

1068
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.560
or A whole number of things. They have kids

1069
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.139
in their lives professionally, personally, we're aunties, we're, we're

1070
00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:57.840
godmothers, you know, we partake, we find our way

1071
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:01.709
to participate in, uh, the development of the next

1072
00:59:01.709 --> 00:59:03.860
generation. If, if we want, and, you know, honestly,

1073
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:06.899
from what I see thousands over, over 25 years,

1074
00:59:07.379 --> 00:59:09.459
most people who aren't raising kids on their own,

1075
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:12.820
they do participate in children's lives in some way,

1076
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:15.620
some form. We care about, you know, how they

1077
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.620
live in our society, so.

1078
00:59:18.239 --> 00:59:20.840
Yeah, so Laura, look, we've already done an hour

1079
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.120
and I think we've covered the most important aspects

1080
00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.399
of being child-free and years. So I mean there

1081
00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:30.719
were other things that we could probably talk about,

1082
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.760
but let's leave it there. And where can people

1083
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.300
find you and your work on the internet?

1084
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.000
Well, I have a website, LauraCarroll.com, and I'm on

1085
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.350
just about all the socials, um, on Facebook and

1086
00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:48.540
Instagram, uh, I post mostly on Blue Sky these

1087
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.280
days. I, I'm, I'm not as active on X

1088
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.780
anymore for reasons we can all, we all maybe

1089
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.620
know about, but, uh, on

1090
00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.000
all reasons probably also tied to a certain specific

1091
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.899
person, also a

1092
01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:06.689
person who is a pro-natalist. So, yeah, if you

1093
01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:08.330
go to my website, you can have links to

1094
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:10.850
all those socials as well as information about my

1095
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:14.290
books, and also on my site, um, there's a

1096
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.169
child-free writings library, I call it now, but it

1097
01:00:17.169 --> 01:00:20.520
really is a, it's all of my writings from

1098
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.129
when I had a pretty popular blog, La Vie

1099
01:00:23.129 --> 01:00:26.409
Child Free, that I started in 2009, and then

1100
01:00:26.409 --> 01:00:28.679
over the years, I, I just put everything on.

1101
01:00:28.969 --> 01:00:32.189
To LauraCarroll.com. So I, I continue to feed that

1102
01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:35.409
library, but you'll find, you know, you'll find writings

1103
01:00:35.409 --> 01:00:38.199
going back about topics we talked about today. Certainly,

1104
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.879
I have a whole set of them. I'm like,

1105
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:42.850
OK, let's talk about the happiness studies and what's

1106
01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:45.320
wrong with them, you know. So you'll see some

1107
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.169
historical conversations that have been out there about the

1108
01:00:48.169 --> 01:00:51.159
child-free people and uh any, a lot of things

1109
01:00:51.159 --> 01:00:53.429
that are related to that, and pro-natalism as well.

1110
01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:56.719
