00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.279
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.590
Dissenter. I'm, I'm your host Ricardo Lops, and today

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.630
I'm joined by Dr. Valerie Tiberius. She is a

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
professor in the department of philosophy at the University

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.040
of Minnesota. She works on the on well-being and

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.440
virtue from a philosophical and psychological perspective, and we're

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.940
going to focus mostly on her book What Do

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.879
You Want Out of Life, a philosophical Guide to

9
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.919
Figuring Out What Matters. So Doctor Tiberius, welcome to

10
00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:35.599
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.159
Thanks, thanks for having me.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.959
So tell us first, what is well-being and how

13
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:48.479
do you approach it from a philosophical and also

14
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.540
a psychological perspective?

15
00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.619
So, Philosophers have a lot of different theories about

16
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.639
what well-being is. Psychologists also have a lot of

17
00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:05.610
different theories. Those theories tend to group into three

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.250
big types. One is hedonistic theories. That's where well-being

19
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.120
is just having more pleasure than pain. Then second,

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.400
there's a kind of objective theories where well-being is

21
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.379
getting some things that are objectively good independent of

22
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.959
you. And then the third group is the view

23
00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.599
that well-being is what your well-being is, is determined

24
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.839
by your own psychological states like your goals or

25
00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.220
your desires or your preferences, and that's my group.

26
00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:40.080
Um, SO I defend a theory that's called the

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.250
value fulfillment theory. And it takes well-being to be

28
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:51.629
the fulfillment of your values over time. Uh, SO

29
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:56.089
it, there's pleasure is valuable, of course, on my

30
00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:00.430
view, because people value pleasure and they value in

31
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.910
having enjoyable experiences, but there aren't any objective goods

32
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.429
that you have to get. What is good for

33
00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.479
you depends on The things that you care about

34
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.970
and could will care about over time. Yeah,

35
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:22.110
and what is intrinsically good for people and is

36
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.529
what is intrinsically good for people something they want

37
00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.509
or care about, or is it something different from

38
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.789
that?

39
00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.490
So, I think what's intrinsically good for people is

40
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.710
to get the things that they care about or

41
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.529
as I would put it, the things that they

42
00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.399
value. OK. Now, some people would say, as long

43
00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.479
as you want it right now, then it's good

44
00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.119
for you. My picture is a little more complicated

45
00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.740
because I think if you say that what's intrinsically

46
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.839
good for you is what you want for its

47
00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.929
own sake right in this moment. You end up

48
00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.250
with some, um, some problems because sometimes the thing

49
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.229
that you want for its own sake right now

50
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.770
is something that's going to cause you a lot

51
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.410
of problems in the future. Uh, SO, I think

52
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.050
the thing that's good for you is the thing

53
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.889
that you value intrinsically. With a few conditions placed

54
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.289
on that. It has to be something that you

55
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:28.490
value in a holistic way. You, all of your

56
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.139
psychology is oriented towards that thing that you value.

57
00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:40.220
Right, but I mean, does what is intrinsically good

58
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.500
for people include aversion towards certain things in life,

59
00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.009
because there are, for example, what I think we

60
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.539
could call robust beds like pain, nausea, etc.

61
00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.229
Yeah, that's a great question. So these kinds of

62
00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.449
robust bad, these, these examples of things that seem

63
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.600
obviously intrinsically bad for people. Independently of what they

64
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.320
happen to care about. So you can imagine a

65
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.928
person who is a masochistic, who, you know, Thinks

66
00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:20.209
they want to feel pain, but perhaps we still

67
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.809
want to be able to say that the pain

68
00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.170
is bad for them, or you can imagine a

69
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.769
person who is um so depressed that uh uh

70
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.049
that they don't care if they're in pain or

71
00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:34.769
they feel like they deserve it. We still want

72
00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:36.959
to say the pain is bad for them. So,

73
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.359
those are the kinds of cases that cause the

74
00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:42.570
most difficulty for me, for my, for a theory

75
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.149
like mine. Because it, a, a theory like mine,

76
00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.769
which I think it they, it, it has a

77
00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:55.329
lot of advantages, but there's a big disadvantage of

78
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:58.690
not having those objective good and bads that you

79
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.890
can point to and say, this is always bad

80
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.559
for you, no matter what you care about. Um,

81
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.420
SO the way I try to accommodate that, that,

82
00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:11.940
that kind of intuition that you're pointing to, the

83
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.130
intuition that pain is just bad, no matter what,

84
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:23.239
um, is by talking about how Much Pain is

85
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.339
involved in the pursuit of what we value. So,

86
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.279
pain is a, it's a kind of signal that

87
00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.480
something is going wrong, uh, on, on the, the

88
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.049
kind of uh psychological picture that I like, uh,

89
00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:42.920
uh, pain is a kind of perception that you're

90
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.359
failing in getting the things that you care about.

91
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.190
Um, IT might be something so simple as you're

92
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.589
failing to protect your physical body, because you have

93
00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.519
an injury and that causes pain. So, I think

94
00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:02.100
there's a, it, it's a, a bit of a

95
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.660
convoluted explanation about the badness of pain, but I

96
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.019
still think on this value fulfillment theory or any

97
00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:12.140
kind of theory that starts with our desires and

98
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.250
goals, you can make sense of why pain is

99
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.760
almost always bad for people intrinsically. It's just, it's

100
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.359
not as simple and and elegant a story. As

101
00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:28.679
the hedonists who just get to say, look, pain

102
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:31.100
is just objectively bad.

103
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.589
So you touched a little bit on depressed people

104
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.959
there. So what if people have no goals or

105
00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:43.910
desires at all, like when they are depressed, how

106
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.450
do you approach those kinds of people?

107
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.220
Yeah, so one thing about actual depressed people as

108
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.359
opposed to philosophical made up people, um, is even

109
00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:02.399
if they have very few goals, positive goals, they

110
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:07.279
typically have aversions. They're averse to the painful state

111
00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.480
that they're in and would rather be happier. They

112
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.399
would rather not be depressed, um, so. Value fulfillment

113
00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.750
theory says that what's good for you is fulfilling

114
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.890
your values. Desires are an a a part, a

115
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.739
component of values, and aversions are a component of

116
00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:36.339
what we might call disvalues. So, the theory would

117
00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:41.209
say if fulfilling your values is good. Satisfying your

118
00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:48.209
desires is. Part of that Avoiding what you disvalue

119
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.779
is good or. I suppose the other way of

120
00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:56.579
putting it is, um, not getting what you're averse

121
00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:01.510
to is good. Um, AND so, one thing we

122
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.220
can say about depressed people is that if they

123
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.119
are averse to their depression, which mostly they are,

124
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.420
um, it's good for them not to be depressed.

125
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.339
There are some cases and uh there's a nice

126
00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:26.040
paper about this by um Anne Tully. Where you

127
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.079
might think the depressed person is in what he

128
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:35.760
calls complete cognitive collapse. So there's absolutely nothing there,

129
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:40.239
no aversion, no desire. I came to think talking

130
00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:43.619
to psychologists that that kind of case is actually

131
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.520
extremely implausible because even if the person in that

132
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.630
state doesn't have goals that are In their conscious

133
00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:00.630
mind, they do have kind of preprogrammed biological goals

134
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:06.419
and aversions that are subconscious, so they're Uh, and

135
00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:09.330
if that's all they have, then that's what we

136
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.650
should pay attention to.

137
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:17.520
But how do we know that they have subconscious

138
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.400
desires or goals?

139
00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:24.859
Yeah, that's, that's a great question. I mean, What

140
00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:31.099
Psychologist, uh, my, one of my uh uh collaborators

141
00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:33.539
is a psychologist who I talk to about these

142
00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.739
topics a lot, and, and his basic answer is

143
00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:40.580
it's, it's inference to the best, best explanation, um,

144
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.799
that you, you can't actually do an experiment to

145
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.859
put people in a state of complete cognitive collapse

146
00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:52.900
and and, and manipulate the variable. To find out

147
00:09:52.900 --> 00:10:00.210
what happens, but typically when people's depression alleviates their

148
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.500
goals come back and so that's some evidence that

149
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.299
the goals were there, um, you know, we, we

150
00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:14.799
sometimes. LACK conscious awareness of our goals because we're

151
00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.719
distracted, or we're asleep, or you're in a coma

152
00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:20.400
for a month because you got hit by a

153
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.960
car, um, and after that period where the goals

154
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.799
are not in your, the focus of your conscious

155
00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:32.280
attention, they do come back. So that's, I think

156
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.359
that's the best sort of evidence we have that

157
00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:37.289
these goals are actually there in the brain. I

158
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:43.309
mean, one thing about our consciousness is. It's, if

159
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:47.070
you think of it as a flashlight, um, which

160
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.710
I'm sure is not the right way to think

161
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.590
about it from the point of view of consciousness

162
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.349
studies, but if you think of it as, you

163
00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:57.539
know, we have All these different things going on

164
00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:00.700
in our brain and the part that we are

165
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.750
actually consciousness of is like a light shining on

166
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.070
something that's in our focus. That light is tiny

167
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.390
compared to all the stuff that's happening in our

168
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.460
brains. So I don't, for that reason too, I

169
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.070
think it shouldn't be surprising to think a lot

170
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.830
of these goals and aversions that we have are,

171
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.750
they're in there, even if we're not thinking about

172
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.869
them right now. And so for the person, for

173
00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:30.309
this seriously depressed person who seems to be in

174
00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:34.559
complete cognitive collapse. Ultimately, I wanna say it, the

175
00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.799
collapse isn't complete. They're, they don't have, it's not

176
00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.799
actually the case that they have nothing whatsoever like

177
00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:45.599
a rock. They're not the person is not a

178
00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:45.900
rock.

179
00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:52.890
Right, but since many times our values and goals

180
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.950
are in conflict with one another, how do we

181
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.210
weigh them and decide which ones we should prioritize?

182
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.640
That's one of the questions I'm most interested in

183
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.450
in that, especially in the book that you mentioned,

184
00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:15.659
because, so. I think the values that we should

185
00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:18.179
pay attention to when we're thinking about how to

186
00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:21.619
improve our lives and how to live, they're pretty

187
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:27.020
big, you know, things like enjoyment and friendship, um,

188
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.780
meaningful work, uh, skill development, achievement, for, you know,

189
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:39.609
for some people, spiritual connection. So these things are

190
00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:45.119
very broad. There's There are tons of ways of.

191
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.960
Fulfilling the value of friendship, the value of spiritual

192
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.130
connection. You could, I'm not a very spiritual person

193
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.460
myself, but you could go to the Catholic Church,

194
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.700
you could go to a Buddhist temple, you could

195
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.419
do your own thing. You could go to California

196
00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:04.099
and practice yoga. I mean, there's so many different

197
00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:08.000
things you can do to fulfill that value. So

198
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.580
that's one thing. And then the other thing is,

199
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.159
all of these things, if you want to fulfill

200
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:16.919
them, they take time and attention. And so just

201
00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:19.760
as you say, there's going to be a conflict

202
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.900
because we are sadly limited creatures and we can't

203
00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:29.159
do everything all the time. Um, SO I think

204
00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:35.049
resolving those conflicts is a matter of Trying to

205
00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:41.150
refine or interpret that big, huge general value that

206
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.640
could be pursued in multiple different ways. Try to

207
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.359
try to bring it down to earth, to translate

208
00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:53.500
it into specific projects and goals in a way

209
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.919
that makes it compatible with the other things that

210
00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:01.750
you care the most about. And that's just sort

211
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.950
of the messy process of living a life, and

212
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:11.640
I think there there aren't that many. Rules, um.

213
00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.789
It's not, it's, it's, you know, I, I inclined

214
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:21.729
towards. Thinking that It along the lines of a

215
00:14:21.729 --> 00:14:25.969
kind of particularism where it's the, the details and

216
00:14:25.969 --> 00:14:30.010
the context matter so much in these decisions about

217
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.229
how to try to make our values fit together.

218
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:36.710
Yeah. That we can't give the kind of general

219
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.229
principles. Like if I told you, always put friendship

220
00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:44.070
first, you know, even if you're up for tenure

221
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.130
and what you really need to do is publish

222
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.150
or you're going to lose your job. It doesn't

223
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.830
make sense, but putting friendship first could make it

224
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.830
make sense later in your life. So, these decisions

225
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.909
are extremely context sensitive, and they also are not

226
00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:03.739
always the same for a person over time. Sorry,

227
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.940
that's a very complex answer, but I think it's,

228
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.239
it's just the complexity of life.

229
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:12.900
Yeah, right, so, but when it comes to the

230
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.859
goals that are worth pursuing in life, should they

231
00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:19.520
be decided at an individual level?

232
00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:26.809
Yes, that's a great question too. I think this

233
00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:29.890
is what a lot of people don't like about

234
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.799
a theory like mine. Because I do think what's

235
00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:39.190
intrinsically good for a person or what constitutes a

236
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:46.530
person's well-being. Is ultimately determined by the individual. So

237
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.609
the, the kind of. Black and white answer to

238
00:15:50.609 --> 00:15:54.179
your question is, it's the, it's the individual who

239
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:58.859
decides. It's the individual who's the, the ultimate determinant

240
00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:02.020
or the authority about what's good for him or

241
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:08.349
her. But it's also true that we are profoundly

242
00:16:08.349 --> 00:16:11.510
social creatures, and so many of the things we

243
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.309
care about involve other people. Um, SO two of

244
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:19.549
the things that people value tremendously, if you ask

245
00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:26.250
them, friends and family. Well, If you're going to

246
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:30.770
fulfill those values, you can't do it by ignoring

247
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.590
what other people think about you and how and

248
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.349
how good a job you're doing. Um, SO, you

249
00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:40.469
know, for instance, you're just, if, if one of

250
00:16:40.469 --> 00:16:46.099
your values is to have um Significant friendships and

251
00:16:46.099 --> 00:16:50.169
to be a good friend. You just don't succeed

252
00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:53.030
in that if your friends think you're a jerk.

253
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.659
Um, YOU, you have failed, and, and so you,

254
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.090
in, in figuring out how to fulfill the value

255
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.809
of friendship, you need to actually be responsive to

256
00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:06.948
the other people in your life. So that doesn't

257
00:17:06.948 --> 00:17:11.558
mean that other people determine what's good for you,

258
00:17:11.688 --> 00:17:15.759
but they're in the sense that if you're a

259
00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:19.368
person who actually just is a loner, and you

260
00:17:19.368 --> 00:17:22.648
just don't want many friendships, I don't think the

261
00:17:22.648 --> 00:17:26.848
fact that other people care about friendship impinges on

262
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:29.448
you and says, oh, you have to value friendship

263
00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:32.609
because that's what other people value. That goes against

264
00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:36.729
my theory. But I do think when you're figuring

265
00:17:36.729 --> 00:17:39.739
out how to live your life because other people

266
00:17:39.739 --> 00:17:47.349
are so important to, you know, To our capacity

267
00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:49.500
to to get the things that matter to us,

268
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.709
we do have to pay attention to what other

269
00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:52.430
people think.

270
00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:58.290
But I mean when it comes to deciding among

271
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.550
them many possibilities open to us, should we consult

272
00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:07.729
other people or should we make the decision by

273
00:18:07.729 --> 00:18:08.329
ourselves?

274
00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:12.459
So I think it often makes sense to consult

275
00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:15.780
other people, you know, we're moving away from the

276
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.050
kind of philosophical question about what's the, what's the

277
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.619
foundation of the value because there I think it

278
00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:25.040
is the individual. But if we're talking about being

279
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.260
the practical question, and we're like, how do you

280
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.739
do this? How do you figure out, how do

281
00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:32.020
you manage these conflicts? How do you figure out

282
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.359
what goals to pursue? I think talking to other

283
00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:39.760
people is extremely valuable, partly because I think we

284
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.719
are crappy at introspection. So, We, especially philosophers, tend

285
00:18:47.719 --> 00:18:50.489
to think if you want to know about yourself,

286
00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:55.119
you just sit there. And think, well, what's most

287
00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:57.319
important to me? What do I like? What do

288
00:18:57.319 --> 00:19:00.619
I care about? But I think we're actually not

289
00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:04.060
very good at this, in part because of this

290
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.500
matter of conscious attention. There's so much going on

291
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.010
that we're not consciously. Focused on. And I think

292
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.369
often people, especially people who know us, can kind

293
00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:20.650
of look at our behavior, you know, like as

294
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.250
if they were doing a scientific study of us,

295
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.050
like rats in a maze. They can sort of

296
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:33.079
watch us and think. She, she really feels happy

297
00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.520
every time she comes back from her dance class,

298
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.469
you know, I've, I've, and a friend can, this

299
00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.479
has happened to me, a friend can, can tell

300
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:44.319
you, you know what, you've been so anxious about

301
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:47.000
work lately, and the 11 I, one thing I

302
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.599
noticed about you is every time you do anything

303
00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:53.359
like dancing or music or something like that, you

304
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:57.260
just come home all bubbly and happy. And that

305
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.180
can make you think, oh, maybe I should do

306
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.380
more of that. Maybe I should prioritize that in

307
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.699
my life a little bit more than I have

308
00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:10.229
done. But sometimes we can't see that ourselves because

309
00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:12.589
we're so wrapped up in the work stuff that

310
00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:16.949
we're anxious about that we don't, uh, we just,

311
00:20:17.109 --> 00:20:20.699
we can't shift our attention to the thing that's

312
00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:24.189
actually bringing us some relief and some joy. I

313
00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.469
don't know if you've had experiences like that. If

314
00:20:26.469 --> 00:20:32.609
there's a there's interesting questions about female friendships versus

315
00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:35.089
male friendships, and I don't, you know, I've talked

316
00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:37.979
to my husband about whether he has these kinds

317
00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:41.689
of experiences with his male friends, and he does,

318
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.449
but I think it's more common with women friends

319
00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:48.010
that we're watching each other and, and, you know,

320
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.729
and saying like, I've noticed this about you. I

321
00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:52.910
think you ought to, um.

322
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but if people make the

323
00:20:57.959 --> 00:21:00.670
decision by themselves, if they decide to do that,

324
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.819
do you think that they should follow their gut

325
00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:06.680
or be a little bit more reflective?

326
00:21:08.489 --> 00:21:13.530
I'm for balance between gut and reflection, um, so

327
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:19.640
I think. Depending on the kind of person you

328
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.260
are, I think a lot of people, especially academics

329
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.469
and people who would likely be listening to a

330
00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:34.329
podcast like yours, um, We tend to put too

331
00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:38.410
much emphasis on reflection, so we think we're so

332
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.939
smart that we can think through the best choice.

333
00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.150
And I think that sometimes results in ignoring the

334
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:53.550
evidence from your body. Uh, SO this example about,

335
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.630
you know, a friend telling me that every time

336
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.910
you go to a dance class, you, you, you're,

337
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.540
you're all happy for a few minutes. Uh, THAT'S,

338
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.589
that's something you don't have to have a friend

339
00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:07.689
tell you that. You could observe that about yourself

340
00:22:07.689 --> 00:22:12.569
if you notice, suddenly I feel lighter, and, and

341
00:22:12.569 --> 00:22:14.969
I'm, I'm all of a sudden bubbly, and it

342
00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:17.510
feels like a weight has lifted from my shoulder.

343
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.380
Um, THAT'S That's what I think it means to

344
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.739
say you're uh listening to your gut, you know,

345
00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:27.979
you're, it's not literally your gut, it's being in

346
00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:31.420
tune with your, the emotional side of yourself and

347
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.819
your physical responses to um what's happening in your

348
00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:40.010
life. So, I think We should listen to our

349
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.660
gut more, especially if we're the kind of person

350
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:48.589
who is overly reflective. But I don't think just

351
00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:54.930
the gut, because sometimes your gut. Sometimes your emotions

352
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.489
lead you in stupid directions. I mean, I think

353
00:22:58.489 --> 00:23:00.469
for some people, if you just went with your

354
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.939
Strongest emotion and, you know, you're very in touch

355
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:08.979
with your physical experience, but you never think about

356
00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:12.099
the future. Um, YOU could end up doing some

357
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.699
things that have negative consequences in, in a few

358
00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:18.459
years. So we do have to be somewhat reflective

359
00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:26.780
to think about. Tradeoffs and how much um. Sacrificing

360
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.420
some current joy might have future benefits and those

361
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.780
kinds of long term goals are often quite important

362
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.280
to us and I think it's, it's hard to,

363
00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:43.839
uh, pursue long term commitments without some reflection. Mhm.

364
00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:48.869
But I mean, what is since you're, you're talking

365
00:23:48.869 --> 00:23:53.910
about long term commitments when it comes to our

366
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.589
values, I mean, should they be more short term

367
00:23:57.589 --> 00:24:00.750
or long term oriented, or is that for each

368
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.030
person to decide?

369
00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:06.439
Yeah, I think that so when I talked about

370
00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:10.680
these, these kind of very general broad values like

371
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.680
friendship, family, spiritual connection, work, meaningful work, I don't

372
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.119
actually think those values change much at that general

373
00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:23.239
level of description. So they're very long term. I

374
00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:27.839
think most people who value friendship value friendship for

375
00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:33.469
their entire lives. Um But what, so what changes

376
00:24:33.469 --> 00:24:39.719
is the specific goals that fulfill that value. And

377
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:47.959
there I think you're. There is individual variation. I

378
00:24:47.959 --> 00:24:52.199
think some people are, are more content with greater

379
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:59.739
change, um, where, you know, They I mean, maybe

380
00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:04.140
have multiple spouses, one after the other, or different

381
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.020
friends, and they have a friendship and it wanes,

382
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.140
and then they have other friendships. And then for

383
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.859
some people, having one spouse for your entire life

384
00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:16.900
is the most important thing to their happiness. So,

385
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.219
I do think when it comes to the specific

386
00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:24.219
goals that rep that that um follow or that

387
00:25:24.219 --> 00:25:31.900
help you pursue the value. How much stability you

388
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.839
should have is. To a large extent up to

389
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:37.660
the person.

390
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.239
Right, so I wanted to ask you about a

391
00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:46.439
concept I read about in your book. What is

392
00:25:46.449 --> 00:25:50.880
reflective wisdom and how does it apply in the

393
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.920
context of what we are talking about here?

394
00:25:55.479 --> 00:25:59.520
So I, I was, I sort of coined that

395
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.119
reflective wisdom phrase because I wanted to talk about

396
00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:07.469
the kind of wisdom people have. Who are good

397
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.339
at making choices for themselves. So, people who are

398
00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:14.770
good at living their own lives well. And I

399
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.459
wanted to distinguish it from how we typically think

400
00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:22.630
of wisdom as a a moral virtue, where wisdom

401
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.170
is the virtue that helps you sort out all

402
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:32.680
the different moral considerations. Um, SO, We've actually already

403
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.079
talked about quite a few of the features of

404
00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:40.160
reflective wisdom. I think for a person who has

405
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:47.079
reflective wisdom has some self-awareness, so they're, uh, they

406
00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:50.119
have some just self-knowledge about the kinds of things

407
00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:53.979
that they like and how they respond to, to

408
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.869
the the world. Um, BUT also some awareness of

409
00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:01.500
their emotional states and their physical responses to the

410
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.530
world. And then importantly, I think a person with

411
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:12.069
reflective wisdom has a kind of flexibility. That allows

412
00:27:12.069 --> 00:27:15.030
them to sometimes be reflective and sometimes listen to

413
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.630
their gut. Um, SO, I, I wanted to get

414
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.189
away from a picture of wisdom where it's very

415
00:27:22.189 --> 00:27:25.670
cognitive and it's just intellectual, and the wise person

416
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.630
is just a really good thinker, uh, because I

417
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.229
think wisdom, the kind of wisdom that helps you

418
00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:38.219
live your life, is, uh, Knowing when to think

419
00:27:38.219 --> 00:27:41.660
more, but also knowing when to stop thinking and

420
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:47.979
just experience things. So that's The way it fits,

421
00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:50.300
yeah, I guess that's the explanation for how it

422
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.979
fits with what we're currently talking about is I

423
00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:57.540
think reflective wisdom would be the virtue that enables

424
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.459
people to figure out how to fulfill their values

425
00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:03.520
and how to put their values together over time.

426
00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:10.859
Right, OK, so we've been talking about values, goals,

427
00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:15.300
desires that people have, and how they can approach

428
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.219
them, how they decide among them which ones to

429
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:22.099
prioritize, and so on, but

430
00:28:22.099 --> 00:28:22.300
what

431
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.459
is a good

432
00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:29.959
life? So, I don't have, um, I haven't written

433
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:33.719
about a good life. I think, I mean, so

434
00:28:33.719 --> 00:28:36.199
I don't have a, a view to defend, but

435
00:28:36.199 --> 00:28:39.119
I'm inclined to think when we talk about a

436
00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:41.479
good life, we don't just meet in a life

437
00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:46.150
that's going well for you. We mean a life

438
00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:51.750
that's also morally upright, morally respectable. So I'm inclined

439
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.839
to think a good life is A life that

440
00:28:55.839 --> 00:29:00.079
has well-being, so it has things that are intrinsically

441
00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:03.979
good for the person, but it also lives up

442
00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:07.680
to a moral standard. And I don't know what

443
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.640
that moral standard is. You'd have to, you have

444
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.760
to have a moral theory to determine the standard.

445
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.300
But, but I would say, you know, at least,

446
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:23.959
You, you have to be uh. Uh, NOT, not

447
00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:26.239
the, not the kind of person who violates a

448
00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:29.839
bunch of moral rules and laws and to have

449
00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:36.400
a modicum of virtues like kindness and fairness. Um,

450
00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:40.500
YEAH, so one thing I've, I've wondered is if

451
00:29:41.709 --> 00:29:44.510
To me, it seems like the good life. That's

452
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.949
the biggest category. It includes everything. And I've just

453
00:29:48.949 --> 00:29:55.199
said it certainly includes well-being and moral virtue, but

454
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:59.540
maybe it also includes some kind of aesthetic appreciation.

455
00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:03.910
So my, my friend, uh, the happiness philosopher Dan

456
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.069
Hayron, he thinks a good life has to include

457
00:30:07.069 --> 00:30:12.829
some capacity to appreciate the beauty of nature, um.

458
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.920
And maybe the beauty of art. That's, I don't

459
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.560
know, I'm not sure what to think about that,

460
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.800
but I'm open to thinking that a good life

461
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.979
also includes some, uh, aesthetic awareness, you know, like

462
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.739
a person who would burn the Mona Mona Lisa,

463
00:30:33.989 --> 00:30:37.959
is that person, they have a good life. Feels

464
00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:40.760
like they're missing something, that's not, they're not the

465
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.079
best, they're not doing the best in life. But

466
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:48.800
I, I'm, I'm, that's something I'm not. I, I

467
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.160
don't know. I don't have a horse in the

468
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.619
race.

469
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.520
But if the good life includes being moral, what

470
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.280
is it to be moral? I mean, how do

471
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.680
we determine that? Of course, I think you mentioned

472
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.819
at a certain point there that it depends on

473
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:09.640
the moral or ethical theory we adopt, but just

474
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.760
in more general terms, what is it to be

475
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.319
moral?

476
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.089
Well, that's kind of a million dollar question. I

477
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:21.760
and I don't, I don't, I don't. I don't

478
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.530
defend and I haven't written about that question. I'm

479
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.750
inclined towards a kind of contractualist approach and thinking

480
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:37.910
that um the. Morals. Rules that we should follow

481
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:46.219
are the rules that People, reasonable people thinking. In

482
00:31:46.219 --> 00:31:50.880
terms of what. Set of principles that makes sense

483
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.359
to live by in a community with other reasonable

484
00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:56.479
people, whatever that set of rules is, that's what

485
00:31:56.479 --> 00:32:02.400
determines the moral, but Um So I'm not, I'm

486
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.599
not really inclined towards the utilitarian perspective for various

487
00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:13.510
reasons, um, but. You know, people obviously disagree here.

488
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.329
I don't, that's not something I've really spent much

489
00:32:16.329 --> 00:32:20.839
time, uh, I, I haven't published anything about morality

490
00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:22.790
per se. Mhm.

491
00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:27.530
So going back to the topic of well-being specifically,

492
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.449
does it tie to virtue in any way and

493
00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:34.109
what is virtue in this context?

494
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.270
So, I absolutely think it does. Um, YOU know,

495
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:47.130
Hume thought, Hume, David Hume defined virtue as the

496
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.349
traits of character that are useful or agreeable to

497
00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:55.130
the self or others. Very broad conception of virtue,

498
00:32:55.510 --> 00:33:00.750
which I like, um, and I think There are

499
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.630
plenty of virtues that are useful for us in

500
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:09.270
pursuing our own values. Um, SO we talked a

501
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:13.260
bit about the reflective wisdom, having a kind of,

502
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.699
uh, mental flexibility that allows you to be reflective

503
00:33:17.699 --> 00:33:21.199
sometimes and also to listen to your gut. If

504
00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:24.520
that's a virtue, I think it's obviously relevant to

505
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:30.910
well-being. Because people have so many values that are

506
00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.050
social, that involve other people, I think lots of

507
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:43.569
virtues like kindness, compassion, um, generosity, those sorts of

508
00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:48.530
virtues are good for pursuing the value of friendship,

509
00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:53.699
the value of relationships with family. Um, I would

510
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:59.260
bet, although this isn't my particular expertise, but they're

511
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.040
probably virtues that help people pursue their spiritual values

512
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.159
if they have religious or spiritual values, um, any

513
00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.120
kind of values that have to do with long

514
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.668
term projects. Like, um, values that have to do

515
00:34:16.668 --> 00:34:22.820
with work. Those will benefit from the virtues of

516
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:30.300
courage and perseverance, temperance, um, focus. So, so I

517
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.447
think, you know, it's gonna be uh If, if

518
00:34:35.447 --> 00:34:38.289
you have a picture of the virtues like David

519
00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:42.529
Hume had where there's tons of virtues because it's

520
00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:45.648
anything that's useful or agreeable to you or to

521
00:34:45.648 --> 00:34:50.688
other people, um, so it'll be a pretty complicated

522
00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:55.978
picture to, to. Define every single virtue that could

523
00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:58.659
possibly be related to well-being, but I think there's

524
00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:00.479
going to be tons of connections.

525
00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:04.860
Right, so I have one last topic I would

526
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.300
like to ask you about, and I have 2

527
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.000
or 3 questions about it. So we've been talking

528
00:35:11.379 --> 00:35:15.729
about well-being, but what about happiness? Should we aim

529
00:35:15.729 --> 00:35:16.899
at being happy?

530
00:35:18.629 --> 00:35:26.080
Um, So, One thing, one problem in this, the

531
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.179
philosophical well-being literature is that. These, these words get

532
00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:34.669
used in different ways by different people. And there

533
00:35:34.669 --> 00:35:37.199
are quite a few people who just use happiness

534
00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:42.770
to mean well-being, so there's no distinction. I'm thinking,

535
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.459
the way I think about happiness is it's a

536
00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:48.580
psychological feeling, and that's maybe how you're thinking about

537
00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:54.179
it. Um, SO, I really like, again, uh, my

538
00:35:54.179 --> 00:35:57.139
friend, uh, Dan Haburn has a theory of happiness

539
00:35:57.139 --> 00:36:04.600
as a kind of emotional state. Um, It's Enjoyment,

540
00:36:04.709 --> 00:36:09.489
um, engagement, attunement, and endorsement, uh, and a person

541
00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:13.850
who's stably disposed to regard their life in, in

542
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:18.689
this way, um, with these kinds of emotional states,

543
00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.090
that's what happiness is. I like this theory. It's,

544
00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:26.050
it's, I think it, um, it fits. It, it

545
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:30.889
really captures a lot of uh happiness in a

546
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:35.889
broad sense. So happiness isn't just excitement, but also

547
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:40.510
it includes kind of like stoic calm or tranquility.

548
00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:45.280
So why should we go for that? Um, WELL,

549
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.000
first. I just think most of us do. We

550
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.840
do, we just like being in pleasant states of

551
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.629
consciousness and If you think about how we evolved

552
00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:02.939
to pursue our goals. You could think of happy

553
00:37:02.939 --> 00:37:05.780
states of consciousness as a kind of reward for

554
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.090
getting what we want. Um, SO, I think we're

555
00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:16.780
almost hardwired to like our own happiness. Uh, GOOD

556
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.360
states feel good. I mean, it's, it's kind of

557
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.939
as simple as that. But it's also true. So

558
00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:27.139
this is one thing you find from the psychological

559
00:37:27.139 --> 00:37:30.899
research because they study happiness in the sense of

560
00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:36.340
these emotional states. The state of feeling satisfied with

561
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.379
your life or other kinds of positive affective states.

562
00:37:42.169 --> 00:37:47.030
And there's quite a bit of evidence that those

563
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:53.159
happy states of consciousness. Or at least there's great

564
00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:55.969
evidence that they're highly correlated with lots of other

565
00:37:55.969 --> 00:38:00.719
good things, like stable relationships, success in your job,

566
00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:05.629
health outcomes, and there's some evidence that there might

567
00:38:05.629 --> 00:38:09.370
be a causal relationship, so that if happier people

568
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.250
being happy actually causes you to do better at

569
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.850
these things. So, it's not just that if you

570
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.570
have friends, you'll be happy, but also if you're

571
00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:22.100
happy, uh, you'll have better friendships. So I think.

572
00:38:23.459 --> 00:38:27.020
We want to be happy just intrinsically because of

573
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.860
how we're wired, um, but there's also lots of

574
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.340
instrumental reasons to care about happiness because it's good

575
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.219
for us in so many other ways. Uh, IF

576
00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:42.969
you're, you know, a happier person, you will actually

577
00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:46.179
live a longer and healthier life with more good

578
00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:48.860
things in it. Uh, SO I think happiness is

579
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.889
really important. It sometimes has made me think, That

580
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:59.250
My, my value fulfillment theory should have a, a

581
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.530
special place for happiness, but I haven't taken that

582
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.570
step. It, it seems. I don't think it's, it,

583
00:39:06.649 --> 00:39:09.969
it seems to make the theory kind of awkward

584
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:13.530
and complicated in a way that's not necessary, given

585
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.030
that happiness just is important to our values.

586
00:39:18.409 --> 00:39:22.479
But I mean, if even if we value happiness,

587
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.310
should we have it as a goal? Should we

588
00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:30.649
seek happiness, or is it just, or should it

589
00:39:30.649 --> 00:39:35.729
also, should it just be a byproduct of aiming

590
00:39:35.729 --> 00:39:40.750
at other things like virtue, morality, and so on?

591
00:39:41.169 --> 00:39:43.590
Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, I think,

592
00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.590
so you might, you probably remember from uh The

593
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.110
history of philosophy, the paradox of hedonism, that if

594
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:55.250
you aim at pleasure, you won't get it. Um,

595
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.790
THAT in order to get pleasure, you have to

596
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.909
aim at something else and get the pleasure as

597
00:39:59.909 --> 00:40:03.270
a byproduct. So, I think there's something to that.

598
00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:11.389
I think aiming. Directly at positive states of consciousness

599
00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:15.820
is not the way to get them. You know,

600
00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:21.389
Back to dancing for a second. I do go

601
00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:24.770
to dance classes, and I'm not, I don't go

602
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.530
there to be happy, although I know it makes

603
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.409
me happy, but I go there to dance and

604
00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:34.649
to learn the steps and, you know, improve my

605
00:40:34.649 --> 00:40:38.669
dancing skills, uh, but then I get the happiness.

606
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:44.090
Um, AND I think that's probably psychologically the way

607
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:49.520
it's gonna work for most people. But if you're

608
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:56.030
depressed, and you're or you're very anxious about something,

609
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.800
and you're in a period of your life where

610
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.310
you've noticed or someone has told you that you're

611
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.800
really unhappy and you need to do something about

612
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.719
it, then I think it could make sense to

613
00:41:06.719 --> 00:41:09.540
have it as a goal. It's just that you

614
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.229
might It might be this kind of thing where

615
00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:16.229
you have to, you have to say. OK, this

616
00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:19.189
is my goal, cause I'm really unhappy right now

617
00:41:19.189 --> 00:41:22.669
and I need more happiness in my life. I

618
00:41:22.669 --> 00:41:25.060
know that if I just aim at it directly,

619
00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:29.030
I can't get it. So I'm going to force

620
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.189
myself to do some other things in the hope

621
00:41:31.189 --> 00:41:34.310
that it will produce happiness. So that's a way

622
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.070
in which it is your goal, but you have

623
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.510
to kind of mentally trick yourself into um some

624
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.969
indirection. I don't know what you would do if

625
00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:47.840
you just wanted to be happy. I mean, aside

626
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.949
from taking drugs or something, that happiness drugs.

627
00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:57.770
Yeah, so I have one last question then, does

628
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.810
happiness play a role in morality?

629
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:11.649
Yes, so Even though I said I'm not a

630
00:42:11.649 --> 00:42:16.290
utilitarian, but I still think it's really important to

631
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.129
help other people be happier, or other creatures. Uh,

632
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:26.219
SO, Even if you don't think that the entire

633
00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:30.860
point of morality is to increase the, the aggregate

634
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.449
happiness in the world. No one would deny that

635
00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:40.169
happiness, well, some philosophers would deny it, but, but

636
00:42:40.169 --> 00:42:43.949
most, most people think happiness is a good thing,

637
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.689
it's good if there's more of it, it's a,

638
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:52.379
it's a morally good thing to Help, uh, other

639
00:42:52.379 --> 00:42:58.489
people acquire it. Um, SO, you know, I don't

640
00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:02.370
eat meat, why not? That's because of the the

641
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:06.909
suffering and unhappiness of the animals who are in

642
00:43:06.909 --> 00:43:10.459
the meat industry. Uh, SO there's a way in

643
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:14.159
which happiness is the happiness of animals is obviously

644
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:24.290
morally relevant. I think Happiness figures into the description

645
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:28.469
of quite a few moral virtues. Uh, SO being

646
00:43:28.469 --> 00:43:33.550
compassionate to other people or being kind, it's hard

647
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.919
to be kind or compassionate without. Taking into account

648
00:43:37.919 --> 00:43:43.090
the happiness of the. Beneficiary of your compassion or

649
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:48.439
kindness. Um, BUT I think they're, when it, especially

650
00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:53.590
when it comes to people rather than farm animals,

651
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.689
it's important to think about well-being and not just

652
00:43:56.689 --> 00:44:00.770
happiness, because I think if you want to help

653
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.770
another person, helping them get what they care about,

654
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.649
it is. Actually a better way to help them

655
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:14.750
than to just help them feel happier.

656
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.979
Yeah, OK, so, uh, the book is again What

657
00:44:20.979 --> 00:44:24.179
Do You Want Out of Life, a philosophical guide

658
00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:27.310
to figuring out what Matters, and I'm leaving a

659
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.620
link to it in the description of the interview

660
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:35.439
and Doctor Tiberius, just apart from the book, would

661
00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:38.120
you like to tell people where they can find

662
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.800
your work on the internet?

663
00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:46.389
Uh, MY website, Valerie Tiberius.com has a, has, um,

664
00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:48.020
lists and links.

665
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.600
OK, great. I will add that to the description
