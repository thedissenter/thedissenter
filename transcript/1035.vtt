00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.750
Dissenter. I'm your host, Ricardo Lopes and today I'm

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.310
joined by Doctor LC M Johnson. She's a philosopher,

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.670
bioethicist, and neuroethicist and associate professor of bioethics and

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.479
humanities at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Her research focuses

6
00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:22.790
on ethical issues related to brain injuries including sport-related

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.959
neurotrauma, brain death, and disorders of consciousness, and today

8
00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:31.000
we're focusing on her book, Philosophical, Medical and Legal

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.360
controversies about brain death. So, Doctor Johnson, welcome to

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.880
the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.

11
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.340
Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

12
00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:43.759
So, I mean, I know that this is a

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.930
multifaceted question, but to get, to get into the

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.290
topic of brain death, perhaps it would be better

15
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.810
for us to start with what death is or

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.610
how we understand death, just common people how they

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.340
understand it and also philosophers, doctors, and people like

18
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.370
that. So, what is that? And, and how do

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.169
you approach such a question?

20
00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:12.400
This is a surprisingly complicated question given that death

21
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.930
is a universal part of existence. So at the

22
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.529
most basic we can say that an entity is

23
00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:25.389
dead when the biological processes that maintain life cease.

24
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.690
So for humans and other animals, that would be

25
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.339
respiration and circulation. Traditionally, we've always understood that when

26
00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:38.309
an animal, including humans, died was when it stopped

27
00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.580
breathing. But of course, to say that you're dead

28
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.569
when you're no longer alive is almost a tautology,

29
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.110
and there is tremendous variation in beliefs about death

30
00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:52.339
as a social and a spiritual and a cultural

31
00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:56.180
phenomenon. So death is, for example, in many belief

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.139
systems when the soul leaves the body. So we

33
00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.220
have, you know, this traditional understanding of death which

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.538
aligns with our Medical and biological understanding that when

35
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:12.809
you stop breathing and when your heart stops beating,

36
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.940
you die. This is, this is a pretty much,

37
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.520
uh, you know, universally accepted way of thinking about

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.729
death. It's been complicated by medicine and modern medicine,

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.259
which has the ability to Maintain artificially respiration and

40
00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:34.740
circulation using heart lung machines, using ventilators, and and

41
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.860
a lot of other wonderful medical technology that can

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.910
keep those biological processes going. Um, BEYOND what used

43
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.320
to be possible. And of course this is only

44
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.910
true if you are in a part of the

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.309
world that has access to advanced and very expensive

46
00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.669
medical technology. So for many people around the world,

47
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.550
the traditional understanding of death is still just the

48
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.589
only way that people die. For people in Europe,

49
00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.350
in the United States, and other places where we

50
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.669
have advanced technology, it gets more complicated because of

51
00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.789
our ability to maintain those biological processes sometimes when

52
00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.110
that person is no longer conscious and maybe perhaps

53
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.149
when they will never again regain consciousness.

54
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.169
And because I also mentioned with the ideas that

55
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.529
people just commonly have about death, uh, I would

56
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.570
imagine, and this is a point I guess that

57
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.660
we'll come back later on in our conversation. But

58
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.460
I guess that it's, it's also important to understand

59
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.059
how people commonly, and commonly, of course, I know

60
00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.300
that it would probably vary across culturally and between

61
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.300
across individuals, how people approach death, but it's also

62
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.369
important for us to have at least some idea

63
00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.210
of how people commonly approach it because it might

64
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.130
clash with the medical understanding of death,

65
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.389
right? Right. As I said, almost universally among human

66
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.300
cultures, there is this agreement that death happens when

67
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.250
you stop breathing and when your heart stops, um,

68
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.020
or, or when the soul has departed the body,

69
00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.108
and, and sometimes the the lack of breathing is

70
00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:20.339
an indication, right, that the soul, the animating force,

71
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.200
has left the body, and that's when it's appropriate

72
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.570
for us to To begin death behaviors, the traditions

73
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.690
and the rituals that we perform when someone has

74
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.579
died. It's also a legal turning point for people.

75
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.700
So when you have died, you cease to be

76
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.690
a person and a citizen. You cease to have

77
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.679
rights, but your heirs may have rights to your

78
00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:47.755
property. Um, YOU know, we might open your will

79
00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:49.945
at that point, and of course we will engage

80
00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:53.424
in death behaviors like preparing you for burial or

81
00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:55.584
for cremation and, and things like that. Those are

82
00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.024
things we don't do when you are still alive,

83
00:04:58.144 --> 00:05:00.825
right? So your status changes in a lot of

84
00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:04.695
ways when you have died, both medically and legally

85
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:09.820
and socially. The problem for many centuries has been

86
00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:15.130
how we actually diagnose or determine that someone has

87
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.839
died. Of obvious ways that, of course, people must

88
00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.549
have known about for many, many centuries are rigor

89
00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.970
mortis when the body becomes stiff and cold and

90
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.269
decomposition when the body begins to decay. Until we

91
00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:33.510
had things like stethoscopes where we could more easily

92
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.429
listen to someone and see if they're breathing or

93
00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:39.350
if their heart was beating, medically speaking, we had

94
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.190
the same techniques for determining that someone had has

95
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.200
died. Today it's even more complicated because of our

96
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.029
ability to resuscitate people when their heart has stopped

97
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.660
or when they have stopped breathing. And of course,

98
00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:57.850
even today there are still cases where people that

99
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.839
we think are dead. End up waking up in

100
00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.799
morgues. They're misdiagnosed as being dead, so it can

101
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:08.359
still be fairly complicated and difficult sometimes to determine

102
00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:09.720
whether or not someone is dead.

103
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.880
That's about deaf, generally speaking, but when it comes

104
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.609
to the top, to the specific topic of brain

105
00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:22.359
death, when did such a concept first develop and

106
00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:24.579
how has it evolved over time?

107
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.170
The concept of brain death emerged alongside developments in

108
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.239
critical care medicine, including the invention of respirators or

109
00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:39.570
ventilators that could support lung function and resuscitation and

110
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.619
cardiac bypass for the heart. So, uh, through the

111
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:47.709
1950s and 1960s, we see these technologies emerge. It

112
00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.410
did not take very long for doctors to begin

113
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.720
to question. The value of maintaining life in patients

114
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.839
who had severe brain injuries. Those patients could be

115
00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.000
kept alive with medical technology, but there wasn't much

116
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.260
else that we could do to treat their brain

117
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.760
injuries. So there was this possibility of having patients

118
00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:14.679
who were kept alive long term in an untreatable

119
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.989
and irreversible coma. Mhm. So the concept of brain

120
00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:22.480
death emerges here, the death of the brain, but

121
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.040
not the body. And as it happened at the

122
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.119
same time, scientists and doctors began to make progress

123
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.799
with organ transplantation, so the development of surgical techniques

124
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:40.209
and Innovations in immunology, um, our ability to understand

125
00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:43.209
and address the problem of organ rejection. So some

126
00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:47.880
of those physicians began looking to so-called brain dead

127
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.630
patients as possible organ donors. So in 1968, A

128
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.750
committee at Harvard University, which was led by Dr.

129
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.640
Henry Beecher, published a paper in the Journal of

130
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.200
the American Medical Association defining what they called irreversible

131
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.760
coma and describing the diagnosis, and by irreversible coma

132
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.420
they meant brain death. And they said an organ,

133
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.869
whether it's the brain or any other organ that

134
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:20.309
no longer functions and has no possibility of functioning

135
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:25.200
again, is for all practical purposes dead. So here's

136
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.239
our first sort of formal definition of brain death

137
00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:32.880
as a permanently non-functioning brain. They also said something

138
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.419
else that was interesting. They attempted to equate brain

139
00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:43.169
death with circulatory respiratory death or traditional death, um,

140
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.039
by stating that When you stop breathing, when your

141
00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:49.619
heart stops beating, your brain is going to die

142
00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:53.299
within a few minutes, and therefore, brain death really

143
00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.859
is the same thing as death as we have

144
00:08:55.859 --> 00:09:00.580
traditionally understood it. Um, AND It was always the

145
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.380
death of the brain is, is what they wanted

146
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.380
us to understand. Now, I think that was a

147
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.099
bit of a stretch because death, which we always

148
00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:11.580
understood as the ceasing of the heartbeat and the

149
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.659
breath, is really not the same as death in

150
00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:18.219
which the brain is non-functioning, but the body continues

151
00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:20.820
to function, where the body continues to breathe and

152
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.099
has a beating heart is still warm and sometimes

153
00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:27.140
can move, for example, right? It brain death doesn't

154
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.710
look like traditional death. There were a couple of

155
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.549
reasons why the Harvard Committee adopted this sort of

156
00:09:35.549 --> 00:09:38.909
newly invented way of being dead, and one was

157
00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:43.669
that at the time doctors could still be charged

158
00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:47.349
with medical homicide if they disconnected a patient from

159
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:50.789
life support. So we didn't really have a legal

160
00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:54.400
mechanism in place to allow them to do that.

161
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.880
As a consequence, there were patients with very severe

162
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.909
brain injuries who were being maintained on life support,

163
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.239
but for whom we could do very little except

164
00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:08.520
keep them alive. The second reason was organ transplants.

165
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:12.359
We didn't have a source of living organs. We

166
00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:16.710
had no way to acquire viable organs without killing

167
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.760
the donor. So being able to say that that

168
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.419
patient is brain dead and therefore dead. WOULD make

169
00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:26.260
it possible to take their organs, they would already

170
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.780
be considered dead even though they were still breathing

171
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.219
and still had a beating heart. Doctors at this

172
00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:37.299
point were already experimentally acquiring organs from so-called brain

173
00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.219
dead patients, but it wasn't clear that it was

174
00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:42.299
actually legal for them to do so.

175
00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:46.419
And are there different types of brain death?

176
00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:51.039
There are two main sets of criteria that have

177
00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:55.010
been accepted in various countries for brain death, and

178
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.719
one is called whole brain death. The other is

179
00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:01.960
called brain stem death. Whole brain death is the

180
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.719
legal standard in the United States, where the state

181
00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:09.520
laws define the criteria for determining death. And those

182
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.359
state laws are all modeled on what's called the

183
00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:15.320
uniform determination of Death Act, which was a piece

184
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.380
of model legislation. That was promulgated in 1980. So

185
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.669
whole brain death is the irreversible cessation. Of all

186
00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:28.510
functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem.

187
00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:32.349
Alongside the determination of brain death, there are also

188
00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:36.380
criteria for circulatory respiratory death that are very similar,

189
00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:41.799
irreversible cessation of all circulatory and respiratory functions. Some

190
00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:46.770
countries, including the United Kingdom, for example, Use a

191
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.359
brain stem death standard and that standard defines death

192
00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:56.539
as the irreversible loss of consciousness and the irreversible

193
00:11:56.539 --> 00:12:00.950
loss of the capacity to breathe. So both consciousness

194
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.080
and the capacity to breathe are functions regulated by

195
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.250
the reticular activating system in the brain stem. So

196
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.090
they determine a non-functioning brain stem results in irreversible

197
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.489
loss of consciousness and capacity to breathe, and that

198
00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:23.080
is death. Interestingly, both the brain stem criteria and

199
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.369
the whole brain death criteria are basically the same.

200
00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:31.380
The diagnostic criteria. And the reason for this is

201
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.559
that it really isn't possible to diagnose whole brain

202
00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:38.700
death or the loss of all functions of the

203
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.049
entire brain. When the Harvard committee first proposed this,

204
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:50.299
they included a diagnostic method that included determining unresponsiveness

205
00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:54.900
or unconsciousness, loss of movement and breathing, a lack

206
00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:01.309
of reflexes, and a flat electroencephalogram or EEG. Today

207
00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:04.590
we know that many patients who are diagnosed as

208
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.830
brain dead can still have some electrical activity that's

209
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.429
detectable on EEG. They also can have some functioning

210
00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:16.710
in some parts of the brain, so the hypothalamus,

211
00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:18.989
for example, or the pituitary gland, which are sort

212
00:13:18.989 --> 00:13:23.090
of located in the center of the brain. The

213
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.690
primary diagnostic tests for whole brain death are basically

214
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.539
the same as the ones for determining brain uh

215
00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:35.619
brain, brain stem, I'm sorry, um, the absence of

216
00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:40.619
brain stem reflexes, coma, and or unconsciousness and apnea

217
00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:43.159
or the loss of the ability to breathe. So

218
00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:47.010
they, the two sets of criteria for these two

219
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.700
types of brain stem or brain death are are

220
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.130
identical, basically. There is a 3rd more recent standard,

221
00:13:55.299 --> 00:14:00.539
which is sometimes called the unified brain-based determination of

222
00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:04.340
death standard, which kind of goes back to the

223
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:09.020
Harvard criteria and the rationale that when circulation and

224
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.940
respiration stop, the brain will die. So this standard

225
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.780
tries to establish a single set of criteria for

226
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.369
death rather than two standards that exist now. A

227
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:24.690
single criterion for death, but with two different ways

228
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.450
to diagnose it. One way to diagnose it is

229
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.729
using circulatory respiratory criteria, and the other way to

230
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.130
diagnose it is to use the brain death criteria,

231
00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:40.520
unconsciousness, apnea, and, and loss of reflexes. So this,

232
00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:44.760
this unified standard basically says it's always brain death,

233
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.729
right? When we talk about death, we're always talking

234
00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:49.770
about the death of the brain. We have two

235
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.679
ways to diagnose it. One focuses on breathing, circulation,

236
00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:57.950
one focuses on on brain stem activity. And there

237
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.950
was a position paper in Canada published last year

238
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.830
which um which defines this and accepts this as

239
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.349
the the guidelines for Canadian brain death, although Canada

240
00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:14.179
doesn't have, for example, a legally defined standard. One

241
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.429
reason for favoring this unified brain-based determination of death

242
00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:23.380
standard. IS that there has been a lot of

243
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.520
legal and philosophical controversy from the very beginning about

244
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.770
whether brain death is really equivalent to biological death

245
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.989
as we have traditionally understood it. The other reason

246
00:15:35.989 --> 00:15:40.979
is that organ donation is increasingly common in situations

247
00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:44.849
where the donor is not brain dead. And that's

248
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:49.169
called donation after circulatory death, where someone has a

249
00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:51.849
serious brain injury, there's a decision that's made to

250
00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:56.440
withdraw life sustaining treatment. Um, AND then with consent

251
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.479
of the donor's family, typically, um, that they become

252
00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:02.559
an organ donor. We wait for their heart to

253
00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:06.640
stop, and then we immediately procure their organs within

254
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.869
a very short time. As we all know, it's

255
00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:15.650
possible, it's, it's often possible to resuscitate that donor's

256
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.849
heart, um, which raises the question about whether they

257
00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:23.270
were really irreversibly dead. So according to the unified

258
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.909
standard, we know that that brain is going to

259
00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:28.549
die once circulation stops, so we can say that

260
00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:32.030
the patient is also brain dead when their heart

261
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.869
stops. Um, Brain dead patients have beating hearts, so

262
00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:38.390
we can still say that patient is dead whether

263
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.219
their heart is beating or not, or could be

264
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:42.710
beating with assistance.

265
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:49.330
And from a philosophical standpoint, is our current understanding

266
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.219
of brain death in medicine a dualistic one in

267
00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:53.849
any way?

268
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.739
There's implicit dualism in the medical understanding. Brain death

269
00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:03.700
is this idea that the body and the mind

270
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.618
or the soul, or whatever you want to call

271
00:17:05.618 --> 00:17:08.569
it, um, can come apart, right? That the body

272
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.219
could continue to function. And even be in relatively

273
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:15.989
good health, while the essence of that person, what

274
00:17:15.989 --> 00:17:19.790
makes them a person is missing. So this is

275
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.760
akin to the notion of the soul leaving the

276
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.829
body. Of course, the soul is not a clinical

277
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.680
or a biological entity or a structure or a

278
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.400
function of any particular organ that we can, you

279
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.630
know, take a picture of and poke or anything

280
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.219
like that. Um, THE, the UK Academy of Royal

281
00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:41.979
Medical Colleges in their, um, position on brain stem

282
00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:47.349
death. Actually do equate brainstem death with the death

283
00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:50.790
of the person. So what they say is that

284
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:56.000
death entails the irreversible loss of those essential characteristics

285
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.119
which are necessary to the existence of a living

286
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:02.680
human person. And so the definition of death should

287
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.119
be irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and

288
00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:10.050
irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. On the

289
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.619
face of it, this seems a little strange. Um,

290
00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:15.819
THESE are doctors who are trying to define what

291
00:18:15.819 --> 00:18:18.500
it is to be a person, um, which is

292
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.469
an age-old philosophical question. Um, AND the essence of

293
00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:27.819
a person as they define it, is, is made

294
00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:31.459
up of these two capacities, the capacity for consciousness

295
00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:34.180
and the capacity to breathe. This seems like an

296
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.810
odd way to define what a person is. Um,

297
00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:41.219
IS someone who is comatose and unconscious, no longer

298
00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:44.780
a person. Is someone who is unable to breathe

299
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.459
on their own without assistance no longer a person?

300
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:52.630
Is there something special about losing both of those

301
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.069
capacities that makes you no longer a person? Setting

302
00:18:57.069 --> 00:19:00.469
aside those questions, what they are doing here is

303
00:19:00.469 --> 00:19:04.270
really defining the death of personhood, the death of

304
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.709
a person rather than the death of a biological

305
00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:12.060
organism. What makes you a person is lost, they

306
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.130
say, when these essential brain functions are lost. So

307
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.209
this is a very dualistic idea, the idea that

308
00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:22.689
the body and the person or the essence of

309
00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:26.780
the person can separate, can part ways. This is,

310
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.030
of course, in many ways a very ancient ancient

311
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.510
way of thinking about body and soul. It's one

312
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.199
that we see in the Abrahamic religions, in Buddhism,

313
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.939
and many other spiritual traditions. So it is strange,

314
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:44.750
I think, to see it in modern scientific empirical

315
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.369
medical discourse. And I personally, I think that defining

316
00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:52.729
personhood is really not something that's within the domain

317
00:19:52.729 --> 00:19:55.119
of medicine, and they are sort of stepping outside

318
00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:57.760
of of their own domain and doing this.

319
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.689
So if there's this form of dualism that you

320
00:20:01.689 --> 00:20:05.650
mentioned there in our current understanding of brain deaf

321
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.150
in medicine. I would imagine that that would point

322
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.560
to some metaphysical commitments when it comes to conceptualizing

323
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.959
brain death in medicine, but are there also moral

324
00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:20.089
commitments behind it or not?

325
00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:25.989
With traditional death, we see the the biological, the

326
00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:29.949
metaphysical, and the moral all come together. The body

327
00:20:29.949 --> 00:20:32.469
does not breathe, doesn't have a beating heart, the

328
00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:35.750
body is dead, that person's no more. We all

329
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.930
agree about this as death. With a little bit

330
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.280
of variation about when exactly the the soul is

331
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.640
going to depart that body, um, which in some,

332
00:20:45.849 --> 00:20:48.969
some spiritual traditions is what's considered true death, right,

333
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.920
when the soul actually leaves. In brain death. Um,

334
00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:58.170
ONE issue is that we don't always have Global

335
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.099
loss of brain function. There are areas of the

336
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:05.650
brain that can continue to function. Um, AND there

337
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.140
are, there are actually quite a few cases in

338
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.619
the medical literature of long-term survival of the body

339
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:16.420
in brain death. So pregnant patients have continued to

340
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.660
gestate living fetuses and have given birth. Children have

341
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.819
undergone puberty and have proportional growth. The hair grows,

342
00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:28.910
the body continues to excrete waste and absorb nutrition.

343
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.939
These bodies are very much alive. If we had

344
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.160
global loss of brain functioning, where the entire brain

345
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.760
was destroyed, It would be exceptionally difficult to keep

346
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.069
that patient's body functioning for very long because there

347
00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:50.910
are some essential functions which the brain regulates. Something

348
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.160
like this was, I think, what the Harvard Committee

349
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.729
had in mind. But since then, in the last

350
00:21:56.729 --> 00:22:01.250
several decades, the professional criteria for what counts as

351
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.010
brain death have shifted. The professional guidelines, like the

352
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.650
guidelines for the American Academy of Neurology, no longer

353
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.069
required that the entire brain is non-functioning or destroyed.

354
00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:16.719
So it seems really evident that there is this.

355
00:22:17.589 --> 00:22:23.310
Dualistic metaphysical commitment within medicine to this idea that

356
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.349
someone, some person can be dead when their brain

357
00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:30.729
is no longer functioning at a certain level, a

358
00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:34.849
level that supports the existence of a mind. Um,

359
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.189
THERE'S no longer a living person there, just a

360
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:41.660
living body. And this does imply that the body

361
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.119
and the mind or the body and the person

362
00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:48.300
can separate, can part ways, are two different entities.

363
00:22:49.089 --> 00:22:53.689
And that what makes you a person in some

364
00:22:53.689 --> 00:22:56.130
way is a function of your brain and not

365
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.969
the rest of your body. So that is almost

366
00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:02.250
a kind of substance dualism, right? One that separates

367
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.640
the substance of the brain, mind, and the rest

368
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.349
of the corporeal body. There is also a moral

369
00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:14.910
or an ethical commitment because it assumes that what

370
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.229
makes the brain, what the brain makes possible, including

371
00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:24.229
consciousness and interaction and thinking, sociality, all of those

372
00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:29.079
things are also what makes human existence valuable. And

373
00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:33.319
that existence without a fully functioning brain can have

374
00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:37.520
no value, no value for that individual, and no

375
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.020
value for anyone else. Now, what makes human existence

376
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.140
valuable is a really important question. It's a question

377
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.000
that has really vital ethical and cultural and spiritual

378
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.660
and personal importance, but I don't think it's a

379
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.099
medical question, and I don't think it's a question

380
00:23:56.099 --> 00:24:01.079
that can be Decided by medicine. We're saying here

381
00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:08.000
that Someone who's chronically unconscious and apneic are basically

382
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.209
as good as dead. And that we should treat

383
00:24:11.209 --> 00:24:13.969
them as if they are dead, which is to

384
00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:16.680
say don't treat them medically at all, send them

385
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.369
to the morgue or send them to organ procurement.

386
00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:24.969
So this is a kind of reasoning by analogy,

387
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.260
and although many people would agree with these statements

388
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.500
that someone who's brain dead is as good as

389
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.140
dead, analogies themselves are not medical or scientific or

390
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.290
even legal facts. Chronically unconscious apneic individuals are not

391
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.140
the same as a decaying corpse, who should be

392
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.969
sent to the morgue or put in a box

393
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:49.589
and buried, right? We, we also see this idea.

394
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.859
COME about in the the language that's used to

395
00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:57.839
describe medical treatment when someone has been determined to

396
00:24:57.839 --> 00:25:01.119
be brain dead. So after that brain death is

397
00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:04.869
declared, a lot of doctors will no longer say

398
00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:09.609
that the patient is receiving life sustaining treatment, right?

399
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.680
The language changes to organ support, even though we're

400
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.339
talking about essentially identical treatments. Treatments that are keeping

401
00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:22.910
the body alive. So this kind of reinforces the

402
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.180
unscientific and dualist notion that there's just no longer

403
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.060
a person there, no longer a living patient, but

404
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.369
just a material body, or a collection of living

405
00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:38.140
organs. And this is a way of using synectady,

406
00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:40.689
right? Using a part to refer to the whole.

407
00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:48.270
That's intentionally dehumanizing. It involves this metaphysical stance regarding

408
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:53.069
what persons are, and an ethical stance concerning which

409
00:25:53.069 --> 00:25:57.430
humans have value, and it shifts the locus of

410
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.750
our ethical concern from the individual patient to the

411
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.819
needs of others, to potential organ recipients who might

412
00:26:07.069 --> 00:26:09.550
benefit from the active organ support.

413
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.849
So in the book, you go through several different

414
00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:17.609
kinds of challenges to brain death. And first, there

415
00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:22.479
are the epistemic challenges. In the domain of epistemology,

416
00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:25.489
what is there to consider here when it comes

417
00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:26.469
to brain death?

418
00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:31.800
So one epistemic challenge is that it's simply not

419
00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:37.689
possible to To definitively determine or diagnose whole brain

420
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:41.810
death in the vast majority of cases, um, in

421
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.760
the cases where we can, where there is just,

422
00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:48.280
you know, global and catastrophic injury to the brain,

423
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:50.650
we'll probably not be able to keep that patient

424
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.239
alive long enough to do a brain diagnosis. Um,

425
00:26:54.449 --> 00:26:58.290
WE don't have tests that can determine that all

426
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.310
parts of the brain are non-functioning. We use surrogate

427
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:07.670
tests. These can include those brainstem tests like loss

428
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:12.229
of consciousness, breathing, and brain stem reflexes. They also

429
00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:17.609
include tests of brain perfusion. Where we can, we

430
00:27:17.609 --> 00:27:20.770
can do scans, um, and look for uh blood

431
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:26.229
circulation in the brain. And one thing that frequently

432
00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:30.369
results in a brain death diagnosis is that there's

433
00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:33.719
an injury to the brain that causes edema or

434
00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:37.800
swelling of the brain. Because our brains are encased

435
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.239
in this hard skull, that swelling can really be

436
00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:44.349
catastrophic because the brain has nowhere to go. And,

437
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.800
uh, and it will result in additional injury to

438
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.560
the brain above and beyond whatever caused the initial

439
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.160
injury. And that swelling can have the effect of

440
00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.079
cutting off circulation, cutting off the blood supply to

441
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:03.859
the brain. And that in theory, is going to

442
00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:08.170
cause a global brain injury and loss of function.

443
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.790
But there is this hypothesis out there. That there's

444
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:18.589
a condition called global ischemic penumbra, in which circulation

445
00:28:18.589 --> 00:28:21.579
to the brain is at such a low level

446
00:28:21.869 --> 00:28:25.640
that it can't be detected by our current medical

447
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.869
technology, but that it's just enough to support cellular

448
00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:35.189
life in the brain. And moreover, The hypothesis goes

449
00:28:35.189 --> 00:28:38.280
on the way to brain death, on the way

450
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.640
towards total loss of circulation and perfusion to the

451
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.280
brain, the brain is always going to pass through

452
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.560
this global ischemic conumbra where we have very minimal

453
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:58.150
circulation and perfusion. So there's epistemic uncertainty in the

454
00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:03.040
diagnosis of brain death. Even with brain stem death,

455
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.520
we have epistemic uncertainty about the loss of consciousness.

456
00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:12.170
In disorders of consciousness, so brain disorders that result

457
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:18.079
in impaired consciousness like coma or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome,

458
00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:21.000
which used to be called the vegetative state. And

459
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.719
the minimally conscious state, there's a high rate of

460
00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:29.560
misdiagnosis of unconsciousness, around 43%, which is really a

461
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.719
very high rate of misdiagnosis, and that has persisted

462
00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:37.800
for many decades. So these are patients who appear

463
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.520
to be unconscious, but who are conscious, but not

464
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.599
responsive. They're unable for a variety of reasons to

465
00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:50.369
respond when we test them for signs of consciousness.

466
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.660
Now, some of the same injuries that result in

467
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.479
brain stem death can also result in disorders of

468
00:29:58.479 --> 00:30:01.920
consciousness. Someone in a coma will also not breathe

469
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.760
spontaneously, so they appear to satisfy criteria for brain

470
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.560
death. Someone in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome can breathe

471
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.670
on their own. And can have recovery of one

472
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.349
aspect of consciousness, wakefulness, but they're gonna lack awareness.

473
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:22.229
So the main difference between brain death or coma

474
00:30:22.229 --> 00:30:26.780
or UWS is that We don't think there's any

475
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.709
possibility at all that the brain dead patient can

476
00:30:30.709 --> 00:30:39.010
recover consciousness. Here's where that gets interesting. In 2013,

477
00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:42.729
a 12 year old girl named Jehai McMath was

478
00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:46.239
declared brain dead in a hospital in Oakland, California.

479
00:30:46.729 --> 00:30:51.839
So she'd experienced uncontrolled bleeding after a routine surgery,

480
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.369
which resulted in a prolonged cardiac arrest and a

481
00:30:55.369 --> 00:31:02.310
hypoxic brain injury. Now, by all accounts, Expert neurologist

482
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.050
diagnosed her and she met the clinical criteria for

483
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.449
brain death. I don't know of anyone who disagrees

484
00:31:09.449 --> 00:31:13.040
that she was properly diagnosed according to the existing

485
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.599
criteria, and that includes people who are very skeptical

486
00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:19.530
of the existing criteria, but they, you know, have

487
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.420
said, yes, she was properly diagnosed according to our

488
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:27.150
clinical guidelines. Her family objected to the brain death

489
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.589
diagnosis and refused to consent to withdrawal of treatment

490
00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:34.800
on religious grounds. They said that as long as

491
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.979
her heart was beating, they believed she was alive,

492
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.949
so they had a traditional biological understanding of death.

493
00:31:42.619 --> 00:31:46.439
Mhm. They took the hospital to court, and after

494
00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:50.250
a court battle that lasted for several weeks, the

495
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.489
family was finally allowed to take Jahai, who was

496
00:31:54.489 --> 00:31:57.410
considered under California law to be dead and a

497
00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.290
corpse, but a ventilated corpse, um, and they flew

498
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:06.189
her to from California to New Jersey. New Jersey

499
00:32:06.189 --> 00:32:09.349
is the only state in the US that has

500
00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:13.819
an explicit religious exemption for brain death. So in

501
00:32:13.819 --> 00:32:17.989
New Jersey, if the patient has a religious objection

502
00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:21.579
to neurologic criteria for death, the patient can only

503
00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:26.910
be declared dead by circulatory respiratory criteria. So now

504
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.849
we have this strange situation where Jehai McMath is

505
00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:35.130
considered legally and medically dead in California. She had

506
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.119
a death certificate and legally alive in New Jersey.

507
00:32:39.709 --> 00:32:43.859
Um, SHE survived for 4 more years. And received

508
00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:48.339
care primarily in her family's home. During that time,

509
00:32:49.329 --> 00:32:53.719
Neurologists who examined her found what they say is

510
00:32:53.719 --> 00:32:58.680
evidence that she had recovered consciousness. And was likely

511
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.800
in a minimally conscious state. Now, if true, she

512
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.400
would be the only known case of someone recovering

513
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.119
from brain death. Brain death is by definition, irreversible.

514
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:15.530
So this would be really extraordinary, right? Some neurologists

515
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.280
believe that Jihai was experiencing global ischemic promumbra when

516
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.170
she was diagnosed as brain dead, that the circulation

517
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.635
to her brain was. Minimal and undetectable, but was

518
00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:31.824
not completely absent. So there's the epistemic challenge. Do

519
00:33:31.824 --> 00:33:36.275
we have the capability to diagnose whole brain or

520
00:33:36.275 --> 00:33:39.354
brain stem death? Can we say with certainty that

521
00:33:39.354 --> 00:33:44.140
a brain injury, that brain death, is irreversible? Part

522
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.739
of what makes this more complicated is because of

523
00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:50.540
the legal status of brain death that someone is

524
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.359
considered legally dead, it's Most common that we remove

525
00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:59.760
life sustaining treatment, which will result in that patient's

526
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.510
body dying. Or they become organ donors, which will

527
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:08.060
also result in that patient's body dying. So what

528
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.429
we typically do after a brain death diagnosis makes

529
00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:15.279
it very difficult for us to know. Is this

530
00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:19.918
person really irreversibly dead with a non-functioning brain, or

531
00:34:19.918 --> 00:34:22.918
is this sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy that we

532
00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:24.148
have put into place?

533
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.418
Yes, and we'll come back in a bit to

534
00:34:28.418 --> 00:34:32.219
some of those cases where there's conflict between the

535
00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:37.379
commitments and worldviews of patients and doctors or people

536
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:42.100
who are closely related to patients, of course. But

537
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.364
uh, the second set of challenges. ARE the medical

538
00:34:45.364 --> 00:34:48.404
ones. So what is, what is there to consider

539
00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:48.833
here?

540
00:34:49.043 --> 00:34:53.083
For medicine, those epistemic challenges are, of course, very

541
00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:57.063
real and urgent, although they're not always acknowledged. Um,

542
00:34:57.343 --> 00:35:01.003
DOCTORS are the people who have to communicate with

543
00:35:01.003 --> 00:35:04.624
families about the patient. They are the entities who

544
00:35:04.624 --> 00:35:08.780
have to determine and declare death. Not all doctors

545
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.209
agree that brain death is truly deaf, but that

546
00:35:12.209 --> 00:35:15.770
is sort of the, the, the common position that

547
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.370
brain death is truly death. Um, NOT all doctors

548
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.610
agree that the clinical guidelines are adequate, um, in

549
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.879
the US. The clinical guidelines, the current guidelines which

550
00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:32.719
were released just last year, um, by the American

551
00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:36.439
Academy of Neurology, those guidelines have changed over time,

552
00:35:36.479 --> 00:35:40.080
and they are no longer in alignment with the

553
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.520
law on brain death because we really can't diagnose

554
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.399
the irreversible loss of all functions of the entire

555
00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:54.479
brain. So knowledgeable neurologists also have to contend with

556
00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:58.879
that, with the disconnect, with the knowledge that when

557
00:35:58.879 --> 00:36:01.239
they tell a family that their loved one is

558
00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:04.879
brain dead, they're not actually conforming to the legal

559
00:36:04.879 --> 00:36:08.399
standard, but they are conforming to what is in

560
00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:11.199
effect an approximation, the best that we can actually

561
00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:12.919
do medically speaking.

562
00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.530
So, and there's also the ethics behind brain death

563
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.370
and how we deal with it. So what are

564
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.290
some of the main questions or considerations that we

565
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.350
need to address from an ethical standpoint when it

566
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.129
comes to brain?

567
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:35.149
So brain death imposes and and enforces these moral

568
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:39.350
and metaphysical worldviews on, on patients and on their

569
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:42.570
families in a way that actually can be very

570
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.790
onerous, especially for, for families who reject brain death,

571
00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:51.929
right, or who deny brain death. Now, when we,

572
00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:54.229
when we do this, right, when we tell someone,

573
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.729
look, your, your child or your husband or, you

574
00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:00.620
know, your, your sister is dead. They are brain

575
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:05.169
dead, they are legally dead. We are not imposing

576
00:37:05.169 --> 00:37:08.969
this view on them, this diagnosis on them in

577
00:37:08.969 --> 00:37:13.530
a way that extends their rights or protects that

578
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.850
affected individual from serious harm. In fact, what it

579
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.729
does is it really abolishes the rights of those

580
00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:25.250
who are judged to be brain dead. Now the

581
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.860
people who denied brain death. ARE in the minority,

582
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.760
right? They're they're likely to be subjected to the

583
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.879
involuntary withdrawal of life sustaining treatment. There have even

584
00:37:39.879 --> 00:37:43.280
been cases where the organs of the patient have

585
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.000
been um removed against the wishes of the family

586
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.110
or the surrogate. Mhm. It's not unreasonable to say

587
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.229
that, you know, death requires that the heart stops

588
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:58.199
beating and that breathing ceases, but that is not

589
00:37:58.199 --> 00:38:00.800
only a traditional way of understanding and determining death.

590
00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:04.030
It's also a scientific and a medically accepted way.

591
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.080
So when a family, you know, comes to us

592
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.959
and says, Look, her heart is still beating, she

593
00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:11.270
can't be dead. Right, they're they're not saying something

594
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.750
that is outrageous and and outlandish and completely divorced

595
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.510
from the facts. In fact, that is one of

596
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.229
the ways that we determine that someone has died.

597
00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:27.590
So the burdens For people who only accept that

598
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.830
traditional understanding of death are really very significant, and

599
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.489
they're not benign, and they're not equally distributed, right?

600
00:38:35.629 --> 00:38:39.830
Only people who reject brain death are subjected to

601
00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:44.530
involuntary withdrawal of life sustaining treatment or organ procurement.

602
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.870
Only they will see their loved ones stripped of

603
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.580
their rights and losing their own rights. To make

604
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.510
decisions about what happens to their family members. So

605
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.949
there is an issue of justice here, right? An

606
00:38:56.949 --> 00:39:01.659
issue of whether we are um providing equal treatment

607
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:04.350
to everyone or whether we are treating people who

608
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:08.020
reject brain death differently than we would treat those

609
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.649
who are accepting of the diagnosis and willing to

610
00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:13.830
um donate organs, for example.

611
00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:19.659
So you've already alluded or referred briefly to some

612
00:39:19.659 --> 00:39:22.449
of the considerations when it comes to my next

613
00:39:22.449 --> 00:39:26.899
question, but what exactly happens when the commitments and

614
00:39:26.899 --> 00:39:31.419
the worldview behind brain death or associated with brain

615
00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:35.919
death are not shared by the patient or the

616
00:39:35.919 --> 00:39:36.699
surrogate?

617
00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:39.580
There was a case in the UK several years

618
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.510
ago where A young toddler, um, choked on a

619
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.830
little piece of fruit, and he suffered a hypoxic

620
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.669
brain injury as a result. It took a while

621
00:39:50.669 --> 00:39:52.110
to get him to the hospital. It took a

622
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.820
while for the doctors to be able to remove

623
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.340
that little piece of fruit. Um, SO his parents

624
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:05.100
were Muslims from Saudi Arabia. Their child was declared

625
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.449
brain dead. His parents objected. They wanted to take

626
00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:13.820
their child home to Saudi Arabia, where life sustaining

627
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.820
treatment would be continued, right? They would not ever

628
00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.419
withdraw life sustaining treatment from that child. So they

629
00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:24.860
went to court and uh the court ruled against

630
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.310
them and said, your child is dead. And it's

631
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.330
not in your child's best interest to continue life

632
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.540
sustaining treatment. It's in his best interest to remove

633
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.419
treatment and allow him to quote, die a dignified

634
00:40:40.419 --> 00:40:45.500
death. So this is an extraordinary example of the

635
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:50.750
law and medicine. Being in alignment here and really

636
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:55.070
running roughshod over the religious and the cultural beliefs

637
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.239
of a family. Beliefs that did not cause harm

638
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:03.149
to anyone in the UK because this family was

639
00:41:03.149 --> 00:41:07.419
planning to repatriate their child to Saudi Arabia, right?

640
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.110
So their right to decide what happened to their

641
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.449
child, what medical treatment to provide for their child,

642
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:17.750
and whether their child lived or died. We're taken

643
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.110
away. And that is an example of how this

644
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:27.030
sort of medico-legal worldview about brain death can be

645
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:32.350
imposed on patients or on their surrogates without them

646
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:36.489
really having any ability to To push back or

647
00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:39.209
fight back against that. If the courts are going

648
00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:42.000
to agree with doctors in all of these cases.

649
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.810
Um, AND they don't always, in the United States,

650
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.659
we've had cases that sort of go both ways.

651
00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.050
The problem is when you end up in court,

652
00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:54.199
Well, courts are not really better at deciding these

653
00:41:54.199 --> 00:41:58.320
metaphysical and ethical issues, um, than, than physicians are,

654
00:41:58.399 --> 00:42:03.000
right? Um, OR hospitals are. So we're talking about

655
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.439
really important and fundamental personal, cultural, social, spiritual beliefs

656
00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:14.840
and worldviews here. And it's, it's important here that

657
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.719
we remember that the belief that most people have

658
00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:22.149
as an alternative is that When the heart stops

659
00:42:22.149 --> 00:42:26.149
and breathing stops, then we will accept and understand

660
00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:29.350
that, you know, our loved one is dead. That's

661
00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:34.469
a valid medically accepted medically diagnosable death. It's really

662
00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:39.989
not controversial. So why trample on people's rights and

663
00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:45.820
their reasonable beliefs in order to maintain this controversial

664
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:49.350
medico-legal dogma about brain death.

665
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.320
So when there are these kinds of conflicts, should

666
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.120
we, from an ethical perspective, should we respect uh

667
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.899
the, the interests and the worldviews of the patient,

668
00:43:02.919 --> 00:43:06.120
or the surrogate or the doctor?

669
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.969
So laws have coercive force, right? And when we

670
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:17.899
compel a definition of personhood that's not compatible with

671
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:24.260
someone's individual moral, philosophical, cultural, social, or spiritual beliefs,

672
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.370
that can be really coercive in a way that

673
00:43:27.659 --> 00:43:31.620
it is very easy to perceive as oppressive or

674
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:37.270
as a kind of legally sanctioned medical neglect. Some

675
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.610
would even say, my, you know, my child, my

676
00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.699
sister was not dead. The doctors killed her by

677
00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:49.489
removing life sustaining treatment. It's not surprising that brain

678
00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:53.219
death is contested when we view it as a

679
00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:57.530
way of determining something that is Very much implied

680
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:01.689
in the law that this person with rights, this

681
00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:06.729
subject of justice, is transformed by a diagnosis into

682
00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:10.780
a non-person who no longer has any rights. Because

683
00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.100
of course, as I said, personhood is not the

684
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.540
domain of medicine. I don't think it's the domain

685
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.540
of law either. The law, in fact, has frequently

686
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.979
been wrong about who is and who is not

687
00:44:21.979 --> 00:44:24.419
a person. When we look historically at the status

688
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:27.820
of women or the status of children or enslaved

689
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.020
peoples, right, who were not considered persons under the

690
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.300
law. So the law actually, you know, very much

691
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.129
can come out of alignment with our understanding of

692
00:44:36.419 --> 00:44:38.780
who's a person who has rights, who should have

693
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:44.379
rights. So when we sort of impose those those

694
00:44:44.379 --> 00:44:47.899
medico legal definitions of death on people, it is

695
00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:51.620
coercive. It is um it is coercive when they

696
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.340
are unable to stop us from ending life sustaining

697
00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.459
treatment or unable to stop us from taking organs

698
00:45:00.459 --> 00:45:01.500
from that patient.

699
00:45:01.879 --> 00:45:05.129
And so in this particular case, just going back

700
00:45:05.129 --> 00:45:09.580
to the second part of my question, whose worldviews

701
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.199
and interests should be respected here?

702
00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:18.879
The majority of people in Western societies, I think,

703
00:45:18.889 --> 00:45:23.639
do believe that even if brain death isn't exactly

704
00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:27.409
the way we've traditionally understood death, it's close enough.

705
00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:31.360
So many people believe that for them personally, right?

706
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.800
It's, it's close enough they wouldn't want to be

707
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.169
kept alive with such a severely injured brain where

708
00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:40.159
they won't recover consciousness, will never be able to

709
00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:42.399
do the things that they valued in life, and

710
00:45:42.399 --> 00:45:46.000
so on. And for those people, there's really no

711
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.030
problem with with brain death. OK. For the minority

712
00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:54.669
who do not believe that brain death is really

713
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:58.790
truly death, but who believe that death Occurs in

714
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.350
the traditional way when the heart stops and when

715
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.590
breathing stops. I think it's reasonable to respect that

716
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:10.209
because they have an understanding of death that's reasonable,

717
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:16.729
that's accepted, accepted by almost everyone. Now, it would

718
00:46:16.729 --> 00:46:20.209
not be reasonable for someone to believe in human

719
00:46:20.209 --> 00:46:24.340
immortality, right? To insist on resuscitating a corpse who

720
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.209
is in rigor mortis or ventilating a decaying body.

721
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.489
Um, IN, in some Buddhist traditions, it's believed that

722
00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:37.159
the soul leaves the body about 7 days after

723
00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:39.770
the heart and breathing stops, that that is the

724
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:43.360
true death. Well, it would be unreasonable to insist

725
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.719
that the body remain in a hospital bed during

726
00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:48.040
those 7 days after the heart has stopped and

727
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.149
the breathing has stopped. But we do have two

728
00:46:53.679 --> 00:46:58.520
medically and legally accepted ways of being dead, this

729
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.040
traditional way that is in agreement with pretty much

730
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.070
everyone's spiritual, cultural, and common sense views. Um, AND

731
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.790
this more recent invented way that's controversial for a

732
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.729
lot of people, not just controversial for lay people,

733
00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:19.060
but for doctors, for lawyers, for philosophers, for theologians.

734
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:24.070
So I think we can and we should accommodate

735
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:29.340
those reasonable, uncontroversial views about death. And allow that

736
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.989
minority group of patients and families to say brain

737
00:47:32.989 --> 00:47:35.590
death isn't death as we understand it. We want

738
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.310
to keep this patient on a ventilator.

739
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:43.479
Does the value or principles such as patient autonomy

740
00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:46.459
also apply in the context of brain death?

741
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.129
I think it does. So we think that based

742
00:47:51.129 --> 00:47:55.229
on the value of patient autonomy, patients should be

743
00:47:55.229 --> 00:47:59.050
able to make choices for themselves about the medical

744
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.929
treatment that they will accept and the medical treatment

745
00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:07.540
that they will refuse. Family members or surrogates or

746
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:13.280
proxies, depending on how they're defined, um, Exercise that

747
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.679
autonomy on behalf of the patient. So when the

748
00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:20.510
patient's no longer able to speak for themselves, their

749
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.800
their family members speak for them, right? And and

750
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.030
exercise their autonomy by proxy, as it were. So

751
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.149
we do currently allow patients to refuse medical treatment,

752
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.229
even if it will result in them dying, an

753
00:48:35.229 --> 00:48:38.709
avoidable death. Um, AND we should also, I think,

754
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:44.790
permit patients to choose which standard of death among

755
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.709
our reasonable accepted standards which are available is the

756
00:48:48.709 --> 00:48:51.469
one that's going to be used to determine their

757
00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:55.370
death. One that is in keeping with their values,

758
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.780
with their beliefs, and with their preferences.

759
00:48:59.379 --> 00:49:02.800
So I think that throughout our conversation, we've already

760
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.000
touched on the point of organ donation and how

761
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
it ties to brain death in a way. So

762
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.120
I have one final question then. Which should be

763
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.560
considered reasonable objections against the standard medical view of

764
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.760
brain death or even death more generally among the

765
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.709
ones that we explored here.

766
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:26.360
Well, there are so many reasons, right? There are

767
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:31.120
philosophical, there are medical, there are legal um reasons

768
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.760
to question brain death, and it has been controversial

769
00:49:35.199 --> 00:49:38.879
from the very beginning and continues to be controversial

770
00:49:38.879 --> 00:49:43.949
today. It's also endorsed by many people as being

771
00:49:43.949 --> 00:49:49.199
necessary and a useful legal fiction, a legal fiction

772
00:49:49.199 --> 00:49:53.840
that solves the practical and ethical problems that emerged

773
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.479
alongside our advancements in medicine. And a number of

774
00:49:58.479 --> 00:50:02.080
people have referred to brain death as a legal

775
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.679
fiction, and I think it's a really interesting and

776
00:50:05.679 --> 00:50:09.909
important way to think about. What brain death is

777
00:50:09.909 --> 00:50:13.709
and how it functions in our world. So legal

778
00:50:13.709 --> 00:50:20.550
fictions are basically um legal decisions or legal arbitrary

779
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:25.939
legal lines that are established for purposes, but which

780
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:30.020
are not otherwise rooted in reality or in facts.

781
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.510
So as an example, Um, in most places, there

782
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.149
is an age when someone is considered a legal

783
00:50:37.149 --> 00:50:41.300
adult. In the United States, that's typically 18 years

784
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.860
old. So the day before your 18th birthday, you

785
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.810
are basically the same person that you will be

786
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.419
the next day. But legally, the day before your

787
00:50:51.419 --> 00:50:54.179
birthday, you're a child, and the day after you're

788
00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:57.060
an adult, and you have the rights and responsibilities

789
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.580
of an adult as soon as you turn 18

790
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.300
on the anniversary of your birth. That's a legal

791
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.899
fiction, right? There's also this concept called legally blind,

792
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:12.350
where someone who has very impaired vision, um, such

793
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.989
that they're not allowed to do things like drive

794
00:51:13.989 --> 00:51:18.439
a car, for example. They're not completely, literally blind,

795
00:51:18.629 --> 00:51:22.229
but they are considered legally blind, which limits their

796
00:51:22.229 --> 00:51:25.189
right to do certain things and at the same

797
00:51:25.189 --> 00:51:30.070
time might entitle them to certain accommodations or benefits

798
00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.270
as a disabled person. So this gets to that.

799
00:51:33.879 --> 00:51:39.100
DISTINCTION of being legally dead for all practical purposes,

800
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:42.439
right? You can be for all practical purposes blind,

801
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:47.300
or for all practical purposes an adult or According

802
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.629
to those who accept brain death for all practical

803
00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:55.540
purposes, dead. If brain death is a legal fiction

804
00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:00.270
like that. It's an especially interesting one, because as

805
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:05.729
a human being, A citizen, your status will change

806
00:52:05.729 --> 00:52:08.850
very significantly on your death. You will no longer

807
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.510
be a moral person, a member of the moral

808
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.689
community who's entitled to moral consideration. You're no longer

809
00:52:15.689 --> 00:52:18.449
a legal person, a citizen with legal rights and

810
00:52:18.449 --> 00:52:22.379
responsibilities. The loss of those moral and legal rights

811
00:52:22.379 --> 00:52:25.570
is very significant, right? You are no longer entitled

812
00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:28.639
to medical treatment. Your family loses the right to

813
00:52:28.639 --> 00:52:32.100
act on your behalf. Um, IN many places, it

814
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:37.100
can mean that doctors can withdraw medical support unilaterally

815
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.699
without consent from you or your family. So, you

816
00:52:41.699 --> 00:52:46.340
know, some doctors will really lean into that legal

817
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.320
definition of death. When they're confronted with families who

818
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.959
don't accept brain death, or don't accept that their

819
00:52:52.959 --> 00:52:55.639
loved one is dead, and they will say, the

820
00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:58.669
law says this person is dead, so they're dead,

821
00:52:58.879 --> 00:53:01.469
right? And we no longer have to treat this,

822
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:04.629
your, your sister or your brother or your child.

823
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.320
It's a, it's a way of stating a legal

824
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.600
fact as if it was also a biological or

825
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.199
a medical fact when when actually they sort of

826
00:53:14.199 --> 00:53:20.989
have come apart there. There's an interesting case, I

827
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:27.739
think, in Japan. Japan did something really interesting and

828
00:53:27.739 --> 00:53:31.500
I think valuable in thinking about brain death. There

829
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.979
was a national debate about whether or not brain

830
00:53:33.979 --> 00:53:36.689
death should be codified as legal death in Japan,

831
00:53:36.899 --> 00:53:38.790
and it went on for more than a decade.

832
00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:44.379
This followed a controversy in 1968 in the early

833
00:53:44.379 --> 00:53:48.060
days of transplantation, where a doctor was charged with

834
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:52.030
murder for taking a patient's organs for transplant. So

835
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:55.989
there was mistrust of organ donation and brain death.

836
00:53:56.729 --> 00:54:00.969
There were also these deeply important social, cultural, and

837
00:54:00.969 --> 00:54:04.879
religious beliefs in a country with many Buddhists and

838
00:54:04.879 --> 00:54:10.679
Shintos. Where the idea was that a warm breathing

839
00:54:10.679 --> 00:54:14.280
body with a heartbeat cannot be dead, right? This

840
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.560
rejection of Western dualism about the separability of body

841
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:25.189
and mind. So in 1999, Japan's parliament passed a

842
00:54:25.189 --> 00:54:29.360
law on organ donation that was basically a compromise,

843
00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:33.449
and it allows the determination of brain death only

844
00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:36.850
for purposes of organ donation and only when there

845
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.510
is first person consent. So the patient themselves must

846
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:43.330
decide in advance that they're willing to be an

847
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:46.489
organ donor and to be declared dead by neurologic

848
00:54:46.489 --> 00:54:51.719
criteria. What I find interesting about this is that

849
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:58.409
Japan is not an especially pluralistic, multi-ethnic, multicultural, or

850
00:54:58.409 --> 00:55:03.250
diverse country. Yet they created this compromise on brain

851
00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:07.969
death that respects both majority and minority viewpoints about

852
00:55:07.969 --> 00:55:13.169
brain death and is very transparent about why brain

853
00:55:13.169 --> 00:55:18.270
death is valuable. So it recognizes and it transparently

854
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:22.469
acknowledges the importance of brain death for organ donation,

855
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:27.870
while also respecting important social, cultural, and spiritual objections

856
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:32.070
to brain death as human death and respects individual

857
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.699
autonomy when it comes to choosing. Both organ donation

858
00:55:36.699 --> 00:55:39.729
and brain death. I think if we had that

859
00:55:39.729 --> 00:55:45.060
same transparency and respect elsewhere. In the United States,

860
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.580
for example, or in European countries. A lot of

861
00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:52.780
the controversies about brain death would actually be resolved.

862
00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:57.479
Because we could have almost any criteria for brain

863
00:55:57.479 --> 00:56:01.840
death, whole brain death, brain stem death, unified brain-based

864
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.500
death, as long as we allowed people who objected

865
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.629
to opt out and to choose the alternative of

866
00:56:08.629 --> 00:56:12.919
circulatory respiratory death. People who want to be organ

867
00:56:12.919 --> 00:56:16.870
donors would have to recognize that this is what

868
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.189
it means for you to be an organ donor,

869
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.969
right? We could be transparent about it and then

870
00:56:21.969 --> 00:56:28.389
we wouldn't. Risk exploiting people or instrumentalizing persons and

871
00:56:28.389 --> 00:56:30.989
using them as organ donors for the purposes of

872
00:56:30.989 --> 00:56:32.270
serving others.

873
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:36.350
Great. So, the book is again philosophical, medical, and

874
00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:39.830
legal controversies about brain death. Of course, I'm leaving

875
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.989
a link to it in the description of the

876
00:56:41.989 --> 00:56:45.189
interview. And Doctor Johnson, just before we go, would

877
00:56:45.189 --> 00:56:47.750
you like to tell people if there are any

878
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.389
places on the internet where they can find you

879
00:56:50.389 --> 00:56:51.189
and your work?

880
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:55.570
Um, LET'S see. Well, if they go to Google

881
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:58.889
Scholar, they can find a a profile that includes

882
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:01.840
my uh all of the publications that I have.

883
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.290
I have a website um with my university, and

884
00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:08.510
then I also do have a personal website, it's

885
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.409
symjohnson.com.

886
00:57:11.629 --> 00:57:14.159
Great. So I'm adding that to the description of

887
00:57:14.159 --> 00:57:16.929
the interview and Doctor Johnson, thank you so much

888
00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:18.689

889
00:57:18.689 --> 00:57:22.129
