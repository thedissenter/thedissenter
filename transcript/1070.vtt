00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.869
Center. I'm, I'm your host, Ricardo Lopez, and today

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:09.229
I'm joined by Doctor Claudia Pas Frere. She is

4
00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.939
an assistant professor of bioethics at New York University.

5
00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.629
Her current research program focuses on the development of

6
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:21.024
consciousness, including What theories of consciousness say about infant

7
00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:25.385
consciousness and machine consciousness and how these theories shed

8
00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:28.385
light on ethical issues. And so we're talking about

9
00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:32.543
the development of consciousness and morality today. So, Doctor

10
00:00:32.543 --> 00:00:34.784
Pas Ferreira, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

11
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:35.345
to everyone.

12
00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:38.549
Welcome. Thank you very much for having me.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.529
Great. So, uh, uh, tell us first, how do

14
00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:47.290
we determine that a particular being is conscious? I

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.569
mean, how do we go about determining that, for

16
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.849
example, an infant and nonhuman animal is conscious? Are

17
00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:56.889
there particular tests that we can use or what?

18
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.150
Uh, YEAH, this is a, uh, a very good

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.590
question to start because it's right on, on the

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.589
focus of my current research. So, so for a

21
00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:12.269
creature like us, adults, uh, human beings, we usually

22
00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:16.069
rely on what we call verbal reports. So I

23
00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.099
ask you, are you perceiving this stimulus? Are you

24
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.660
hearing the sound? Are you seeing this, uh, uh,

25
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.910
visual input? And you can give me verbal reports.

26
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.099
You can say yes or no, or you can

27
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.940
indicate with the behavior, whether you're seeing or, or

28
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.730
hearing or perceiving uh the uh the stimulus. Uh,

29
00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.949
SO, in other cases where you don't have reports,

30
00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:47.980
you have a challenge because we know from our

31
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.220
cases that I cannot observe directly conscious, consciousness on

32
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.019
your brain. I cannot see your brain or open

33
00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.540
your brain, or have an image of your brain

34
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.480
and spot, oh, here is uh Ricardo's consciousness. So

35
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.449
we need some other type of indication that gives

36
00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:09.210
us an idea if you are uh conscious or

37
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.649
not of the stimulus. So in that case, as

38
00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.130
I said before, we have, I can, you can

39
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.490
communicate to internal states and tell me whether you

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.690
are perceiving or not a stimulus. In cases we

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.169
don't have verbal reports, we have this problem that

42
00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:29.080
how can we assess, uh, access, uh, internal status

43
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.220
in cases. That the creature cannot give us a

44
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.410
verbal indication that they are perceiving or not. Uh,

45
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.220
IN the animal case, we can train animals to

46
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.979
give us some indications with their behavior. So we

47
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.330
can train, uh, for instance, uh, a monkey to

48
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.380
push a button when you see an image on

49
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.899
the screen, OK. Uh, OR you can observe the

50
00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.660
way they behave if they have some certain kind

51
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.690
of behavior that we think goes together, goes, uh,

52
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.460
uh, correlates with consciousness, and you might get in

53
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.179
conclusion that they might, uh, uh, perceiving that behavior

54
00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.570
or performing that behavior, giving a conscious states they

55
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.809
have. Uh, IN the case of infants, we have

56
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:19.369
a challenge because, uh, we cannot train, uh, young,

57
00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.009
uh, uh, infants, uh, young infants, when I say

58
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.610
young infants very young, like 1 month, 2 months

59
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.600
newborns, so we cannot train them to give us,

60
00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.710
even with their behavior indications if they're conscious or

61
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.839
not. OK. So how can we know whether they

62
00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:41.009
are perceiving or hearing or seeing a stimulus consciously.

63
00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.369
So usually we have some sort of behaviors that

64
00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.610
we think correlated with cautious, that is some sort

65
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.470
of indication, uh, but we cannot have the classic

66
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.119
verbal report, uh uh uh indication of consciousness in

67
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.970
infants, OK. And even the behaviors we have is

68
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.850
not a trained behavior as we can have in

69
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.529
the case of animals, it's a behavior that we

70
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.399
observe them. And we can infer from that that

71
00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.520
observation that they might be performing that behavior given

72
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.040
the conscious states they have, but I can elaborate

73
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.250
more about that if you, if you want.

74
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.679
Yeah, uh, so what can we tell about early

75
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.920
conscious states in preverbal infants? I mean, uh, how

76
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.089
can we know anything about it?

77
00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:33.470
Yeah, so, uh, so there are some sorts of

78
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.630
behaviors that we think, uh, in the, in the

79
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.850
early stages that might correlate with, uh, uh, consciousness.

80
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.179
For instance, uh, infants, they have a very limited

81
00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:50.970
motor behavior. We cannot train them as we can

82
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.929
train animals because the range of motor control they

83
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:58.269
have is very limited. They're still developing their motor

84
00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.299
control. Uh, BUT they can already use their eye

85
00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:05.779
gaze and direct their eye gaze to certain stimulus

86
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.820
that might indicate that they're perceiving consciously that is

87
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.019
stimulus. And we can use this type of behavior,

88
00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.130
the eye gaze, the eye direction they have, uh,

89
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.130
as an indication whether they are, uh, perceiving, uh,

90
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.309
for instance, a patch of color in the screen.

91
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.459
So, uh, we usually, uh, have, uh, is something

92
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.019
that uh we humans have, we can, once we

93
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:38.029
are habituated with certain kind of stimulus, we lose

94
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:42.179
interest in that stimulus, OK? And to regain interest,

95
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.820
I have to show you something new and we

96
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.000
can use this, uh, this technique with infants. So

97
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.029
if an infant is habituated with certain kinds of

98
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.880
visual stimulus, Uh, and we change the visual stimulus,

99
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.000
for instance, they are seeing a patch of red

100
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.399
and you change for a patch of green. And

101
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:03.200
if they regain attention and regain interest in the

102
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.799
stimulus, you might, it might suggest that they might

103
00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.959
be perceiving that stimulus consciously. And you can do

104
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:15.540
the same with auditory information. Uh, SO, gain interest

105
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.299
and curiosity and also surprise, if you violate some

106
00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:24.000
sort of expectations they created related to the environment,

107
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.559
this kind of surprise reactions might indicate that they're

108
00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:32.899
perceiving the stimulus consciously. OK. One challenge for uh

109
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.760
For distinguished conscious perception for unconscious perception is, uh,

110
00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:43.869
is because there are many. Percepto states we have

111
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.829
that we are perceiving unconsciously. So how can we

112
00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:51.790
disambiguate when you're perceiving consciously a stimulus and when

113
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.269
you perceive unconsciously the stimulus. So behavioral indication in

114
00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:00.790
this sense might be limited because uh as we

115
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.309
cannot ask infants if they are actually perceiving consciously

116
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.910
or unconsciously because they, they cannot give us those

117
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.739
uh Those uh answers. Maybe sometimes behavior uh response

118
00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.510
might be something confusing, might not be completely clear

119
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.029
for us if the stimulus has been perceived consciously

120
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:26.410
or unconsciously. So usually we combine. Behavioral response with

121
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.190
uh neuro correlates of conscious, that means the, the

122
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.029
way our brain responds to situations of surprise and

123
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.940
situations where I regain interest or regain curiosity um

124
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:45.230
in the cases I was habituated with certain stims.

125
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.660
Mhm.

126
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.179
And our self-knowledge and the development of a first

127
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.890
person perspective related to consciousness?

128
00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:00.329
Um, Yes, this, uh, this is a, a very

129
00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:05.429
good question. So, uh, So for certain uh theories

130
00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:11.670
of consciousness, uh, the, the, the perspective of this

131
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.220
first person perspective of yourself is part of uh

132
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.869
the conscious experiences. So some, uh, some fears of

133
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:27.220
consciousness postulate. THAT uh the, our experience of consciousness

134
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.359
is related to some type of perspective we have

135
00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:35.510
uh related to the environment. So I, I only

136
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.900
perceive the environment from my perspective, from my own

137
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.539
self-perspective, and in this case, I can use my,

138
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.450
uh, my perception to actually perceive my own, uh,

139
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.530
uh, have some knowledge of my own state, OK.

140
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.119
But not all theories of consciousness think that experience

141
00:08:56.119 --> 00:09:00.719
of conscious always rela uh requires self-knowledge. So I

142
00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:04.520
just want to make a distinction before uh go

143
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.690
ahead to say a little bit about self-knowledge. So,

144
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.380
uh, so self-knowledge is the knowledge of our own

145
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.210
minds and not the knowledge of our own stages.

146
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.619
OK. So if I'm conscious of, I don't know,

147
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.419
I'm seeing uh in the screen, your image, I'm

148
00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:23.619
conscious of uh Ricardo's images in the, in the.

149
00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:27.854
I can assess my internal states, I can have

150
00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:31.094
some introspective access to my own state, and I

151
00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:34.965
can have this introspective access directly. For instance, you,

152
00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:38.155
Ricardo cannot know what I'm thinking now, but I

153
00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:42.159
can have access of what I'm thinking. So, one

154
00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:46.159
idea is that self-knowledge is something that might develop

155
00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:52.799
later. I might 11 framework might understand uh the

156
00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:56.030
early stages is I might, I might be born

157
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:03.369
with conscious experience of my, my body, the environment,

158
00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:07.559
uh, and conscious uh uh experience of my internal

159
00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:12.500
state. But self-knowledge means knowledge of my mind. It,

160
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.940
it might come later in the sense that I

161
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.890
might need some uh cognitive development to be capable

162
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.419
to start reading my own mind, OK. When, how

163
00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:27.739
does this might develop? So one idea is that

164
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.900
Our more primitive idea of self-knowledge is how we

165
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.570
very early uh start monitoring our own states, OK,

166
00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:42.789
some sort of internal monitoring uh that gives me

167
00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:47.510
some sort of confidence on uh my perceptual states.

168
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.359
And from this, when I acquire language, I acquire

169
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:55.719
this inner dialogue that is knowledge of my own

170
00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:59.520
mind, but knowledge together with some sort of language.

171
00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:03.080
But this might be something that comes later when

172
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.609
infants acquire language. In the early stages might be

173
00:11:06.609 --> 00:11:10.330
just a sort of capacity of monitoring your, your

174
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.080
own stages, maybe later uh our own internal stages,

175
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.289
maybe later you develop the capacity to conceptualize or

176
00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:22.559
create some, some, some sort of concepts about yourself.

177
00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:27.690
So one classic indication of self-knowledge that comes with

178
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.090
an external behavior is the classic neural, self neural

179
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:37.630
recognition. When, uh, around 1 year and a half,

180
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.429
infants start to be capable to see the image

181
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:47.070
of themselves and that image be recognized by them

182
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.020
as an image of themselves. So the classic test

183
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.250
for this is the mirror test. You put some

184
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.140
uh some mark in the, the front half of

185
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.099
a child and you, the child see their image

186
00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:03.140
in the mirror. And if the child try to

187
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.010
remove the mark, it's because they uh recognize that

188
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.650
that mirror, that image in the mirror is the

189
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.739
image of themselves. It's a representation of themselves, OK.

190
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.950
So this would be like the classics of knowledge,

191
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.630
but for this, uh, uh, it, uh, it, we

192
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.219
have already like more than a year of development.

193
00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:29.270
So probably consciousness of our state, uh of our

194
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.840
state, uh uh of our perceptual consciousness or sensorial

195
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.469
consciousness is something that might uh evolve earlier in

196
00:12:37.469 --> 00:12:42.109
first than the capacity to have knowledge of our

197
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:42.719
own state.

198
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.570
Mhm. So you've also done work on moral development.

199
00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:51.739
So is morality determined by the brain in any

200
00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:51.969
way?

201
00:12:53.419 --> 00:13:00.340
Uh, Yes, so, um, So I think, I think

202
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.869
the way we, uh, the way we uh pro

203
00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:08.109
process our moral reasoning, I think is related to

204
00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:12.190
the uh the way our brain is, uh, Is

205
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.590
wired, shaped by evolution. It doesn't mean that moral

206
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.599
values are determined by the brain, OK, moral values

207
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:27.140
are collectively constructed uh by uh the society. So

208
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.650
our brain does not tell us uh whether something

209
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.940
is right or wrong, but probably we use our

210
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.099
brain to uh to moral reasoning and we use

211
00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:44.219
our emotions to make decisions, uh, moral decisions regarding

212
00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:49.010
what is right or wrong, uh, to do. So,

213
00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:52.729
um, so one way to think about this is,

214
00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:57.809
um, So probably we have one area of our

215
00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:02.729
brain that is uh related to the way we

216
00:14:02.729 --> 00:14:09.010
uh we react emotionally to certain uh violations of

217
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.090
or situations where we think there are some moral

218
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.840
violations and those emotions might indicate for us what

219
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.700
is Uh, might create some sort of reactive attitudes

220
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.020
if that, uh, that action is right or wrong,

221
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.409
OK. At the same time, we develop with language

222
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.380
and, uh, socialization, uh, we internalize certain kind of

223
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.039
moral rules that we learn collectively. Uh, AND those

224
00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:42.359
moral rules might be part of the type of

225
00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:45.479
reasoning, uh, we can make, and we can also

226
00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:48.640
use others of our brain that are related to

227
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.799
more abstract reasoning to think about some rules. So,

228
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.570
uh, you, we might, we might use our emotions

229
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.650
to react when you see someone suffering, OK? And

230
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.450
then later on in development, I might develop some

231
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.929
internalization of making someone's suffering is wrong. Then I

232
00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:13.049
might use this as a more reasoning, in many

233
00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:18.169
cases, many other cases to reasoning. OK. Uh, BUT

234
00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:21.250
what makes someone suffer or not is not determined

235
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.530
by our brain. What makes someone suffering or not

236
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.650
is a term by other, uh, uh, things related

237
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.020
to well-being of creatures. Uh, AND, uh, about some,

238
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.820
some sort of, of more rules we learn socially.

239
00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:42.190
Mhm. Could you tell us about cognitive and emotional

240
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.989
processes like empathy, being able to identify with another's

241
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:52.479
perspective, and then what stimulation as processes that participate

242
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.580
in moral development.

243
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:03.580
Um, YEAH, I think empathy is, um, A capacity

244
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.309
we have that probably emerged with uh the species

245
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:14.489
evolution uh that gives us some guidance uh to,

246
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.619
to help us to read some, some context, to

247
00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:22.049
read some situations and to evaluate and use our

248
00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:27.690
uh empathic emotions to reasoning whether some situations are,

249
00:16:27.729 --> 00:16:32.640
are, um. ARE morally right or morally wrong or,

250
00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:41.020
or good and bad. OK. Um So one That's

251
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.570
sad, empathy has um many many limitations and many

252
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.409
bias that have been, been described in the literature

253
00:16:48.409 --> 00:16:52.729
by many uh many philosophers, but I still think

254
00:16:52.729 --> 00:16:55.960
that uh it's uh a natural capacity we have

255
00:16:56.369 --> 00:17:00.849
to, uh, to be capable to access uh other

256
00:17:00.849 --> 00:17:03.770
minds and understand what type of reactions you might

257
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.319
have. So, uh, we can use empathy uh in

258
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.319
social cognition. So if I want to understand the

259
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.900
intentions you have when you, when you're acting, I

260
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.239
might simulate your, uh, your actions in my own

261
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.358
mind to understand what type of intentions you might

262
00:17:23.358 --> 00:17:27.829
have, performing X and Y actions. OK, so I

263
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.680
don't know if you are trying to communicate or

264
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.599
make some uh uh some signal to me with

265
00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:36.599
your hands, I might try to understand what Ricardo

266
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:40.069
has in, in his mind, he's trying to, uh,

267
00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.280
to say something to me or not. So I

268
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.430
might to use my understand of, of, of other

269
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.359
minds to try to understand your, your behavior. So

270
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:53.400
in the empathy case, uh, what is relevant to

271
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.520
the type of emotions I might, uh, uh, be

272
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.739
able to imagine that you have when you perform

273
00:18:00.739 --> 00:18:05.869
some actions, OK. So, uh, so we, we use,

274
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.359
we can use empathy in social cognition, you can

275
00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:12.310
use in moral reasoning. So I see some, some,

276
00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:16.359
uh, some circumstance, some action or some contacts where

277
00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:19.780
someone Um, I don't know, perhaps they are beginning

278
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.859
to violate it, OK? And the type of emotions

279
00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:27.579
I feel that is a reaction to that situation.

280
00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:33.099
Uh, CAN be practically coupled with the type of

281
00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:36.709
uh emotions that person is undergoing, OK. I might

282
00:18:36.709 --> 00:18:41.430
feel, uh, uh, some indignity because someone has been

283
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.750
disrespected. I might feel sad, I might feel array

284
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.430
with some, uh, uh, anger, and this reactive, uh

285
00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:55.459
uh uh emotions uh. It's part of this is

286
00:18:55.459 --> 00:18:59.800
empatic feelings that reveals to me what that person

287
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.420
is feeling in that situation. And from this, I

288
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.890
might, it might help me to uh to arrive

289
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.459
at some sort of moral judgment of what the

290
00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:15.829
situation is right or wrong, and And helps also,

291
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:20.550
I think empathy also uh has a motivational component

292
00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:25.229
for you to act uh in, in the behalf

293
00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.900
of the person. Mhm.

294
00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:30.579
So, let me ask you then one last question.

295
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.560
Do you think that empathy can help us being

296
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.119
respectful of people whose communication is impaired and so

297
00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:42.670
we cannot apprehend their point of view as well,

298
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.430
like people with intellectual disabilities?

299
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.579
Uh, YES, I think, uh, empathy can be very

300
00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:55.550
helpful to, uh, to grasp the perspective of others.

301
00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:59.020
So I think empathy is a skill we can

302
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:04.849
train, we can, um, learning how to empathize better

303
00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:10.250
with uh others' perspective. So the, the The case

304
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:15.569
of, of, of people with severe uh learning impairment

305
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.530
or severe cognitive impairment. Uh, IS a challenge for

306
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.849
us because, uh, they are so far away in

307
00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:27.849
terms of communication, OK, so our relationship with someone

308
00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:31.439
with impairment or the severe impairment that didn't develop

309
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.969
language communication is a challenge because it's very hard

310
00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:39.329
to grasp actually what is, what is in the

311
00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:44.790
perspective of that person. So some, uh, some atheists

312
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.540
think that because we cannot, uh, uh, grasp or

313
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.550
identify with their, their positions, it might be hard

314
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.660
for us to know what would be moral, uh,

315
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.989
morally wrong or right to, to do with them.

316
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.660
Uh, SO we would, we not have this type

317
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.819
of identification with that. Uh, I, I think that

318
00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:10.739
empathy can be an ability and skills that can

319
00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:16.989
help us to bridge this gap between, um, What

320
00:21:16.989 --> 00:21:19.780
is the type of mind we have and what,

321
00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:22.630
what, what it's like or what, what it's like

322
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.709
to be a severely impaired person. And once, once

323
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:30.310
we are capable to use our empathic abilities to

324
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:36.250
grasp what type of um Reactions they are having,

325
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:40.959
understand their minds, uh, this might help us to,

326
00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:46.420
um, to relate with them in a more human,

327
00:21:46.569 --> 00:21:51.010
humanly way. So in my paper on uh empathy

328
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:56.250
and, and, uh, severely impaired people, I discuss a

329
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.910
lot how The fact that we don't understand completely

330
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.579
what's going on in their minds, our tendencies is

331
00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:09.709
to dehumanize them, to see them less humans, less

332
00:22:09.709 --> 00:22:14.380
has less humanization than uh I think we should

333
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.939
uh. We should react to them, we should uh

334
00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:20.609
interact with them. So I think empathy could be

335
00:22:20.609 --> 00:22:24.810
a good guide to uh uh to reestablish some

336
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.760
side, some sort of um humanized relationship with them.

337
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.630
Mhm. Great. So just before we go, where can

338
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.489
people find you and your work on the internet?

339
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.439
Uh, YEAH, I have my, my, uh, uh, institutional

340
00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:49.709
website at NYU, uh, the Center for Bioethics, uh,

341
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.390
is, uh, maybe it's the best way, so it's,

342
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.280
uh, New York University, the Center for Bioethics, and

343
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.719
this is my website there. I can also, I
