00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.469
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.960
today I'm joined by Doctor Erica Cartmill. She's Professor

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.819
of Cognitive Science, anthropology and animal behavior at Indiana

5
00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.370
University. She studies the acquisition and evolution of human

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.684
language. And she is particularly interested in whether gestures

7
00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:23.424
play the role in the origins of human language.

8
00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:26.344
And today we're going to talk a lot about

9
00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:29.995
the evolution of gestures and human language, of course.

10
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.645
So Doctor Cartmill, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:33.685
pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.659
Thank you so much, Ricardo. I really appreciate you

13
00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.740
inviting me on. I'm, I'm very excited to talk

14
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.139
with you and, and all of your listeners.

15
00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:45.180
Great. So let's start with gestures then. And I

16
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.659
guess that since we're doing this from an evolutionary

17
00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:54.709
perspective, mostly, do we know how old are gestures

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.909
from an evolutionary perspective?

19
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.090
Yeah. So it's a great question. I, I mean,

20
00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:03.479
I, I think it's a little bit, it's a

21
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.589
little bit tricky to answer because we see gestures

22
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.129
a widely across the animal kingdom. So, you know,

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160
I think in terms of a type of communication,

24
00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:17.199
it's kind of like asking how old is vocalization,

25
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:21.800
right? Lots of animals vocalize dogs, bark, crows, caw,

26
00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.900
et cetera, et cetera. Um All of those involve

27
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.050
vibrations of the vocal chords and similarly, um lots

28
00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:31.839
of different animal species use their bodies to communicate,

29
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.050
right. So birds will, will raise wings sometimes in

30
00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:38.809
elaborate displays. Um Some, you know, blue footed boobies,

31
00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.000
like the ones in the Galapagos Island will raise

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.370
1 ft at a time in a little dance

33
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.040
to sort of show off my foot, show off

34
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.230
my other foot. You could call those gestures. They're

35
00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.669
bodily movements that communicate with other um with other

36
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.819
animals. However, the things that, that humans and other

37
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.120
apes are doing seem to go one step beyond

38
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:03.300
that. So we're using our hands in, in our,

39
00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:05.650
our arms and to some extent also our, our

40
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.660
bodies and our faces to, to communicate in very

41
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.960
flexible, very intentional ways. And I know we'll get

42
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.429
into that in a little bit later. I just

43
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.000
wanted to sort of say that like in terms

44
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.929
of bodily communication, that's something that you see everywhere.

45
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.690
Um When we talk specifically about the origin of

46
00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.889
human, of human language and human gestures, that's where

47
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.279
we wanted to think about. What do we see

48
00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.539
in the other great apes. Humans are a great

49
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.800
ape. We also have chimpanzees and bonobos and gorillas

50
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.690
and, and orangutans. And um and all of those

51
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.759
species also use gesture and they gesture in ways

52
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.149
that are very similar in some important ways to

53
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.009
humans. I know we're gonna talk more about that.

54
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.490
So I don't want to sort of give everything

55
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.339
away at the start, but that humanlike gesture, the

56
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.130
sort of roots of humanlike gesture, I think are

57
00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.809
at least 12 or 13 million years old because

58
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.470
that's how, um that's how long ago the lineage

59
00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.960
that, that resulted in modern orangutans um diverged from

60
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.369
the lineage that resulted in modern humans. And so,

61
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.320
since we see something, since we see these same

62
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.059
qualities of gesture across all of the great apes,

63
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.070
we can, we can infer that our last common

64
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.679
ancestor also had those same properties of gesture.

65
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.149
So we're focusing here mostly on great apes, right?

66
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.229
That's

67
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.089
orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, monin,

68
00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.429
right? Yeah. So, so that's what my work focuses

69
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.839
on. There are people who, who study gesture and

70
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.860
other animals. And I think it's a really interesting

71
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:48.429
question of, you know, are their gestures different from

72
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.559
the gestures we see in, in great apes and

73
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.720
in humans. Um I, I think I can speak

74
00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.600
sort of from an expert perspective um about the

75
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.250
great apes. I'm a little, I, I can sort

76
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.979
of, you know, maybe be a li a sort

77
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.059
of a general consumer like plus a little bit

78
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.220
if we're talking about gestures in, you know, birds

79
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.800
and fish.

80
00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.259
No, but one of the aspects that you mentioned

81
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.010
there that I find very interesting. Uh AND that

82
00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.500
is, it's basically an important clarification is the fact

83
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.239
that animals can actually gesture with different parts of

84
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.829
their bodies and not just the arms, the hands

85
00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:32.089
or the fingers. Because when we colloquially talk about

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.649
gestures, I guess that what people are usually thinking

87
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.980
about is what you do mainly with your hands.

88
00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:39.380
Right.

89
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.589
Absolutely. Yeah. So I think, you know, when we're

90
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.959
talking about human gesture, people are, are typically thinking

91
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.980
about the hands. Um, YOU know, even, and even

92
00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.160
gesture researchers who, you know, sort of think broadly

93
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.079
about gesture. If you, you know, are designing a

94
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:55.579
logo for a gesture conference or a gesture lab,

95
00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:57.480
it's always hands, right? I mean, we're like hands,

96
00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:59.625
hands, hands, we make a lot of and jokes,

97
00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:00.875
you know, oh let me go out on a

98
00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:03.394
limb or hand it to you or, right. So,

99
00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:05.484
you know, like, oh there was the evidence points

100
00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:07.184
to this, right? I mean, we, there are a

101
00:05:07.195 --> 00:05:12.204
lot of hand jokes. Um BUT uh but you

102
00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.825
uh humans are also gesture with, with all different

103
00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:18.269
parts of their body. So you think about and

104
00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.149
if I'm holding a cup of coffee and you

105
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.089
ask me where something is. Um YOU know, if,

106
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.130
if I'm holding something, I might use my head

107
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.000
to, to suggest where it is, I'll be like,

108
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.380
oh, it's, you know, it's over there. I might

109
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.420
use my chin to point, I might use my

110
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:35.980
head to tilt, might use my elbow. Um There

111
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:38.489
are also some beautiful work that shows that people

112
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.239
with limb differences say you're, you're born missing arms

113
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.679
or you had an accident. Um People will use

114
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.600
their, you know, can use their feet in ways

115
00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:49.559
that are very similar to their hands. And so

116
00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.809
I think that the spontaneous sort of most like

117
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.250
first point of articulation, the plan A, I guess

118
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.049
when it comes to human gesture is to use

119
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.290
your hands. But um, gesture, I think is not

120
00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:06.119
something that's limited to the hands. I think gesture

121
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.500
is, you know, is a compulsion. It's something that

122
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.720
we want to do, we want to communicate with

123
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.519
our bodies. And if your hands aren't available, you'll

124
00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:15.809
use other parts of your body.

125
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.880
So let's perhaps take just a small step back.

126
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.190
Uh JUST for me to ask you an even

127
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.260
more basic question. So what are gestures, then what

128
00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.399
counts as a gesture? Exactly, because it's not just

129
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.359
moving one of your limbs or your body in

130
00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.290
a particular way? Right. I mean, I, it entails

131
00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.059
some sort of communication at least.

132
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.040
Right. Absolutely. And I think this is where actually

133
00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.769
people who study humans and people who study nonhuman,

134
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.230
great apes uh tend to have slightly different definitions.

135
00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:59.890
And I think that's just because it's harder when

136
00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.390
you're studying an animal of a different species, it's

137
00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.730
harder to, to make inferences about um their behavior.

138
00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:10.630
It's harder to understand it in a way you're

139
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.070
on the outside looking in, right? And so when

140
00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:16.929
you see another human communicating, um you, you have

141
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.239
stronger intuitions about what they're doing. And um and

142
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.989
oftentimes that's good sometimes you have to like, check

143
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.149
your intuitions and say maybe they're doing something else,

144
00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:29.869
but often, often we use those intuitions as scientists

145
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.790
um to sort of start our, our inquiry. Um

146
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.459
So this is just a point where sort of

147
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.010
my two hats because I work on, on, you

148
00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.950
know, gesture and great apes, but also gesture in

149
00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.799
humans. And so I have to sort of say

150
00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:44.700
like, well, which hat am I wearing right now?

151
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.920
We're also a great tape. Right.

152
00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:50.329
Right. And, and, and yes, thank you for, thank

153
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.470
you for bringing that up because I, I certainly,

154
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.119
I use the term great apes to mean nonhuman,

155
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.299
great apes actually. Yeah, just, just because, you know,

156
00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:02.299
it gets a little wordy is a mouthful. Um

157
00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:05.890
But that's absolutely right. And really important to emphasize,

158
00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:08.690
humans are a great ape. And, you know, that's

159
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.820
why it's not surprising when we see commonalities between

160
00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.670
us and other great apes. But in a way

161
00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:17.170
we're also the most distinctive great ape. You know,

162
00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:19.799
we have, we sort of have what other apes

163
00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:22.029
have, but then we have a bunch of other

164
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.149
weird stuff on top of that. Um And so

165
00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:27.480
when, so just to come back to your question

166
00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:30.250
about what defines a gesture, you know, if you're,

167
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.630
um I would say there's broad sort of broad

168
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.440
agreement about kind of a an area of things.

169
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.549
But then specific definitions really differ from study to

170
00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:44.890
study. So for example, some people, some human gesture

171
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.599
researchers define gesture as movements of the hand and

172
00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:53.390
arm um that are used in communication with other,

173
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.789
with other people. So they occur during conversation during

174
00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:00.450
you know, interaction, they're communicative in nature and their

175
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.169
movements of the hand and arm. Other people expand

176
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.919
that to include the upper body. Other people, you

177
00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.669
know, other people might only use the hands and

178
00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:13.929
arm and face. Other people include any part of

179
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.239
the body as long as it's used in a

180
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.809
communicative manner um with another person. And so, um

181
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.429
but not all gesture happens during communication. And so

182
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.270
that's where it gets tricky because I think what

183
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.099
started as something as a topic for people to

184
00:09:32.109 --> 00:09:35.739
study um this additional part of communication, it's not

185
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.869
just speech, it's also we're doing all these things

186
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.419
with our bodies. How does that communicate? Why are

187
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:42.780
we doing it? Um You know, does it have

188
00:09:42.789 --> 00:09:45.940
specific forms? Does it vary culturally? All of these

189
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.780
things are very rich um questions that people have,

190
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:52.719
have tackled about gesture. But sort of once people

191
00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:55.719
started studying gesture, you realize it doesn't always happen

192
00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:58.270
in conversation. You know, if you're thinking through a

193
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:04.090
complicated math problem, you will sometimes use your hands

194
00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:07.840
to visualize things for yourself. So gesture can also

195
00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:10.000
be things that you're, and it isn't just math.

196
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.039
I mean, if you're thinking about, you know, I'm

197
00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.950
sure any of your, any of your viewers, if

198
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.539
they're like, OK, I'm gonna close my eyes and

199
00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.289
I'm gonna think about how I get from, you

200
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:22.890
know, my house to my office or my house

201
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.989
to my school. Right. And it's like, ok, I'm

202
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.320
gonna go here, I'm gonna turn, you know, there's

203
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.289
this intersection or in your gestures might be small.

204
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.820
Um They're, they're not showy, they're not, you know,

205
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.729
trying to reach someone in the distance. But nevertheless,

206
00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:38.460
the, the things that you do with your hands

207
00:10:38.469 --> 00:10:41.890
can really help your recall, they can help your

208
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.739
memory, they can help, um you know, they can

209
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.890
help you externalize things in the same way that

210
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.510
if, if you were writing something on a piece

211
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.650
of paper. And so, you know, so yes, gestures

212
00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:55.130
are communicative, but at least in humans, they don't

213
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.369
have to be. Um And so in human gesture

214
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.409
research, there's a really interesting divide between talking about

215
00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:05.210
gestures as communication and gestures as cognition. And so

216
00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:09.159
even when you're communicating with another person, um a

217
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:13.130
lot of the gestures that speakers are doing are

218
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.630
helping them talk. And so they're actually, there's really

219
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.690
interesting work where if I realize I've sort of

220
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.260
gone off on a tangent, I apologize. I will

221
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.000
finish up soon. I promise him. But

222
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.909
you're giving away some of our late later. Oh,

223
00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:25.979
no,

224
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:26.059
no,

225
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.020
I'll stop. Um Anyway, I will try to, I'll

226
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.369
try to limit myself to the questions you ask.

227
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.489
I just get excited. And um and then, you

228
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.340
know, I'm like, I'm like, oh, I'm gesturing that

229
00:11:40.349 --> 00:11:42.570
reminds me of something else. Um All right, I,

230
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.289
I will limit myself. But um but to, to

231
00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:47.150
answer to come back to your actual question you

232
00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.969
asked about what is a gesture? I think it

233
00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:53.250
really depends on whether you're studying human gesture or

234
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.270
you're studying ape gesture. Um Human gesture allows for

235
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.320
the possibility that gestures can be for the person

236
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.770
who is gesturing, right? That like it's helping me

237
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.369
think it's helping me reason, it's helping me talk.

238
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.200
Um It's also helping you understand. But a lot

239
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.119
of the things that I'm doing with my hands

240
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.020
are for me, not just for you with apes.

241
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.219
We, we don't sort of allow that possibility and,

242
00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:24.460
and that's because we can't, we can't study those

243
00:12:24.469 --> 00:12:26.690
or it's, it's not that we can't, it's very

244
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.260
difficult to ask those questions about whether gestures are

245
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.200
helping apes. Um THINK it's much easier to ask,

246
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.200
still difficult, but it's much easier to ask whether

247
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.739
um gestures are helping apes communicate with others. So

248
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.530
with ape gesture, we're looking at a really a

249
00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:46.960
small subset of all of the things they do

250
00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:49.520
with their hands. So they have to be and

251
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.099
we'll come, I, I will not jump ahead, but

252
00:12:52.109 --> 00:12:55.679
we're looking for intentional movements that are done to

253
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.729
communicate with another individual. So if you, if I

254
00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:02.739
produce a movement and, you know, maybe I'm waving

255
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.010
my hand and I'm doing it to you in,

256
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.510
in an interaction, say a greeting. Um You don't

257
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.140
see this in apes, but I'm just giving a

258
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.369
human example. Um uh I mean, you do see

259
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.630
it but not as a greeting in this way.

260
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.159
Sorry. It's too many things anyway, if I, if

261
00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:20.830
I do something it's directed towards you and then

262
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.150
I do the movement on my own later on

263
00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:26.270
as a gesture, researchers studying apes, we don't include

264
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.150
that in our data because we're not confident that

265
00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:32.750
it's intending to communicate with another individual, a human

266
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.429
researcher would definitely include it.

267
00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.820
So just to clarify one aspect here, since we're

268
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.270
addressing these from an evolutionary perspective, and I guess

269
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.710
that phylogenetic speaking, these would be relevant. So when

270
00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:50.650
you talk about human gestures, are you referring exclusively

271
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:53.590
to Homo sapiens or also to the rest of

272
00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:57.474
the homogenous? And if so, are you interested in

273
00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:01.744
other Monin and even Omid that came prior to

274
00:14:01.895 --> 00:14:06.684
uh the homogenous? I mean, from Homo Erectus forward

275
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:07.255
or not?

276
00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:11.934
Yeah. Um That's a, that's a great question. I,

277
00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:16.700
I mean, I'm certainly interested uh it's, it's very

278
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.820
hard to say what are, are, you know, earlier

279
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.669
ancestors in the human lineage did. Um I'm specifically

280
00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:32.380
talking about modern humans about Homo sapiens. Um It's

281
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.539
very possible and I would say likely that some

282
00:14:35.549 --> 00:14:38.619
of the features that are unique to human gesture

283
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.989
today were also present um in earlier Homo species.

284
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.780
But um you know, that they evolved after uh

285
00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:50.599
that the, you know, the lineage that, that evolved

286
00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:54.400
into humans split from um from the lineages that,

287
00:14:54.409 --> 00:14:58.729
that evolved into um the other great apes. However,

288
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.830
it's very hard to, to date when those changes

289
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.500
might have occurred. So, um I think that that

290
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.099
there are certainly features of gesture that sorry, they're

291
00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:17.809
features of human gesture that I think could not

292
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.580
have been possible until humans had a much more

293
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:28.010
um representational sort of illustrative mind. And I think

294
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.640
that there's evidence for that kind of mind in

295
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.599
cave art in, you know, early carvings. And you

296
00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:38.369
know, the things that we typically think may be

297
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.919
markers of language, those are certainly, I think also

298
00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:44.840
markers of the kind of complicated gestures you see

299
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:48.159
today. Um The hard thing is saying how much

300
00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:52.080
earlier would humanlike gesture have evolved?

301
00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:55.729
Yeah, I guess that the uh what you just

302
00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:58.849
mentioned that already points to another aspect that we

303
00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:01.729
might come back to later on in our conversation.

304
00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:05.530
But uh there is the fact that the gestures

305
00:16:05.539 --> 00:16:09.309
we use uh do not depend exclusively on the

306
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.210
kinds of things that you ana anatomy allows you

307
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:15.809
to do. I mean the kinds of movements that

308
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.030
we can do with our fingers, hands and so

309
00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:22.419
on, but also with our own cognition, right? I

310
00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:26.510
mean, perhaps there are gestures that we, that we

311
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.460
can do because we can cognitively process specific kinds

312
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:35.909
of information. And perhaps if other animals would have

313
00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:39.809
hands like ours, maybe they wouldn't produce the same

314
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.669
gestures due to some cognitive limitations. Is that it?

315
00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:47.849
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, and I think, um, do

316
00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:49.010
you want me to answer that now, or do

317
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.919
you want to come back to that?

318
00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:52.919
No, no answer that now. Yes. And then it

319
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.109
will have other implications for some other things we

320
00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:57.380
might talk about later.

321
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.239
Yeah. OK, good. I learned my lesson though. Um

322
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.108
So, you know, so I think that that one

323
00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:09.400
of the reasons that that ape gesture is such

324
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.079
an interesting topic. I mean, I think it's many

325
00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.839
reasons, it's an interesting topic. But one of the

326
00:17:13.848 --> 00:17:17.858
reasons is that ape gestural communication, it seems to

327
00:17:17.868 --> 00:17:20.469
be much closer to human commu to human gesture

328
00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:24.839
than ape vocalization is to human speech. And you

329
00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:28.949
know, and in experiments very far away from what

330
00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:30.719
apes are doing naturally. But you know, if you

331
00:17:30.729 --> 00:17:35.300
take a chimpanzee and you raise them in close

332
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.310
contact with humans and you try to teach them

333
00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:40.180
speech and you try to teach them um you

334
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:44.109
know, uh a manual communication system like a modified

335
00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:46.729
version of American sign language, they'll learn a lot

336
00:17:46.739 --> 00:17:48.989
of the sign language, they won't learn the speech.

337
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.189
And that is really a physiological limitation, right? That

338
00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:55.155
we know that their minds can acquire symbols, they

339
00:17:55.165 --> 00:17:59.574
can acquire keyboard symbols, they can acquire manual symbols.

340
00:17:59.584 --> 00:18:03.604
Um BUT they have limitations in their vocal learning,

341
00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:06.214
right? Apes are not vocal learners. Humans are really

342
00:18:06.224 --> 00:18:09.545
the only primate that, that, you know, has vocal

343
00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.935
learning um where we can hear a new word

344
00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:16.020
and pronounce it immediately. Um Apes can do that

345
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.300
with their, with their hands and their hands are

346
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.219
remarkably similar to humans. You know, if you see

347
00:18:21.229 --> 00:18:23.469
a picture of a, of a Bonobo hand or

348
00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.780
orangutan hand and a human hand, they're, I mean,

349
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.939
they're a little bit weird parts get stretched or

350
00:18:27.949 --> 00:18:32.489
squished, but they're very similar. And, um, and yes,

351
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.839
humans have greater, um, greater control, greater dexterity over

352
00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:42.199
their hands. But they move in largely similar ways.

353
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.459
And so, you know, apes can learn something like

354
00:18:45.469 --> 00:18:47.640
American sign language. They do it in a kind

355
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.680
of, you know, in a not fully, uh sort

356
00:18:51.689 --> 00:18:55.000
of, you know, articulated way. It would be like,

357
00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:57.420
you know, if you had a speech impediment and

358
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.069
you were learning English or Portuguese

359
00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:01.339
in the fluent way, then

360
00:19:01.989 --> 00:19:03.719
what? Right. So, I just mean in terms of

361
00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:06.619
their like pronunciation, you know, if they're doing, um

362
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.140
if they're doing a sign, um you know, like,

363
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:14.579
uh you know, like girl, right? They might do,

364
00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:17.579
instead of extending the thumb and dragging it down,

365
00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:20.189
they might just do their, their whole hand like

366
00:19:20.199 --> 00:19:22.589
this, right? And so they, and so that the

367
00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:26.589
sort of articulation, especially of like different fingers in

368
00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:34.469
specific ways is sloppy basically. Um But they're still

369
00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:37.479
able to learn and produce sign. So it's not,

370
00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:41.410
it's not that the, the manual limit the, the

371
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.469
physiological limitations of the hand are not what's preventing

372
00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:48.959
them from learning fluent sign language. Um It's what's

373
00:19:48.969 --> 00:19:53.010
preventing them from pronouncing the signs correctly. But you

374
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.430
can be a fluent speaker who, you know, who

375
00:19:55.439 --> 00:19:58.880
has a pronounced lisp, for example, and if apes

376
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.599
had humanlike minds, they could do that right. They

377
00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:04.930
could, they could be fluent signers who, you know,

378
00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:10.175
just had had pronunciation difficulties. But nevertheless, they were

379
00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:13.295
putting together, you know, sentences and telling stories, they're

380
00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:16.464
not doing that. So, so yes, there, there are

381
00:20:16.474 --> 00:20:21.285
some physiological limitations in terms of how exactly precise

382
00:20:21.295 --> 00:20:24.824
the movements can be. But I think it's really

383
00:20:24.834 --> 00:20:30.420
the cognitive limitations um that are, are preventing them

384
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.790
from, from using a, a full form of human

385
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.819
language with all of the complex grammars. Um AND,

386
00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:42.459
and even, you know, the, the kind of desires

387
00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:45.500
to communicate certain things, you know, to tell stories

388
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.150
to, to tell jokes. Um THESE are, are things

389
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.569
that, that humans do everywhere in the world, no

390
00:20:51.579 --> 00:20:54.650
matter what language you speak. Um YOU know, no

391
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.109
matter sort of sort of one, once you get

392
00:20:58.119 --> 00:21:01.250
to, to be sort of close to adult, like

393
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.349
the question that I'm really interested in is like,

394
00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:06.270
what do very young Children do? Because they they

395
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.310
aren't yet fluent speakers. And so can we see

396
00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:13.650
some of those um those urges, those communicative urges.

397
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.439
Do kid, do you know, two year olds want

398
00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:18.805
to tell stories? Because apes, even when they get

399
00:21:18.814 --> 00:21:22.135
the, the, even when they acquire the communication system

400
00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:24.045
of a two year old don't want to tell

401
00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.185
stories in the same way. And so I think

402
00:21:26.194 --> 00:21:29.064
that's a really interesting question that's fundamentally more about

403
00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:33.035
cognition than it is about uh you know, about

404
00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:34.584
physiology or biology.

405
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.300
So another question now, how do we know whether

406
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.079
ape gestures are intentional or not?

407
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.310
Yeah. So the Ape Chester community um starting starting

408
00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:56.229
with Mike Tomasello and Joseph call borrowed and then

409
00:21:56.239 --> 00:22:00.849
modified a set of criteria from um from researchers

410
00:22:00.859 --> 00:22:05.109
who were studying very young human infants because you

411
00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:07.229
can ask the same question about young human infants.

412
00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:11.140
You know, if a baby goes, ah, how do

413
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.430
you know that like are those movements meaningful? Are

414
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:16.979
they trying to tell you something or are they

415
00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:21.000
just, you know, gassy or uncomfortable or something? And

416
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.270
so, you know, uh in looking at, at any,

417
00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:29.729
any being, including young Children where you can't ask

418
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.869
them what they mean. Um You have to try

419
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.939
to figure out other ways of, of measuring um

420
00:22:36.949 --> 00:22:41.670
their, their intentions. Um And so, so this set

421
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.969
of criteria, at least the, the modified version that,

422
00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:47.219
that we've adapted. I, I could myself in, in

423
00:22:47.229 --> 00:22:49.140
the wii although I was not part of those

424
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.380
original studies. Um WE, the gestural community have, have

425
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.589
adapted for apes is um that we look for

426
00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:01.010
meaning, we look for movements that are um first

427
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.770
we call non effective. And so that means that

428
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.189
the movement doesn't um doesn't achieve its own goal.

429
00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:10.599
So if I want someone to move away, if

430
00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:13.859
I shove them, it's not a gesture, it's an

431
00:23:13.869 --> 00:23:16.189
action, I'm pushing them out of my way. But

432
00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:18.599
if I tap them or I poke them or

433
00:23:18.609 --> 00:23:21.739
I like, you know, touch them gently, um then

434
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.589
that would be something that is, you know, where

435
00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:28.650
the movement is communicative rather than um you know,

436
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.410
where it's, it's communicating my goal rather than doing

437
00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.619
the goal directly. Um So first, they have to

438
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.479
be non effective. Um They also need to be

439
00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:43.140
directed towards another individual and I already talked a

440
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.250
little bit about that, right? That ape gestures, we

441
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.050
really only look at things that are communicating to

442
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.469
another individual rather than things that I might do

443
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:56.729
by myself. And that's where it differs from human

444
00:23:56.739 --> 00:24:02.609
gesture. So um no effective um directed. And then

445
00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:07.130
we start to look for evidence that the, the

446
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.260
ape has a goal in mind in their communication.

447
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.599
And so we do that in a couple of

448
00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:17.810
different ways. We um we look for um for

449
00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:22.489
evidence that um that when there isn't a response,

450
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.989
the ape continues their communication. So we look for

451
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.869
persistence. So if I do something, you know, say

452
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.410
I want you to move and I poke you

453
00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.099
and you don't acknowledge me. Do I persist in

454
00:24:34.109 --> 00:24:37.290
communicating? Right. That's good evidence that you have a

455
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.300
communicative goal or the ape has a communicative goal

456
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.939
and the, and it hasn't yet been met. Right.

457
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:46.170
So I keep doing stuff. Um The, the interesting

458
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.920
part I think is, you know, it is not

459
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.209
about, do I keep communicating. Um Right. I mean,

460
00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:56.219
my dog keeps communicating a lot when there's, you

461
00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:58.609
know, the mail person is delivering mail, but she

462
00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:00.319
just does it in the same way over and

463
00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:03.910
over and over and over and over and, and

464
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.930
I'm like, shut up. Ok. She's lovely. I love

465
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.579
her so much. She's the light of my life.

466
00:25:08.589 --> 00:25:11.939
Um But, uh, but she's, you know, kind of

467
00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:14.420
doing this that she's like, look, look, look, look,

468
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.010
look, look and what is what we're trying to

469
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.180
look for in apes is that they're not just

470
00:25:20.189 --> 00:25:22.709
repeating the same thing over and over, but that

471
00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:28.300
they're also elaborating, um, or, or, um, or exaggerating

472
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.599
or changing their signal. Right. So if, if I

473
00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:33.500
want you to move and I poke you and

474
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.579
you don't move, I might poke you again, repetition,

475
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.300
but then I might change to something else. So,

476
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.180
you know, I might like tap you to get

477
00:25:41.189 --> 00:25:45.530
your attention or I might like, you know, vocalize

478
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.060
as well or I might move if you're not

479
00:25:48.069 --> 00:25:50.000
looking, I might move around in front of you

480
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.030
and then do something I might try pulling you,

481
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.280
I might lean on you and then tap you

482
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.400
and, and kind of throw other things into the

483
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.790
mix. So we look for evidence of elaboration of

484
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.979
persistence and elaboration. And then um in that example,

485
00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:04.900
I just gave where I might move around in

486
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.589
front. That's another thing that we look for is

487
00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:11.920
is sensitivity to the signal being received or being

488
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.939
able to be received. So again, we do this

489
00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:16.800
in a couple of different ways. One is we

490
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.619
look for evidence that the apes are using um

491
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:26.510
potential gestures in modalities that are accessible to, to

492
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.209
the recipient. So if you're, if the recipient is

493
00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:31.459
not looking right, if your back is turned to

494
00:26:31.469 --> 00:26:34.780
me, I am not going to come up behind

495
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.069
you and go shoe, right? Um You can't see

496
00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:42.380
me. Uh So if you're looking, I might do

497
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.000
a shoe gesture, but if you're not looking, I'm

498
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.040
either gonna use AAA vocalization, which we don't count

499
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.410
as a gesture or I could use what we

500
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.800
call an auditory gesture. So I could clap or

501
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.550
I could, you know, tap um you know, the

502
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.589
thing you're sitting on or, or something else. Um

503
00:26:59.089 --> 00:27:01.969
OR I use a tactile gesture like a poke

504
00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.369
to get your attention or a tap or, you

505
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.729
know, I nudge you. Um And, and when apes

506
00:27:08.739 --> 00:27:12.050
uh when, when apes can't be seen by their

507
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:17.010
recipient, they'll either use tactile or auditory gestures or

508
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.729
they'll often walk around where they can be seen

509
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.959
and then use a visual gesture. So I think

510
00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:24.619
that sensitivity to, to when they can and can't

511
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.709
be seen and adjusting their communication um is another

512
00:27:28.719 --> 00:27:32.030
thing that we use as evidence of um of

513
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.260
intentionality. And then the last thing um is we

514
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.790
also use evidence that apes are expecting a response.

515
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.829
So, um we typically um the, where we used

516
00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:45.969
to describe this as response waiting, it's not like

517
00:27:45.979 --> 00:27:48.959
the most exciting term. But if I produce a

518
00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:52.170
gesture, um you know, say I want you to

519
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.910
give me something and I hold my hand out.

520
00:27:54.469 --> 00:27:57.819
Um IF you don't, you know, I, I will,

521
00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:00.449
I will produce the gesture, but I'll wait. And

522
00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:02.420
so you can do that either by a, with

523
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.910
a movement, final hold so I can produce the

524
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.770
gesture and then hold my hand there and wait

525
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.560
for you to respond or I can gesture and

526
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:14.390
then still stay looking at you and wait for

527
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.160
something to happen. And that's very different from, you

528
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:23.530
know, from going, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, and

529
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.650
not kind of not checking to see if there's

530
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.430
a response. And so, um you know, I think

531
00:28:28.439 --> 00:28:31.239
that the kinds of things that, that um we

532
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.920
see sometimes in the animal kingdom, um oftentimes uh

533
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.589
signals that we call broadcast signals, you know, a,

534
00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.729
a bird goes up on top of a tree

535
00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:41.589
and they're like, I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing,

536
00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:43.650
I'm singing. They're just putting stuff out there. Right?

537
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.359
I mean, it's like tweeting, right? Literally. Um RIGHT

538
00:28:47.369 --> 00:28:49.810
where you're, you're like, I'm putting stuff out there.

539
00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:52.400
Maybe people will hear it, maybe they won't. Um

540
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.780
But you're not, you're not producing a signal and

541
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.810
then waiting, producing a signal and then waiting and,

542
00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.910
and so you do see that sometimes in, in

543
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.920
other kinds of animal signals. So I'm not saying

544
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.390
that's only in gesture, but that's just a, a

545
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.989
piece of the puzzle is that, you know, you're,

546
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.310
you're producing a movement and then you're waiting to

547
00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:13.569
see how the other will respond. And I think

548
00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:16.739
that's again, kind of providing evidence that what they're

549
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.180
doing, the movements that they're doing are um are,

550
00:29:21.189 --> 00:29:23.959
you know, intended to communicate, they have a specific

551
00:29:23.969 --> 00:29:28.010
goal and they're anticipating a particular response.

552
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.989
Well, I don't know about other nonhuman primates or

553
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.670
apes, but I guess that if you repeat a

554
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.709
gesture without waiting for a response, at least in

555
00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:42.839
humans, you might have the intention of annoying the

556
00:29:42.849 --> 00:29:46.550
other person. So it might be still intentional.

557
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.959
That's, that's very fair. Actually, that's one of the

558
00:29:49.969 --> 00:29:52.349
things we're looking at it in this new project

559
00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:54.829
I'm working on, on teasing. So I do think

560
00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:58.300
that, that, you know, this exactly like, hey, hey,

561
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:03.050
hey, um so, yeah, I, I agree. Yeah.

562
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.849
And then in 10 seconds, the other person will

563
00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:08.949
turn the wrong things and, and say you're annoying

564
00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:15.739
me. Yeah. So uh a another aspect of gestures

565
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.170
here. So when it comes again to apes, how

566
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.810
flexible are their gestures?

567
00:30:23.729 --> 00:30:30.420
So I would say there, I mean, medium flexible,

568
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.069
uh I mean, I think they're, they're, we think

569
00:30:33.079 --> 00:30:36.260
that they're more flexible than their vocalizations. Um I

570
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.369
would say they're less flexible than, than human gesture.

571
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.589
So there do seem to be, you know, there

572
00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:46.660
are certain kinds of gestures that apes use um

573
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.839
to communicate different kinds of goals. So there are

574
00:30:49.849 --> 00:30:51.420
set, you know, there are kinds of gestures that

575
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.540
apes use to initiate play with others. There's certain

576
00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:00.290
kinds of gestures that apes use to um you

577
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.020
know, to display, maybe to threaten or, or to,

578
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.520
you know, to like seem big and show off.

579
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:13.619
Um However, we do see those gestures also in

580
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.260
other contexts and that's, that's important too that you,

581
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.979
you know, if you only have a g if

582
00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:22.239
you have a gesture that you always use in

583
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.660
just one context, always in the same way, it's

584
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.300
very hard to say that, that you have any

585
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.760
control over it, right? It's, it's more likely to

586
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.739
be something that's quite reflexive, right? If it's like,

587
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.010
oh, every time, you know, I see Molly, uh

588
00:31:41.069 --> 00:31:42.920
you know, and she's my friend, right? So like

589
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.180
every time I see Molly, I go, hi, sorry.

590
00:31:45.189 --> 00:31:48.410
Right. Uh And I don't ever do anything different

591
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.680
and I never do this gesture in any other

592
00:31:50.689 --> 00:31:54.800
context. It's very difficult to argue um without the

593
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:59.219
ability to interview someone that like this gesture is

594
00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:03.449
um you know, is intentional that it's something that

595
00:32:03.459 --> 00:32:06.420
I have control over. And that's fundamentally what intentional

596
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.689
is about. Right? And so I think, I think

597
00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:11.469
that this question of flexibility is very important. So

598
00:32:11.479 --> 00:32:14.530
I would say yes, ape gestures are flexible. Um

599
00:32:14.979 --> 00:32:18.920
But, you know, I don't think, I think that,

600
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.829
that they probably don't have as a all from

601
00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:26.400
what we see, they don't have as much flexibility

602
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.109
as uh over their gestures as humans do. Um

603
00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:34.949
But they do seem to, to have gesture forms,

604
00:32:34.959 --> 00:32:40.469
you know. Uh SO arm raises arm extensions, tapping

605
00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:44.359
things poking. Um AND they use those gestures, those,

606
00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:48.609
those underlying forms of gestures across a wide variety

607
00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:51.849
of contexts and they modify them and combine them

608
00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:54.550
with other forms of gesture in many different ways.

609
00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:00.579
So when you mentioned their gestures being reflexive and

610
00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:05.319
so the individual produces them not having particular control

611
00:33:05.329 --> 00:33:08.319
over them. Does that have anything to do with

612
00:33:08.329 --> 00:33:13.130
the gestures being innate or learned or not at

613
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.430
all?

614
00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:15.709
Yeah. Uh Let me, so let me just clarify.

615
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:19.069
I don't think that ape gestures are, are reflexive.

616
00:33:19.209 --> 00:33:21.800
Um So, yeah, so I just wanted to, to

617
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.780
be clear that um you know, I do think

618
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:28.349
ape gestures are intentional, they're not reflexes but um

619
00:33:28.369 --> 00:33:31.619
you know, but some animal signals, um you know,

620
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.869
you, you look at sort of a classic example

621
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.239
of like the Darwin's like, Digger wasp, right? Um,

622
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.430
AND you have, you know, these examples of say,

623
00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:45.920
insects who, like, will do the same behavior over

624
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.839
and over as long as you, you know, no

625
00:33:47.849 --> 00:33:49.770
matter how many times they've done it before, as

626
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.839
long as you put the right stimulus in front

627
00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:53.810
of them. And that's sort of what I mean

628
00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:56.930
by like a reflex, right? You something where if

629
00:33:56.939 --> 00:33:59.290
you have the, the form, you know, if you

630
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.369
sort of put the command into the computer system,

631
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.130
it produces the signal um without thinking and, and

632
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.010
I don't think that's what apes are doing. Um

633
00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:13.678
But it's, it's an interesting question about biology, right?

634
00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:18.248
About um what's inherited and what's learned. And so

635
00:34:18.259 --> 00:34:24.458
ape gesture is a really tricky, um you know,

636
00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:29.290
sort of topic in this area because the forms

637
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.969
of ape gestures seem to be very similar across

638
00:34:33.978 --> 00:34:37.228
different groups of apes. They're very similar across species

639
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.989
of apes, um including us. So humans do a

640
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.429
lot of other fancy things. But we also seem

641
00:34:43.438 --> 00:34:46.530
to have this kind of core set of movement

642
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.840
that are used by all of the Great apes.

643
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.699
You know, we extend our arms with our palms

644
00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:57.550
up to request things, we throw our, our arms

645
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.760
away from our body to get others to go

646
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:04.260
away. Um You know, we like clap and tap

647
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.080
and wave to get attention. Uh AND So I

648
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.159
think one great question is, are though, is that

649
00:35:12.169 --> 00:35:17.729
similarity in form due to a common biology? Um

650
00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:20.750
YOU know, either within a species or also between

651
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.050
species um or is it due to similarities in

652
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.050
body forms? Right, you only have, you have like

653
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.229
10 things that can wiggle on two things that

654
00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:33.739
can wiggle more on two things that can like

655
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.800
stretch out and come towards your body, but they

656
00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.719
can only do those in a certain number of

657
00:35:38.729 --> 00:35:42.979
ways. Um And so, you know, is it that

658
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:47.209
the sort of similarities in physiology are driving the

659
00:35:47.219 --> 00:35:51.250
similarities in, in the form of the communication system

660
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:55.500
or is it, you know that we have inherited

661
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.649
forms, we, the great apes, all great apes have

662
00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:03.899
inherited forms of gestures. Um Or could it also

663
00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:08.580
be something to do with, with, you know, similar

664
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.139
social needs? And this, I think is a little

665
00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:13.580
bit harder to explain across species, but I think

666
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.580
is a nice way to potentially explain similarities across

667
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.830
groups of the same species, you know, so if

668
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.439
you're, um you know, if you're in a chimpanzee

669
00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:27.500
group and, you know, and you're in a zoo

670
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.389
and in Belgium compared to a chimpanzee group in

671
00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:33.550
the wild in Uganda, um you're, you know, you

672
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.750
still have multiple males, multiple females, you have, you

673
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.010
know, juveniles, you probably have babies, babies want to

674
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.270
be picked up, other females want to, you know,

675
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.469
to like play with or interact with babies, you

676
00:36:48.479 --> 00:36:51.169
have to communicate, you know. So, so there are

677
00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:53.959
sort of a, a set of social goals, you

678
00:36:53.969 --> 00:36:55.959
know, I want stuff, I want you to go

679
00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:58.520
away. I want you to look at me. Um

680
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.530
So that, that set of social goals might sort

681
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.669
of common social goals might lead communication systems to

682
00:37:06.679 --> 00:37:09.629
be more similar than we would expect just in

683
00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:13.090
a random number generator. Um But I think that's

684
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.709
probably not the reason that great apes have, have

685
00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:20.570
sort of similar forms of gestures. A lot of

686
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.110
the movements that they're producing look similar. Um I

687
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.949
think that there's probably biology involved. I don't know

688
00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:30.739
whether all, I mean, I do not think that

689
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.250
all forms of grade a grade ape gesture are

690
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.530
biologically inherited. Um And, and so it might be

691
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.939
that it's sort of a constraint of the body.

692
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.550
Plus, you know, a certain, maybe an underlying like

693
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.219
movements away from the body or to push other

694
00:37:48.229 --> 00:37:50.540
individuals away movements towards the body or to bring

695
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.179
them towards and then those kind of get mapped

696
00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:57.770
onto similar physiological forms. And so you see common

697
00:37:58.489 --> 00:38:02.189
uh common forms of gestures. That's a really big

698
00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:04.429
question. I think no one has a great answer

699
00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:06.929
for it. There are, are different. Um You know,

700
00:38:06.939 --> 00:38:09.229
there are lots of different, well, not a lot,

701
00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:13.139
there are a few different theories about how apes

702
00:38:13.149 --> 00:38:17.429
acquire their gestures. I perhaps in a sort of

703
00:38:17.439 --> 00:38:23.429
political slash theoretically weak position. Um Think that ape

704
00:38:23.439 --> 00:38:27.620
gestures are not acquired all acquired via the same

705
00:38:27.629 --> 00:38:29.879
mechanism. I think that there are some gestures are

706
00:38:29.889 --> 00:38:34.310
probably socially learned, some are probably biologically inherited, some

707
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.350
are probably ritualized down from um from effective actions.

708
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.209
Um And so, uh just, I don't know if

709
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.879
we're gonna talk about that later, but just quickly

710
00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:47.439
ritualized means sort of something that started out as

711
00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:50.540
an effective movement, like I'm, you know, pull you

712
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.229
towards me and that over time, um you know,

713
00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:57.100
you start as the recipient of that, of that

714
00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.550
action, you start to realize what I'm trying to

715
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.020
do and you start to respond earlier and earlier

716
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.540
and earlier. And so what started out as I

717
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.209
grab you and pull you or put my arm

718
00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:11.729
around you and pull you, um then turns into

719
00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:15.199
something that, you know, goes from uh to uh

720
00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:19.830
to uh to e right? And so, and, and

721
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.969
then the final movement, it can be something that's

722
00:39:21.979 --> 00:39:24.120
just like come, come, come, come, come, come with

723
00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:27.389
me, right? Um WHICH is very different from, all

724
00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:29.570
right. I gotta take you and go over here.

725
00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.290
Um The problem is that's a very difficult process

726
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.870
to observe because it, it happens over many, many

727
00:39:36.879 --> 00:39:40.969
interactions over a lot of time. Um And, and

728
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.969
that's something that we, we believe is important in

729
00:39:43.979 --> 00:39:46.649
the gestures of some of the gestures of human

730
00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:48.979
Children as well as some of the gestures of

731
00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:51.149
great apes. And so I, I think that that

732
00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:55.840
ape gestures are acquired via uh uh you know,

733
00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:01.100
a diversity of, of um of mechanisms. But one

734
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.639
final thing and then I promise I, I will

735
00:40:02.649 --> 00:40:06.340
be quite an about this is that um it

736
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:10.820
seems like the forms of gestures are very similar

737
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.820
across species and across um groups of the same

738
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.260
species in different locations who've never met each other.

739
00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:21.850
But it seems like the uses of gesture differ

740
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.810
much more than the forms. So you might have,

741
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.489
you know, the same shooing gesture. But in one

742
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.010
group, it, it tends to get combined with these

743
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.310
other signals or tends to get used in these

744
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.975
contexts. And in another group, it, it manifest, it's

745
00:40:36.985 --> 00:40:39.245
used in different ways. So I do think that

746
00:40:39.254 --> 00:40:43.695
there's more evidence that learning, whether it's social learning

747
00:40:43.705 --> 00:40:46.965
or individual learning, I'm not, I'm not sure. Um

748
00:40:46.975 --> 00:40:50.375
But I think that that learning um and potentially

749
00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:53.814
culture plays a bigger role in the use of

750
00:40:53.824 --> 00:40:57.284
ape gesture than it does in um in determining

751
00:40:57.294 --> 00:40:58.905
the, the the physical forms

752
00:41:00.449 --> 00:41:05.350
and do a gestures have specific meanings. And, and

753
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.080
by the way, what is the meaning in this

754
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.389
context exactly?

755
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.020
Uh WHAT is meaning? How many hours do we

756
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:24.100
have? Um So I, I think so, I mean,

757
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.760
yes, I, I think ape gestures, I think some

758
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:32.159
ape gestures have specific meanings. I think some, the

759
00:41:32.169 --> 00:41:37.169
meaning is very flexible and you know, and it,

760
00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:40.300
so just in the way that, you know, if

761
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.159
we have, you know, if I say, do human

762
00:41:42.169 --> 00:41:45.590
words have meanings and you say absolutely. And I

763
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.080
say, OK, well, you know, like if you take

764
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:56.659
the words, um I, I mean, I don't know,

765
00:41:56.669 --> 00:42:00.379
like storm, right? Like it can be, it can

766
00:42:00.389 --> 00:42:02.560
be like a physical storm. It can also refer

767
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.120
to someone's mood, it can also refer, right? So

768
00:42:05.129 --> 00:42:08.489
you, you can have things that yes, there is

769
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.820
sort of AAA me like there is a meaning

770
00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:16.399
but it really differs, you know, based on the

771
00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:19.239
context exactly what it means and you can use

772
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.830
it in, in non literal ways. Um And lots

773
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.439
of human words don't have, don't have very tight

774
00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:30.620
meanings, right? So, I mean, like Dike Dick words,

775
00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:34.530
I can say here and there and like the,

776
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.300
those are really like, yes, they mean things absolutely.

777
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.929
But uh what exactly they mean really depends on

778
00:42:41.939 --> 00:42:45.239
the context. And um you know, and I think

779
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.739
that the same is probably true of ape gesture

780
00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:51.830
and now I am not saying that ape gestures

781
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.399
are the same as words. So it'd be really

782
00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:59.530
clear. But um they're similar in the way that

783
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.610
or is what I'm talking about is that they

784
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.489
have sort of a primary meaning that you think

785
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.169
about where it's like, yes, this gesture is used

786
00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:12.169
to initiate play or this gesture is used to,

787
00:43:12.179 --> 00:43:15.429
you know, to um get someone to follow you,

788
00:43:15.729 --> 00:43:19.030
but they, they also sometimes get used in other

789
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.429
contexts or they, they, you know, might have, um,

790
00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:27.760
sort of have a loose, like this is a

791
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:31.270
play adja like this, this is a play gesture

792
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.889
but it gets used in different ways within the

793
00:43:34.899 --> 00:43:40.399
context of play. Um And so, you know, I

794
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:45.810
think for, you know, for example, I'll just, well,

795
00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.229
I guess I could just offer you my coffee

796
00:43:47.239 --> 00:43:49.979
cup or so, like, if I, if I, I'm

797
00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:52.750
offering you something right? And I love how, whenever

798
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.229
I'm doing being an ape, I have to, like,

799
00:43:54.239 --> 00:43:57.850
get down. But if I'm offering you something as

800
00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.679
an ape, I don't know why it's like, ah,

801
00:44:00.639 --> 00:44:02.040
um, then

802
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.020
do they have shorter neck?

803
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.570
I don't know. I think it's just my leg.

804
00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:13.199
Oh, I'm acting now. Um, SO sorry. But, uh,

805
00:44:13.209 --> 00:44:15.330
it's just how you, like, tell I'm switching into

806
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.439
like, oh, I'm being the atheist. So, uh, so

807
00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:21.649
I give you, uh, so let's say I'm offering

808
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.439
you something sometimes, you know, that, I mean, that

809
00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:26.979
can be, that can have many different meanings. It,

810
00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:29.270
yes, it can be taken. But it can also

811
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.340
be, look at what I have, I could pull

812
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.750
it back. I could, I could be disingenuous. Um,

813
00:44:35.149 --> 00:44:38.360
YOU know, I could be offering you something. Um,

814
00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:41.919
YOU know, because I, you know, I want to

815
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:43.300
get rid of it. I could be offering you

816
00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.979
something because I, you know, it's a high value

817
00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:48.989
item and I want you to meet with me,

818
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.010
I could be offering you something because I want

819
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.560
you to see the thing I just got and

820
00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.129
I'm not going to give it to you. And

821
00:44:54.139 --> 00:44:56.669
so, you know, there are, I think that, that

822
00:44:56.679 --> 00:45:00.610
yes, ape gestures have meanings. Um, BUT I think

823
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.580
they're not, you know, they don't, they're not always

824
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.469
constrained in like, meaning exactly the same thing each

825
00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:09.030
time. I, I also think and, and just really

826
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.669
quickly, I just want to say that um just

827
00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:14.780
because I like wrote a whole paper about this

828
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.500
recently. And so it's a particular bugbear of mine

829
00:45:18.629 --> 00:45:23.969
is that um the ways that we study meaning

830
00:45:23.979 --> 00:45:27.040
in animal communication are so different from the ways

831
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.689
that we study it in human language that I

832
00:45:29.699 --> 00:45:33.550
think um you know, in order basically, in order

833
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.270
to demonstrate that an animal signal has meaning, whether

834
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.280
it's a vocalization or a gesture, we're looking for

835
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:43.060
evidence in order to prove, yes, this, this thing

836
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:47.219
has meaning we are often looking for evidence that

837
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.270
it has a reliable response, right? So the animal

838
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.590
does this, the signaler, does this, the recipient, you

839
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.500
know, the signaler does A, the recipient does B

840
00:45:56.959 --> 00:45:59.120
we want the recipient to do B A bunch

841
00:45:59.129 --> 00:46:02.370
of times in order to argue that A has

842
00:46:02.379 --> 00:46:06.909
the meaning, request B, right? Um The problem with

843
00:46:06.919 --> 00:46:10.379
that is that then we conclude that animal signals

844
00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:13.110
are very inflexible. You know, we we argue that

845
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.610
like, oh animal signals are very different from language

846
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.340
because they have this simple code system where I

847
00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:21.100
do, you know where I use this signal and

848
00:46:21.129 --> 00:46:23.689
this, I it always gets this response. But that's

849
00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:26.090
also the way that we're structuring our questions. It's

850
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.179
what we're looking for. And so I get very

851
00:46:29.189 --> 00:46:32.709
irritated, not at you, you're wonderful. But at this

852
00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:38.439
like idea that, you know, the animal communication is,

853
00:46:38.449 --> 00:46:43.239
is fundamentally different from human communication because it has

854
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.800
this 1 to 1 correspondence between what the signaler

855
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.209
does and what the recipient does when most of

856
00:46:49.219 --> 00:46:53.169
our studies have been designed specifically to look for

857
00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:56.270
that. And so I'm not saying that it's impossible

858
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.389
that animal communication is like that. But I think

859
00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:02.139
that the way that we're asking questions about animals

860
00:47:02.149 --> 00:47:05.080
affords those types of those types of answers and

861
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.860
really excludes the, the possibility that they're using them

862
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.300
in, in much more flexible, creative, um you know,

863
00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.449
human like ways.

864
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.969
So the last thing that you just mentioned there,

865
00:47:17.979 --> 00:47:20.379
I was actually earlier when I was about to

866
00:47:20.389 --> 00:47:22.919
interrupt you, I was going to ask you, uh

867
00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:25.239
and I guess that you've already answered the question,

868
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.889
but just to see if you have anything else

869
00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:30.530
to add to it. But uh I was going

870
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:35.110
to ask you actually how you go about distinguishing

871
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.780
uh a gesture that has no meaning from a

872
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.469
gesture with a specific meaning.

873
00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:54.080
Yeah. Um So with, I mean, with nonhuman great

874
00:47:54.090 --> 00:48:02.219
apes. Um It's hard to argue that gestures have

875
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:08.060
no meaning because, I mean, there's certainly gestures where

876
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:09.729
we're saying, like, we don't know what the meaning

877
00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:13.159
is. Um And there are gestures where we say

878
00:48:13.169 --> 00:48:15.909
we're pretty confident, we know what this means. Um

879
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.500
It's, it's harder for us to sort of call

880
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:24.389
something to like, conclude that something is a gesture

881
00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:26.530
if there, if we don't have any evidence that

882
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.919
it means something. Um uh JUST because it's hard

883
00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:33.419
to ask, you know, and, and again, this is,

884
00:48:33.429 --> 00:48:36.800
I think where the, the human gesture researchers and

885
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.360
the ape gesture researchers would differ in terms of

886
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:42.189
like human gesture researchers would say like it's a

887
00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:44.560
movement, it happens while you're, you know, while you're

888
00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.360
talking with other individuals, it's a gesture with apes,

889
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.040
we don't have that luxury, right? They're not engaged

890
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.659
in conversation like the gesture is the conversation. And

891
00:48:52.669 --> 00:48:55.280
so in a way you have to say, well,

892
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.129
you know, what are they communicating in order to

893
00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:00.459
argue that the movement they're doing is a gesture.

894
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:03.260
So it gets a, I mean, the intentionality criteria

895
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.520
that I talked about are not about meaning. So

896
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.050
it, it, at least that's really nice. It's clean,

897
00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.899
we can say, you know, it's not effective, it's

898
00:49:10.909 --> 00:49:16.699
directed, they're repeating, they're elaborating. But um you know,

899
00:49:16.709 --> 00:49:19.810
but sometimes it, it gets, it's tricky for us

900
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.449
to sort of say like this is clearly its

901
00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:27.610
own gesture. When we don't have evidence that um

902
00:49:27.629 --> 00:49:31.350
that it's, it's communicating something in particular. And so

903
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.689
that's where I think this, this, like we just

904
00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:38.370
need to be uh transparent about the fact that

905
00:49:38.379 --> 00:49:41.100
the, the ways we're studying ape gesture and human

906
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:44.139
gesture are very different. And um and there are

907
00:49:44.149 --> 00:49:46.479
researchers who are trying to, to work around that.

908
00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:49.110
Um And really trying, it's harder to study apes

909
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.600
in the same way that you study humans. Um

910
00:49:51.709 --> 00:49:53.360
But there are people who are trying now to

911
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.239
study humans in the way that we study apes.

912
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:57.530
And I think when you do that, you see

913
00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:03.389
many more similarities um than, than differences. Um But

914
00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:06.790
in terms of, of how do you differentiate between

915
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.600
a gesture that has a clear meaning and a

916
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.080
gesture that has, I won't say no meaning. I'll

917
00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.419
say a less clear meaning it, you know, is,

918
00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:18.149
is, you know, you want to look for uh

919
00:50:18.159 --> 00:50:22.399
kind of a match between what the recipient is

920
00:50:22.409 --> 00:50:27.310
doing and um and when the signaler stops gesturing,

921
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.629
right? So if I like poke you and you

922
00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:31.030
don't do anything and I poke you, you don't

923
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.070
do anything and I poke you and then you

924
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.560
move away. Um And then I stop communicating. That's

925
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.840
like one data point that suggests that the, the

926
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.040
poke is um either the, the goal and that's

927
00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.669
the meaning of the poke is, is to move,

928
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:52.540
right? The same thing if I'm doing a like

929
00:50:52.709 --> 00:50:55.629
you know, a, a beckon, right. I'm like, ah,

930
00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:57.929
you know, come here, come here, come here. Um,

931
00:50:58.199 --> 00:51:01.090
AND we try to, as ape researchers, we try

932
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.070
to not like gloss things as, oh, it, it

933
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.699
means come here, right? You wanna build that evidence

934
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:09.020
up from the, from the bottom up. Um And

935
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.209
so, you know, we see this arm swing towards

936
00:51:11.219 --> 00:51:16.219
the body and another individual comes over and then

937
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:20.159
the ape stops producing that signal and stops, you

938
00:51:20.169 --> 00:51:23.929
know, stops communicating. Um Maybe they switch to grooming,

939
00:51:23.939 --> 00:51:27.149
maybe they do something else, but we use um

940
00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:32.020
the, the sort of what the recipient does that

941
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:36.919
makes the signaler stop communicating as evidence of um

942
00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:40.750
of meaning. And it, you know, it's important that

943
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.370
it isn't just once, right? So we, and that's

944
00:51:43.379 --> 00:51:45.649
that, you know, because like you do it once

945
00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:47.790
it could be, you know, like you were saying,

946
00:51:47.879 --> 00:51:49.399
if I poke you a bunch and you turn

947
00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:51.649
around and yell at me, it's like, get the

948
00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:54.810
heck off, right? Like that's probably not the meaning

949
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.250
of the gesture. And so it's important that, you

950
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.290
know, as researchers, we gather lots and lots of

951
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.669
examples and we look across them to see um

952
00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:07.969
you know, to see like what across many examples,

953
00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:14.310
what um are the most frequent behaviors that cause

954
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.469
the, the signaler to stop signaling. And um and

955
00:52:18.479 --> 00:52:21.780
then, you know, for some gestures, 95% of the

956
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.929
time, it'll be the same thing and we think

957
00:52:23.939 --> 00:52:25.860
about those as gestures that have very tight or

958
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.250
very strong meanings, right? This gesture is used to

959
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.719
get this thing to happen. Sometimes it doesn't happen.

960
00:52:31.729 --> 00:52:34.439
The other individual ignores them or goes away or

961
00:52:34.449 --> 00:52:38.110
whatever. But you know, when there is a response

962
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.929
that causes them to stop, it's almost always this

963
00:52:40.939 --> 00:52:44.010
thing, other gestures are used much more flexibly. And

964
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.629
so maybe, you know, 20% of the time the

965
00:52:46.639 --> 00:52:49.699
other individual goes away, 20% of the time they

966
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:51.969
come towards you, 20% of the time they start

967
00:52:51.979 --> 00:52:55.155
grooming. 5% of the time they share an object

968
00:52:55.165 --> 00:52:57.995
with you, 5% of the time it initiates mating,

969
00:52:58.004 --> 00:53:00.554
you know. So there, so there are gestures that

970
00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:04.955
um, that have seem to have much more flexible

971
00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:07.425
meanings and that they result in a lot of

972
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:12.324
different outcomes that um that sort of satisfy or,

973
00:53:12.334 --> 00:53:14.175
or apparently satisfy the signaler.

974
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.550
Well, I guess that perhaps uh you, people who

975
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.379
study gestures in nonhuman apes should be a little

976
00:53:22.389 --> 00:53:25.260
bit more ambitious. And when you teach them sign

977
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:28.820
language, you should also try to teach them philosophy

978
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.429
and then you would be able to ask them

979
00:53:31.439 --> 00:53:34.979
directly if their gestures have any meaning or not.

980
00:53:35.489 --> 00:53:37.889
Ah, why didn't I think of that

981
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.949
even though perhaps it would later on raise some

982
00:53:41.959 --> 00:53:46.100
ethical questions because if you teach them philosophy, they

983
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:49.729
might start to, to think about their own existence

984
00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:53.229
and then start to feel existential rather and think

985
00:53:53.239 --> 00:53:56.100
about death and all of that, which would ruin

986
00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.550
their mental health.

987
00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:02.840
Uh Absolutely. Yeah.

988
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.080
So uh let's get now a little bit into

989
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:10.929
language then. So in what ways do gestures relate

990
00:54:10.939 --> 00:54:15.479
to uh language? I mean, are there features of

991
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:19.879
gestures that are shared with human language, for example?

992
00:54:20.649 --> 00:54:23.350
Yeah. So when you, when you say gestures there,

993
00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.270
do you, do you want me to talk about

994
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.439
the ways in which ape gesture might be similar

995
00:54:27.449 --> 00:54:28.949
to human language? Or do you want me to

996
00:54:28.959 --> 00:54:33.120
talk about human gestures and how they like are

997
00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.429
an integrative part of,

998
00:54:35.669 --> 00:54:39.500
let's go with ape gestures. I'm more interested here

999
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.449
in the phylogenetic aspect of these.

1000
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:47.399
Cool. Yeah, because I mean, uh to answer the

1001
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.479
thing you didn't ask um just to, just to

1002
00:54:50.489 --> 00:54:54.340
say, I do think that that human gesture is

1003
00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:57.040
very much part of human language. So I think

1004
00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.510
that that speech and gesture together are really like

1005
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.280
part of a multimodal system that manifests in different

1006
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:09.054
ways where like speech, you know, has particular rules

1007
00:55:09.064 --> 00:55:11.534
and is much more digital gesture is much more

1008
00:55:11.544 --> 00:55:14.495
analog. It is, you know, more holistic, it's more

1009
00:55:14.504 --> 00:55:17.294
imagistic and, and I think that those systems coming

1010
00:55:17.304 --> 00:55:20.155
together is actually like part of what makes human

1011
00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:23.645
language very powerful and very different as a system.

1012
00:55:24.334 --> 00:55:29.199
Um But um you know, in terms of similarities

1013
00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:35.159
between ape gestures and human language, um so they,

1014
00:55:35.169 --> 00:55:38.120
you know, we, I think there's much more evidence

1015
00:55:38.129 --> 00:55:42.350
that apes combine gestures um together. They don't, they

1016
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.780
don't seem to do it according to syntactic rules.

1017
00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:48.770
So, you know, um so, I mean, no one

1018
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.560
has found evidence of that. They did. It would

1019
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.370
be a nature paper, it would be very exciting.

1020
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:58.199
Um But they combine gestures together in sequences and

1021
00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:02.280
um and those sequences tend to, to show, you

1022
00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.600
know, like I said, persistence and elaboration, things like

1023
00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:08.209
that. Um But uh you know, but they're not

1024
00:56:08.219 --> 00:56:10.929
isolated signals, I think in that way that, you

1025
00:56:10.939 --> 00:56:15.350
know, those are sort of more language like. Um

1026
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.959
AND they, you know, they are very flexible and

1027
00:56:19.969 --> 00:56:23.100
I think that that's really the part where, you

1028
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.659
know, the, the thing that attracts a lot of

1029
00:56:24.669 --> 00:56:28.070
people to study gesture is that, you know, they,

1030
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.129
they seem to be able to, you know, to

1031
00:56:31.139 --> 00:56:36.320
use them in ways to overcome communicative um you

1032
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.389
know, hurdles, right? So, uh an early experiment I

1033
00:56:39.399 --> 00:56:43.290
did uh looked at the ways in which captive

1034
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.429
apes. Again. We, we sort of, I've been talking

1035
00:56:45.439 --> 00:56:47.479
about like apes in general, but there's, you know,

1036
00:56:47.489 --> 00:56:49.360
there are people that study apes in captivity and

1037
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:51.919
people that study them in the wild and their

1038
00:56:51.929 --> 00:56:54.979
gestures seem to be pretty similar, but they're, their

1039
00:56:54.989 --> 00:56:58.929
social needs, their social structures. Um And the kinds

1040
00:56:58.939 --> 00:57:01.419
of things that they communicate about seems to be

1041
00:57:01.429 --> 00:57:03.310
very, I mean, well, not seems to be, is

1042
00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.409
very different, right? You have animals that are trying

1043
00:57:05.419 --> 00:57:07.429
to survive and you have animals that are sitting

1044
00:57:07.439 --> 00:57:11.189
around being fed, basically, like watching television and poking

1045
00:57:11.199 --> 00:57:13.790
each other, which I would argue is much more

1046
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.860
like modern humans. But, um, you know, we're all

1047
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:21.510
sort of thrown in together and, you know, just

1048
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.189
finding ways to occupy our time. Um Anyway, uh

1049
00:57:26.199 --> 00:57:29.949
So, um, what was your actual question? Sorry, that

1050
00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:30.739
image just like,

1051
00:57:31.649 --> 00:57:35.669
no, sure, no worries. It was if the, whether

1052
00:57:35.679 --> 00:57:41.219
there are aspects or features of the not but

1053
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.350
tape gestures and human language that they share.

1054
00:57:45.399 --> 00:57:50.459
Yeah, absolutely. Um Yeah. So, so, right. So I

1055
00:57:50.469 --> 00:57:53.550
talked a little bit about flexibility. Um You know,

1056
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.070
they, they seem to, to combine them um in

1057
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.270
potentially interesting ways. Uh So, one of the, the

1058
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.840
first experiments that I did was was looking at

1059
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:09.800
how apes um communicate when they've sort of met

1060
00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:12.939
their communicative or sorry, how they communicate when uh

1061
00:58:12.949 --> 00:58:18.959
a human experiment experimenter appears to misunderstand versus only

1062
00:58:18.969 --> 00:58:22.239
partially understand. Um And so, in this experiment, uh

1063
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.790
you know, we had, um we had the experimenter

1064
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.709
give the apes, either part of the thing that

1065
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:31.550
they were requesting or give them the wrong thing.

1066
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.629
And then we wanted to see what apes did

1067
00:58:33.639 --> 00:58:36.850
in response and we found different patterns in how

1068
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.889
they, and you know how they gestured and how

1069
00:58:39.899 --> 00:58:42.639
they tried to communicate and they weren't vocalizing. Sometimes

1070
00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:44.879
they were making noises with their mouths and they

1071
00:58:44.889 --> 00:58:48.840
were like blowing raspberries or kind of smacking their

1072
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:52.340
lips. But, you know, mostly they were gesturing um

1073
00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:56.500
either with auditory gestures or visual gestures. Um We,

1074
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:59.280
we don't, we don't usually have tactile gestures between

1075
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:02.879
apes and, and zookeepers that can be problematic. So,

1076
00:59:02.889 --> 00:59:05.340
um so in this case, you know, we found

1077
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.199
that in these two very different situations where they're

1078
00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:10.699
either getting the thing, they, um they're, they're not

1079
00:59:10.709 --> 00:59:13.719
getting anything they want. So it's like they're requesting

1080
00:59:13.729 --> 00:59:16.179
a banana and they get an onion versus they

1081
00:59:16.189 --> 00:59:17.735
were the banana and they get a little piece

1082
00:59:17.745 --> 00:59:20.834
of the banana. We found that the kind of

1083
00:59:20.844 --> 00:59:23.725
uh the patterns of their communication were very different

1084
00:59:23.735 --> 00:59:27.215
following getting an onion and getting a little piece

1085
00:59:27.225 --> 00:59:30.165
of a banana. And, and so even though there

1086
00:59:30.175 --> 00:59:33.094
doesn't seem to be any syntactic structure, there's still

1087
00:59:33.104 --> 00:59:37.235
strategic combination, right? They're, they're using their signals in

1088
00:59:37.245 --> 00:59:41.875
strategic ways to overcome miscommunication. Um And I think

1089
00:59:41.885 --> 00:59:44.245
that that's sort of an interesting suggestion that there

1090
00:59:44.254 --> 00:59:47.439
might be um there might be a, a range

1091
00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:55.060
of different um sort of um strategic uh pathways

1092
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:59.560
to have communicative complexity that isn't just syntax. So,

1093
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:01.199
you know, the sort of syntactic rules that we

1094
01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:03.449
see in human language are amazing. I mean, they

1095
01:00:03.459 --> 01:00:05.919
allow language, they allow us to take this finite

1096
01:00:05.929 --> 01:00:08.469
number of things and communicate about an infinite number

1097
01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:11.000
of possibilities, right? By combining them in different ways

1098
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.989
like a Rubik's Cube um Apes don't seem to

1099
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.989
have that, but they nevertheless seem to be able

1100
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.979
to use a limited number of gestures, a limited

1101
01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:24.949
number of movements and they, they are able to,

1102
01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:29.669
to combine those to communicate, um, you know, with

1103
01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.429
other individuals in novel situations, to achieve their social

1104
01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:37.639
goals. Those social goals are more limited than, than

1105
01:00:37.649 --> 01:00:40.679
humans. Right? We're not like they're not trying to

1106
01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:45.840
build universities, teach each other recipes, um, you know,

1107
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.879
make up bedtime stories. But, um, you know, but

1108
01:00:49.889 --> 01:00:53.500
they're still able to, to achieve their social goals

1109
01:00:53.510 --> 01:01:01.449
um, in oftentimes, um quite flexible uh ways that,

1110
01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:08.290
that involve using, combining different signals, um paying attention

1111
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.290
to what the other individ, what the, the recipient

1112
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.629
understands and doesn't understand. Right. Do you are, you

1113
01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.439
know, did you, did you get me, did you

1114
01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.429
sort of get me? Um, AND whether the other

1115
01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:23.659
individual is paying attention? So I think that this

1116
01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:27.370
like social monitoring of the other individual, the potential

1117
01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.590
for theory of mind, which we haven't talked about.

1118
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.909
But, but I do think it's sort of there

1119
01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:34.659
in the background with him with ape gesture. Um

1120
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.770
What do I know about your mind? Do you

1121
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.879
understand me? Do you know that I'm trying to

1122
01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:45.010
communicate to you? Do I know that, you know

1123
01:01:45.189 --> 01:01:47.169
that I'm trying to communicate? Right? It's all of

1124
01:01:47.179 --> 01:01:49.340
those kinds of, of you can go on and

1125
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:52.000
on and on. But, but fundamentally it's what do

1126
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:55.639
I understand about your mind and I think that

1127
01:01:55.649 --> 01:01:58.419
apes are different from humans, but I think they're

1128
01:01:58.429 --> 01:02:02.419
a lot closer than, than, you know, people used

1129
01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:05.090
to think. Um, YOU know, I, I do think

1130
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.340
that they understand something about intentions, they understand something

1131
01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:12.530
about others goals, they understand things about what surprises

1132
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.350
other individuals and they can use that to their

1133
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.050
benefit. Um FOR good or for evil, they can

1134
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.139
like, manipulate other individuals. Um BUT they, they can

1135
01:02:22.149 --> 01:02:25.949
also console and be quite empathetic. Um And I

1136
01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:27.844
mean, just as humans can. And so I think,

1137
01:02:27.854 --> 01:02:29.405
you know, this is a way in which humans

1138
01:02:29.415 --> 01:02:32.405
are kind of a supercharged primate. We really think

1139
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.324
a lot about other individuals. That's why we have

1140
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.205
soap operas, right? We spend a lot of time

1141
01:02:37.215 --> 01:02:39.965
and we're fascinated by like what other individuals want,

1142
01:02:39.975 --> 01:02:42.945
what they're doing, what they're thinking like humans as

1143
01:02:42.955 --> 01:02:46.665
a species are like a super supercharged ape. And

1144
01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.264
I think what's interesting is to look at the

1145
01:02:48.274 --> 01:02:50.614
other apes and figure out the ways in which

1146
01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:55.429
um you know, we, we see commonalities in the

1147
01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:58.199
sort of basic forms of our cognition, but also

1148
01:02:58.209 --> 01:02:59.070
our communication.

1149
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:03.929
And so to go back to one of the

1150
01:03:03.939 --> 01:03:07.679
points we made early in our conversation when I

1151
01:03:07.689 --> 01:03:12.280
asked you or, or basically I mentioned that probably

1152
01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:15.459
gestures are not, are not used simply to convey

1153
01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:19.219
information to others, but also to a one's own

1154
01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:24.719
cognition. So in what ways can our usage of

1155
01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:27.590
gestures aid our own cognition.

1156
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:33.969
Yeah. So, um I mean, there's so many, we

1157
01:03:33.979 --> 01:03:35.840
could talk for an hour, you know, for an

1158
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:41.310
hour. I mean, a lot of, um so there

1159
01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.550
are several theories about this um in terms of

1160
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.669
why gesture might aid our cognition, but I, I

1161
01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:49.199
can just sort of talk for, you know, a

1162
01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:51.350
minute or two about like the different areas in

1163
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.300
which we think it does. Um So gesture certainly

1164
01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:00.300
helps speech. It helps you speak more fluently. It

1165
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:03.479
helps you. Uh YOU know, it helps, you have

1166
01:04:03.489 --> 01:04:05.949
fewer pauses, helps you have fewer ums and us.

1167
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.399
So there's a, you know, really, really nice experiments

1168
01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:12.149
that show that when you restrict people's gesturing. So

1169
01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:14.010
like if I sat on my hands, I mean,

1170
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.429
I, I could do this, you know, live on

1171
01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:18.070
your show, but I'm not going to, I like

1172
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.840
gesturing. But, you know, if you restrict your gesturing,

1173
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.949
you will, you'll make more mistakes in speech, you'll

1174
01:04:24.959 --> 01:04:29.500
pause more, you'll go um uh uh you, you'll

1175
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:32.409
also, you'll have more disfluencies and a disfluency is

1176
01:04:32.419 --> 01:04:34.719
what I just did. I said you'll also, you'll

1177
01:04:34.729 --> 01:04:36.939
have more disfluencies, right? And so it's like I

1178
01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:38.729
start, and then I start a different thing or

1179
01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.750
I say half a word and then I erase

1180
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.840
it. So, um so gesturing helps you speak more

1181
01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:47.370
smoothly. It helps you speak more coherently. Uh It's,

1182
01:04:47.379 --> 01:04:50.540
it helps you remember words. If you're like, I'm

1183
01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.409
thinking of this word and I can't remember it.

1184
01:04:52.419 --> 01:04:54.600
And I'm like, uh and, and you see this

1185
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:58.010
kind of like I'm sorting through things, gesture, people

1186
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.290
do that a lot. Um One of the, the

1187
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.310
best ways to think about uh whether gesture helps

1188
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.300
speaker fluency is to look at people gesturing when

1189
01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:09.929
they're on the telephone. And so, you know, and

1190
01:05:09.979 --> 01:05:12.510
when they can't be seen, right? I am clearly

1191
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.739
if I am on the phone and I am

1192
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.639
talking to someone and, you know, we're not using

1193
01:05:16.649 --> 01:05:20.080
facetime or zoom, my gestures are not for you.

1194
01:05:20.439 --> 01:05:26.179
But what's fascinating is that those gestures actually are

1195
01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:29.379
sort of for you because they make my speech

1196
01:05:29.389 --> 01:05:32.189
better, they make it, they, you know, they, I

1197
01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:35.250
make more sense. I'm, you know, my speech is

1198
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:39.489
smoother, it doesn't have as many pauses. Um It,

1199
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.379
you know, it, it has more like musicality, right?

1200
01:05:42.389 --> 01:05:45.649
And so, um so the, the ways in which

1201
01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:50.260
gesture uh sort of integrates with and supports speech

1202
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.179
can be present even if you can't see my

1203
01:05:52.189 --> 01:05:55.709
gestures and that, and I think that's really fascinating.

1204
01:05:55.889 --> 01:06:00.169
So that's about sort of gesture as part of

1205
01:06:00.179 --> 01:06:03.189
communication, even when you can't see the gestures. Um

1206
01:06:03.199 --> 01:06:06.580
And I think the communication, the aid to communication,

1207
01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.419
there is both for the person who's communicating, but

1208
01:06:09.429 --> 01:06:12.929
also for the other person. And um then I

1209
01:06:12.939 --> 01:06:14.659
think there's a whole body of work that looks

1210
01:06:14.669 --> 01:06:20.709
at how gestures can help learners. So they can

1211
01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:23.199
help, you know, they can help while you're learning

1212
01:06:23.209 --> 01:06:28.620
something, they can help you. Um WHEN you're processing

1213
01:06:28.629 --> 01:06:32.360
that information, they can help you remember things. And

1214
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.209
so there's a whole body of work looking at

1215
01:06:34.219 --> 01:06:39.850
gestures and educational contexts and um that's both learning

1216
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.949
from the gestures of others. So how do Children

1217
01:06:41.959 --> 01:06:45.350
learn from teachers, gestures? And you know, it seems

1218
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.679
to be, it's, it's quite important. And so there,

1219
01:06:47.689 --> 01:06:50.050
there's a lot of, you know, their interventions where,

1220
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.399
where people are, you know, changing the ways in

1221
01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:55.620
which teachers use gesture as a visual aid and

1222
01:06:55.629 --> 01:06:59.159
seeing does that in, in what context does that

1223
01:06:59.169 --> 01:07:02.719
help Children learn more than not getting gestures or

1224
01:07:02.729 --> 01:07:06.370
getting some visual aid that isn't gesture? Um And

1225
01:07:06.379 --> 01:07:09.830
most of that research is in math education. And

1226
01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.379
then there's, there's also research that looks at how

1227
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.469
the gestures that Children are producing. It's usually, it's

1228
01:07:16.479 --> 01:07:19.239
usually Children just, you know, I think sort of

1229
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.790
the majority of educational research is on Children, but

1230
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.949
it's also true of adult learners, how do the

1231
01:07:23.959 --> 01:07:27.600
gestures that learners themselves are producing? Um How does

1232
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.989
that help? Um But how does that help them

1233
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.590
learn? And um you know, and, and I think

1234
01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:37.959
that initial work in that area really showed that

1235
01:07:37.969 --> 01:07:42.159
the ways in which Children are gesturing can, can

1236
01:07:42.169 --> 01:07:45.120
provide insight about where they are in their learning

1237
01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.969
process. So um there's a beautiful set of studies

1238
01:07:48.979 --> 01:07:51.949
uh by um Susan Gold Meadow and and her

1239
01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:56.580
colleagues that look at um what are what are

1240
01:07:56.590 --> 01:08:01.510
called Piagetian conservation conservation tasks. Um They're like page

1241
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.489
uh famous scientist who had developed these tasks. So

1242
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:10.439
um there are cases where children's gestures will differ

1243
01:08:10.449 --> 01:08:13.260
from like what you see, Children gesturing about will

1244
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.029
differ from what they say in speech. And so

1245
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.540
when that happens, children's gestures tend to be right.

1246
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.819
And that even when their speech is wrong. And

1247
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.500
so what's really interesting is that Children who are

1248
01:08:24.509 --> 01:08:27.310
in this space where their hands are saying one

1249
01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:29.549
thing and their mouth is saying something else, those

1250
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.470
Children are more sort of ready to learn, they're

1251
01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:36.450
like almost figuring it out. Um But they don't

1252
01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:39.689
realize it. And so that, and so that is

1253
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.490
actually a great way to get insight about, you

1254
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.129
know, when learners are like about to get something,

1255
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.250
you know, maybe that's a point where you could

1256
01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:51.810
give them some additional support. You could, you could

1257
01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:54.020
intervene in a way that would help get them

1258
01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.370
um to there, you know, so in, in one

1259
01:08:56.379 --> 01:09:02.707
conservation task, there's um two rows of, of little

1260
01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:07.358
stones or markers and, and then one and then

1261
01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:09.738
the experimenter spreads one of them out and then

1262
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:12.408
you ask the child which one has more, right?

1263
01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:15.729
And Children will like uh below a certain age

1264
01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:17.548
though, even though they have the same number of

1265
01:09:17.559 --> 01:09:21.988
stones, um because they're longer, Children will say, you

1266
01:09:21.999 --> 01:09:24.870
know, this row has more um, and if you

1267
01:09:24.879 --> 01:09:27.459
have a whole group of Children, all of whom

1268
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:30.839
say that one has more. If you look at

1269
01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:34.029
children's hands, they're actually split into two groups. See

1270
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.319
some Children will take their finger and they'll go,

1271
01:09:40.019 --> 01:09:41.957
that one has more and you're like, wait, but

1272
01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:45.238
you just counted them, you know, um, and you

1273
01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:47.377
know, you match them up 1 to 11 to

1274
01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:48.988
11 to 1 and that's how you solve the

1275
01:09:48.999 --> 01:09:52.048
task. But children's hands figure that out before their

1276
01:09:52.059 --> 01:09:55.918
mouths do. And what's interesting is that those hands

1277
01:09:55.929 --> 01:09:59.329
can, can help, you know, I think the possibility

1278
01:09:59.338 --> 01:10:01.878
is that your hands can help your brain figure

1279
01:10:01.889 --> 01:10:03.999
out things that then you communicate to your mouth.

1280
01:10:04.429 --> 01:10:06.909
And so, uh, I realize it's a very simplistic

1281
01:10:06.918 --> 01:10:09.810
way of saying that. But, um, uh, you know,

1282
01:10:09.819 --> 01:10:11.569
but I, I think that this is true, you

1283
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.930
know, you can see that in your own life

1284
01:10:12.939 --> 01:10:15.640
where you're, you're thinking or I certainly can, I

1285
01:10:15.649 --> 01:10:18.049
gesture a lot as you can tell. But, um,

1286
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.700
you know, but where I will oftentimes be thinking

1287
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:23.189
about something and I'll kind of, you know, put

1288
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.350
ideas out and move them around or think about

1289
01:10:26.359 --> 01:10:28.229
them. And sometimes I look at my hands and

1290
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.709
I go, oh, right. And it's like, yeah, I

1291
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.620
think, you know, and, and it's like I'm trying

1292
01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:36.490
to work something out and then by doing the

1293
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.720
action and by seeing the action, I then get

1294
01:10:39.729 --> 01:10:42.939
new insight into it. And so this is something

1295
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:46.020
that, you know, that manifests itself in many different

1296
01:10:46.029 --> 01:10:49.310
ways in conversation, but also in, you know, in

1297
01:10:49.319 --> 01:10:51.520
different kinds of learning or practice.

1298
01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:55.839
Well, you mentioned uh Susan Golden Medal and I'm

1299
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:59.020
actually about to interview her soon, soon.

1300
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.049
Hey, Susan is amazing. She's the

1301
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:05.549
best about her book thinking with your hands. So

1302
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.660
I guess that will get more into these kinds

1303
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:11.745
of questions. So uh so I have two more

1304
01:11:11.754 --> 01:11:14.935
questions for you today then. Um THE first one

1305
01:11:14.944 --> 01:11:18.134
is, how do you look at the future of

1306
01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:22.345
gesture research? I mean, what kinds of questions would

1307
01:11:22.354 --> 01:11:25.584
you like to see tackled or answered?

1308
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:29.339
Yeah, I mean, I would love to see and

1309
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:30.810
I think I alluded to this a little bit

1310
01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:35.910
earlier with, you know, talking about the um sort

1311
01:11:35.919 --> 01:11:37.720
of do ape gestures have meanings. I mean, I

1312
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:43.069
would really love to see sort of a, I

1313
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.370
don't wanna say breaking away from, but an opening

1314
01:11:45.379 --> 01:11:48.629
up of the way that people think about meaning

1315
01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.419
that we ask questions about meaning um in, in

1316
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.310
nonhuman animals broadly, but in, in ape gesture specifically

1317
01:11:56.319 --> 01:11:58.810
to me because, you know, that's the area I

1318
01:11:58.819 --> 01:12:03.069
work in. And I think, you know, we, we've

1319
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.270
for so long been trying to look for one

1320
01:12:07.279 --> 01:12:10.529
ape does something, another ape responds, you know, A

1321
01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.089
to B A to B A to B and

1322
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.830
that's great. It's really important fundamental work. Um But

1323
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:22.020
if we're also really interested in flexibility, we need

1324
01:12:22.029 --> 01:12:24.790
to kind of expand out from that to think

1325
01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.120
about the rare cases, to think about the, the

1326
01:12:28.129 --> 01:12:30.310
things we can't explain. And I think in, in

1327
01:12:30.319 --> 01:12:32.839
some ways the stuff we can't explain which oftentimes

1328
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.310
we just say, well, we excluded these other things

1329
01:12:35.319 --> 01:12:38.299
because they're always too complicated, you know, three party

1330
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:42.100
interactions or, you know, cases where you use a

1331
01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:45.850
gesture out of context and you're like, but, but

1332
01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:47.569
isn't that part of the date? Right? And I

1333
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.410
mean, I, I do this myself, I'm not trying

1334
01:12:49.419 --> 01:12:51.509
to say that like other people are doing bad

1335
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.209
work. I think all the work is, has been

1336
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.129
really important to building up a science of ape

1337
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.419
gesture. But I think now that we have a

1338
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:02.649
science, I think it frees us up to, to

1339
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.540
ask potentially, you know, harder questions um that, that

1340
01:13:08.549 --> 01:13:13.620
break away from, you know, simple A to B

1341
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:16.979
structures. I'm really excited about that possibility. I think

1342
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.910
it's really important. Um One of the things I

1343
01:13:18.919 --> 01:13:22.520
would love to, to look at personally and I

1344
01:13:22.529 --> 01:13:25.569
hope others will look at is um you know,

1345
01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:30.330
are things about non literal um gesture and in

1346
01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:34.180
particular play, I'm very interested in communicative play. So

1347
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:38.600
how, you know, and we, we have always looked

1348
01:13:38.609 --> 01:13:41.299
at at gestures that initiate play, but we never

1349
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:44.649
think about the gestures themselves as being play. So

1350
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:47.549
that's something that we know is incredibly important in

1351
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.509
humans. It's, you know, especially important in human Children

1352
01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.830
who, and we often are comparing the gestural systems

1353
01:13:53.839 --> 01:13:56.930
of human Children because they don't yet know language

1354
01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:01.029
to ape um the gestures of great apes who

1355
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.020
also don't know language but, but aren't gonna learn

1356
01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:06.879
language. And so, um so what we see in

1357
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:11.120
human Children is they use gestures in many creative,

1358
01:14:11.129 --> 01:14:16.629
spontaneous, playful, nonserious, weird ways. Um THEY also use

1359
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.759
them in many serious ways. But, but right now

1360
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:21.759
I'm interested in, in what happens outside of the

1361
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:25.310
predictable. And that's something that's been really hard for

1362
01:14:25.319 --> 01:14:28.830
us to, to look at an ape communication. Um

1363
01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:32.049
Because we've been trying to prove that there, you

1364
01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.560
know, there are predictable interesting ways, right? We've been

1365
01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:37.009
trying to say ape gesture is a thing. Yes,

1366
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.979
it has meanings. Yes. You know, it has intentional

1367
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:43.069
meanings. Yes. Uh But now that we've said that

1368
01:14:43.274 --> 01:14:45.774
hopefully, I think we can, we can kind of

1369
01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:48.345
take it for granted and start to look at

1370
01:14:48.354 --> 01:14:51.134
the things that, that are not part of that

1371
01:14:51.145 --> 01:14:55.975
expected structural intentional system, um which I think might

1372
01:14:55.984 --> 01:14:59.674
lead us to some, some more interesting insights about

1373
01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:02.774
how apes might be learning, might be playing, might

1374
01:15:02.785 --> 01:15:07.814
be uh you know, communicating with one another in,

1375
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:12.910
in unexpected ways and might be even uh using

1376
01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:16.149
gesture to think in addition to communicate.

1377
01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:23.220
So, does that connect to your project on whether

1378
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:25.979
ape apes have humor or not?

1379
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.500
Uh I ate a little bit, I think. Um,

1380
01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.490
AND yeah, and I mean, thanks for bringing that

1381
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.859
up. I know that's sort of like my new

1382
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:36.689
project that's, that's just coming out now. Um, I,

1383
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.169
uh, so potentially, I mean, we haven't, so I

1384
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.859
haven't yet done the thing that, you know, I

1385
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:45.919
want to do with, with looking at, at communicative

1386
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:50.770
play. But, but this project on, on, uh, playful

1387
01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:56.520
teasing, sort of, you know, humor adjacent. I try

1388
01:15:56.529 --> 01:15:59.080
not to use the word humor just because, um

1389
01:15:59.799 --> 01:16:01.799
you know, because it's a very loaded term and

1390
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.640
I think people have a lot of, of intuitions

1391
01:16:04.649 --> 01:16:06.700
about what it means. And so I try to

1392
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:07.359
use like

1393
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.609
it might offend comedians.

1394
01:16:10.569 --> 01:16:13.100
Exactly. You know, everyone's worried that A I is

1395
01:16:13.109 --> 01:16:14.959
coming for their jobs and the comedians will be

1396
01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.100
like the apes are coming for years, buddy. So,

1397
01:16:18.109 --> 01:16:21.140
um I, I don't think that's gonna happen anytime

1398
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:23.970
soon, but, but I do, uh I do think

1399
01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:28.580
that uh that, that looking at playful teasing and

1400
01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:32.120
sort of joking behavior in, in great apes um

1401
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.310
is, is something, is a space where we can

1402
01:16:36.319 --> 01:16:39.189
look for more flexibility. Um We can kind of

1403
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.729
build on some of the things that we've done

1404
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.629
in ape gesture. And that's actually where I started

1405
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.250
with the project was to take gestural coding systems

1406
01:16:46.259 --> 01:16:51.310
and apply them to interactions that, you know, weren't

1407
01:16:51.319 --> 01:16:54.669
necessarily gestural um to, you know, take the, the

1408
01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.959
criteria of intentionality, looking for per repetition and persistence

1409
01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:03.180
and directed behavior. Um But then, you know, sort

1410
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:06.979
of broaden that and, and look for uh sort

1411
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:10.290
of, you know, we created other criteria and, and

1412
01:17:10.299 --> 01:17:12.859
things that we were looking for as well, but,

1413
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:18.879
but to focus on interactions where one ape seems

1414
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:22.859
to be provoking another, uh but in a, in

1415
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:25.279
a playful way. And so I was really focusing

1416
01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:28.540
on um on the playful side of teasing rather

1417
01:17:28.549 --> 01:17:31.779
than the aggressive and bullying side of teasing. And

1418
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:36.970
that's something where um it where I think the

1419
01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:45.000
the cognition underlying that uh underlying those interactions might

1420
01:17:45.109 --> 01:17:50.569
be very uh illuminating about what one Ape understands

1421
01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.859
about another ape's mind. So do they understand what's

1422
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.009
going to be surprising to them? Do they understand

1423
01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.490
what's gonna push them too far? Do they understand

1424
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:05.009
what they're going to um you know, what's going

1425
01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:08.109
to get a rise out of them? Um And,

1426
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:10.680
and I think that that teasing is a really

1427
01:18:10.689 --> 01:18:15.549
interesting area because it's, it's kind of dangerous, right?

1428
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.370
It's in this gray area between being nice and

1429
01:18:18.379 --> 01:18:22.250
being mean and you absolutely can have mean teasing.

1430
01:18:22.259 --> 01:18:24.850
I think it's very important to be clear about

1431
01:18:24.859 --> 01:18:27.529
that. I'm not saying all teasing is nice but

1432
01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:31.520
teasing when it happens in a closer relationship. Um

1433
01:18:31.529 --> 01:18:34.919
LIKE the teasing between a parent and an infant

1434
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:38.339
or the teasing that happens in flirting, for example,

1435
01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.810
um you know, the or between close friends, those

1436
01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:46.379
kinds of teasing. Um YOU know, can tell you

1437
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:50.089
a lot about the social relationships and it can

1438
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.450
also be potentially. And this is what I'm, I

1439
01:18:52.459 --> 01:18:54.189
argue in our new work, it can be a,

1440
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.770
an opportunity to learn about the strength of your

1441
01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:01.410
relationship with that other individual and also potentially to,

1442
01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:04.470
to build that relationship and to strengthen it. And

1443
01:19:04.479 --> 01:19:06.640
so, um so, yeah, I think this is, this

1444
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:09.450
is something where it's not, I'm not specifically looking

1445
01:19:09.459 --> 01:19:12.000
at gestures within teasing, but I'm very interested in

1446
01:19:12.009 --> 01:19:16.290
looking at teasing as its own behavior um as

1447
01:19:16.299 --> 01:19:20.850
a as a site to, to study the social

1448
01:19:20.859 --> 01:19:24.410
cognition of um of great apes and potentially other

1449
01:19:24.419 --> 01:19:26.410
species. I mean, my, my whole goal in this

1450
01:19:26.419 --> 01:19:28.870
new project was to kind of argue that that

1451
01:19:28.879 --> 01:19:31.479
teasing, the playful teasing was a thing that teasing

1452
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:35.209
wasn't always bad and that it is its own

1453
01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.830
behavior that's different from play and different from, from

1454
01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:42.279
aggressive teasing. And then I think hopefully more people

1455
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.240
will become interested in and we can get more

1456
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.770
data about what other apes are doing about what

1457
01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:49.770
other species are doing. Um YOU know, about what,

1458
01:19:49.779 --> 01:19:51.930
you know, humans are doing in societies around the

1459
01:19:51.939 --> 01:19:55.560
world and hopefully to, to develop uh you know,

1460
01:19:55.569 --> 01:19:58.299
a sort of serious science of, you know, a

1461
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.919
nonserious behavior.

1462
01:20:00.859 --> 01:20:03.720
Great. So hopefully this will also serve as a

1463
01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:09.709
teaser to our future second interview to talk more

1464
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.200
about this point.

1465
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:14.640
Very, very happy. It has been really a delight.

1466
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:15.770
So,

1467
01:20:16.089 --> 01:20:18.189
yeah. So just before we go, would you like

1468
01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.479
to tell people where they can find you when

1469
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:22.000
you work on the internet?

1470
01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:27.839
Uh, ABSOLUTELY. I am, I am not on, on,

1471
01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:30.620
you know, what used to be Twitter. Um, ALTHOUGH

1472
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:32.970
I probably should be, but maybe I will do

1473
01:20:32.979 --> 01:20:34.359
that in the future. You can always look for

1474
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:36.279
my last name is weird. So you can always

1475
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:40.040
look for me. Um I, I'm just moved to,

1476
01:20:40.049 --> 01:20:43.040
to Indiana University, so I haven't gotten my lab

1477
01:20:43.049 --> 01:20:45.990
website up and running yet. But, um, if you

1478
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.750
look for my name in Indiana, um you'll find

1479
01:20:48.759 --> 01:20:51.600
my lab website by the time this comes out.

1480
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:56.000
And, um, and uh hopefully we'll also have some

1481
01:20:56.009 --> 01:20:58.790
new social media um along with that as well.

1482
01:20:58.799 --> 01:21:00.689
And one thing I just do before we end

1483
01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:04.970
is um separate from my lab. I also run

1484
01:21:04.979 --> 01:21:08.950
um, coun uh with my husband, uh the Diverse

1485
01:21:08.959 --> 01:21:11.959
Intelligences Summer Institute. And so that's something I would

1486
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:14.240
love people to, to check out. So we run

1487
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:16.640
a, a summer institute for three weeks every year

1488
01:21:16.649 --> 01:21:19.819
in Scotland. Um And you can check our website

1489
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:23.660
out at um D CD I si.org.

1490
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:27.879
Great. So, Doctor Cartmill, thank you so much again

1491
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:29.680

1492
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:31.669
It's been really fun to talk to you.

1493
01:21:32.279 --> 01:21:33.990
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I

1494
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.149
have a great time and um, Yeah, I, I

1495
01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.029
look forward to, to seeing more of more of

1496
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.689
your work and um hopefully talking again in the

1497
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.029
future.
