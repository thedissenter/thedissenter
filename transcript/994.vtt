00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.610
Center. I'm your host, Ricard Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:08.899
joined by Louis Bacho. He's a phd student at

4
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.859
the University of Kent and also the University of

5
00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.569
Lille. His research investigates the History and Sociology of

6
00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.559
Science and he's been particularly interested in contemporary misunderstandings

7
00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:24.600
of evolutionary science. And there are appropriations in online

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.590
debates around sex and gender. And so today, we're

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.649
going to focus a lot on how people from

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.549
the Manos Manos Spe Muse research in the evolutionary

11
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.240
sciences, evolutionary psychology, particularly, but also other sciences like

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.669
that. So Louis, welcome to the show. It's a

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.060
big pleasure to everyone. Thanks for having me. So

14
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.790
before we get into some of the claims that

15
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.389
people from the men insphere make about women about

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.169
seduction about gender roles and all of that, could

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.680
you start by telling us what the Manos sphere

18
00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.860
is? I mean, how would you define it?

19
00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.260
Yeah. So fortunately, uh even though there are disagreements

20
00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.720
about the different groups that go in there, um

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.459
there's quite a bit of consensus about what the

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.279
Manos sphere is. The harder thing is what you

23
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.419
put inside of it, but it's basically a loose

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.430
collection of men's groups on the internet. And they

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.970
tend to um try to cater to men from

26
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.709
a male perspective and to tell them about contemporary

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.709
issues in society, mostly Western society, once again, from

28
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.150
a masculine uh point of view. And so then

29
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.059
from then on, you have different subgroups that focus

30
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.019
on, on different themes and that have different agendas

31
00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:48.360
and different goals and methods. But basically online men's

32
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.000
groups that try to talk as men to other

33
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.730
men about, you know, the lives of men in

34
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:54.639
current society.

35
00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.209
Yeah. And so inside the menu sphere, you have

36
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.120
groups like for example, people related to uh um

37
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:07.610
Mras men's rights activists speak parts Mukta or men

38
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.919
going their own way, the Red Pill and Black

39
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.050
Pill communities and also some insults,

40
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.929
right? Yeah. So I use this typology with five

41
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.470
groups. You can find, you know, many different ones.

42
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:23.210
The internet goes very quickly movements um spawn new

43
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.610
hybrids of each other. They evolve all the time.

44
00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.639
But basically big five, I would say you have

45
00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.979
the men's rights activists. So they are the oldest

46
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.350
group in the Manos spe, they predate the internet.

47
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.559
So you can say they predate the Manoe too.

48
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.509
And they are kind of the opposites of feminism

49
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.899
for men in the sense that they want to

50
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.059
have reforms and cultural change on some issues that

51
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.130
are linked to men. So for example, a big

52
00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.050
one is uh divorce laws or, you know, custody

53
00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.339
battles in court after a divorce. Well, you are

54
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.669
going to find fathers rights groups who try to

55
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.389
the divorced fathers interests. Um And so they do

56
00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.869
tend to be opposed to feminists around issues of,

57
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.789
you know, domestic violence divorce where, you know, both

58
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.020
sides basically take the sides of men or women.

59
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.449
Um, YOU then have pick up artists, they are

60
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.160
the other older ones. So they are your dating

61
00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.300
seduction coaches. So maybe less ideological because more commercial

62
00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.630
to try to sell you a service. But still

63
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.360
they've been there from the beginning and they've influenced

64
00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.919
the language and the ideas of the manoe quite

65
00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.809
a bit. And then in more recent years, you've

66
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.639
had um upsurge in new maybe more radical uh

67
00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:40.460
communities, more misogynistic communities. So the three that are

68
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.000
specifically online because the first two I told you

69
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.240
about they existed before the internet. You had dating

70
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.009
coaches, you had men's rights activists. But the new

71
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.110
three from the two thousands, 2010 would be the

72
00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.279
Rick Pill, which is kind of a combination of

73
00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.470
the pickup artistry the game. So that's how they

74
00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.720
call seduction techniques. And you have more, you know,

75
00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.639
right wing politics in their anti PC culture, anti

76
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.229
progressivism and also just a whole life philosophy of

77
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.399
how to be a successful independent alpha male, et

78
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.130
cetera, et cetera. So that would be the red

79
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.970
pill. Mik Tao share a lot with the red

80
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.988
pill. So Mik Tao means men going their own

81
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.119
way, but they say society is too hostile to

82
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.940
men right now. So we should just live on

83
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.940
our own. So they are separatists and they advocate

84
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.260
primarily against any form of, you know, serious relationship

85
00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:38.779
or commitment, uh romantic or sexual with a woman.

86
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.049
And the most infamous one these days, uh The

87
00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.899
best known one are, I think undoubtedly Incels because

88
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.410
they have committed a few terror attacks in the

89
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.049
past decade. And these are um in young men,

90
00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.329
mostly who are uh virgins and who are, who

91
00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.410
have an entire identity based upon this sex lessness

92
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.899
and you know, this frustration of anger and bitterness

93
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.809
at not being able to find a, a relationship.

94
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:09.070
Mhm

95
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.170
And uh so you told us there about some

96
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.420
of the differences between these groups, but are there

97
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.140
general beliefs that you find across all these groups

98
00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:23.700
or are they very different or diverse ideologically?

99
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.279
Yeah. So that was one of the, I think

100
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.179
challenges of trying to study the Manoe is trying

101
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.679
to find the, the common themes running through them,

102
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.359
trying to identify what makes them a Manoe because

103
00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.660
otherwise, why would we be using this term if

104
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.500
they have nothing in common? And I think for

105
00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.600
sure what you find is that there's the overall

106
00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:47.880
discourse that there is some sort of male crisis

107
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.679
or malaise in Western society. So they will focus

108
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.799
on different goals, different aspects of it. So in

109
00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.589
cells we talk about maybe uh all the males

110
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.880
except the best looking ones and they will focus

111
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.279
on relationships and sex. Men's rights activists will focus

112
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.059
on false rape allegations and, and reproductive rights for

113
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.200
men. So they have different focuses, but they kind

114
00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:16.250
of all operate in this assumption that uh men

115
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.250
have a tough time in current society. Um There

116
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.070
might even be some sort of male crisis that

117
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.690
feminism hasn't been doing anything to try to combat

118
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.989
this or on the other hand, has been promoting

119
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.940
and furthering this by just either they will think

120
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.529
it has gone too far in defending women's rights

121
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.799
and interests or it was always some sort of

122
00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:40.350
anti male political lobby or something like that. So

123
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:43.850
I think that's one of the trope that's uh

124
00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:46.739
common to all these groups. And then they also

125
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.140
share a lot of jargon language, you know, terms

126
00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.760
that are specific to the manoe that circulate between

127
00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:57.510
those communities um and some sense of community as

128
00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.040
well. Uh You know, people go there and they

129
00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:03.059
share their experiences in, in the fraternal environment. So

130
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.630
you might think manos here and think about the

131
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.070
violence and the misogyny that's directed towards others, uh

132
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.125
which is definitely a feature. But now if you

133
00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:14.605
go to those spaces, you will also see brotherhood

134
00:07:14.614 --> 00:07:18.125
between guys, uh you know that open up and

135
00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:20.845
talk about their relationships, their emotions, et cetera, et

136
00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:24.665
cetera. So I would say that solidarity. Um The

137
00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:28.464
anti feminism and the idea of a male crisis,

138
00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:31.885
male molest would be the, the big three of

139
00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:34.434
things that run through all the groups. Mhm

140
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.410
So I wanted to focus now a bit on

141
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.010
female sexuality and claims that these different groups make

142
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.850
about this topic. But before we get into the

143
00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:48.670
claims specifically, let me just ask you when it

144
00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:52.260
comes to female sexuality, what would you think are

145
00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:55.329
the most important things for people to know about

146
00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:58.549
it when they get across this kind of information

147
00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.049
on the internet from the mens here?

148
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.269
So I would think that what you find on

149
00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:08.730
the internet on the manos spe can be quite

150
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.440
remote from what, what you will find in actual

151
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.929
scientific papers. So sometimes it's explicitly drawn from a

152
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.549
paper, but you have the, the memes, you have

153
00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:20.839
the tropes, you have the exaggerations, all these layers

154
00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:23.600
uh in the politics, frankly, the fact that, you

155
00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:27.940
know, if someone fits your preconceived idea, it will

156
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.059
be exaggerated. So my main advice for someone would

157
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.719
just be to and that's an advice in general,

158
00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.400
of course, go to the original source. Um There

159
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.719
are some sources like science media or podcasts like

160
00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:43.299
yours that I'm sure are um or textbooks that

161
00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:46.419
are good sources, secondary sources that you can trust

162
00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:48.869
and believe that they made a good job in

163
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.750
trying to honestly transcribe what was in the original

164
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.750
research as comes to the Manos spe this can

165
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.369
be the case. If you look, if you go

166
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.169
to the Incel Wikipedia, they have a big wiki

167
00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:02.340
page on Testosterone, which is very well documented and

168
00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:05.080
lots of footnotes and they love science. Uh That's

169
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.159
been one of the findings of my research. But

170
00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:11.659
sometimes it's a commercially incentivized type of platform that

171
00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:14.289
tries to sell, you know, horses and seminars to

172
00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:16.960
men. Sometimes it's just a guy who doesn't seem

173
00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:19.320
to understand the basic principles very well. So I

174
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.359
would say as a rule, if you know that

175
00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:23.729
the source comes from the atmosphere, you just better

176
00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:27.229
go check the research itself and look for yourself

177
00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:29.820
is the sex difference that big uh what did

178
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.599
the researchers find? Does it allow to make this

179
00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:35.760
very broad generalization about the sexes and things like

180
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.320
that? You know.

181
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.320
Yeah, but this is very interesting because even looking

182
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.830
at it from a, from a historical perspective, I

183
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.719
guess that we could say, and you will tell

184
00:09:46.729 --> 00:09:49.250
me more about that. Uh We could say that

185
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.630
some early evolutionary accounts of female sexuality insisted on

186
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.460
some of the points that uh people from the

187
00:09:57.469 --> 00:10:01.289
Manoe also bring to the table like women being

188
00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:05.760
coy and uh having monogamous tendencies and stuff like

189
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.109
that,

190
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.710
right? So, since Darwin's time in evolutionary biology and

191
00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:15.409
the idea of sexual selection, um Darwin had this

192
00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:18.530
big thought that it's mostly the males who kind

193
00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:22.039
of parades and fights and they try to catch

194
00:10:22.049 --> 00:10:24.719
the female's attention and then the females choose. So

195
00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:26.880
it was called female choice. And it's still thought

196
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.739
to be a huge, you know, driving factor in

197
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.599
evolution, uh, explaining the antlers of D A or

198
00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:34.799
the, the plumage of the birds of paradise, et

199
00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:39.059
cetera, et cetera. But interestingly, Darwin was so steeped

200
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.099
in the, in the cultural mindset of his time

201
00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.890
that he thought that seems to be true in

202
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.960
all the animals except for humans. So he said

203
00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:48.299
in humans, it seems to be the women who

204
00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:50.960
dress up, who dress up with these frills and

205
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.059
laces and who parade in front of the men.

206
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.840
And it's actually the men who select. Um So

207
00:10:56.849 --> 00:10:58.929
even then you can see that there was politics

208
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.450
that he didn't really maybe apply what he was

209
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.349
seeing uh to his own species on this little

210
00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:09.270
area. So that was your traditional model and that

211
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.030
worked quite well, right? We know that males have

212
00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:15.929
more reproductive variants in mammals because, you know, insemination

213
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.659
cost them, you know, from five seconds to 2030

214
00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:22.039
minutes. I don't know, whereas uh females have to

215
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:26.349
go through the, the gestation process. And so it

216
00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:29.659
did mean that there was selective pressure, increased, selective

217
00:11:29.669 --> 00:11:32.510
pressure on young males to, you know, fight and

218
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.489
grow bigger and reproduce quick and early. So that's

219
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.330
how you explain sexual dimorphism. And that mostly stood

220
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.609
in evolutionary biology until the 19 seventies. And then,

221
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:50.260
you know, some primatologists in particular started noticing that

222
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.320
this just didn't fit what we were observing. You

223
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:57.280
know, females seem to be sometimes aggressive, manipulative, deceitful,

224
00:11:57.289 --> 00:12:00.679
horny. And then what we just realized is that

225
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.950
they were, of course, also selected to selective pressures

226
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.150
and there were also players in the games of

227
00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:10.679
sexual selection. Sure males might be fighting and there

228
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.239
tends to be this bias in biology where you

229
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.025
notice the males more because they're louder because they

230
00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:18.664
are brighter because they fight more. They are more

231
00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:21.965
rowdy. And so we kind of tended to overlook

232
00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.924
all the ways in which females also competed for

233
00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:27.974
reproduction. And even though there is less variants and

234
00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:30.094
they have less to win quote unquote in terms

235
00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:33.765
of fitness um in the Darwinian game than males

236
00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:36.905
because, you know, a single man can sire 500

237
00:12:36.914 --> 00:12:40.599
offspring. There's still huge variants. I mean, some females

238
00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:44.000
do not reproduce and some have 356 kids. So

239
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.150
there was also a selective pressure there. And since

240
00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:50.719
then, we have started investigated, uh you know, all

241
00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.830
these aspects of female sexuality, all these potential fitness

242
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.280
benefits that they can derive. And um what's interesting

243
00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:02.239
is that I would say the impetus behind this

244
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.309
was originally feminist. It was those female researchers saying

245
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.039
we have this male bias in our discipline, we

246
00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:12.359
look at female behavior quite less. We don't see

247
00:13:12.369 --> 00:13:17.929
females as competitive as potentially promiscuous. We just are

248
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:23.260
stuck in this Darwinian inherited framework where they are,

249
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.890
you know, coy and shy and choosy et cetera,

250
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.200
which can, which can hold for some species in

251
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.489
some context. But they were asking to complicate the

252
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.750
picture. And what's funny is that those, this line

253
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.349
of research on the female mating strategy has kind

254
00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:42.330
of complex the picture of female nature. Right now,

255
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.900
you put competition, you put uh deceit manipulation, gossip,

256
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:50.419
aggression, coalitions. They are just, you know, organisms like

257
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:54.679
others. There are no, you know, perfect beings and,

258
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.630
but that was seen as feminist, you know, sex

259
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.500
is good. Um Females can be promiscuous as well.

260
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.630
There's nothing bad about it. And we have been

261
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.820
biased in our biology. What's interesting is that today

262
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.799
in the manoe, the people love these theories, they

263
00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:12.320
love these hypotheses around female mating strategies. So I

264
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.229
wouldn't say they're really echoing the old school 19th

265
00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:18.489
century Darwin style thing where they think that females

266
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.429
are coy and choosy. On the other hand, I

267
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.679
think they have an exacerbated view of how promiscuous

268
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.719
and unfaithful women are based on these accounts of

269
00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:32.099
female sexuality that come from the evolutionary sciences and

270
00:14:32.109 --> 00:14:34.979
they were originally kind of feminist inspired.

271
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.859
Ok. Now, that's very interesting. Yeah. And yeah, actually,

272
00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:41.289
I should have said I should have rephrased my

273
00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:45.549
question and said that these early evolutionary accounts are

274
00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:49.070
the ones that uh people from the men insphere

275
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.239
would have liked to be true because you hear

276
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.429
many times from them that um women should, uh,

277
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.119
be monogamous, should stay faithful to their husbands or

278
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.690
their boyfriends. But, uh, but then when it comes

279
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.280
to men they can actually just, uh, screw around

280
00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:12.289
with, uh, with how many women they can. It

281
00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:15.130
doesn't matter if they are married or if they're

282
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.880
in a committed relationship, they can do that. Uh,

283
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.489
THEY are allowed to do that but the women,

284
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.219
no, not really.

285
00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:28.239
Right. So, there is this insistence on what they

286
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.840
will call body count or trying to find a

287
00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:35.210
sexual partner who has very little uh sexual experience

288
00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:37.869
or relationship experience because they would think that it

289
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.289
makes for just a better and more committed partner.

290
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.169
And they will find some research in, for example,

291
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:46.580
sociology that show that the more partners you've had,

292
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.780
the less likely it is that your marriage is

293
00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:51.059
gonna, is gonna end up well or that you're

294
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.669
the more likely it is that you're going to

295
00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:56.070
divorce, et cetera. So they do have this age

296
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.390
old, sexual double standard for sure where uh you

297
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.479
have a lot of scrutiny on a woman's sexual

298
00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:04.549
history and you don't care much about a man's

299
00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:05.260
for sure.

300
00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.940
Yeah. And by the way, since earlier, you were

301
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.349
talking a little bit about what could be some

302
00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:16.700
of the benefits of short term and extra pair

303
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.320
mating for women. What are those benefits?

304
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.640
So I think it's first important to understand why

305
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.219
we asked the question. Um For males, there wasn't

306
00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:31.070
really ever that question about what could be the

307
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.570
benefit for a male mammal of, you know, being

308
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.150
very horny all the time or trying to reproduce.

309
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.320
Because, you know, they can just, in most species,

310
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.460
I think 95% of mammal species, there are no

311
00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:48.159
real fathers in the sense that fathers just reproduce

312
00:16:48.169 --> 00:16:50.030
and then they leave. Uh, YOU, you, if you've

313
00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:51.700
had cats and dogs, you know, that's how it

314
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.549
goes. So for most species, we really know what's

315
00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:58.609
going on with males, probably over evolutionary history, any

316
00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:01.119
time they could evolve in a way that's, you

317
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.960
know, made them likely to play this reproductive game

318
00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:05.910
and not pay any of the costs and that

319
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.709
they could just uh inseminate a female and, and

320
00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:11.170
then go away, that probably seems to have happened

321
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.020
in most species. However, for females, there was always

322
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.839
this idea that there was a huge limiting factor,

323
00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:20.229
right? It's the number of eggs, but it's also

324
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:24.358
mainly the gestation, the lactation, you have to take

325
00:17:24.368 --> 00:17:27.250
care of your offspring for maybe years before you

326
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.430
can get another one. So then this was the

327
00:17:29.439 --> 00:17:33.150
puzzle. If that is the case, how come that

328
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.369
when we study other female uh mammals, especially primates,

329
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.449
they seem to solicitate and enjoy also population that

330
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:45.020
much. How come they were wired by evolution to

331
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.469
become so uh promiscuous as you will find that

332
00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:52.040
term in the research literature, when the benefits are

333
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.449
unclear, you can mate with 12 males you're not

334
00:17:55.459 --> 00:17:59.449
gonna have 12 times more offspring. So the researchers

335
00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:03.400
start started to devise um hypothesis. One of them

336
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.020
that's been studied quite well in primates is paternity

337
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.489
confusion. So if you sleep around with uh several

338
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.420
males, none of them will be able to know

339
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.050
that they are the fathers of your offspring. And

340
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.699
so they will maybe all directly help raise them,

341
00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:23.010
or at least they will refrain from killing them

342
00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.849
because in a lot of crime and societies, if

343
00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:27.839
a new male comes around and that he knows

344
00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:29.920
that the, the kids are not his, he's just

345
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.469
gonna murder them to kind of, you know, replace

346
00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:35.099
them with his own offspring. Or at least that's

347
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.989
the evolutionary selective pressure there. I'm not, I'm not

348
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.454
sure that's what he thinks about coming. I don't

349
00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:44.135
know what's in Ali's head, but uh that's basically

350
00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:46.724
how this could have evolved. So as a counter

351
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:50.645
strategy against the infanticides by males, maybe sleeping around

352
00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:53.055
with several males could have allowed those, you know,

353
00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:58.515
female primates uh to infuse the potential fathers. So

354
00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:02.339
that's one of the potential benefits. So it's called

355
00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:08.660
paternity confusion hypothesis. You have made switching hypothesis. So

356
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.589
you are going to kind of sample other partners,

357
00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.780
other mates uh to kind of see if maybe

358
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.619
it's worth switching or having at least cultivating some

359
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.060
form of backup. You know, life is dangerous in

360
00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:22.579
nature. Uh If you have kids to raise, it

361
00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:25.910
can be nice to have backups. There's the resources,

362
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.010
the resource based hypothesis where, you know, you might

363
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.489
just be um having sex with several males because

364
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.819
you get several direct benefits from that be, you

365
00:19:34.829 --> 00:19:38.800
know, food. I know shelter, protection, bodyguards, all types

366
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.800
of things. And um I don't think there's one

367
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.219
hypothesis that could stand for all the female mammals.

368
00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:49.569
For example, the, the answer is probably that depending

369
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:52.930
on the ecological conditions and depending on the particular,

370
00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:55.920
you know, social structure of a species, you probably

371
00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:01.099
find uh infidelity quote unquote or a multiple mating,

372
00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:05.089
extra pair mating. Uh THAT'S evolved in females in

373
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.540
through many evolutionary paths because there are many potential

374
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.770
benefits that were overlooked. We thought, oh yeah, a

375
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.650
female just needs one partner. She doesn't need to

376
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.209
enjoy sex and you know, she'll just select the

377
00:20:18.219 --> 00:20:20.760
best father she can. And that's all she does.

378
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.489
One father, best seed, best genes, best parents. And

379
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.599
then that's perfect for, for her offspring. Now, that

380
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:30.459
model still holds in many species, but it's more

381
00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:33.400
complicated. And I think we also found that through

382
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.459
bird studies. So birds are interesting to study these

383
00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:40.160
dynamics because they kind of resemble us in the

384
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.760
sense that um they are relatively monogamous in a

385
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.540
lot of species. And you have the, the father

386
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.640
and the mother building a nest and raising the

387
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.719
the the young birds. So it kind of looks

388
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:57.390
like a human family. And uh that's also because

389
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.650
in birds, I think the males could not kind

390
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:06.199
of like the mammals evolved to just inseminate females

391
00:21:06.209 --> 00:21:08.170
and leave because a bird just takes a lot

392
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.099
of feeding to do. Birds are very hungry for

393
00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:13.329
food because they fly all the time. Their metabolism

394
00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:15.829
is different. So birds just spend their days eating

395
00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:18.109
and finding food. So they've evolved in that way.

396
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.250
That means that they are ideal candidates to study

397
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.300
monogamy. And then when we started doing DNA tracking,

398
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.959
we also thought that there was much more sleeping

399
00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:30.890
around than we believed initially in birds. You know,

400
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.819
so they are, you know, like us partly monogamous.

401
00:21:33.829 --> 00:21:36.619
But we also have rhythms of evidence that in

402
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.069
certain contexts, either the male or the female will

403
00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:42.074
go to another nest and try to make with

404
00:21:42.084 --> 00:21:44.525
other people. And we need to explain that because

405
00:21:44.535 --> 00:21:48.334
our sexual selection models historically were quite monogamous. You

406
00:21:48.344 --> 00:21:51.145
know, finding a good mate for the female. Here

407
00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:54.015
are the challenges she faces and finding a good

408
00:21:54.025 --> 00:21:55.814
mate for a male. Here is what he is

409
00:21:55.824 --> 00:21:59.285
looking for, but it's actually much more complex and

410
00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:02.915
there are many individuals to choose from. And yeah,

411
00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:05.775
the so the picture has been complex for sure.

412
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.020
Yeah. And another kind of topic that is also

413
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.510
commonly brought up in man in the Manos Spe

414
00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:16.920
Manoe podcasts and stuff like that has to do

415
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.300
with some research on the on the female ovulatory

416
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.770
cycle. So first of all, what does the research

417
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.869
action we say, and in what ways do people

418
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.810
from the manos tend to uh take from that

419
00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:34.530
research or misuse it or twist it, twist it,

420
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.449
warp it. Uh uh I mean, what are the

421
00:22:37.459 --> 00:22:41.560
kinds of claims that they make and shouldn't be

422
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:44.290
derived directly from the research?

423
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.880
Yes. So one class of hypothesis about the evolution

424
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.869
of female sexuality that I haven't mentioned is called

425
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.859
the dual mating strategy hypothesis. And so this means

426
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:58.510
that uh women, let's talk about humans. So I'm

427
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.869
gonna stop saying females. So uh women might have

428
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.109
evolved a drive for extra per mating over evolutionary

429
00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:12.109
history. If uh for example, they could derive some

430
00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:15.959
benefits from short term mating. So just having casual

431
00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:19.329
sex can provide you sometimes maybe good genes in

432
00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:21.890
terms of fitness, it can provide you all those

433
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.609
class of benefits and then you also have a

434
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:28.260
long term mate that you select for stability, providing

435
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.780
resources, being a father. And then maybe those two

436
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.479
things could have evolved concurrently so that women would

437
00:23:35.489 --> 00:23:38.140
be, you know, kind of wired with uh drives

438
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.010
that both make them monogamous. But in certain circumstances,

439
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.810
they might have this interest for short term meeting.

440
00:23:45.229 --> 00:23:48.849
And so one of the predictions of that hypothesis

441
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:52.969
was that around ovulation, when women are most fertile

442
00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:55.819
in the fertile phase of the cycle, you would

443
00:23:55.829 --> 00:23:59.939
have find maybe behavioral shifts. Because once again, over

444
00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:02.979
history, if you are having casual sex on the

445
00:24:02.989 --> 00:24:05.880
side, just at the moment when you're fertile, it

446
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.839
could mean that uh if you sleep with uh

447
00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:12.430
partners where you can kind of, you can see

448
00:24:12.439 --> 00:24:14.609
it's a complex type of hypothesis. It was kind

449
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.250
of far fetched, but some of it's interesting to

450
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.390
discuss. But if you sleep basically with a muscular,

451
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.000
tall, masculine uh man, someone who signals that he

452
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.400
has good genes around ovulation. And maybe you can,

453
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.390
you know, diversify the, the fathers of your offspring,

454
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.079
maybe you can have, you know, strong sons and

455
00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:36.560
sexy sons, which was also part of this class

456
00:24:36.569 --> 00:24:39.290
of hypothesis. And so one of the predictions for

457
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.390
that and we started testing, it is do women's

458
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.130
that women's sexual behavior actually change around ovulation. And

459
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.680
if it does and if the dual mating hypothesis

460
00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:52.189
is true, it means that they should be looking

461
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:55.180
for a more masculine partner, they should be looking

462
00:24:55.189 --> 00:24:58.489
for, you know, more casual sex just around ovulation.

463
00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:01.900
They should maybe behave in a more, you know,

464
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:07.949
flirty, alluring manner. And uh some initial studies found

465
00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:11.079
that so studies found that oh some strippers uh

466
00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:14.420
receive more tips around ovulation. So maybe men can

467
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.939
unconsciously perceive when a woman ovulates and maybe women

468
00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:20.670
can signal it differently. There were diary studies where

469
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.785
uh women were asked to say in their diary,

470
00:25:23.795 --> 00:25:25.535
what day of the cycle they were in. And

471
00:25:25.545 --> 00:25:28.005
also, you know, if they are having sexual fantasies

472
00:25:28.015 --> 00:25:31.314
about someone else or their partner, et cetera and

473
00:25:31.324 --> 00:25:35.375
there were studies about face preferences. Do women actually

474
00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:38.844
want partners with more masculine faces and features around

475
00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:42.449
ovulation and more or less, all of this has

476
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:45.479
failed to replicate or as foundered when the studies

477
00:25:45.489 --> 00:25:48.449
are being conducted in more rigorous manners with bigger

478
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:52.089
samples and all the good controls and conditions that

479
00:25:52.099 --> 00:25:54.829
you need to make good research. This research which

480
00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:56.930
was mostly from the two thousands has not really

481
00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.050
replicated well. So for example, there was a study

482
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.699
which found that women wore more revealing clothes when

483
00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:07.099
they were around ovulation. But then you look at

484
00:26:07.109 --> 00:26:11.349
the study, it was maybe 30 women. They excluded

485
00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:14.069
all those who were, you know, not naturally cycling,

486
00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:16.089
who are on the pill. They only took those

487
00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:18.790
who were in relationships and they did not control

488
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.949
for the weather. So they, they, they had them

489
00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:22.880
come at two points of the cycle, but maybe

490
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.589
they were just dressed, dressed more lightly and loosely

491
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.099
because the sun was shining better. And now in

492
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:30.250
the 2000 and twenties, you have some, you know,

493
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.599
good teams of researchers from Germany who try to

494
00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:35.400
replicate the same effects, but they take hundreds of

495
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.410
respondents, they control for all the good parameters, the

496
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.849
preregistered hypotheses, and we mostly failed to replicate most

497
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:45.969
of the effects that were specifically linked to these

498
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:50.140
ovulatory shifts uh hypothesis. That was a corollary of

499
00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:54.359
the dual mating strategy hypothesis, which meant that maybe

500
00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:58.739
women had those two different uh types of reproductive

501
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.449
drives. And so, one of the only thing we

502
00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:04.339
have that holds is that there is a general

503
00:27:04.349 --> 00:27:08.150
increase in sex drive around ovulation in women that

504
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.260
seems to be certain. However, we are not sure

505
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.020
at all that it's directed towards some extra pair

506
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.479
partners doesn't seem to necessarily imply they want to

507
00:27:17.489 --> 00:27:19.619
have more sex like on the side or with

508
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.310
someone else when they're in a committed relationship. This

509
00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:24.810
means that whatever is happening with the hormones is

510
00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:28.010
just making them hornier on ovulation, which from an

511
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.369
evolutionary perspective, uh is not that hard to explain.

512
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.380
But um so that's the entire brand line of

513
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:39.229
research that you were mentioning. And why does it

514
00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:44.040
pleases people in the manoe? Well, though there's, you

515
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.530
know, this idea that they will take any research

516
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.880
about female promiscuity, they will take any research about

517
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.489
female infidelity. And since they have those negative opinions

518
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.130
about it, since they're quite maybe conservative implicitly about,

519
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.660
you know, females sexuality, they have those double standards

520
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.209
that we mentioned, they are angry, those this research

521
00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:06.959
is perfect for them. You know, it can anger

522
00:28:06.969 --> 00:28:09.920
them, it can kind of convert some of their

523
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.170
tropes that they have. So some tropes that you

524
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.569
find are even if you're in a relationship, she's

525
00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:18.290
always looking for something else. You know, she's unfaithful,

526
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.250
she wants more masculine alpha or chad type males.

527
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.050
Well, if you have studies that show that she

528
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.920
is having more fantasies, sexual fantasies or wants more

529
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.969
masculine faces around ovulation that just fodder for your

530
00:28:32.979 --> 00:28:36.900
uh anger if you will or if you thing

531
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.770
that, you know, women are not to be trusted

532
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.729
with and when they go to the club that

533
00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:43.880
with their, you know, girlfriends, they are going to

534
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.530
be unfaithful and try to seduce other men. And

535
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.920
then you find a study that shows that, oh,

536
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.849
strippers get more tips around ovulation or women dress

537
00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:56.739
more loosely around ovulation. It just kind of feels

538
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.619
uh fuels your entire narrative. But more than this

539
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.150
in the Red Pill, they have a saying which

540
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.369
is exactly the mirror of this dual mating strategy

541
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.300
hypothesis. And they know it. So that's quite interesting

542
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.079
to show that they are aware of those kind

543
00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:17.829
of intricate debates, debates in evolutionary psychology that seems

544
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.260
to be kind of abstract and really specialized. But

545
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.550
you actually have communities of lay people on the

546
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.170
internet that are aware of this and that say,

547
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:29.050
oh, this is mate switching. No, this is dual

548
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.369
meaning they are aware about these things. They just

549
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.540
forget that these are hypotheses and that's several of

550
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.619
them can work together and all be true and

551
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.689
that this is all highly speculative at the moment,

552
00:29:40.699 --> 00:29:43.300
you know, and so they have this saying in

553
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.260
the red tail community, that's alpha fox beta bucks.

554
00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:49.089
So which means that the alpha man gets to

555
00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:52.510
have sex, alpha thugs. And the beta man is

556
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.079
the man who's just providing the resources. He's just

557
00:29:55.089 --> 00:29:58.319
the poor guy who's being, you know, exploited for

558
00:29:58.329 --> 00:30:06.550
his resources by an Anthropoid strategy that basically says

559
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.849
if women maybe have a drive of pretension today

560
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:15.930
for infidelity, it comes because of a legacy of

561
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:19.089
this alpha beta bugs dynamic where they would have

562
00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:22.219
one stable partner that they selected with one set

563
00:30:22.229 --> 00:30:25.569
of preferences and then some casual sex partners that

564
00:30:25.579 --> 00:30:28.209
she could have selected through other preferences. And that

565
00:30:28.219 --> 00:30:31.089
obviously, you know, is perfect confirmation for them. But

566
00:30:31.099 --> 00:30:33.910
it's also, you know, perfect rage fuel as the

567
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.930
Incel say that is something that just makes you

568
00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:36.689
really angry.

569
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.420
Mhm uh And so another thing that people from

570
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.069
the mens sphere do if I understand it correctly

571
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:48.310
is that they also it's cherry peak uh scientific

572
00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:52.150
information or cherry peak studies, right? Because for example,

573
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.680
just earlier, you were mentioning how most studies that

574
00:30:56.689 --> 00:31:00.550
made those claims regarding the dual mating strategy, sexism

575
00:31:00.569 --> 00:31:03.369
and hypothesis and so on were from the early

576
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.449
two thousands. And then since then, people have tried

577
00:31:06.459 --> 00:31:11.229
to replicate them with better study designs, bigger samples

578
00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:13.709
and stuff like that. And uh some of at

579
00:31:13.719 --> 00:31:17.290
least some of those claims do not hold much

580
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.579
water, at least as far as we know now,

581
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.979
but they are in the manoe, they are still

582
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.939
going back to those studies and uh claiming that

583
00:31:27.949 --> 00:31:29.699
that is all true right?

584
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.400
To be fair. I would say that that's also

585
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.630
something you can find in science, I mean, when

586
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.520
someone is committed to some hypothesis, they will kind

587
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.630
of always pick up the same study, try to

588
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.390
confirm their referred hypothesis. And I would say to

589
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.579
some degree that's even part of the healthy game

590
00:31:45.589 --> 00:31:47.290
of science. You know, some people believe in a

591
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.469
hypothesis to try to investigate it. Now, they should

592
00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:52.229
not hold on to it too long if the

593
00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:57.579
evidence of course fails to confirm their hypothesis. But

594
00:31:57.589 --> 00:31:59.239
I think part of what happens in the manners

595
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.150
sphere is that um the cherry picking, I'm gonna

596
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.300
describe it and answer you on this point. And

597
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.729
then afterwards, we can come back to the implicit,

598
00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:09.969
I think part of your question, which is what's

599
00:32:09.979 --> 00:32:12.430
their motives? What's their intent? Is it? Yeah,

600
00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:15.089
that was another thing that I was going to

601
00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:15.930
ask you. So

602
00:32:15.939 --> 00:32:18.209
cherry picking, we can find evidence for sure. But

603
00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:20.545
as I said, in any literature review by a

604
00:32:20.555 --> 00:32:22.885
scholar, you're likely to find some things that they

605
00:32:22.895 --> 00:32:24.564
like a little more, some that they like it

606
00:32:24.574 --> 00:32:26.775
less. But this is of course exacerbated when there

607
00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:30.785
are politics and those groups don't necessarily, their goal

608
00:32:30.795 --> 00:32:33.535
is not to accurately depict the world. You know,

609
00:32:33.545 --> 00:32:35.875
that's the goal of scientists, more or less all

610
00:32:35.885 --> 00:32:38.964
of them. Uh But, you know, manager groups all

611
00:32:38.974 --> 00:32:42.324
have a different goal, you know, recruit men. Um

612
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.729
Have you seduced women or on the other hand,

613
00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:47.640
trying to convince you to never have sex with

614
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.560
women again. So of course, what I would call

615
00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:53.219
the cherry picking is that depending on their agenda,

616
00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:56.319
you will see that they focus on different areas

617
00:32:56.329 --> 00:33:00.469
of the evolutionary scientific literature. So the most obvious

618
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:04.119
case is picnic artists and incels, they hate each

619
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.729
other. They kind of try to attract the same

620
00:33:06.739 --> 00:33:09.770
demographic, you know, young sexless men who kind of

621
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.849
roam the internet. And in the two thousands, those

622
00:33:12.859 --> 00:33:15.020
guys would have found pick up artist sites that

623
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.349
would have told them. Listen, here are my 10

624
00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:19.780
tips to be successful with women. I'm gonna explain

625
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.670
to you female psychology with evolution. And now in

626
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.790
the 2000 and twenties, those same young guys, there

627
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.119
is competition with the intel community that are going

628
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.780
to tell them. Listen, you are doomed, you were

629
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.540
doomed from the start because of your genetics. She

630
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.859
will only be interested in uh having sex with

631
00:33:37.869 --> 00:33:40.420
chads and here's the science to back it up.

632
00:33:40.969 --> 00:33:43.589
So if you look at those two communities, they

633
00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:47.930
will all cite some sections, some parts of the

634
00:33:47.939 --> 00:33:52.410
literature, but it's obviously with very different focus because

635
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.400
of their agenda. So you could call that cherry

636
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:58.020
picking. For example, pickup artists are gonna insist on

637
00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.469
female mating preferences for things that you can change

638
00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:05.579
or engineer. So they will say uh confidence is

639
00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:07.959
sexy. You know, studies have shown that women want

640
00:34:07.969 --> 00:34:12.370
confident men or uh hu humor is very attractive.

641
00:34:12.379 --> 00:34:14.668
So you should be funny. You should be confident.

642
00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.469
So they will zoom in on the things that

643
00:34:17.478 --> 00:34:22.280
you can change. Whereas Incels, they will take other

644
00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:25.780
equally valid and they can interpret them correctly. There's

645
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.958
not necessarily a conscious twisting of the results, but

646
00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.100
they will say here is the results about the

647
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.580
negative effects of uh being artistic in sex and

648
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.540
dating, being short, having a small penis, being bald,

649
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.780
being this that so all things that you can

650
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.000
and very hardly or if not at all change.

651
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.938
So once again, some of them are commercial, they

652
00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.050
are trying to sell you hope. And so they

653
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.188
say here's this research, there's hope for you. And

654
00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:58.060
then this little group is trying to peddle hopelessness.

655
00:34:58.219 --> 00:35:01.320
And it says, look at this research, it's doomed.

656
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.439
You know, what they all forget to do is

657
00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:06.860
of course, give you free precisely the statistics, the

658
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.100
effect sizes in those studies. You know, it can

659
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.300
both be true that humor is very important to

660
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.889
get a sexual partner. Maybe it can have a

661
00:35:15.899 --> 00:35:19.070
correlation of, I don't know, 0.3 or four in

662
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.929
a given, you know, dates with uh in terms

663
00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:24.699
of, you know, trying to attract someone else that

664
00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:27.580
you're sitting across from and then maybe your height

665
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.790
if you're short will also have another very negative

666
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.909
effect on potentially on average the attraction that this

667
00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:36.770
woman might feel for you. But there's no reason

668
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.030
to kind of focus on only one or the

669
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.790
other you know, the goal of a good scientific

670
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.310
model would be trying to know all these variables,

671
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.179
all these predictors, their respective, you know, strengths and

672
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.070
then the context in which some of them are

673
00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.270
activated and some of some of which are not.

674
00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:56.949
And in the manos spe so first off, scientists

675
00:35:56.959 --> 00:35:59.830
are very far from being this there, you know,

676
00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:02.040
uh we are very far from having that level

677
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.550
of predictive power in terms of something as social

678
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.679
and complex as you know, mate selection and sex

679
00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:11.489
and dating. And in the mane, they kind of

680
00:36:11.699 --> 00:36:15.590
focusing on one aspect or two and they just

681
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.090
become firebrands advocates for that, you know, everything that

682
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.340
matters is face, everything that matters is height, everything

683
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.439
that matters is looks and you see that in

684
00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:28.030
Incel communities quite a bit, they are always fighting

685
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.330
trying to hierarchy, what traits is the worst, what

686
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.780
traits gives you the less chances of succeeding at

687
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.389
sex and relationship. And so they will kind of

688
00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:42.100
dig up those studies that are not mutually incompatible,

689
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.469
but they by trying to hierarchy them to have

690
00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:47.360
a very simplistic vision of what's going on. They

691
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.939
are going to unnecessarily kind of cherry pick basically.

692
00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:54.419
But it's not, you know, cherry picking so much

693
00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:58.979
as extreme exaggeration and simplification that has its roots

694
00:36:58.989 --> 00:37:04.500
in individuals and groups, trajectories, values biases, agendas, et

695
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.659
cetera, et cetera. So that's what I'm trying to

696
00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:08.379
unpick with my research basically.

697
00:37:08.889 --> 00:37:12.070
Great. But when it comes to their motivations. I

698
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.909
mean, this is probably a two part question but

699
00:37:14.919 --> 00:37:18.070
IW I was interested in, in knowing if you

700
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:22.149
have any ideas about what the motivations from both

701
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:25.520
the, the people who produce this kind of content

702
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.209
for the manos fore and then the ones who

703
00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:31.790
consume it, what the motivations there would be. Um,

704
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.290
BECAUSE for example, when it comes to the ones

705
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.250
that produce it, it could be, I guess that

706
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.139
in certain cases, they have gone through some bad

707
00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:45.250
experiences in their relationships and then that's why they

708
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.070
start talking about that on the internet or perhaps

709
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.649
sometimes they are just grifters. They know what they're

710
00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:55.790
saying is mostly BS, but they still say it

711
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.669
because they know it sells and they know they

712
00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:03.090
can attract, uh I don't know v vulnerable single,

713
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.209
sexless men uh to, to their cause let's say,

714
00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:10.439
or at least make them spend money on their

715
00:38:10.449 --> 00:38:13.570
products. And, and then, but when it comes to

716
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.830
the ones who consume it, I would imagine that

717
00:38:17.149 --> 00:38:20.169
the vast majority of them would be, uh, you

718
00:38:20.179 --> 00:38:23.489
mentioned at the beginning virgins. Uh And they would

719
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.800
be also sexless men and they would be also

720
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:31.409
men who had bad relationships or just ended a

721
00:38:31.419 --> 00:38:36.050
relationship recently. So bad experiences. Uh Do, do you

722
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.419
have any idea about what the motivations behind those

723
00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:40.750
kinds

724
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:40.939
of

725
00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:43.159
people are? There are three things I want to

726
00:38:43.169 --> 00:38:45.840
say in order first, you said maybe a majority

727
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:49.370
are virgins. So that's just Incels are just one

728
00:38:49.379 --> 00:38:52.780
subset of the marriage. But most groups will mostly

729
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.389
be composed. Some of them of middle aged, you

730
00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:58.810
know, college educated white men, the forties or fifties

731
00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.389
who were married have had divorces, things like that,

732
00:39:01.399 --> 00:39:03.770
that type of profile. So these people have had

733
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.909
plenty of relationships in their lives and you also

734
00:39:05.919 --> 00:39:07.610
have the pick up artists who have, you know,

735
00:39:07.669 --> 00:39:10.219
presence if not hundreds of partners because of what

736
00:39:10.229 --> 00:39:12.010
they do, you know, they spend their entire life

737
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.489
trying to chase after women. So I don't even

738
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.010
think your average maner, you know, number of sex

739
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.989
partner, I would have a hard time predicting if

740
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.290
it's below or over average. Um So that's just

741
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.580
one caveat. The second one is that uh those

742
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.909
people are quite hard to reach. So I've interviewed,

743
00:39:29.919 --> 00:39:32.489
for example, one of the main men's rights activist

744
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.489
leader is called Warren Farrell. He is a very

745
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.340
well known activist. He's a public figure. But for

746
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.429
those new, more obscure, more radical online only communities

747
00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:44.129
like Incels and men going their own way. It's

748
00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:46.510
much harder to reach them out for interviews. They

749
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.110
don't show their faces, they use pseudonyms. So if

750
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.590
you can't ask someone about what drives them to

751
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.229
do something, it becomes really, you know, unsteady ground

752
00:39:57.239 --> 00:40:00.530
to actually try to speculate on people's motives. And

753
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.129
the data I'm mostly working with is discourse, what

754
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:07.949
they produce. So forums, social media videos, their ebooks,

755
00:40:08.149 --> 00:40:11.679
uh, Discord, you name it. I've like scraped and

756
00:40:11.689 --> 00:40:16.989
studied a huge collection of materials that was generated

757
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.280
spontaneously by those people. So, one of the advantages

758
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.620
is that they didn't ask one of my questions.

759
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:25.340
I didn't get to orient the research process. I'm

760
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.520
kind of seeing what they naturally did as a

761
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.899
researcher. But of course, the flip side is that

762
00:40:30.909 --> 00:40:34.159
I can't ask them questions. So it's always hard

763
00:40:34.169 --> 00:40:36.600
to know about motives. I've also run a survey,

764
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.139
I will be more than happy to tell you

765
00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:41.270
more about it about their level of scientific education,

766
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.560
how well they know evolutionary science, trying to measure

767
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.820
certain biases and all that and where they get

768
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.719
their scientific content from. So I can also talk

769
00:40:49.729 --> 00:40:52.919
about this as regards the motives. There are hundreds

770
00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:55.300
of thousands of people in the manoe. It would

771
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.979
be very hard to generalize on one type of

772
00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:01.750
motive I think for the influencers and those people

773
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.790
who produce the content. I'm sure you find drifters

774
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.169
uh in especially dating seduction type areas like coaches

775
00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:16.129
who know that basically their um students don't really

776
00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:18.370
stand a chance or that they're not gonna change

777
00:41:18.379 --> 00:41:20.750
their lives or that maybe this is a little

778
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.189
bit overpriced for, for what they're selling. Uh I'm

779
00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:25.929
sure you have people who are convinced you are

780
00:41:25.939 --> 00:41:29.639
doing good. Um You have a lot of men

781
00:41:29.649 --> 00:41:32.850
who are from there because of, you know, outrage

782
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.600
at some inequalities in society, some things that they

783
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.449
think that shouldn't be this way. You know, feminists

784
00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:40.800
should be talking about this. Why do men get

785
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.719
drafted for military service in the United States in

786
00:41:43.729 --> 00:41:47.530
2024 when the army is now, you know, gender

787
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.320
neutral, you have men and women serving in the

788
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.239
army. Why would it only be men that get

789
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.715
sent in the next, you know, Korean War? So

790
00:41:53.725 --> 00:41:55.814
sometimes you have just men that go to these

791
00:41:55.824 --> 00:41:59.975
movements because of some initial outrage. That's more political.

792
00:41:59.985 --> 00:42:01.475
But a lot of the time what you see

793
00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:05.034
with the research is that it's kind of emotional

794
00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:06.594
but it's hard to separate, of course from the

795
00:42:06.604 --> 00:42:10.344
political, but it has to come from negative experiences

796
00:42:10.354 --> 00:42:12.665
in relationships. You know, if you were cheated on,

797
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.520
uh you're of course, gonna lend an ear to

798
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.439
those groups that tell you about why women are

799
00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:21.620
naturally, you know, have evolved to always look for

800
00:42:21.629 --> 00:42:24.149
a better partner to switch mates. As we said,

801
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:26.790
et cetera. If you have had a bad divorce

802
00:42:27.139 --> 00:42:29.469
and you lost the custody of your kids because

803
00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:31.830
this was contested in court. Of course, you're going

804
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.639
to land near to, you know, those activists that

805
00:42:34.649 --> 00:42:38.379
tell you that current society is completely uh you

806
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.330
know Gyno Center, they call it so that it

807
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.560
is favorable to women and they might even have

808
00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.840
an evolutionary story to put on top of that.

809
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.820
Um So yeah, variety of motives, I would think

810
00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.790
a big one that we should not overlook is

811
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.520
to look for community longing for community, especially with

812
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.439
Incels. Um If you've been bullied your entire life,

813
00:42:59.449 --> 00:43:01.760
there are, you know, studies that show high prevalence

814
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.979
of bullying with them. Um You're a virgin. So

815
00:43:04.989 --> 00:43:08.040
that's frustrating when everyone, you know, starting to discover

816
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.739
sex and relationships. You've never been treated, you know,

817
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.750
decently by people. You know, middle school and high

818
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.090
school can be very tough, et cetera. And then

819
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.300
you find this community of like minded people, you

820
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.979
know. Um So that's for sure. One of the

821
00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:24.550
big factors there as well, that uh that sense

822
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.830
of community I would say. And as for the

823
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.250
content producers, I, I'm trying to refrain from making

824
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.669
judgments about, you know, he's stupid. He's, he a

825
00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:37.979
grifter. Does he just not understand the research? Does

826
00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:40.610
he consciously try to twist it? It's really hard

827
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:40.989
to know.

828
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.830
Mhm. But about that survey that you referred to

829
00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:48.159
there briefly, do, could you tell us more about

830
00:43:48.169 --> 00:43:50.790
it? What kind of survey was it? And what

831
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.659
were the results you got there?

832
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.560
So, as I said, those people are quite suspicious.

833
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.550
So if you come there and tell them, hey,

834
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.260
I'm a researcher. I want to know about your

835
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:03.729
politics, your life, trajectory, your life events, um They

836
00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:06.790
might, well, first they might fear you're the FBI

837
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.100
or you're just a woke uh academic that wants

838
00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:14.189
to smear them. Um So I'm not asking a

839
00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:16.899
lot of very personal questions. But what I thought

840
00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:19.959
was I need a science quiz. You know, I

841
00:44:19.969 --> 00:44:24.239
keep studying how those people use and understand science.

842
00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:26.989
And sure it's very easy to reveal the flaws

843
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.330
and the biases and to say, oh, look here

844
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.209
they've misinterpreted that study, everyone can do that. But

845
00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.919
what do we know about their baseline level of

846
00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:38.149
understanding? You know, how well did they know natural

847
00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:41.929
selection, the basic concepts in the life sciences? And

848
00:44:41.939 --> 00:44:43.889
so what I did is I designed a 20

849
00:44:43.919 --> 00:44:48.209
item quiz, science quiz. So a little bit of

850
00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:51.229
stats, a little bit of hormones, genes and then

851
00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:55.860
mostly evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology. I took most

852
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.699
of my questions from pre-existing questionnaires that had been

853
00:44:58.709 --> 00:45:03.320
validated undergraduate level. And then for comparison, I ran

854
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.399
the same survey with a group of random us

855
00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:10.639
respondents who have a baseline. And so I managed

856
00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:12.739
to recruit 100 and 50 people from the manos

857
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.939
sphere from various subgroups. Um Those are very hard

858
00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:17.889
to reach. I would have hoped to have more

859
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.469
and I have my 150 people, my US respondents,

860
00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:24.010
they took the exact same science quiz and the

861
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.050
results couldn't be clearer, you know, the Manoe Ands,

862
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.510
they have 15 out of 20 in terms of

863
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.159
correct answers. And my average group has 10 out

864
00:45:32.169 --> 00:45:34.989
of 20. So obviously, people from the Manos here,

865
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.409
one of my main findings, you can't ascribe all

866
00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:40.850
of this to this misunderstanding the research, you know,

867
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.969
a lot of them, they understand evolution quite well.

868
00:45:43.979 --> 00:45:47.729
There's almost zero creationism in the Manos sphere. They

869
00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:51.129
are, you know, Darwinian enthusiasts. So this makes them

870
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:54.709
a very unique part of the American right wing

871
00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:57.709
of the spectrum where, you know, protestant fundamentalism is

872
00:45:57.719 --> 00:46:01.330
extremely strong politically in the Republican Party. And the

873
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.750
matters here has been verging to the right, but

874
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.510
still they believe in evolution, you have high levels

875
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.489
of college education in terms of science. So a

876
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.169
lot of them have had, you know, science courses

877
00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:16.729
in college. And um then I'm trying to dig

878
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:19.590
things further by asking, asking them about the sources

879
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.229
of scientific content. You know, do you get your

880
00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:24.300
science from the atmosphere or do you get it

881
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:27.310
from Wikipedia youtube? Do you get it from textbooks,

882
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.419
books? And the man here doesn't come in super

883
00:46:30.429 --> 00:46:33.199
high in these lists. So those people they are

884
00:46:33.209 --> 00:46:36.750
fond of, you know, Robert Sapolsky lectures Richard dawkins'

885
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.360
books. I'm sure lots of them watch our podcast

886
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.739
as well. Um There's a lot of content to

887
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.649
be found on the internet with good, you know,

888
00:46:44.274 --> 00:46:47.685
scientific stuff. So once again, this complicates the picture

889
00:46:47.695 --> 00:46:51.945
quite a bit because um they do understand the

890
00:46:51.955 --> 00:46:55.875
evolutionary, you know, principles quite well. They do know

891
00:46:55.885 --> 00:46:58.645
what evolutionary psychology is. And then my job is

892
00:46:58.655 --> 00:47:02.004
just trying to go in the details and see

893
00:47:02.014 --> 00:47:04.544
what they get wrong, what they get, right? What

894
00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:08.294
they exaggerate. But what they also invent because one

895
00:47:08.304 --> 00:47:11.304
of the things that I found is that um

896
00:47:11.649 --> 00:47:14.290
it's a unique phenomenon in which people in a

897
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.820
manos sphere actually devise their own hypothesis, their own

898
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.590
evolutionary stories. And that's, I don't think something that

899
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.110
we had seen before a community of lay people

900
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.439
who appropriate a scientific discipline, they understand the way

901
00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:31.860
that you reason because evolutionary psychology is a lot

902
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.070
about this, you know, adaptation is type of explanation,

903
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.510
explanatory mindset and they apply it the world around

904
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.409
them. And that's fascinating. So I'm also studying those

905
00:47:41.419 --> 00:47:44.239
uh those homemade or manos sphere made hypothesis

906
00:47:44.919 --> 00:47:47.510
great. Uh And by the way, since you mentioned

907
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.239
there, the fields that they draw from, they draw

908
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.959
their information from and misuse uh and misuse it.

909
00:47:54.969 --> 00:48:00.179
Uh Why do you think that evolutionary psychology specifically

910
00:48:00.189 --> 00:48:02.250
is so popular in the menu?

911
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.729
Ok. I think I have three answers to that.

912
00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:09.050
Ok, because I've been thinking about this quite a

913
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.790
lot, you know, why don't they appropriate sociology or

914
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.949
psychology, mainstream psychology or anthropology, what's going on with

915
00:48:16.959 --> 00:48:19.969
it? I think firstly, they do come from a

916
00:48:19.979 --> 00:48:23.820
perspective where the sexes are quite different. Um They

917
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.939
tend to view men and women are really different.

918
00:48:26.949 --> 00:48:30.600
Uh And it gets reinforced by their ideology that

919
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.479
makes them act in more, you know, maybe masculine

920
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:36.110
ways and expect women to behave in more feminine

921
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.860
ways. And so they kind of see the world

922
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.679
around them like this. And that's one of the

923
00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:44.320
hallmarks of evolutionary psychology, right? It's one of the

924
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.879
few scientific fields that really looks at the behavioral

925
00:48:47.889 --> 00:48:51.429
and psychological difference between men and women, but has

926
00:48:51.439 --> 00:48:55.020
a model to predict where those differences happen and

927
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:58.090
where they don't happen. And so I think the

928
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.050
sex different stuff that you find in evolutionary psychology

929
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.520
is inherently just much more aligned with their pre

930
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:08.889
established kind of folk wisdom or ideas or just

931
00:49:08.899 --> 00:49:11.949
the way that they lived in society. I think

932
00:49:11.959 --> 00:49:14.729
um the people who you, whom you end up

933
00:49:14.739 --> 00:49:17.810
finding in the manos spe there's lower chance that

934
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.310
those are people who've always found men and women

935
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.949
to be quite similar, who's always, who have always

936
00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:26.770
hung around with, you know, female friends and sisters

937
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.370
and, and guys and they kind of seek humanity

938
00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:31.580
as a whole. Whereas, you know, if you have

939
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.520
this kind of sex differentiated uh perception of life

940
00:49:35.675 --> 00:49:39.725
plus ideology on top, then evolutionary psychology can give

941
00:49:39.735 --> 00:49:43.564
you perfect explanation for these issues. I think the

942
00:49:43.574 --> 00:49:46.955
second uh reason why EP is so popular is

943
00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:49.895
the fact that those communities do tend to focus

944
00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:53.239
a lot on sex and relationships. And so, you

945
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:55.750
know, pick up artists, they are seduction coaches, they

946
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.159
try to get you a girlfriend in cells, say

947
00:49:58.169 --> 00:50:00.929
we don't have a girlfriend, mita tell you you

948
00:50:00.939 --> 00:50:02.919
should not have a girlfriend. So you see that

949
00:50:03.139 --> 00:50:05.989
they are almost all around this nexus of, you

950
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.350
know, sex and gender and relationships and dating and

951
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.030
seduction and all that. And once again, evolutionary psychology

952
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.840
is a discipline of choice for that. You know,

953
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.840
evolutionary psychologists do study a lot of uh sex

954
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:22.149
and mating. And I think the third reason is

955
00:50:22.159 --> 00:50:26.790
more political. Evolutionary psychology itself is very controversial and

956
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.189
it's been um received very critically by feminists for,

957
00:50:31.199 --> 00:50:33.729
you know, the past 30 or 40 years because

958
00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:36.300
it insisted so much on the sex differences. And

959
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:39.610
the feminists had always been suspicious of these uh

960
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.219
biological models of, you know, why men and women

961
00:50:43.229 --> 00:50:47.750
behave differently. And so, since evolutionary psychology itself is

962
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.050
kind of targeted by, you know, left wing progressive

963
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.110
movements or at least feminists in academia as some

964
00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.330
sort of potentially hidden veiled male supremacist agenda type

965
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.520
of discipline. Well, that's perfect if you are yourself

966
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.810
an anti feminist, you know, there's kind of this,

967
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.889
oh, if the feminist hates that and it must

968
00:51:09.899 --> 00:51:11.899
be something good, there must be something good about

969
00:51:11.909 --> 00:51:14.110
it. And I've seen that actually written in many,

970
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.139
you know, Manoe weeks and pages like, oh, feminists

971
00:51:18.149 --> 00:51:21.360
hate evolutionary psychology. They love the idea that they

972
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.580
love something that feminists hate. Even though if you

973
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.489
actually look at the field of ep itself, those

974
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.600
tend to be either, you know, psychologists or anthropologists

975
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.310
heavily feminized, you know, maybe more than 50% women

976
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.649
at least today get, you know, graduate degrees in

977
00:51:36.659 --> 00:51:40.320
psych and end. Um So lots of feminists in

978
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.969
those fields as well. They tend to be more

979
00:51:42.979 --> 00:51:46.159
or less, you know, liberal researchers uh living in

980
00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:49.500
urban cities. So they are not your male supremacists

981
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.820
as you would imagine in them. You know, evolutionary

982
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.330
psychologists do not really fit this bill for the

983
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.439
most part. But the fact that their discipline is

984
00:51:57.449 --> 00:52:00.389
controversial and hated by feminists, I think is one

985
00:52:00.399 --> 00:52:03.770
of the biggest draws for the Manoe. And maybe

986
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.570
if I had to have one last one, they

987
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.879
are just very gifted writers and popular writers for

988
00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:13.000
evolutionary science. I mean, Steven Pinker Richard Dawkins, those

989
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.110
are just top notch science writers. They have reached

990
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.590
wide broad audiences. Uh I don't know about your

991
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.870
personal trajectory, but you know, that's how I got

992
00:52:21.879 --> 00:52:23.909
into those disciplines in the first place. You know,

993
00:52:23.919 --> 00:52:27.209
some of those fantastic books by Pinker or Dawkins,

994
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.510
you find great lectures on youtube by Robert Sapolsky,

995
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.389
who's a, you know, hormone guy at Harvard. And

996
00:52:33.399 --> 00:52:37.000
so I think maybe another explanatory factor is that

997
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.610
those disciplines, those fields have been very good at

998
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:45.709
producing top notch and enthusing stimulating, you know, scientific

999
00:52:45.719 --> 00:52:46.590
content as well.

1000
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.080
Yeah, I, I mean, in my particular case, I

1001
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.169
started with uh Sapolsky and Pinker and then went

1002
00:52:53.179 --> 00:52:55.110
on from that, I, I think that those are

1003
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.949
probably the two most common people that, that people

1004
00:52:58.959 --> 00:53:01.949
mentioned when they're talking about how they got into

1005
00:53:01.959 --> 00:53:05.030
evolutionary psychology. But le let me ask you perhaps

1006
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.899
about what could possibly be 1/4 hypothesis to explain

1007
00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:13.260
why evolutionary psychology is so popular among the Manoe.

1008
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.040
Could it be that uh evolutionary psychologists the way

1009
00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:26.850
they present information leads or contributes to tho uh

1010
00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.010
those kinds of claims that we hear on the

1011
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:33.810
manos sphere? Or, or there could, it could be

1012
00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.189
the case that there are just a few bad

1013
00:53:37.199 --> 00:53:42.179
apples in evolutionary psychology who promote those kinds of

1014
00:53:42.189 --> 00:53:44.399
views? I mean, do you have any thoughts on

1015
00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:44.459
that?

1016
00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:47.260
So once again, we go back to motives which

1017
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:53.090
are really hard to ascertain. Um EVOLUTIONARY psychologists, the

1018
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.879
big household names, they also tend to be writers.

1019
00:53:56.889 --> 00:53:59.149
So they sell books. You know, David Buss sells

1020
00:53:59.159 --> 00:54:02.379
hundreds of thousands of books, I'm sure. And so

1021
00:54:02.389 --> 00:54:05.000
they probably know that part of the market comes

1022
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:09.830
from those Manoe Darwinian aficionados. Now, I don't know

1023
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.530
what's the motive there? I don't even know what

1024
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.189
you can do about it. They try to write

1025
00:54:13.199 --> 00:54:15.909
the best books they can, I'm sure. Uh BUT

1026
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.760
you also find some instances where, you know, evolutionary

1027
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:21.580
psychologists seem to have kind of tried to appeal

1028
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.560
to the same demographics as the manos sphere. So

1029
00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:28.010
most famously David Buss opened a dating course, um

1030
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.879
a few years ago, it was called First Date

1031
00:54:29.889 --> 00:54:32.629
Course. And he was saying, hey, I'm a scientist.

1032
00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:35.469
Uh I've worked at all these fancy places and

1033
00:54:35.479 --> 00:54:37.629
I'm the expert in the world in sex and

1034
00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:41.149
mating. And if you paid $1000 for my course,

1035
00:54:41.159 --> 00:54:42.989
I'm gonna teach you much better than all those

1036
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.590
pickup artist guides. Jeffrey Miller in the two thousands.

1037
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.159
He had written a book that was the same,

1038
00:54:47.169 --> 00:54:50.250
you know, so he's kind of criticizing pickup artists,

1039
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:55.209
but he's not criticizing them because mostly because they

1040
00:54:55.219 --> 00:54:58.429
objectify women because they are obsessed with just casual

1041
00:54:58.439 --> 00:55:01.679
sex because they just don't give men any sense

1042
00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:03.989
of their own worth other than just, you know,

1043
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.030
trying to find someone to sleep with. But he

1044
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.689
was mostly saying their things don't really work. And

1045
00:55:09.699 --> 00:55:12.659
here is the good science. And so they are

1046
00:55:12.669 --> 00:55:17.330
evolutionary psychologists who use their expertise as sex dating

1047
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.580
seduction experts to try to sell commercial products because

1048
00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:24.219
there are very strong incentives, there's a very big

1049
00:55:24.229 --> 00:55:27.020
market. So in a way, they share part of

1050
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.399
this market with Manoe people, you know, they try

1051
00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:33.199
to distance themselves from it, but they also try

1052
00:55:33.209 --> 00:55:35.750
to appeal to the, you know, sexless young men,

1053
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.449
nerdy sciency demographic. I think it would be much

1054
00:55:39.459 --> 00:55:41.070
better if they got their tips from, you know,

1055
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.080
a scientist uh with actual research that's much more

1056
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.830
nuanced than from the Manoe. But you could say

1057
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.360
that maybe some of those researchers, it's really hard

1058
00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:53.659
to know if I can't interview them or uh

1059
00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:57.790
what their motives are, what their views are. So,

1060
00:55:58.229 --> 00:56:00.590
um yeah, I'm not, I'm not so sure that

1061
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.500
that's obviously been one of the big questions. Uh

1062
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.989
And I do think that evolutionary evolutionary psychologists have

1063
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.629
stressed sex differences a lot. Um You know, David

1064
00:56:12.639 --> 00:56:16.050
buss run this very famous study on 37 cultures

1065
00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:19.469
where you have men and women rate their preferences.

1066
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.239
And since he was trying at the time in

1067
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:26.229
the late eighties and early nineties to promote ep

1068
00:56:26.379 --> 00:56:29.310
he really stressed on the finding that he found

1069
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.229
some stable cross cultural sex differences about resources and

1070
00:56:33.239 --> 00:56:36.610
looks. If you look at the results, there's so

1071
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.489
much similarity between men and women, you know, they

1072
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.979
want kind, they want honest, they want intelligence. And

1073
00:56:42.989 --> 00:56:45.489
if you actually look at the, of the variant

1074
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.479
that's explained by sex, it's just ridiculously low. I

1075
00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:51.469
think it's in the single digits compared to the

1076
00:56:51.479 --> 00:56:53.820
variants that can be explained by the different cultures

1077
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.639
that were surveyed. So I think for sure, evolutionary

1078
00:56:56.649 --> 00:56:59.530
psychologists in their fight against, you know, blank slate

1079
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:03.550
views. Um I've kind of stressed a lot on

1080
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.639
heredity. They have stressed a lot on, you know,

1081
00:57:05.649 --> 00:57:08.590
genes do matter and, you know, there are different

1082
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:12.429
genetic and behavioral differences between the sexes and the

1083
00:57:12.439 --> 00:57:16.510
in this ideological warfare. Maybe they've been far, maybe

1084
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.699
they've also neglected to say, let's not be too

1085
00:57:19.709 --> 00:57:23.060
deterministic either. We can't explain much of these variants.

1086
00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:26.120
There's a lot of cultural variation, um There's lots

1087
00:57:26.129 --> 00:57:29.530
of different patterns in behavior. And so I think

1088
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.350
one of the other reasons why EP gets appropriated

1089
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.219
and not behavioral ecology, for example, I'm sure you've

1090
00:57:35.229 --> 00:57:38.429
had behavioral ecologists in your podcast. They use the

1091
00:57:38.439 --> 00:57:41.550
same Darwinian models. They mostly use the same methods

1092
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.250
these days. Maybe they do more ethnography, but it's

1093
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.290
very similar. But the behavioral Ecologist look at, looks

1094
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.925
at the d like what resource or pathogens in

1095
00:57:52.935 --> 00:57:56.504
a given environment makes humans behave in animals in

1096
00:57:56.514 --> 00:58:00.274
a different way. Whereas the evolutionary psychologist historically is

1097
00:58:00.284 --> 00:58:02.764
trying to find the human universals, you know, the

1098
00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:05.254
deep structure of the mind, the things that we

1099
00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:08.054
all share in common human nature. And so I

1100
00:58:08.064 --> 00:58:10.685
think in that regard, also, we can say that

1101
00:58:10.695 --> 00:58:15.145
evolutionary psychology in its project and communication is more

1102
00:58:15.155 --> 00:58:18.135
liable to be appropriated by people who want to

1103
00:58:18.145 --> 00:58:23.250
do very gross um gross um simplifications or generalizations

1104
00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.750
about men, women, humans in general, you know, humans

1105
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.520
are this way, you know, they are a species

1106
00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:32.000
with language. Uh THAT'S evolutionary psychology, you know, the

1107
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.860
language instinct by Tinker. Now, uh behavioral ecologists look

1108
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:37.879
more at the, you know, we had the variation,

1109
00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:42.560
the the differences between cultures. And so maybe that's

1110
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:45.810
also why it has been less appropriated than evolutionary

1111
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.679
psychology. And also it's less controversial. Uh So maybe

1112
00:58:49.689 --> 00:58:53.909
it's less alluring for those uh manoe people. Yeah.

1113
00:58:53.989 --> 00:58:58.570
And you were talking about uh revolutionary psychology many

1114
00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.800
times being focused on sex differences, differences between men

1115
00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:06.870
and women. But I think that possibly another issue

1116
00:59:06.879 --> 00:59:10.729
here when it comes to how evolutionary psychologists talk

1117
00:59:10.739 --> 00:59:14.479
about their own research is that they perhaps do

1118
00:59:14.489 --> 00:59:17.560
not put enough emphasis on the fact that even

1119
00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:22.800
among women and among men, there's variability. So uh

1120
00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:27.139
there are many times where they focus so much

1121
00:59:27.149 --> 00:59:29.840
on the differences between men and women that perhaps

1122
00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:34.699
they forget to say that uh among women, there's

1123
00:59:34.709 --> 00:59:37.610
lots of variation. And among men, there's also lots

1124
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.620
of variation in terms of what they're interested in,

1125
00:59:40.629 --> 00:59:43.340
for example, a partner and stuff like that.

1126
00:59:43.419 --> 00:59:46.199
Yeah. So to be fair, I think variation is

1127
00:59:46.209 --> 00:59:51.120
one of the things that evolutionary psychologists investigate. So

1128
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:53.540
for example, in personality research, you have lots of

1129
00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:57.290
evolutionary psychologists and in personality research, you have to

1130
00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.810
kind of try to explain why are some people

1131
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.560
shy? Why are some people confident? Where does this

1132
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.219
variability come from? And can it be explained with

1133
01:00:05.229 --> 01:00:07.810
Darwinian principles? You know, is it just all noise

1134
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.320
or random things happening with alleles or are there

1135
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.879
just evolutionary trajectories that explain these patterns? And I

1136
01:00:14.889 --> 01:00:19.070
think for mating, um there's also a recognition that

1137
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.280
people are extremely different, you have different fetishes, kings

1138
01:00:22.489 --> 01:00:26.620
people look for more casual sex, some look for

1139
01:00:26.629 --> 01:00:29.939
uh more committed relationships. So they've been building scales,

1140
01:00:29.949 --> 01:00:34.699
you know, like uh socio sexual, so sexuality orientation,

1141
01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:36.479
things like that. So I don't want to say

1142
01:00:36.489 --> 01:00:40.060
that they, they kind of put this idea aside

1143
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.860
like they know there are huge variability in the

1144
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.139
data and they do try to explain it. It's

1145
01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:47.590
just incredibly hard and messy it's just really difficult

1146
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.510
to explain, you know, why some people like licking

1147
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.590
feet and why some people like cross dressing and

1148
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.790
why some people just are not interested in sex

1149
01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.389
altogether. You know, this is just very difficult topic.

1150
01:00:59.399 --> 01:01:02.260
So they do tend to simplify and generalize and

1151
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:07.229
talk about averages. I think in their popularization endeavors,

1152
01:01:07.239 --> 01:01:10.370
they do remind that I'm just talking about average

1153
01:01:10.379 --> 01:01:13.189
difference here. It means that there can be overlap.

1154
01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:14.989
I'm not saying all women are like this. All

1155
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.419
men are like this. But I do think that

1156
01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:20.639
in the scientific literature itself, in the papers, all

1157
01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:23.820
those caveats, all those precautions, they're kind of thrown

1158
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.939
away. So you find that you find them in

1159
01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.090
books, you find them in textbooks. But when you're

1160
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.159
talking to other evolutionary psychologists, it's like we know

1161
01:01:31.169 --> 01:01:33.820
we are talking about averages. We know I'm not

1162
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:36.030
saying all women are like this. We know what

1163
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.620
an ethic size is, what the correlation is. But

1164
01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:41.320
what they don't really know is that people, you

1165
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.520
know, manage your people can access these papers today.

1166
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.860
You know, they know psy hub, they know Google

1167
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.370
scholar. So it's not as if when you're writing

1168
01:01:49.379 --> 01:01:51.610
a science paper just as was the case 30

1169
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.870
years ago, you're only writing to your colleagues in

1170
01:01:53.879 --> 01:01:57.860
your academic very niche branch. Now you're also kind

1171
01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:00.110
of writing to the whole world and you know,

1172
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.149
those papers, they can end up on Twitter, they

1173
01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:04.550
can end up on Reddit and it's been seen

1174
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.540
with alt rights uh movements, white supremacist movements that

1175
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.330
have those journal clubs when they kind of scour

1176
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.610
the new research in population genetics and everything that

1177
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.590
they can find to support their race science, uh

1178
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.889
pseudoscience they will find. So researchers now kind of

1179
01:02:21.899 --> 01:02:25.649
have this new responsibility that maybe even in their

1180
01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:28.649
papers, they need to be more careful about restating

1181
01:02:28.659 --> 01:02:32.810
those percussions, you know, about variability, ethic sizes, et

1182
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.649
cetera, et cetera.

1183
01:02:34.229 --> 01:02:37.780
Yeah, I mean, many evolutionary psychologists probably are not

1184
01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:42.459
even aware that people from the Manoe are misusing

1185
01:02:42.469 --> 01:02:46.489
their research or presenting it or making specific limbs

1186
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.040
about it that they do not agree with. Right?

1187
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:49.290
I mean,

1188
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.679
so I've also been running a survey on that,

1189
01:02:51.689 --> 01:02:53.709
you know, asking them if they were aware, it

1190
01:02:53.719 --> 01:02:55.439
was a small survey. I only, you know, there

1191
01:02:55.449 --> 01:02:57.620
are very few in the first place. So I

1192
01:02:57.629 --> 01:03:01.199
think there were around 50 respondents. Um A lot

1193
01:03:01.209 --> 01:03:04.739
of them had, I think maybe 20% of my

1194
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.149
respondents, like 10 out of 50 had seen their

1195
01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:11.399
research personally appropriated, you know, for politics in some

1196
01:03:11.409 --> 01:03:13.979
sort of another on social media. So lots of

1197
01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:18.139
them are aware. Um They tell me anecdotally that

1198
01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.659
when they, their students tell them that when they

1199
01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:24.270
start watching Evolutionary Psychology on the internet, maybe you

1200
01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.719
can start with your podcast but it can end

1201
01:03:26.729 --> 01:03:30.530
with, you know, Manoe stuff, for example. Um So

1202
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.050
there seems to be a pipeline there and there,

1203
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.840
there, there have been articles and discussions among the

1204
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:39.679
evolutionary psychology community more recently. Plus I've been sharing

1205
01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:42.110
my research for the past years in their journals

1206
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.419
and their conferences. So I kind of come to

1207
01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:47.149
these conferences and tell to these people. Hey, uh

1208
01:03:47.159 --> 01:03:49.129
here is what lay people are doing on the

1209
01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:51.750
internet with your um research, you know, here's their

1210
01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.050
attitudes is how well they understand it. Here are

1211
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:59.139
the biases. So I do think that nowadays it's

1212
01:03:59.149 --> 01:04:01.840
been, it's quite well known in the evolutionary psychology

1213
01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:05.989
community. And um they can't really say that they

1214
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.340
are not aware of what's going on, you know.

1215
01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:11.780
Uh Yeah, I mentioned that there's a possibility just

1216
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:16.929
because just recently Daniel Con Conroy Beam, uh an

1217
01:04:16.939 --> 01:04:21.649
evolutionary psychology researcher. Uh I mean that he wrote

1218
01:04:21.659 --> 01:04:23.919
an article, I, I'm not sure where it is

1219
01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:27.530
published but he wrote an article but basically, yeah,

1220
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:31.820
e exactly uh where he basically talks about how

1221
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.590
he wasn't aware of all that. Some people in

1222
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.790
the manoe was, were misappropriating his own research and

1223
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.659
making claims that are completely different from what he

1224
01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:44.909
was studying there. Uh I mean, I'm going to

1225
01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:48.320
interview, actually, I'm going to interview him actually early

1226
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.560
next year and we can get a little bit

1227
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:53.280
more into that, but there are at least a

1228
01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.010
few people that are probably not aware of it.

1229
01:04:56.419 --> 01:04:58.780
Yeah. But see now he is aware and he's

1230
01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.659
writing articles about it. And III, I think I

1231
01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:04.610
contributed to that. He, he because I know I

1232
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.580
know him and he said, he credited me for

1233
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:08.500
kind of opening his eyes to the, to the

1234
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.949
entire thing. But to be fair, the first time

1235
01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:12.320
I reached out to him to tell him about

1236
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.530
my research, he said, oh, I've been waiting for

1237
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.179
this for years. So like they know that there

1238
01:05:18.189 --> 01:05:22.074
are some, you know, men's rights, uh anti people

1239
01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.495
who do use their research. They also know that

1240
01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:28.604
some academics are probably sympathetic to those ideas as

1241
01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:31.314
well in the field. And so that's kind of

1242
01:05:31.324 --> 01:05:35.274
a political, ideological warfare that's also going on inside

1243
01:05:35.284 --> 01:05:37.715
this branch of academia if you will. But I

1244
01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:41.764
don't think anyone is unaware these days, mostly because

1245
01:05:41.774 --> 01:05:46.800
also the anthropologists, the geneticists, they've had this reckoning

1246
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:50.090
already 56 years ago, there was the Buffalo shootings

1247
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.110
in New York where the killer actually posted graphs

1248
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.909
from their journals, their science. And so they've been

1249
01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:59.090
reflecting a lot on how come our discipline is

1250
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.439
so loved by Racists and white supremacists. And that's

1251
01:06:02.449 --> 01:06:04.350
kind of the same reckoning that's going on with.

1252
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.135
Ep you know, how come anti feminists, how come,

1253
01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:12.145
you know, misogynists, uh like our discipline so much,

1254
01:06:12.155 --> 01:06:14.554
isn't there something wrong there? And I think my

1255
01:06:14.564 --> 01:06:17.655
goal here is just to document this, contribute to

1256
01:06:17.665 --> 01:06:20.524
the debate. I'm not saying I have easy solutions.

1257
01:06:20.534 --> 01:06:22.725
The research is fascinating. I'm sure we'll talk about

1258
01:06:22.735 --> 01:06:26.165
that afterwards. You know, it do. I don't even

1259
01:06:26.175 --> 01:06:28.754
want people not to look at evolutionary psychology. I

1260
01:06:28.764 --> 01:06:32.534
love evolutionary psychology. So what's my recommendation here? It's

1261
01:06:32.544 --> 01:06:35.689
very difficult. But uh I do think the reckoning

1262
01:06:35.699 --> 01:06:39.969
has been starting to come for um evolutionary psychologists

1263
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.399
and another driving factor. There is two other guys.

1264
01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:47.379
Uh Mike Murphy has a evolutionary science podcast if

1265
01:06:47.389 --> 01:06:50.020
I can name the your competitors. And so he

1266
01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:52.429
has been kind of engaging and debunking with Manos

1267
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.830
fore people online because he's on social media a

1268
01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.919
lot. So he would find those people plumbing over

1269
01:06:57.929 --> 01:07:01.340
and over again. And there's date, psychology date, like

1270
01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.719
he has a Twitter where he shares, you know,

1271
01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:07.080
kind of evolutionary inspired sex and dating research and

1272
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.189
he has been engaging with the Manoe quite a

1273
01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:11.709
lot on social media. So I think these guys

1274
01:07:11.719 --> 01:07:15.300
are doing tremendous work and they are also trying

1275
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.360
to kind of sensitize all the research community about

1276
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:18.989
these issues,

1277
01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:22.159
right? So I, I mean, just before we get

1278
01:07:22.169 --> 01:07:25.520
into the last part of our conversation, which in

1279
01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:28.189
which I would like to ask you about probably

1280
01:07:28.199 --> 01:07:31.669
some of the ways we could deal with the

1281
01:07:31.679 --> 01:07:36.179
misuse of evolutionary psychology and other evolutionary sciences in

1282
01:07:36.189 --> 01:07:38.719
the Manos sphere. Let me just ask you about

1283
01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:43.330
some other aspects of society, gender and stuff like

1284
01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.850
that, that we haven't touched on earlier, that we

1285
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.000
also see a lot in the Manos sphere. So

1286
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:53.449
when it comes to gender roles specifically and what

1287
01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:57.469
they understand as being feminine or masculine or masculinity

1288
01:07:57.479 --> 01:08:00.439
and femininity. What are perhaps some of the most

1289
01:08:00.449 --> 01:08:02.810
common claims that you see in the menu?

1290
01:08:04.189 --> 01:08:07.570
So once again, there's a lot of variability because

1291
01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:09.649
I would say there are two strands that are

1292
01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.989
completely opposed. But you also find them cohabits quite

1293
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.339
easily in the manos sphere. Some of the earlier

1294
01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:19.649
men's rights people in the 19 seventies, they came

1295
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.589
from a movement which was called men's liberation. And

1296
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.509
this was a ally of feminism. And these guys

1297
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.040
were saying, hey, the women are really finding a

1298
01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:31.220
general role. They are want to enter the workforce

1299
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:34.129
politics, business. That's great. Why don't we do the

1300
01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.759
same? Why don't we take more time to spend

1301
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.899
with our kids? Why don't we stop working 50

1302
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:42.399
hours a week? Why do we don't we talk

1303
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.520
more about our emotions? Be less homophobic? So this

1304
01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:47.660
was a very woke moment, a movement for the

1305
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:51.200
time and they were basically trying to deconstruct masculinity

1306
01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:53.520
and some of these people have remained, some of

1307
01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.520
these ideas have. So inside the men's rights movement,

1308
01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:59.109
they are also very suspicious of what they call

1309
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.640
trad cons traditional conservatives because they think this is

1310
01:09:02.649 --> 01:09:06.240
also oppressive to men. They think having you wake

1311
01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:08.319
up every day to put bread on the table,

1312
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:11.120
to be the provider of your family, having to

1313
01:09:11.129 --> 01:09:13.640
be, you know, kind of shut down your emotions,

1314
01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.229
not being able to open your frailness, vulnerabilities. They

1315
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.020
all think these are the negative aspects of masculinity.

1316
01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.698
So you find those people in the memos, but

1317
01:09:22.707 --> 01:09:24.698
in the Red Pill community, you also find those

1318
01:09:24.707 --> 01:09:28.179
who say you need to be independent, self sufficient,

1319
01:09:28.188 --> 01:09:30.008
you need to be lean, you need to be

1320
01:09:30.019 --> 01:09:33.457
muscular, just be an alpha man and everything will

1321
01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.729
go your way. So it's hard to generalize about

1322
01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:39.818
what you find in terms of ideology in general.

1323
01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:42.298
But if I had to take one example, that's

1324
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:44.788
gonna interest us because of the evolutionary science that

1325
01:09:44.798 --> 01:09:47.679
they put behind it. They are very fond about

1326
01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:51.339
this idea of male disposability. So they do think

1327
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:55.688
that because as I explained, wombs and eggs are

1328
01:09:55.699 --> 01:09:59.278
a limiting factor in mammal reproduction and you find

1329
01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:01.999
plenty of sperm and plenty of males to provide

1330
01:10:02.008 --> 01:10:06.409
it. Nature has evolved like species of have evolved

1331
01:10:06.418 --> 01:10:08.749
at least humans in such a way that males

1332
01:10:08.758 --> 01:10:14.430
are seen as disposable. Males are not really biologically

1333
01:10:14.439 --> 01:10:17.509
valuable. So that's the argument and then they will

1334
01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.109
write entire books. Well, they find examples from our

1335
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.000
society to say that this is such a broad

1336
01:10:23.009 --> 01:10:26.029
term. What is disposable? You can explain many things

1337
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.129
with it. So men are sent off to die

1338
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.169
in war. Men are more victims of suicide. Men

1339
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.770
tend to suffer more homelessness, they tend to die

1340
01:10:34.779 --> 01:10:37.569
younger, they die from drugs more, these are all

1341
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.049
very interesting social issues and I'm not saying we

1342
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.250
shouldn't look at why men do these things more.

1343
01:10:42.259 --> 01:10:46.089
It's very important to address them, of course. But

1344
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.689
this is all to feed their idea of male

1345
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.609
disposability. You know, males, we are kind of nature's

1346
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.589
experiments. We are just there to provide our sperm,

1347
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.290
but the female dominates. So, very interestingly, they have

1348
01:10:59.299 --> 01:11:02.589
a vision of biology. It's not the male supremacist,

1349
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.649
18th, 19th century vision that you would think about.

1350
01:11:05.779 --> 01:11:08.009
It's kind of a reverse of that because remember,

1351
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:10.750
they think they are oppressed, they think that male

1352
01:11:10.759 --> 01:11:14.410
contemporary society is hostile to men. So they find

1353
01:11:14.419 --> 01:11:17.770
in the biology, a model that uh can completely

1354
01:11:17.779 --> 01:11:19.959
explain that by saying, yeah, we've always been this

1355
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:22.680
way, you know, we have been the Canon fathers.

1356
01:11:22.689 --> 01:11:25.370
We are the disposable men. Now, the problem with

1357
01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:28.970
that is that the evolutionary reasoning is completely spurious.

1358
01:11:28.979 --> 01:11:33.200
You know, um Darwin himself wondered why are there

1359
01:11:33.209 --> 01:11:36.520
so many males? We don't need 50% of males.

1360
01:11:36.529 --> 01:11:39.120
We could just have one lucky ma male for

1361
01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:41.910
10 females and there would be more peace, less

1362
01:11:41.919 --> 01:11:44.439
competition and he could inseminate all of them and

1363
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:47.640
the species would perpetuate. However, we know that natural

1364
01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:50.620
selection does not operate at the level of what

1365
01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:53.459
is good for the entire species. You know, organisms

1366
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:56.040
just kind of fight in this struggle of natural

1367
01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:59.200
selection to maximize their own fitness. And so males

1368
01:11:59.209 --> 01:12:02.399
over history, even though there could be less males

1369
01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:04.549
for the good of the species, they've remained, they've

1370
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.779
remained, they fought, they've had their competition, their natural

1371
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:12.220
selection, their dimorphism and testosterone, et cetera. And so,

1372
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.580
um, the, the problem with the theory of male

1373
01:12:14.589 --> 01:12:17.129
disposability that's very popular in the manoe and they

1374
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.299
use it a lot to talk about general roles,

1375
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:21.640
you know, you know, as a man you're expected

1376
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:24.060
anyways, you're disposable, you know, you're nothing to your

1377
01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:27.049
wife or to your kids, you're just cog in

1378
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:31.100
the machine. Um The problem is that uh the

1379
01:12:31.109 --> 01:12:33.950
evolutionary model is not the best to justify this.

1380
01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:36.979
You know, and since the 19 thirties, there was

1381
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:39.629
a geneticist named Ronald Fisher and he kind of

1382
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.649
explained why we have more or less 50 50%

1383
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.720
of males and females, you know, this stable sex

1384
01:12:44.729 --> 01:12:48.299
ratio in most species. And his arguments was a

1385
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:51.660
thought experiment, you know, imagine you have a species

1386
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:56.109
with 90% females, 10% males. This would mean that

1387
01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.910
the expected reproductive success of a son is nine

1388
01:12:59.919 --> 01:13:02.950
times higher than that of a daughter, which means

1389
01:13:02.959 --> 01:13:06.529
that alleles that would kind of with your sex

1390
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.490
ratio of the parents towards having more male kids

1391
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.640
would be selected because of some is a huge

1392
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:16.169
boon in terms of offspring and fitness, which means

1393
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.359
that we would kind of naturally have a rebalancing

1394
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.149
of the sex ratio. It's kind of what we

1395
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.470
observe in most species. I mean, we know sex

1396
01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:28.209
ratios are variable in humans. We know there are

1397
01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.279
slightly more male babies born and female babies. But

1398
01:13:31.479 --> 01:13:34.109
let's say it's more or less a across, you

1399
01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.830
know, mammals rather a stable. And we have good

1400
01:13:36.839 --> 01:13:40.049
explanations for that. And so it shows that the

1401
01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.700
male disposability argument does not really hold water. Uh

1402
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.089
BUT it's very, very popular to discuss society. And

1403
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:51.020
that's one of the main justifications for their feeling

1404
01:13:51.029 --> 01:13:56.819
of, you know, oppression and being like, yeah, basically

1405
01:13:57.109 --> 01:14:00.459
useless and not looked after by society, which is

1406
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.609
a thing that I think should be addressed because,

1407
01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.080
you know, it's, it's a valid concern and it's

1408
01:14:05.089 --> 01:14:07.770
also potentially dangerous for the entire society. So,

1409
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:13.740
and what about claims about supposed alpha males? What

1410
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.870
do they tend to say about that in the

1411
01:14:15.879 --> 01:14:16.060
manoe?

1412
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.660
So I think in the atmosphere um being alpha,

1413
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:26.270
being an alpha man has um two or three

1414
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.910
implications or there are three elements of the definition.

1415
01:14:29.919 --> 01:14:31.589
There's a physical one, you know, you have to

1416
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.580
be muscular, lean fit. Uh There's also the idea

1417
01:14:35.589 --> 01:14:40.149
that uh you're independent, you're self sufficient, you're driven

1418
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.430
by, you know, projects, you do your own thing,

1419
01:14:42.439 --> 01:14:45.390
you don't owe anything to anyone else. And the

1420
01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:48.020
third one, which is kind of linked would be,

1421
01:14:48.319 --> 01:14:52.580
you don't get in committed relationships. You kind of

1422
01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:59.759
are too um we've drawn distant cocky. Um You

1423
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.729
pretend that women don't have an influence or power

1424
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.600
on you. So you are this, you know, I

1425
01:15:05.609 --> 01:15:10.419
don't know, John Wayne Harrison Ford type figure the

1426
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:14.080
issue with that is manifolds. Firstly, you don't find

1427
01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:17.359
the alpha male uh term in human research literature

1428
01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:21.040
a lot. Even for other animals, it's not very

1429
01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:23.979
popular. It was called for wolves in the 19

1430
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:26.279
forties, but it's not even used for wolves anymore

1431
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:28.890
because it only works for wolves in captivity by

1432
01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:32.069
the hierarchies of alpha males. Uh BUT it's used

1433
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.950
for other primates, for example. So in primate societies

1434
01:15:34.959 --> 01:15:36.990
where there's a dominance hierarchy, you will hear of

1435
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.020
the alpha male, but there's also always an alpha

1436
01:15:40.029 --> 01:15:42.779
female. That's something that you never see in the

1437
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.359
manos spe you know, that's a classic. Uh THEY

1438
01:15:45.419 --> 01:15:47.729
kind of honed in on the alpha male trope

1439
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.649
because it fits, you know, former images of masculinity.

1440
01:15:52.109 --> 01:15:54.689
Uh BUT there's nothing about the alpha female trope

1441
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:59.319
in 1819 eighties, Franz de Valls, the famous primatologist

1442
01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:02.529
wrote his book Chimpanzee Politics and it was a

1443
01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.109
hit in Wall Street in Washington DC. The right

1444
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.879
wing Republican Representative Newt Gingrich told all his other,

1445
01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:14.129
you know, Senate uh House of the Representative Mates.

1446
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.870
You should read that book. So alpha male kind

1447
01:16:16.879 --> 01:16:19.870
of became its own concept in the corporate world

1448
01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:23.089
in kind of right wing self help spheres. And

1449
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.600
interestingly, it's percolated also in the manos sphere seduction

1450
01:16:26.609 --> 01:16:30.379
techniques. And I think what's really flawed in their

1451
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:33.770
understanding they have of it is that it's this

1452
01:16:33.779 --> 01:16:37.439
independent aloof type of thing, you know, we're a

1453
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:41.020
social species. So of course, we have hierarchies in

1454
01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.879
humans and we can look at other primates with

1455
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.410
dominance hierarchies to kind of understand what's going on

1456
01:16:46.419 --> 01:16:48.859
in our species, even though it's more complicated here.

1457
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:52.100
But we are a social species. So an alpha

1458
01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:56.609
male doesn't have to be uh necessarily aggressive. It

1459
01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.350
doesn't have to be necessarily, and it can't be

1460
01:16:59.359 --> 01:17:01.759
solitary and independent. That's the thing, you know, in

1461
01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:05.540
a social species, all leaders tend to be connected,

1462
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.549
they tend to know how to use humor, flattery

1463
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:12.299
coalitions, alliances, they solve issues for others that might

1464
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:15.319
be generous. So the idea is not so much

1465
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.410
with, I mean, there are two issues. They use

1466
01:17:17.419 --> 01:17:19.600
this concept of alpha male which has no real

1467
01:17:19.609 --> 01:17:23.080
scientific relevance and validity in humans. And it's not

1468
01:17:23.089 --> 01:17:27.839
really used by psychologists, anthropologists, uh sociologists to talk

1469
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:30.509
about human society in the first place. So we

1470
01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.069
don't really know what it is, what it predicts.

1471
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.100
It's not a good scientific theory. But also even

1472
01:17:36.109 --> 01:17:37.819
if you look at other animals where we use

1473
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:40.350
it, we just use it as a label for

1474
01:17:40.359 --> 01:17:44.450
up in the hierarchy. But the features that make

1475
01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:47.970
another primate top of the hierarchy are clearly not

1476
01:17:47.979 --> 01:17:50.410
necessarily the ones that the manos fear. You know,

1477
01:17:50.419 --> 01:17:53.169
dating coaches tell you to mimic or imitate in

1478
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.370
humans. You know, they tell you to be some

1479
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.520
sort of as asshole frankly. And uh if you're

1480
01:17:58.529 --> 01:18:01.229
an asshole, you're not gonna remain in power for

1481
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.859
a very long time. So in private and societies,

1482
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:05.609
you know, you see alpha males that are much

1483
01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:10.490
more politically savvy and actually more benevolent than anything

1484
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.979
you can find in the manoe and my own

1485
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:15.399
personal analysis and issue with that. What I found

1486
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.149
is that this is such a broad concept and

1487
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.089
I've seen it with my eyes, you know, in

1488
01:18:21.439 --> 01:18:24.609
analyzing hundreds and thousands of pages of manager content,

1489
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:28.330
everything can be construed as alpha. So they use

1490
01:18:28.339 --> 01:18:30.109
it as an adjective they'll say, oh, this is

1491
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.529
so alpha, bro, you know anything, if you put

1492
01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.970
the right twist on it, you know. Oh I

1493
01:18:34.979 --> 01:18:37.290
lied to her. Oh, that's alpha. You know, you

1494
01:18:37.299 --> 01:18:39.540
didn't let her penetrate your thoughts or I told

1495
01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:41.370
her the truth. Oh, that's alpha. You know, you

1496
01:18:41.379 --> 01:18:43.569
don't, you're not afraid of opening up the truth.

1497
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.330
It's just a concept that's kind of devoid of

1498
01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.169
any meaning and that's really blurry and then it

1499
01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:53.229
can hence be used to. Yeah, to mean anything.

1500
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.990
So I think it's kind of pointless.

1501
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.910
Yeah. And I guess that when it comes to

1502
01:18:57.919 --> 01:19:02.129
alpha males and also gender roles more broadly, uh

1503
01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.350
uh we also hear it's, it's very common for,

1504
01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:08.390
for us to hear in the Manoe people saying

1505
01:19:08.399 --> 01:19:11.839
particularly the ones of course, who get some money

1506
01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:15.600
out of these, uh they make them making limbs

1507
01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:20.270
about how uh exaggerated claims about how I if,

1508
01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:22.569
if you want a girl, if you want a

1509
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.419
wife or something like that you have to go

1510
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:28.339
to the gym, you have to have a six

1511
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:31.729
figure salary. You have to have fancy cars, fancy

1512
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.160
clothes, fancy watches and, and stuff like that. So,

1513
01:19:35.169 --> 01:19:39.645
I, I mean, they are exactly exaggerating what women

1514
01:19:39.654 --> 01:19:43.015
like and even some of those things perhaps not

1515
01:19:43.024 --> 01:19:45.875
even apply to a vast majority of them. But

1516
01:19:45.884 --> 01:19:49.794
also, I guess that by exaggerating they're also putting

1517
01:19:49.805 --> 01:19:54.075
even more pressure on the sorts of vulnerable men

1518
01:19:54.334 --> 01:19:56.794
that tend to follow them.

1519
01:19:57.185 --> 01:20:00.515
Yeah. So there's a hard balance to find the

1520
01:20:00.524 --> 01:20:03.095
red pillars. They are against what they call the

1521
01:20:03.104 --> 01:20:06.209
Blue Pill in the Blue Pill they think is

1522
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.180
the kind of romantic vision of love and relationships

1523
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:11.890
that you are fed when you're a kid, eventually

1524
01:20:11.899 --> 01:20:14.310
someone will love you, you will find someone who

1525
01:20:14.319 --> 01:20:16.729
likes you for who you are. Just be yourself.

1526
01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.740
And your mom tells you that you're the most

1527
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:21.919
beautiful, wonderful son in the world. And they, they

1528
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:25.680
say that's how most uh men, young kids, boys

1529
01:20:25.689 --> 01:20:28.740
are brought up in Western society. But this is

1530
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:31.430
all lies because when you look at studies, you

1531
01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:33.750
do see that. Of course, there are thousands of

1532
01:20:33.759 --> 01:20:37.359
factors that do have predictive power that do have

1533
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.990
an influence on my choice. So we know about

1534
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.270
height, we know about confidence, humor, prowess, you know,

1535
01:20:44.279 --> 01:20:47.359
being socially connected, all the things that is also

1536
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:49.919
part of our folk wisdom that we don't all

1537
01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:52.810
have equal chances in the game. Of, you know,

1538
01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:56.279
relationships and sex. And so the red pillars, what

1539
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.439
they kind of say is that they use that

1540
01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:01.600
caricature version of the blue pill that they think

1541
01:21:01.609 --> 01:21:04.140
everyone is being fed. And they say we are

1542
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:07.259
the realists, we offer the hard truth. You know,

1543
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:09.459
we are going to tell you the science of

1544
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:12.240
how, you know, you need to do to succeed

1545
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:14.339
when it's a tough world and you're gonna lose

1546
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:17.020
all your illusions and you can shed those blue

1547
01:21:17.029 --> 01:21:19.500
blue pill beliefs. You know, you can't be just

1548
01:21:19.509 --> 01:21:22.060
yourself. It's not gonna work. You have to go

1549
01:21:22.069 --> 01:21:24.339
to the gym, blah, blah, blah. And the thing

1550
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:27.600
is those are two extreme caricatures and as often

1551
01:21:27.609 --> 01:21:30.089
the truth, just somewhere on a huge spectrum in

1552
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.209
the middle, you know, obviously, uh if you never

1553
01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.859
shower and you never go to talk to anyone

1554
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:38.109
and you're rude as hell, you're never gonna find

1555
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.209
a girlfriend. So the Blue Bill myth, you know,

1556
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.470
just be yourself. Uh AND it will eventually work

1557
01:21:43.479 --> 01:21:45.830
out is plain wrong, you know, and a lot

1558
01:21:45.839 --> 01:21:48.129
of incels have found it for themselves. So they

1559
01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:51.290
cater to these other narratives which are extremely extreme,

1560
01:21:51.299 --> 01:21:54.339
which are equally extreme. And that's uh yeah, they

1561
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:57.540
overemphasize the importance of a few selected traits and

1562
01:21:57.549 --> 01:22:03.060
factors in explaining extremely complex phenomena. And um they

1563
01:22:03.069 --> 01:22:06.319
are really, really bent on generalizations. So they have

1564
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:08.970
this um acronym in the red pill, which is

1565
01:22:08.979 --> 01:22:11.399
called a walt. It means all women are like

1566
01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:14.569
that, you know, so we were talking about variability

1567
01:22:14.649 --> 01:22:16.629
and we know, I mean, we've all seen, you

1568
01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.000
know, women who go out with all different types

1569
01:22:19.009 --> 01:22:22.060
of men and we've seen huge age gaps in

1570
01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:24.640
either directions. I mean, if there is one area

1571
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:27.319
where you find all potential arrangements and things that

1572
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:30.439
sex and relationships, so we know that all women

1573
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:34.279
are not like anything but still there's this, you

1574
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:39.500
know, gross generalizations um which I think can be

1575
01:22:39.509 --> 01:22:41.729
useful to some young men. I mean, I think

1576
01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.470
pick up artists uh in the two thousands. If

1577
01:22:44.479 --> 01:22:47.490
they tell someone, you need to build confidence, you

1578
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.569
need to kind of go out there and meet

1579
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.990
people, get a social circle and you'll eventually meet

1580
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.810
girls. Obviously, that's a better discourse to be hearing

1581
01:22:57.149 --> 01:23:00.345
and even then just lay down and rot, which

1582
01:23:00.354 --> 01:23:02.524
is what the incels tell these young men now,

1583
01:23:02.535 --> 01:23:05.325
you know, it's over, it's doomed. So what do

1584
01:23:05.334 --> 01:23:08.115
they have left, you know, video games, porn, uh

1585
01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:12.444
suicides, mass shootings. It's just very bleak as well.

1586
01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:14.904
So I'm saying, you know, some of the self

1587
01:23:14.975 --> 01:23:19.435
help motivational narratives can have a positive effect on

1588
01:23:19.444 --> 01:23:23.750
some young men's trajectories. And for sure someone telling

1589
01:23:23.759 --> 01:23:26.009
you, you know, here are basic things that women

1590
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.709
like, you know, confidence, blah, blah, blah, probably com

1591
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:32.890
compared the thing is. How much do you exaggerate

1592
01:23:32.899 --> 01:23:35.500
this and what's the vision of female nature that

1593
01:23:35.509 --> 01:23:37.750
you have behind that, you know, is it just

1594
01:23:37.759 --> 01:23:41.759
neutral, is passionate scientific here are the preferences of

1595
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:44.120
men and women here they come from or is

1596
01:23:44.129 --> 01:23:47.200
it driven by, you know, this, this misogynistic biases

1597
01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:49.759
and tropes like they are all like this, she

1598
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:51.700
will never like you for who you are. She's

1599
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:54.540
always looking for another, we don't know, you know,

1600
01:23:54.549 --> 01:23:57.839
there's much more variability and the very interesting thing

1601
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.879
that I noticed on Intel forums is that back

1602
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:02.540
when they were on Reddit, now they've all been

1603
01:24:02.549 --> 01:24:05.140
banned. You had a lot of normies coming. So

1604
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:09.089
people from outside communities and the women would say,

1605
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:12.370
actually, I'm not like this, you describe someone, but

1606
01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:15.089
that's not how I feel my boyfriend is autistic

1607
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:18.450
or I don't discriminate men based on their height

1608
01:24:18.459 --> 01:24:21.259
or something. And they would never believe they would

1609
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:23.959
never accept these testimonies by women who are kind

1610
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:26.129
of trying to help them. Like you do have

1611
01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.069
a chance. You know, my boyfriend is not a

1612
01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.370
chad and I love him dearly and they kept

1613
01:24:30.379 --> 01:24:33.430
on saying that's wrong. That's just what you say.

1614
01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:35.970
But what your what are your revealed preferences, you

1615
01:24:35.979 --> 01:24:39.540
know, stated preferences are easy. So they have kind

1616
01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:42.850
of this double standard for skepticism. You know, if

1617
01:24:42.859 --> 01:24:45.560
there's something that feeds your world view, they can

1618
01:24:45.569 --> 01:24:48.850
accept the most ridiculous piece of evidence to show

1619
01:24:48.859 --> 01:24:52.129
that it proves validates their vision of female nature,

1620
01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.319
which is very dark. Uh But then if you

1621
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:59.270
have examples in the other direction. They are gonna

1622
01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:02.850
be the most. Yeah, hardened skeptics and they won't

1623
01:25:02.859 --> 01:25:05.450
believe it, unfortunately. So that's kind of the opposite

1624
01:25:05.459 --> 01:25:07.910
of the, the open mind you need for scientific

1625
01:25:07.919 --> 01:25:11.439
inquiry where you're ready to accept evidence for all

1626
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:12.529
positions, basically.

1627
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:17.270
Yeah. And so just as a last topic here,

1628
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.359
um what would you say, perhaps since you've been

1629
01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:24.689
studying and looking into these manos ferre communities and

1630
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.970
so on, what would you say, perhaps would be

1631
01:25:26.979 --> 01:25:29.930
some of the best ways to try to fight

1632
01:25:29.939 --> 01:25:35.459
back against the misappropriation of evolutionary science and even

1633
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:38.189
other kinds of science that they do there.

1634
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:42.520
So that's obviously the question that I'm being asked

1635
01:25:42.529 --> 01:25:44.830
a lot because I study this and people come

1636
01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:47.479
and they say, uh so what's the solution? What

1637
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:51.729
should we do? It's hard, it's hard because that's

1638
01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.310
a great science. You know, I don't want to

1639
01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:57.250
censor evolutionary psychology. Uh Most people do genuinely good

1640
01:25:57.259 --> 01:25:59.270
work and they are motivated by looking for the

1641
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.919
truth and I don't want to come up as

1642
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:03.069
some sort of, you know, censor for the entire

1643
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.240
field. I love it. I want to contribute to

1644
01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:09.270
the field. On the other hand, we can't accept

1645
01:26:09.279 --> 01:26:11.649
the idea that we have no responsibility. You know,

1646
01:26:11.729 --> 01:26:15.509
most people do things with our research. I can

1647
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.180
never prevent it. So why should I do everything,

1648
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:20.189
anything about it? And it's true that it's very

1649
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.029
hard to prevent my friend Macken uh who's the

1650
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.859
science podcaster? He's gone and he's debated pits from

1651
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:29.009
the Manos sphere alive. And he said, at the

1652
01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:31.839
end, you know, I don't feel like I accomplished

1653
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:34.089
anything. I feel like I've, they've kind of became

1654
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.930
more radical, more entrenched in their position. It's just

1655
01:26:36.939 --> 01:26:40.169
not working. So it's really tough work. Um I

1656
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.410
think at least if the field makes sure that

1657
01:26:42.419 --> 01:26:46.459
it communicates clearly that the results are solid, that

1658
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:50.060
you mentioned the variability, the uncertainties that you're cautious

1659
01:26:50.069 --> 01:26:53.790
about generalization. But you also mentioned, you know, the

1660
01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:56.049
effect sizes and things like that. There's a lot

1661
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.250
you can do to kind of try to shield

1662
01:26:58.259 --> 01:27:04.069
yourself from appropriation by politicized factions. And at least

1663
01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.330
if it doesn't work, maybe it can sh shield

1664
01:27:07.339 --> 01:27:10.399
the field from criticisms from other branches of academia

1665
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:14.450
because that's apr disaster, you know, ep is already

1666
01:27:14.459 --> 01:27:18.500
controversial and you do have communities that some of

1667
01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:22.169
them do mass shootings. For example, sometimes, you know,

1668
01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:25.899
periodically you have one insect that uh amidst acts

1669
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:28.790
of massive violence. You don't want those people quoting

1670
01:27:28.799 --> 01:27:30.870
your science, you don't want those people, you know,

1671
01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:32.839
you don't want to be associated with them even

1672
01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:35.870
in terms of the politics of academia. So first,

1673
01:27:35.879 --> 01:27:40.069
I think there are incentives and justifications for evolutionary

1674
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.390
scientists to take this seriously. Then there's the question

1675
01:27:43.399 --> 01:27:47.240
of what they can do and then it becomes

1676
01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.319
really hard because as I said, the content is

1677
01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:52.580
open, it's on the internet, it's accessible and we

1678
01:27:52.589 --> 01:27:57.520
like that. And I'm not even sure sometimes that

1679
01:27:57.529 --> 01:28:01.490
there's, there's a solution where you can really prevent

1680
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.459
someone with different values from having a different conclusion.

1681
01:28:04.859 --> 01:28:08.390
So look, for example, scientific studies, they look at

1682
01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:11.689
links between variables, right? They tell you, I looked

1683
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:14.100
at this little bit of nature or society and

1684
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:16.100
here is, I think if you pull this lever,

1685
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:18.399
this happens, this is what happens and that's it.

1686
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:21.259
They are descriptive. Now, they might end their paper

1687
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:23.939
by saying, well, maybe we can use this lever

1688
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:28.830
to, you know, accomplish that goal. But nothing prevents

1689
01:28:28.839 --> 01:28:31.939
someone with completely different values to say, oh, I'm

1690
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.560
gonna use this lever to accomplish this goal. And

1691
01:28:34.569 --> 01:28:37.350
even if a scientist were, was telling people, hey,

1692
01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:40.859
look, I've studied women's mate preferences. Here is what

1693
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:43.609
would make them tick. Please don't use this to

1694
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.209
seduce women or please don't use this for that.

1695
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:49.640
I mean, no one believes people would actually believe

1696
01:28:49.649 --> 01:28:52.410
that. So what, what do we do as social

1697
01:28:52.419 --> 01:28:56.450
scientists? If we find things where you know, this

1698
01:28:56.459 --> 01:28:59.029
link between variables can be used for all kinds

1699
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.609
of ends. It's a really difficult question. So I've

1700
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.129
seen in cells, for example, being fascinated with research

1701
01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:09.330
on endocrine disrupting chemicals. Uh They do think that

1702
01:29:09.339 --> 01:29:14.129
there's some sort of global homosexual Jewish conspiracy that's

1703
01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.669
poisoning the water as we speak and trying to

1704
01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.120
make men into more feminized versions of men. And

1705
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:24.200
it's true that if you look at the research,

1706
01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:28.629
they are not Jewish conspiracies, but endocrine disrupting chemicals

1707
01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.669
in our drinking water. We do find that the

1708
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.540
water is polluted and the values of most scientists

1709
01:29:34.549 --> 01:29:36.779
who study this is to say we find this

1710
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:39.609
link and in terms of prescript. So this is

1711
01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.850
descriptive and in terms of prescription, we think this

1712
01:29:42.859 --> 01:29:44.770
means we can filter the water, we could use

1713
01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:48.459
this technology, we can heal people in cells. Let's

1714
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:51.720
say, let's ban the contraceptives, let's ban the contraceptive

1715
01:29:51.729 --> 01:29:54.750
pill because that's where a lot of the chemicals

1716
01:29:54.759 --> 01:29:57.799
the estrogens come from and from their own point

1717
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.040
of view, if you don't have sex and if

1718
01:30:00.049 --> 01:30:02.990
you hate women, why should you care that people

1719
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.359
pollute your drinking water with your contraceptive pills? So

1720
01:30:06.370 --> 01:30:08.589
once again, they have very different values. So they

1721
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.540
have their different interpretation of the research. But what

1722
01:30:11.549 --> 01:30:13.870
can the researchers do about it? I don't think

1723
01:30:13.879 --> 01:30:16.129
they can do much. So when I'm being asked

1724
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.479
for easy fixes, I think it's really hard because

1725
01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:21.799
these are politics and I mean, if I could

1726
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:24.029
use my magic wand and kind of fix, you

1727
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.669
know, hatred and division between communities and nations in

1728
01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.200
politics, I would do it. But the thing is

1729
01:30:30.209 --> 01:30:33.589
the Manoe is also anchored to the broader political

1730
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:38.109
climate of, you know, culture wars, online, polarized politics

1731
01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.109
in the US. So it's been drifting more and

1732
01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.910
more to the right in Europe here as well.

1733
01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:45.810
Uh YOU find in the European memos here, so

1734
01:30:45.819 --> 01:30:48.779
Spanish Italian French, you find much more of the

1735
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:53.319
anti imig uh far, right, uh positions that are

1736
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:57.140
spreading politically across Europe from eastern northern, southern Europe.

1737
01:30:57.439 --> 01:30:59.310
And the Manoe is just part of that. I

1738
01:30:59.319 --> 01:31:04.220
mean, it's, it's somewhere in that cultural landscape. So

1739
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:07.419
I would be very presumptuous if, if I thought

1740
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:10.729
that I myself could find solutions. Um, YOU know,

1741
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:14.779
to kind of hundreds of thousands or millions of

1742
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:18.080
people holding beliefs that I don't agree with or

1743
01:31:18.089 --> 01:31:20.509
that I find distasteful. So I think it's really

1744
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.240
hard, that's political struggle, that's ideological battle, which is

1745
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:28.560
not really my industry as a researcher. And my,

1746
01:31:28.569 --> 01:31:32.250
maybe my final take on that would be, it's

1747
01:31:32.259 --> 01:31:35.330
really hard to correct people's opinions and beliefs. And

1748
01:31:35.339 --> 01:31:37.799
if we are to be a liberal, tolerant society,

1749
01:31:37.919 --> 01:31:40.479
our goal is also to be, that's one of

1750
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:43.839
the classics of liberalism. You know, people do their

1751
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:45.830
thing, people think what they want, they have their

1752
01:31:45.839 --> 01:31:48.290
own religion, they have their own beliefs. I don't

1753
01:31:48.299 --> 01:31:50.680
mind. So, at the end of the day, if

1754
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:52.279
you have red tailed men and red tailed women

1755
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:54.720
who want to be in traditional marriages and they

1756
01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:57.000
consent to the thing and the woman likes, you

1757
01:31:57.009 --> 01:31:59.379
know, making sandwiches for her husband. Hey, I think

1758
01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:01.180
that's a pity. That's not how I want to

1759
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:04.509
run my life, but that's also not the worst

1760
01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.459
in the tolerant open society. So maybe what we

1761
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:13.950
should focus on is the overtly antisocial, um, dangerous

1762
01:32:13.959 --> 01:32:18.189
violent consequences, manifestations of mane ideology. I'm not sure

1763
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.709
I can always, I can ever be able to

1764
01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.580
get out, you know, traditional views about traditional gender

1765
01:32:23.589 --> 01:32:27.870
roles and masculinity. Those go back for Millenia. However,

1766
01:32:27.879 --> 01:32:30.319
you know, if we make sure that we prevent

1767
01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:33.709
the more radicalized members from committing terror attacks, we

1768
01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.069
protect, you know, people from cyber harassment because if

1769
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.899
you're a feminist and you speak out on some

1770
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:42.040
of these issues, uh you're gonna receive reams of

1771
01:32:42.049 --> 01:32:45.180
cyber harassment myself. As a manager, researcher, I've had

1772
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:47.709
to make sure to take precautions along the way

1773
01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:50.220
and things like that. So if we actually can

1774
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:53.859
make sure that, you know, these things are mitigated

1775
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:57.839
and then hopefully some content producers, some politicians can

1776
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.680
inspire young men and just bring forward new models

1777
01:33:01.689 --> 01:33:06.310
of masculinity and answer men about their anxieties about

1778
01:33:06.319 --> 01:33:10.350
current society because uh there are anxieties that are

1779
01:33:10.359 --> 01:33:12.979
completely legitimate that drive people to the manos spe

1780
01:33:13.779 --> 01:33:16.540
young men seem to be more likely to fall

1781
01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:20.470
prey to, you know, video game addictions, pornography addictions.

1782
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:23.189
They are doing less well than girls at school.

1783
01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.680
And the gap is widening, they are enrolling less

1784
01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:28.180
in college. So there's definitely a lot of space

1785
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:31.319
to occupy for politics in those male issues. Uh

1786
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:34.970
TRYING to tell male men, you know, about what

1787
01:33:34.979 --> 01:33:37.430
their role and their identity should be as men,

1788
01:33:37.439 --> 01:33:40.200
as even biological males. You know, I, I love

1789
01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:43.589
biology but, uh, I wish it was done by

1790
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.950
other people than those in the mane. And, uh,

1791
01:33:46.959 --> 01:33:49.370
unfortunately there's, yeah, there's lots of work to do

1792
01:33:49.379 --> 01:33:52.629
on these issues. And at the moment, lots of

1793
01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.229
young men are catering towards tiktok or youtube content

1794
01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.060
that just tells them how to be those, uh,

1795
01:33:58.069 --> 01:34:01.910
assholes basically. But, uh, I, I wouldn't know of

1796
01:34:01.919 --> 01:34:03.720
a, of a solution to that. I think it

1797
01:34:03.729 --> 01:34:06.819
would come from politics, from deep changes. And I

1798
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:12.109
think this disgruntlement of segments of the male population

1799
01:34:12.129 --> 01:34:15.250
also has deep economic roots. You know, the the

1800
01:34:15.259 --> 01:34:19.209
Western countries have been kind of plateauing or declining,

1801
01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.549
not declining, but their economies, you know, are not

1802
01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.129
booming like they used to be in the post

1803
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:25.250
World War Two era. So for a lot of

1804
01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:29.209
men today, you know, you're not necessarily necessarily gonna

1805
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.979
do as well as your parents. You're not gonna

1806
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:32.439
be able to buy a house in a big

1807
01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:34.919
city because the real estate prices, blah, blah, blah,

1808
01:34:35.419 --> 01:34:38.569
those are all super deep political economic issues. And

1809
01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.819
I think they are driving forces in the manos

1810
01:34:40.859 --> 01:34:43.709
sphere as well. So my question, my answer would

1811
01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.149
be, it's complicated and I don't have any, you

1812
01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.189
know, magic solution.

1813
01:34:47.729 --> 01:34:50.569
Yeah, but great. Uh I think that's a very

1814
01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.680
good final message for us to win the interview

1815
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:57.140
one. And Louie uh if people are interested in

1816
01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:59.959
learning more about you and your work, where can

1817
01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:01.700
they find you on the internet,

1818
01:35:02.839 --> 01:35:06.899
you can find my publications on Google's color. And

1819
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:09.879
then I am almost, I don't know when the

1820
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:12.279
podcast will be out, but I am writing up

1821
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.120
the final stages of my phd dissertation. So if

1822
01:35:15.129 --> 01:35:18.569
you're more interested about this, I wrote 400 pages

1823
01:35:18.729 --> 01:35:22.330
of Mano Sphere, History, Manoe Sociology. And you will

1824
01:35:22.339 --> 01:35:26.319
have a complete breakdown of my analysis where I

1825
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:29.359
compare the scientific state of the art, the scientific

1826
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:31.520
literature. And I try to be really fair and

1827
01:35:31.529 --> 01:35:34.240
even handed to what people actually say in the

1828
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:38.080
manos. And so if yourself, some of your listeners

1829
01:35:38.089 --> 01:35:40.720
are, you know, adjacent or interested involved in the

1830
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:45.240
atmosphere. Um I'm trying to examine your beliefs and

1831
01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:48.189
tropes and compare them with what actual evolutionary science

1832
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.129
says. And uh I hope it can, you know,

1833
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.810
lead you to reconsider some positions or to nuance

1834
01:35:53.819 --> 01:35:56.350
some of them that would be uh also uh

1835
01:35:56.359 --> 01:35:58.229
I would be very proud if my research can

1836
01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:58.910
accomplish that.

1837
01:35:59.589 --> 01:36:02.569
Great. So perhaps we have to schedule a second

1838
01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:08.209
interview when your dissertation is finished. So to talk

1839
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.609
about all of the other information you will probably

1840
01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.850
have there. So thank you so much for doing

1841
01:36:14.859 --> 01:36:18.540
this. It's been a very fun and uh very

1842
01:36:18.549 --> 01:36:21.890
fun and informative conversation too. Thanks for having me,

1843
