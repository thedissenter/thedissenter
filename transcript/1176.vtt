00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.530
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops, and

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.810
today I'm joined by Doctor Justin Le Miller. He's

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.810
a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and an

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.969
internationally recognized sex educator, and today we're going to

6
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.295
focus. Primarily on his book Tell Me What You

7
00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.334
Want, The Science of Sexual desire and how it

8
00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.055
can help you improve your sex life, and we're

9
00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:30.135
going to talk about sexual fantasy. So, Doctor Le

10
00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.334
Miller, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

11
00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:32.534
everyone.

12
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.215
Hi, Ricardo, thanks for having me.

13
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.869
So tell us first, perhaps just to introduce the

14
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.990
topic here, what is a sexual fantasy and what

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.330
counts as such?

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.400
So a sexual fantasy is basically a mental image

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.400
or thought that turns you on. And this is

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.029
something that happens while you're awake and conscious. So

19
00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:00.139
we're not talking about sexual dreams here. That's a

20
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.439
different feast entirely, and the content of sex dreams

21
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.480
can often be quite different from the content of

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.839
our sexual fantasies, but a sexual fantasy, the simplest

23
00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.480
way to think about it is that it's a

24
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.080
mental picture that turns you on and that pops

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.300
into your head while you're awake.

26
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:21.750
And how has psychology traditionally dealt with sexual fantasies?

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900
I mean, how are they approached?

28
00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.680
So they've been viewed somewhat differently over time in

29
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.879
the field. So for example, if you go back

30
00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.989
to the days of Sigmund Freud as one example,

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.029
he viewed fantasies through a pretty negative lens. So

32
00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:41.230
Freud famously wrote that a happy person never fantasizes,

33
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.160
only a dissatisfied one. So Freud's view was really

34
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.360
that you wouldn't have indeed to fantasize if you

35
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480
were sexually content and that you would only be

36
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.849
fantasizing if there was something wrong or missing in

37
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.959
your sexual life. Now, over time, views in the

38
00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.839
field shifted and, you know, in the 1960s, the

39
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.599
psychologist Dr. Jerome Singer published a book called Daydreaming

40
00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.839
where he really reframed the way that we think

41
00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:09.679
about sexual fantasies and instead of viewing them as

42
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.160
a Through this sort of deficit lens, he viewed

43
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.789
fantasies as something that could be a positive, healthy,

44
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.119
normal aspect of, of our sexuality, and that really

45
00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.080
reflects more the dominant view of the field today

46
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.850
is that for the most part, fantasizing is viewed

47
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.210
as the This healthy aspect of sexuality, you know,

48
00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.570
we see that people who fantasize more tend to

49
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.889
have fewer sexual problems, tend to be more sexually

50
00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.949
satisfied, but that's not to say that fantasies are

51
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.850
positive or healthy in all cases, right? There can

52
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.800
be a dark side to sexual fantasizing where Sometimes

53
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
people might feel a lot of distress about the

54
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.350
things that they fantasize about, or they might fantasize

55
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.800
about things that would be illegal or nonconsensual to

56
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.559
do, and they're afraid that they might act on

57
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.960
them, and, you know, that sort of becomes a

58
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.990
whole other issue where, you know, what is the

59
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.759
link between fantasy and sexual offending, and I don't

60
00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.039
know if we'll have time to get into that,

61
00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.399
but, you know, there's all kinds of things that

62
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.279
could be said here, but there's certainly been a

63
00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.039
big shift in the way the field has viewed

64
00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.039
fantasies over time.

65
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.500
Yeah, hopefully later we will have time to get

66
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.210
into that a little bit more, but what is

67
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.149
the deal with what psychologists and I guess also

68
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:21.610
psychiatrists call paraphilia? I mean, what, what is a

69
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.619
paraphilia exactly? Because it sounds to me that it,

70
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.660
that it has a sort of negative connotation attached

71
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.160
to it.

72
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.949
Yeah, so a paraphilia clinically defined refers to an

73
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:41.669
unusual or atypical or uncommon sexual interest. And You

74
00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.300
know, the term paraphilia, if you look at the

75
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.789
current version of the DSM, there are about 8

76
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.910
specific paraphillias that are defined in there, and that

77
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.949
includes things like exhibitionism, which is where you're non-consensually

78
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.389
showing your genitals off to to someone else. It

79
00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.949
includes voyeurism, things like where you're spying on other

80
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.220
people without their knowledge or consent. It also includes

81
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.520
sadism and masochism. Uh, AND you know, historically lots

82
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.880
of things have been considered paraphillias that today aren't

83
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.360
considered to be paraphillias, you know, for example, up

84
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.480
until the early 1970s, homosexuality was actually listed as

85
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.648
a paraphilia in the DSM. And if you look

86
00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:23.329
beyond the DSM, I actually have a book on

87
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:27.569
my shelf behind me that lists 500 specific paraphillias

88
00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.528
in it. And when you start looking at that

89
00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:32.688
list, almost anything can be considered to be a

90
00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:35.148
paraphilia, you know, so it really depends on who

91
00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:38.688
is defining paraphilia and, and what's the reference point,

92
00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:41.079
you know, what is unusual or uncommon. Common to

93
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.160
one person might seem pretty normative to, to someone

94
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.920
else. And so, I think historically we've identified a

95
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.920
lot of things as paraphillias that aren't actually necessarily

96
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.519
statistically rare and actually aren't all that uncommon when

97
00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.720
it comes to what it is that turns people

98
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.079
on. And so I think the, the bigger question

99
00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.279
when we're talking about You know, what is a

100
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.119
healthy versus unhealthy sexual interest has a lot more

101
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.709
to do with, well, is it consensual or not,

102
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.440
and also does it cause distress to the individual

103
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.000
who has that particular sexual interest.

104
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.000
So do you think that perhaps some of what

105
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.910
are what are now considered paraphillias will be not

106
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.040
considered such in the future?

107
00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.369
Yeah, I mean, I think the, the concept of

108
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.709
paraphilia is something that is subjective and it's always

109
00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.170
evolving and ongoing. And in the most recent version

110
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.049
of the DSM for the first time ever, they

111
00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:38.010
made a distinction between having a paraphilia and having

112
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.489
a paraphillic disorder, with the paraphilia being just you

113
00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:44.049
have an uncommon or unusual sexual interest and a

114
00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:47.420
paraphillic disorder meaning it's uncommon or unusual. Plus it's

115
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.940
coupled with distress or it's leading to other problems

116
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.700
or it's related to criminality or something along those

117
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.779
lines. So, you know, in the past, in the

118
00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.059
field, we didn't really make that distinction, and so

119
00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.410
things like BDSM would get lumped into this paraphilia

120
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.160
category and then would be associated with mental illness,

121
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.619
when in reality, most people who are kinky and

122
00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:13.100
into BDSM. ARE perfectly psychologically well adjusted, right? So

123
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.940
it's a subjective thing that I think is always

124
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.140
evolving in terms of how we think about it,

125
00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:18.880
view it, treat it in the field.

126
00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.529
So let's get into the survey you conducted a

127
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.799
few years ago on Americans sexual fantasies, which is

128
00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.190
the main thing you explore in your book. So

129
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.410
tell us first, how did you conduct the study?

130
00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:38.640
So this was a survey that I conducted for

131
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.119
a book that I wrote called Tell Me What

132
00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.989
You Want, and the survey took me a couple

133
00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:45.959
of years to do because I recruited data, or

134
00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:49.200
I recruited participants from all over the US, from

135
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.299
all 50 states, and it was a large sample

136
00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:55.589
of Almost 4200 American adults ranging in age from

137
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:58.239
18 all the way up through their eighties, and

138
00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:01.000
I asked them to complete this very extensive online

139
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.959
survey. It consisted of, I think, 369 questions that

140
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:08.450
asked about their favorite fantasy of all time. Hundreds

141
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.690
of different people, places and things they might have

142
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.309
ever fantasized about, as well as extensive questions about

143
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:19.010
their personalities, their attachment styles, their demographic backgrounds, and,

144
00:07:19.109 --> 00:07:21.209
and lots of other aspects of the self because

145
00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:23.450
I wanted to look at not just what do

146
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.329
people fantasize about, but is there any connection between

147
00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:29.529
our fantasies and different aspects of the self. So

148
00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:33.730
are our fantasies related to our personalities or demographic

149
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.899
backgrounds or age and things like that.

150
00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:41.290
And so what are the most common or what

151
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.290
were the most common sexual fantasies?

152
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.790
So I analyzed people's favorite fantasy of all time

153
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.290
and found that there were really 7 main themes

154
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.510
that seemed to categorize them. So, the first of

155
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.630
these was multi-partner sex, which was basically sex involving

156
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.250
more than 2 people, could be a threesome orgy,

157
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.480
anything involving some type of group. Then there were

158
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.750
the power, control, and rough sex fantasies, which was

159
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.600
anything that falls under the kink or BDSM umbrella.

160
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.029
Then we have the novelty and adventure fantasies, which

161
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:16.809
are about kind of just adding a new twist

162
00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:19.630
or new element to to sex, such as having

163
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.429
sex in a new position or location or or

164
00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:25.649
just otherwise adding some element of novelty or adventure.

165
00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:28.829
Then we have the passion and romance fantasies, which

166
00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.460
are fantasies about emotional fulfillment in some way, tapping

167
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.070
into some deeper psychological need, such as the desire

168
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.270
to be desired, you know, wanting to feel wanted

169
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.960
by a partner. Then we have the non-monogamy fantasies,

170
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.679
which are different from the group sex fantasies because

171
00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:48.640
these are fantasies about being able to pursue multiple

172
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.760
sexual or romantic relationships at the same time. So

173
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.190
for instance, that might involve a fantasy about cheating

174
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.760
on your romantic partner, or it might involve a

175
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.590
fantasy about you and your partner swinging with another

176
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.789
couple or something along those lines. Then we have

177
00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:08.409
the gender bending and homoeroticism fantasies, which are about

178
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.630
sort of playing with the boundaries or limits of

179
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.590
your gender identity or sexual identity in some way,

180
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.510
such as a cisgender person who fantasizes about cross-dressing

181
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.429
or a heterosexual person who has a same sex

182
00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:24.099
fantasy. And then finally, there are the taboo fantasies,

183
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.770
which are basically the fantasies that involve doing anything

184
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.030
that is socially or culturally forbidden for you.

185
00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:34.090
Do you think, or did you find that there's

186
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.469
perhaps any common thread that runs along all of

187
00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:43.309
these fantasies, or are they completely distinct from one

188
00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:43.809
another?

189
00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:47.510
Well, so in terms of these seven themes, they're

190
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.590
not mutually exclusive. Like these are different themes that

191
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.390
can be combined in any number of ways. And

192
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.630
in some of the follow-up research that I've done,

193
00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.469
I've asked people to describe their favorite fantasy and

194
00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:01.585
then to select which of these. Themes apply to

195
00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:04.265
that particular fantasy that they have, and I find

196
00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:06.905
that more often than not, people are selecting multiple

197
00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:09.625
elements, and there's only about 2 to 3% of

198
00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:12.054
people who say that none of those seven themes

199
00:10:12.054 --> 00:10:14.744
apply to their favorite fantasy. So I consider these

200
00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:17.700
to be kind of the seven. Building blocks, if

201
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.500
you will, of our erotic fantasies that can be

202
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.020
combined in in any number of ways, and that

203
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.539
I think are tapping into, you know, sort of

204
00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:28.940
different core erotic needs that people have, like the

205
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.619
need for novelty or the, you know, sort of

206
00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:35.299
need to connect with someone else, right? And for

207
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:38.059
some people one particular need is more important than

208
00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:41.830
another, and that goes into You know, how I

209
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.710
found that our fantasies are related to a lot

210
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.739
of different aspects of the self, they're related to

211
00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:47.669
where we are in our lives at a given

212
00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:49.869
point, and so some of those themes might be

213
00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:53.070
more important at different stages of development or different

214
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.010
stages of life.

215
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.669
Um, SO this study or this survey was conducted

216
00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.010
among a sample of American individuals. Do you have

217
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.169
any idea if, uh, other people have conducted similar

218
00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:11.119
surveys in other countries or if, uh, your findings

219
00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:13.969
could extrapolate to other countries?

220
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.849
Yeah, so since I conducted the original survey for

221
00:11:16.849 --> 00:11:19.369
the book, I've studied the sexual fantasies of more

222
00:11:19.369 --> 00:11:22.090
than 10,000 people from all around the world, and

223
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.929
I've actually partnered with and collaborated with some researchers

224
00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:27.590
in other countries to try and replicate the results.

225
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.450
And what we see is that for the most

226
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.770
part, the things in the US that are the

227
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.530
most common sexual fantasies tend to be the most

228
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.469
common sexual fantasies in other parts of the world,

229
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.450
and the least common fantasies here in the states

230
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.010
also tend to be the least common fantasies elsewhere.

231
00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:47.909
Now, now certainly there are some Some differences and

232
00:11:47.909 --> 00:11:50.950
variations, you know, for example, one that pops out

233
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.229
to me off the top of my head is

234
00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:55.309
that I find that on average, people who live

235
00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:59.070
in European countries, especially Western Europe, tend to have

236
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.030
more of the kinky sexual fantasies compared to people.

237
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.854
In other parts of the world. So there are

238
00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:07.335
some regional variations in terms of the, the prevalence

239
00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:11.854
of given fantasies, but for the most part, there

240
00:12:11.854 --> 00:12:14.575
seems to be more commonality than differences in terms

241
00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:16.094
of what it is that people around the world

242
00:12:16.094 --> 00:12:17.294
are fantasizing about.

243
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.570
And uh what do we know about where our

244
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.630
sexual fantasies stem from? I mean, what influences them?

245
00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:29.469
So I like to think of our fantasies as

246
00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:34.989
being biopsychosocial, meaning there can be biological, psychological, and

247
00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:39.650
also sociocultural factors that contribute to The extent to

248
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.340
which we have fantasies and then also specifically what

249
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.140
it is that we fantasize about. So for example,

250
00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:49.299
if we think about biological factors in relation to

251
00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:52.880
sexual fantasies, well, something like our hormone levels is

252
00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:54.940
actually really important when it comes to whether or

253
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.520
not we even have fantasies. So what we see

254
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.609
is that for instance, when People have lower levels

255
00:13:01.609 --> 00:13:04.049
of sex hormones in their bodies, they tend to

256
00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:05.960
have fewer fantasies, and this is part of the

257
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.489
reason why as people age, fantasies tend to decrease

258
00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:11.719
in frequency. Uh, YOU know, I've done some research,

259
00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:14.809
for example, recently on menopausal women and their sexuality,

260
00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.799
and I find that There tends to be a

261
00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.659
decline in sexual fantasies for women as they undergo

262
00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:23.409
the menopause transition. However, for menopausal women who are

263
00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:28.210
given hormone therapy or hormone replacement, they don't experience

264
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.409
as big of a drop in their sexual fantasies,

265
00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:32.250
right? So, you know, that's, that's one example of

266
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.020
a biological. Logical factor related to fantasizing and you

267
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.539
know, there's also some work on the menstrual cycle

268
00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:40.460
and sexual fantasies and what we see is that

269
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.219
women actually fantasize more about sex when they're near

270
00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:45.780
the point of ovulation. So when women are most

271
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.299
fertile, they tend to have more of those erotic

272
00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:52.299
thoughts, right? So, Biology certainly plays a role in

273
00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:56.479
terms of psychology, our personality plays a big role

274
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.340
in in terms of what we fantasize about. So

275
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.059
I find that all of the big five personality

276
00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:03.710
traits are related to different types of fantasies that

277
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.375
people have. So as a Couple of examples, if

278
00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:09.494
you're a more extroverted person, meaning you're more sociable

279
00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:12.695
and outgoing in real life, you tend to have

280
00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:16.135
more sociable and extroverted sexual fantasies. So you're more

281
00:14:16.135 --> 00:14:19.255
likely to fantasize about group sex and non-monogamy and

282
00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:21.294
other things like that. It's not to say that

283
00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:23.484
it's a foregone conclusion that if you're an extrovert,

284
00:14:23.494 --> 00:14:27.044
that you are into orgies, but there is a

285
00:14:27.044 --> 00:14:31.229
correlation there. Also for people who are high in

286
00:14:31.229 --> 00:14:34.429
say a trait like neuroticism, where they have a

287
00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:38.469
lot of swings between positive and negative mood states

288
00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:41.789
and where they have more difficulty dealing with and

289
00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:44.789
navigating stress, they tend to play it safer in

290
00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:47.239
their fantasies where they don't fantasize as much about

291
00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:49.390
kind of like going outside of their comfort zone

292
00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:52.049
because they want to do things that are more

293
00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:54.429
comfortable for them that aren't going to stress them

294
00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:57.429
out, you know, as they're thinking about sex, um.

295
00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.210
You know, and then in terms of like the

296
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.849
socio-cultural factors, I do find that there are some

297
00:15:02.849 --> 00:15:06.609
cross cultural differences in fantasies too. Uh, ONE of

298
00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:09.390
them being in terms of who we fantasize about.

299
00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:13.159
So for example, when I look at the characteristics

300
00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.280
of the people we fantasize about, I, I ask

301
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.690
people about, you know, height, race, age, weight, you

302
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.210
know, all these other sorts of things. And one

303
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.489
interesting thing that I find is that if you

304
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:26.659
look at Asian Americans, so people of Asian descent

305
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:30.159
who are living in the United States, predominantly they're

306
00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:33.969
fantasizing about white people. By contrast, if you look

307
00:15:33.969 --> 00:15:36.840
at Asian people living in Asian cultures, they're primarily

308
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.530
fantasizing about other Asian people, and I think that's

309
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.849
one like telling example of how culture can influence

310
00:15:42.849 --> 00:15:46.679
fantasies, and there are stereotypes in American culture. Culture

311
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.799
about Asian individuals in terms of their sexuality, for

312
00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:53.030
example, the negative stereotypes about Asian men in particular,

313
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:56.119
and those kinds of stereotypes can be internalized, and

314
00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:58.719
then they can transfer over into our fantasy content

315
00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:00.400
in terms of how we think about or see

316
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.159
ourselves or in terms of who it is that

317
00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:05.669
we see as desirable. And so, yeah, our fantasies

318
00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:09.919
are this complex product of biology, psychology, and society

319
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:10.520
and culture.

320
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.039
That's really fascinating. How about porn? I mean, do

321
00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:20.400
we have any idea as to whether porn influences

322
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.559
our sexual fantasies in terms of their content?

323
00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:27.630
Yeah, so I find that pornography has a bidirectional

324
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:33.349
association with fantasizing, meaning that porn both shapes the

325
00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:36.630
content of our fantasies, but people are also going

326
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.190
to pornography to vicariously live out their fantasies, right?

327
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.979
So it's not just one or the other. More

328
00:16:42.979 --> 00:16:45.719
often than not, however, people are going to porn

329
00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:47.590
as a way to, to kind of live out

330
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.799
or explore their fantasies. But I find that somewhere

331
00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:55.280
around 1 in 10 people can directly connect their

332
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.440
favorite fantasy of all time with something that they

333
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.840
saw in the world of porn, right? They can

334
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.340
say, There was this video I saw or this

335
00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:05.790
erotic novel I read, and it just sort of

336
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.239
awakened something in me and I fantasized about this

337
00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:11.030
thing ever since. But it's not just pornography that

338
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.680
has this influence, right? We, we tend to like

339
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.959
think of porn as like this special thing that

340
00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.520
influences our fantasies, but it's not, you know, I

341
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.390
also see even more people who report that their

342
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.199
fantasies were influenced by something they saw in popular.

343
00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:27.183
Media, you know, in television or film, or something

344
00:17:27.183 --> 00:17:29.144
that they, they read about in a novel that

345
00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:31.384
wasn't 50 Shades of Grey or that wasn't an

346
00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.943
erotic novel in the first place. You know, our

347
00:17:33.943 --> 00:17:37.404
fantasies have these very complex and diverse roots, and

348
00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.384
I think we'd like to oversimplify it and say

349
00:17:40.384 --> 00:17:43.024
it's all about porn, especially in this era where

350
00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:45.504
everybody has all this access to the world's largest

351
00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:49.619
collection of porn ever known to humankind, but Fantasy

352
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:51.500
content is influenced by a lot more than just

353
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.339
porn. Porn is one contributing factor, but there's more

354
00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.040
to it than that.

355
00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.170
How about sex differences? Are there differences between men

356
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.630
and women when it comes to their sexual fantasies?

357
00:18:04.329 --> 00:18:06.300
Sure, and if you look at the broader literature

358
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.650
on sexual fantasies, there have long been differences between

359
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.719
men and women that have been noted. And I,

360
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.020
you know, my research is no exception to that.

361
00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:19.119
I, I will say that overall, I think there

362
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:22.160
are more similarities than differences, you know, most of

363
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.280
the things that men fantasize about, women also fantasize

364
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.089
about, and vice versa. But if you look at

365
00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:30.270
some of the key differences where you see the

366
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.589
biggest Divergence. One is that men on average tend

367
00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:40.630
to fantasize more about multi-partner sex and non-monogamy and

368
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:44.709
taboo activities compared to women, and by contrast, women

369
00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:48.270
fantasize more about passion and romance and also kink

370
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.890
in BDSM compared to men, right? Now, another interesting

371
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.000
thing is that when I break my data down

372
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.280
and look at it by age, so if we

373
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.670
look at men and women, you know, by different

374
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.589
decades of life, the size of some of these

375
00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:05.520
gender differences actually changes a little bit, and it

376
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.380
shrinks in some cases. So for example, the difference

377
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.760
between men and women in terms of the degree

378
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.479
to which they fantasize about sex with multiple partners

379
00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:19.599
or non-monogamy actually shrinks at midlife compared to Other

380
00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:22.640
stages of life, and you know, there's something that's

381
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.920
interesting just more generally going on in midlife where

382
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.260
people's fantasies across the board, across gender and sex,

383
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.209
just become more adventuresome in a lot of ways.

384
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:33.219
Uh, THERE could be a lot of reasons for

385
00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:34.989
this, you know, one is that some people are

386
00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:37.680
kind of having their midlife crisis, another is that,

387
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.479
uh, you know, people at that stage of life

388
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.229
sometimes start to care a little bit less about

389
00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:44.959
what other people think and feel more freedom to

390
00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:48.739
kind of explore their sexuality. But also, you have

391
00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:50.459
a lot of people who have been in long-term

392
00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:53.339
monogamous marriages, and you know, at that point, they're

393
00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:55.579
kind of looking for this newness and novelty and

394
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:58.459
excitement because the sex has grown pretty boring or

395
00:19:58.459 --> 00:20:01.699
routine or predictable in their relationship. So, uh, yes,

396
00:20:01.819 --> 00:20:04.579
there are lots of sex differences, but it's interesting

397
00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.880
that the size of those sex differences seems to

398
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.400
uh change at different stages of life.

399
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.000
And do you have any explanation for those differences?

400
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.630
I mean, why is it that men tend to

401
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.800
have a little bit more sexual fantasies related to

402
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.800
group sex and non-monogamy and taboo fantasies and women

403
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.280
more BDSM fantasies, king king fantasies and things like

404
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:35.560
that.

405
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.890
Sure, and there are different theories on why some

406
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.000
of these differences exist. And if you think about,

407
00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:45.770
for example, why men have more fantasies about group

408
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.729
sex or non-monogamy, that's often discussed through an evolutionary

409
00:20:49.729 --> 00:20:54.619
lens, right, because Evolutionarily, it's seen as more adaptive

410
00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.380
for men to want to have sex with multiple

411
00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.339
partners to quote unquote spread their seed, uh, because

412
00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:04.660
it's more reproductively advantageous for them, and there is

413
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.140
some limited research where, for example, they've shown men

414
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.819
different types of pornography and, uh, and then collected

415
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:14.765
semen samples from them, and in one condition. They

416
00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:17.165
were shown a video of, you know, kind of

417
00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:19.765
an all-female threesome, and in another video, they were

418
00:21:19.765 --> 00:21:23.084
shown multiple men having sex with one woman. And

419
00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:25.765
what they find is that when you have multiple

420
00:21:25.765 --> 00:21:28.405
men who are kind of competing, if you will,

421
00:21:28.484 --> 00:21:32.084
for the same partner, that men release more motile

422
00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:35.045
or active sperm in their ejaculate compared to when

423
00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:39.319
they're watching an all-female. SCENARIO. And, and the thought

424
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.280
there is that, you know, this is some evidence

425
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.959
of what's called sperm competition, which is this idea

426
00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:46.760
that men's brains and bodies evolved to, to kind

427
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.589
of be aroused by situations where you have multiple

428
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:53.750
men competing for the same female and so their,

429
00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.760
their brains and bodies are doing things that are

430
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.260
going to try and help them outcompete those of

431
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.520
other men who are around, right? So you can

432
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.750
think about some of this stuff through an evolutionary

433
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.290
lens. I don't think we can say for sure

434
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.250
that, you know, that's what the explanation is, but

435
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.869
there is some evidence that's at least consistent with

436
00:22:09.869 --> 00:22:14.920
that idea. Um, BUT yeah, it's, I, I don't

437
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.119
think it's fully settled in terms of why there

438
00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:19.920
are these sex differences in, in sexual fantasy content,

439
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040
but there are lots of different theories and ideas

440
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.979
out there for it.

441
00:22:23.739 --> 00:22:26.219
So I asked you earlier about porn. I mean,

442
00:22:26.329 --> 00:22:29.900
is there also a political element to sexual fantasies,

443
00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:34.420
or do our political preferences also influence in any

444
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.140
way our sexual fantasies? Like, for example, in the

445
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.719
particular case of the US, are there differences between

446
00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:43.219
Democrats and Republicans?

447
00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:47.449
So I do find that there are associations between

448
00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:50.650
people's political beliefs and the things that they fantasize

449
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.329
about, at least in the US context, because that's

450
00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:57.010
primarily where I've looked at this. And what I

451
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:03.790
see is that Republicans on average fantasize more about

452
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.660
non-monogamy and multi-partner sex and taboo activities, um. Or

453
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.300
things that are taboo for them, uh, compared to,

454
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.609
to Democrats, right, and Republicans historically have kind of

455
00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:18.180
been the party of quote unquote family values, if

456
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.979
you will, where they promote this ideal of monogamous

457
00:23:21.979 --> 00:23:25.339
lifelong marriage and sex for purposes of procreation. So

458
00:23:25.459 --> 00:23:28.180
you see a lot of these fantasies about things

459
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.880
that are kind of violating that norm of monogamy

460
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.939
among people who identify as Republicans. By contrast, in

461
00:23:35.939 --> 00:23:38.660
terms of Democrats and their fantasies, I see that

462
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.739
they fantasize more on average about Kink and BDSM

463
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.239
compared to Republicans, so they have more fantasies about

464
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.780
power play. And I think what's going on here

465
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.900
is that essentially Politically, what people are fantasizing about

466
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.300
to some extent is that they're fantasizing about what

467
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.699
is taboo for them in terms of their political

468
00:23:57.699 --> 00:24:00.839
context. And so for Republicans, you've got that, you

469
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:04.180
know, norm of monogamy and, you know, sex for

470
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.180
purposes of procreation, and so, you know, doing anything

471
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.569
that sort of violates or subverts that norm is,

472
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.699
is taboo and that becomes more exciting, you know,

473
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.560
whenever we're told that we're not allowed to do

474
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.954
something, it tends to become more. Tantalizing, right? This

475
00:24:16.954 --> 00:24:19.714
goes back to something that the psychologist Jack Moran

476
00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:22.074
wrote about in his book, The Erotic Mind, which

477
00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:25.375
he refers to as the erotic equation, which means

478
00:24:25.385 --> 00:24:28.714
attraction plus obstacles equals excitement. And so if you

479
00:24:28.714 --> 00:24:31.015
have even the slightest inkling to want to do

480
00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:33.635
something, and then there's this obstacle thrown up in

481
00:24:33.635 --> 00:24:35.515
your path that says, no, you can't do that,

482
00:24:35.795 --> 00:24:37.354
that makes us want to do it even more.

483
00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:40.074
It sort of fuels the, the desire, the excitement

484
00:24:40.074 --> 00:24:42.849
for it. So, and then on the, you know,

485
00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:48.479
sort of democratic side. Political liberals tend to espouse

486
00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:50.910
the idea of this, you know, very level playing

487
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.040
field, and there shouldn't be any power differentials or

488
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.719
imbalances, and, you know, power differentials are inherently exploitative

489
00:24:57.719 --> 00:25:00.439
and so forth. And so this idea of thereby

490
00:25:00.439 --> 00:25:05.300
playing with power, I think becomes more tantalizing to

491
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.280
people who are politically aligned with this belief that

492
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.650
everybody's on like a level and equal playing field.

493
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.239
So I think to some extent that might explain

494
00:25:13.239 --> 00:25:16.670
why we see these political differences is that. It's

495
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.609
the cultural environment or context in which you're embedded,

496
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.390
where the things that you're told you're not supposed

497
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.510
to do just become more tantalizing.

498
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:26.760
That's really interesting. I mean, I don't know if

499
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.599
you know anything specifically about this, but do you

500
00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:33.709
think that that same kind of interpretation of the,

501
00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:37.479
the differences in terms of sexual fantasies between Democrats

502
00:25:37.479 --> 00:25:43.040
and Republicans could explain. Data coming from Pornhub that

503
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:49.359
points to uh red states consuming more, uh, trans

504
00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:53.199
porn, for example. I mean, because people who identify

505
00:25:53.199 --> 00:25:58.040
as Republican or are more conservative tend to not

506
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.439
like trans people as much or consider the topic

507
00:26:01.439 --> 00:26:03.770
of trans people as taboo in a way. Do

508
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.790
you think that that could explain it as well,

509
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.219
or?

510
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.219
Yeah, I mean there could certainly be something to

511
00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:12.339
that and, and you know, related to that, something

512
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:14.459
that I've seen in some of my own data

513
00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:19.260
is that there's this link between having a toward

514
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.420
religion, there's this link between religiosity and same-sex attraction

515
00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:25.900
that also emerges and you know that's another one

516
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.920
of those taboo things for um people who are

517
00:26:30.939 --> 00:26:36.449
more politically conservative and so. And, and I, I

518
00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:38.689
think it's important to mention that our fantasies themselves

519
00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:42.150
are not politically correct, and they often do not

520
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.089
align with our political values in the way that

521
00:26:46.089 --> 00:26:47.729
you might think that they do, and, and I

522
00:26:47.729 --> 00:26:50.250
think that there is some of that, you know,

523
00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:52.729
just sort of taboo element that's going on there,

524
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.810
but I think there's also this element of internalized

525
00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.880
shame where if you were brought up in an

526
00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:00.155
Environment where you're told that certain things are wrong,

527
00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:02.364
but that is like a core aspect of who

528
00:27:02.364 --> 00:27:05.005
you are and how you experience your sexuality, that

529
00:27:05.005 --> 00:27:07.074
can lead to a certain level of shame that

530
00:27:07.074 --> 00:27:09.405
leads you to present a different version of yourself

531
00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:11.584
to the outside world than who you are in

532
00:27:11.584 --> 00:27:14.204
private. And that's, so that's why you often see

533
00:27:14.204 --> 00:27:17.204
people who get embroiled in these sexual scandals where

534
00:27:17.204 --> 00:27:20.824
they've been espousing certain political ideas, but in private,

535
00:27:20.984 --> 00:27:24.579
they've been Doing something, let's just say quite different.

536
00:27:25.349 --> 00:27:30.829
Yeah, uh, what does, what do one's sexual fantasies

537
00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:34.130
say about oneself? I mean, if we know about

538
00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:40.089
the sexual fantasies of someone, can we tell anything

539
00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.589
about them just from their fantasies?

540
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.040
So, I wouldn't say that if you told me

541
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.670
what your biggest fantasy of all time was that

542
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.719
I could 100% give you an accurate reading of

543
00:27:52.719 --> 00:27:54.920
your personality. I, I, I don't think it's that

544
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.400
simple. What I can tell you is that I

545
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.959
do see a predictable pattern of associations across multiple

546
00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:05.280
studies between the things people fantasize about and their

547
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:13.239
personality traits, their attachment styles. Their sociosexuality, their political

548
00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:17.829
and religious background, their age, right? So, fantasies are

549
00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:20.839
associated with a whole bunch of different factors, and

550
00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:24.140
so I could make an educated guess based on

551
00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:27.439
something that somebody fantasizes about what their personality or

552
00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.920
demographic traits are likely to be, but I wouldn't

553
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.760
say that it could be 100% accurate because These

554
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.800
are just correlations, they're associations. But the fact that

555
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.849
they exist and they exist consistently tells us that

556
00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:42.239
there is something there, like that, if our fantasies

557
00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:44.439
had no meaning, this would just all be random

558
00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:46.439
noise, you know, we wouldn't see anything, we wouldn't

559
00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:49.319
see these predictable patterns in the data. But the

560
00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:52.000
fact that we do says, yeah, our fantasies do

561
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.140
seem to tell us something about who we are

562
00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:57.079
and where we are in our life right now.

563
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.390
And I think it's also important to emphasize that

564
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.829
two people can have the same fantasy, but for

565
00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:05.979
very different reasons. So, let's take for example, the

566
00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:10.630
fantasy of a threesome. Not everybody who fantasizes about

567
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.079
a threesome. Fantasize about it, fantasizes about it for

568
00:29:14.079 --> 00:29:16.859
the same reason. So for example, for some people,

569
00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:19.400
a threesome fantasy might actually be a way for

570
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.310
them to explore some same sex or same gender

571
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.180
attraction that they have, right? Because maybe they are

572
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.810
a man partnered with a woman, but they have

573
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.800
a threesome in which another man comes in and

574
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.719
so it's a Way of, of kind of exploring

575
00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:35.930
that homoeroticism element. For other people, however, a threesome

576
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.290
might be more about, it might be less about

577
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.849
the gender or sex of their partners and more

578
00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:43.369
about wanting to be the center of attention, and

579
00:29:43.369 --> 00:29:46.599
wanting to be overwhelmingly desired by multiple people at

580
00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:49.729
once, right? And so, This is where it gets

581
00:29:49.729 --> 00:29:51.569
a little bit tricky with our fantasies, and it's

582
00:29:51.569 --> 00:29:55.170
why we don't have necessarily huge associations between fantasies

583
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.170
and some of these other traits and characteristics is

584
00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.930
because different people can have that fantasy for different

585
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.469
reasons. Yeah.

586
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:07.969
And we've talked here mainly about the themes, or

587
00:30:07.969 --> 00:30:12.400
the seven main themes you uncovered through your, uh,

588
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.599
survey, your research when it comes to people's sexual

589
00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:20.410
fantasies, but who do people fantasize about? I mean,

590
00:30:20.489 --> 00:30:23.810
uh, what, what are the people that tend to

591
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.109
be part of their fantasies? Mhm.

592
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.729
So, this is a good question, and the single

593
00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:34.910
most person who's likely to appear in your fantasies

594
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.949
is your current romantic partner, if you're somebody who

595
00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:40.969
is in a current romantic relationship. Now, if you're

596
00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:43.569
not currently in a relationship, the most likely person

597
00:30:43.569 --> 00:30:47.050
to appear in your fantasies is an ex-partner, right?

598
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.989
So, more often than not in our fantasies. We

599
00:30:50.989 --> 00:30:54.349
are picturing people that we know well and who

600
00:30:54.349 --> 00:30:58.310
we are currently or have previously been intimately involved

601
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.390
with, and I think that speaks to the fact

602
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.150
that our fantasies are often about meeting some deeper

603
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.890
emotional need or wanting to connect with someone else,

604
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.349
and it's easier to Feel emotionally validated in that

605
00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:13.609
way when you're picturing somebody with whom you already

606
00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:16.189
have or at least have had that connection with

607
00:31:16.189 --> 00:31:19.380
before. By contrast, if you look at fantasies about,

608
00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:21.630
you know, celebrities and the rich and famous, you

609
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.550
know, certainly most people have had one of those

610
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.540
fantasies before at one time or another, but more

611
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.810
often than not, that's not who we're picturing when

612
00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:33.310
we close our eyes and, and, and fantasize and

613
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.699
fantasize. There, there can be a whole host of

614
00:31:36.699 --> 00:31:38.790
other people who appear in our fantasies though. I,

615
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.699
it can also include friends and and acquaintances. It

616
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:45.219
could include co-workers or bosses, uh, it could include

617
00:31:45.219 --> 00:31:48.599
superheroes or comic book characters, right? There's a whole

618
00:31:49.099 --> 00:31:51.060
host of different people who might appear in our

619
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.780
sexual fantasies, but most of the time it's somebody

620
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.719
that we actually know fairly well.

621
00:31:56.599 --> 00:32:00.839
Yeah, that's really interesting. So should we say, or

622
00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:05.829
can we say that all sexual fantasies are normal?

623
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.599
I mean, and perhaps this ties back to my

624
00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:12.760
earlier question about paraphillias, but are all of them

625
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.959
normal or not?

626
00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:17.109
Well, it depends what you mean by the term

627
00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:20.560
normal, right? So, you know, when I use the

628
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.260
term normal in this context of talking about fantasies,

629
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.869
I'm using it to refer to things that are

630
00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:32.729
statistically common, right? And And that's not how everybody

631
00:32:32.729 --> 00:32:35.160
else uses the term normal, right? For some people,

632
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.130
normal implies more of a value judgment, like that

633
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.239
this is a healthy or unhealthy thing to, to

634
00:32:41.239 --> 00:32:43.250
fantasize about. So I'm, I'm staying out of the

635
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.930
realm of, of judgment and using it more in

636
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.329
the, the sense of, is this statistically common or

637
00:32:49.329 --> 00:32:53.750
not. And, you know, using that as, as, as

638
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.630
sort of the framework here, no, not every fantasy

639
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.989
is normal in the sense of being statistically common,

640
00:32:59.189 --> 00:33:01.349
but a lot of the things that we've historically

641
00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:04.410
thought of as being abnormal are actually pretty normal

642
00:33:04.829 --> 00:33:06.910
in terms of being more common than we thought.

643
00:33:07.189 --> 00:33:10.290
So for instance, things like kink and BDSM fantasies,

644
00:33:10.869 --> 00:33:12.989
they're so common in the population as to be

645
00:33:12.989 --> 00:33:17.425
considered normative. Also, if you look at fantasies about

646
00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.785
something like voyeurism, you know, spying on other people

647
00:33:19.785 --> 00:33:23.155
who are undressing or having sex, also incredibly common.

648
00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:26.385
But, you know, this question of, well, is it

649
00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:28.425
normal in the sense of being common? Does that

650
00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:30.824
mean it's OK to have the fantasy? Well, that's

651
00:33:30.824 --> 00:33:33.305
a different question, right? You know, this, this healthy

652
00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:36.135
or unhealthy thing is, is a totally separate element.

653
00:33:36.464 --> 00:33:39.084
So in the case of consensual kink and BDSM.

654
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.650
Yeah, it's common, and as long as it's consensual

655
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.699
and risk away or risk informed for the people

656
00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:48.260
who are participating in it, there's nothing inherently wrong

657
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.660
with with taking part in it. But for something

658
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.180
like voyeurism, which is by definition inherently nonconsensual, even

659
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.969
though it is common and and normative in the

660
00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.380
population, that doesn't mean that it would be OK

661
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.109
to act on, because by definition, it is inherently

662
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:05.704
nonconsensual. So again, I think we often have this

663
00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:08.235
tendency of getting too wrapped up and looking at

664
00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:10.675
the prevalence of a given fantasy and using that

665
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:13.185
as our metric for saying whether a given fantasy

666
00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:15.195
is good or bad. I think instead we need

667
00:34:15.195 --> 00:34:18.094
to look at, well, is this consensual or nonconsensual?

668
00:34:18.324 --> 00:34:21.274
And is, is somebody being harmed by, you know,

669
00:34:21.353 --> 00:34:23.313
if they were to act on that particular fantasy,

670
00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:26.074
or is it causing distress to the individual who,

671
00:34:26.195 --> 00:34:27.235
who has the fantasy?

672
00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:33.228
So people have their sexual fantasies. What happens when

673
00:34:33.228 --> 00:34:37.228
they share them with others, and I mean, how

674
00:34:37.228 --> 00:34:40.590
should people go about sharing their fantasies?

675
00:34:41.438 --> 00:34:44.438
So I find that across the surveys that I've

676
00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:47.800
done, about half of adults say that they've ever

677
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.239
shared a sexual fantasy with a partner before. And

678
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:54.590
for the most part, people are reporting positive outcomes,

679
00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.750
like somewhere between 2/3, 3/4 are saying their partner

680
00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.120
responded favorably or positively, and then there's some portion

681
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.600
who say that. You know, there, there wasn't really

682
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.639
a strong response one way or the other, and

683
00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:08.360
then a small number who are saying their partner

684
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.520
responded pretty negatively. So for the most part, people

685
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.270
are reporting positive outcomes when they share fantasies. Now,

686
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.520
one caveat to that is that people are a

687
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.679
little bit selective in terms of the fantasies that

688
00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:22.800
they share with their partner, and they're more likely

689
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.560
to share fantasies that they think are going to

690
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.280
get a positive response. So this isn't to say

691
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.179
that If you shared every single fantasy you've ever

692
00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:32.830
had that your partner's likely to have a positive

693
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.439
response to every single one of those. No, uh,

694
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.719
the way the data should be interpreted is that,

695
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.300
you know, for fantasies that people intentionally choose to

696
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.669
share with a partner. Based on what they think

697
00:35:44.669 --> 00:35:46.909
their partner is likely to be into, their partners

698
00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:50.189
usually respond favorably. Now, in terms of how to

699
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:52.389
share a fantasy with a partner, I don't think

700
00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:55.510
there's just one right or correct way to do

701
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:59.580
this because different people have different comfort levels, different

702
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.590
types and forms of preferred sexual communication, but here

703
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.550
are a few things that you can consider. So

704
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.300
one is that, you know, if you have a

705
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.949
hard time verbalizing your sexual wants and needs and

706
00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:16.129
desires. You can actually leverage technology to help you

707
00:36:16.129 --> 00:36:18.340
with this. So, for example, there are a couple

708
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.780
of apps that I often recommend. I don't have

709
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.419
a financial stake in them. I wish that I

710
00:36:22.419 --> 00:36:24.659
did because I recommend them all the time, uh,

711
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.580
but one of them is called X Confessions, the

712
00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.300
other one is called Own Your Sex, and basically

713
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.040
they're both sort of like Tinder for sexual fantasies.

714
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.379
And so you and your partner each download the

715
00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:38.899
app, you sync your accounts, and then separately you

716
00:36:38.899 --> 00:36:44.260
take a survey that's Prompts you with different sexual

717
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.179
acts or ideas that you might try, and then

718
00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.219
you basically swipe right if you're into it and

719
00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:51.370
swipe left if you aren't. And then what the

720
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.919
apps will do is they will compile your shared

721
00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:57.610
sexual interests, and they will only reveal to each

722
00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.139
of you the things that you're both into. So

723
00:37:00.139 --> 00:37:03.229
in that way, you don't have to risk Sharing

724
00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:05.270
something with your partner that they might not be

725
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.350
into. So I think that technology can be a

726
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.969
very useful way of kind of getting that conversation

727
00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:14.350
started and quickly honing in on your shared sexual

728
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.570
interests. Another way to have this conversation, if it

729
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.530
feels hard to just sort of put your specific

730
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.929
fantasy out there, is to, to reframe the conversation

731
00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:28.810
from being, what's your fantasy to how do you

732
00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.889
want to feel during sex? You know, what are

733
00:37:30.889 --> 00:37:33.570
the physical sensations that you want to experience, what

734
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.149
are the emotions that you want to feel? Essentially,

735
00:37:37.189 --> 00:37:40.229
what are your core erotic themes or needs during

736
00:37:40.229 --> 00:37:43.590
sex? And that's a totally different conversation and sometimes

737
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.989
one that's easier for people to have, because it

738
00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:48.850
gets away from the particulars of a given fantasy

739
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:53.189
because often Those particulars aren't really what it is

740
00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:55.139
that kind of turns us on and drives us

741
00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:58.820
wild. It's more about the deeper Intimate needs that

742
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.929
we might have. And so the nice thing about

743
00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:02.379
that question of how do you want to feel

744
00:38:02.379 --> 00:38:04.659
during sex is that if you can identify each

745
00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:07.620
partner's core erotic themes, you can then play with

746
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.610
that, and you can kind of build a custom

747
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.780
fantasy together that's going to meet everybody's needs in

748
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.590
that moment. And then, you know, other ways you

749
00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.189
can do this, I often recommend, you know, using

750
00:38:20.189 --> 00:38:23.429
popular media as as sort of an icebreaker or

751
00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:26.270
jumping off point. So, if you watch a movie

752
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.110
or TV show that has a steamy scene in

753
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.820
it that depicts a turn on that you have,

754
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.310
afterwards, you can just have a conversation with your

755
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.790
partner about, oh, what did you think about when

756
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.520
this happened, or wasn't it hot when they did

757
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.050
this, or You know, there's all kinds of ways

758
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.169
that you can just sort of broach the conversation

759
00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:46.000
to kind of get it started. And then one

760
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.129
other thing I'll say is that you can also

761
00:38:48.129 --> 00:38:49.729
kind of turn it into a game. Like I

762
00:38:49.729 --> 00:38:52.969
love suggesting playing that game of would you rather,

763
00:38:53.209 --> 00:38:54.419
where you can just kind of go back and

764
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:56.850
forth saying things like, would you rather be tied

765
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.330
up in bed or would you rather tie me

766
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.189
up? And that's just a super easy way of

767
00:39:02.129 --> 00:39:04.370
Feeling your partner out for what they might be

768
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.129
more or less into without you having to put

769
00:39:07.129 --> 00:39:09.929
your specific fantasies out there and, and kind of

770
00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:12.969
owning them, right? So it can be a kind

771
00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:15.169
of a fun and, and low stress way of

772
00:39:15.169 --> 00:39:16.510
getting that conversation going.

773
00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:22.370
OK, so we've covered the most common sexual fantasies,

774
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.899
how people go about sharing their fantasies with their

775
00:39:26.899 --> 00:39:31.659
partners or other people. Uh, DO people actually tend

776
00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:34.510
to act on their sexual fantasies?

777
00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:37.659
For the most part, no. And again, this is

778
00:39:37.659 --> 00:39:40.219
a pretty consistent finding across all the surveys I've

779
00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:44.129
done is that when I ask people. If their

780
00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:46.100
favorite fantasy of all time is something that they

781
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.379
would like to try in the future, I find

782
00:39:48.379 --> 00:39:52.050
that about 80% of people say that, yeah, it's,

783
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.260
it's a desire, meaning it's something that I want

784
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.120
to do, but only about 1 in 5 people

785
00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.699
say that they've ever actually tried it before, right?

786
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.899
So 80% say they want to do it, only

787
00:40:02.899 --> 00:40:05.260
20% say that they've ever done it. So there's

788
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.520
a very big gap between fantasy and reality, and

789
00:40:10.149 --> 00:40:12.020
You know, I've asked people, well, you know, if

790
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.830
this is something that you want to do, why

791
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.989
haven't you acted on it before? And I find

792
00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:17.590
that there are lots of things that are holding

793
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.580
people back, and they shouldn't be that surprising, but

794
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.790
one of the biggest is that they say they

795
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.909
don't have a willing partner, so their partner's just

796
00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:27.580
not into it, and Therefore, it's something that they

797
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.179
can't act out. But also there's a lot of

798
00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:32.820
fear and uncertainty that hold people back too, where

799
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.540
a lot of people say, well, I don't know

800
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.139
what would happen if I were to act this

801
00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:39.919
out, like, Could I get hurt? Could somebody else

802
00:40:39.919 --> 00:40:43.070
get hurt? How would this affect my relationship? Like,

803
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.320
I'm just afraid of what's gonna happen. And then

804
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.120
there's also the, I just don't even know how

805
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.159
to do this. Like, for example, a lot of

806
00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:52.030
people think it's challenging enough to find just one

807
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.830
other sexual partner, let alone many at the same

808
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.199
time to have a threesome or orgy or something

809
00:40:57.199 --> 00:41:00.080
like that. And so, you know, that uncertainty of

810
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.719
just like, I don't even know how to do

811
00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:03.979
this is a big thing too. And then of

812
00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:05.979
course there are multiple other reasons, you know, for

813
00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:09.300
some people their fantasy is just totally impossible to

814
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.379
do. You know, I have a lot of fantasies

815
00:41:11.379 --> 00:41:14.350
that take place in outer space or in sci-fi

816
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.260
worlds, and yeah, it turns people on in their

817
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.219
minds, but the only way they can ever bring

818
00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:21.979
that fantasy to life would be to roleplay it

819
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.340
because they can't actually do it because the things

820
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.500
that they're turned on by don't exist in, in

821
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.820
real life. So there are lots of things that

822
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.620
might prevent us from acting on our fantasies.

823
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.399
And would you say that there are risks and

824
00:41:35.399 --> 00:41:39.780
benefits of acting on one's fantasies, and if so,

825
00:41:39.959 --> 00:41:41.080
what would they be?

826
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.719
So I think there are both risks and benefits

827
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.360
to sharing fantasies and also acting on them. And

828
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.580
what I see is that I think it's a

829
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.820
little bit riskier to act on a fantasy than

830
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.979
it is to share a fantasy. You know, talking

831
00:41:55.979 --> 00:41:58.090
about what you're turned on by is one thing,

832
00:41:58.459 --> 00:42:01.219
but actually trying it in real life is a

833
00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:03.179
whole other beast, and there's more things that can

834
00:42:03.179 --> 00:42:05.899
go wrong there. So, if we talk about sharing

835
00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:09.020
a fantasy, the, the risk reward analysis to do

836
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.530
there, uh, is, you know, if you share this

837
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.760
fantasy, it could bring you and your partner closer.

838
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.820
It could help you to better understand each other

839
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.770
as sexual beings. It could Deepen your intimacy and

840
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.169
trust in your partner, it could improve your sexual

841
00:42:24.169 --> 00:42:26.810
communication. It might also be a form of dirty

842
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.659
talk that turns both you and your partner on.

843
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.729
So those are some of the benefits, but some

844
00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:33.610
of the risks of sharing a fantasy would be,

845
00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:36.530
well, maybe they're not into what you're into, and

846
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.290
this is going to reveal a deeper incompatibility in

847
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:44.739
your relationship, or maybe you're Partner will judge you

848
00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:47.139
or shame you, and then you're gonna feel embarrassed

849
00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:49.219
by having shared that fantasy, right? So there are

850
00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:50.739
things that can go wrong when it comes to

851
00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:53.699
sharing fantasies. Now, when it comes to acting on

852
00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:55.899
them, you know, of course, some of the benefits

853
00:42:55.899 --> 00:42:57.600
would be maybe you'll have a really great time

854
00:42:57.739 --> 00:42:59.739
and you'll check something off of your sexual bucket

855
00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:03.800
list, and it will Add some spark or intensity

856
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.129
or passion back into your relationship, and it'll lead

857
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:09.570
you to, to try and explore new and other

858
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.570
things with your partner down the road in the

859
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.050
future, you know, so it could kind of be

860
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.929
the, the kicking off point for a new chapter

861
00:43:15.929 --> 00:43:18.090
in your sexual relationship. You know, there's all kinds

862
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.969
of benefits. That could happen from acting on a

863
00:43:19.969 --> 00:43:22.729
fantasy. Um, WE also see in the research that

864
00:43:22.729 --> 00:43:24.689
women in particular who share and act on their

865
00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:28.889
fantasies also have much more consistent orgasms than women

866
00:43:28.889 --> 00:43:30.570
who don't share and act on their fantasies. So

867
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.610
when we talk about something like closing the orgasm

868
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.929
gap, I think for women in particular, getting in

869
00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:37.850
touch with what it is that they really want

870
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.290
and what turns them on when it comes to

871
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.409
sex could actually really be key in terms of

872
00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:44.360
closing the orgasm gap. But when we talk about

873
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.120
the risks of acting on fantasies, well, you know,

874
00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:50.000
I'm a social psychologist by training, and I, we

875
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.919
talk a lot about affective forecasting, which is where

876
00:43:52.919 --> 00:43:55.280
we predict what our future emotional state is going

877
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.399
to be, and we tend to be pretty poor

878
00:43:57.399 --> 00:43:59.860
predictors of how we're going to feel in future

879
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.800
situations. And so when we picture a future situation

880
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.560
where we think we're going to feel good, we

881
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.699
tend to overestimate how good we're going to feel.

882
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.399
And the same thing is true when it comes

883
00:44:08.399 --> 00:44:10.439
to our fantasies is that we often go in

884
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:14.489
with these sky-high expectations, and then The fantasy doesn't

885
00:44:14.489 --> 00:44:16.129
live up to it. And so I think we

886
00:44:16.129 --> 00:44:17.969
need to have a reality check before we go

887
00:44:17.969 --> 00:44:20.489
in and act on a fantasy and recognize that,

888
00:44:20.649 --> 00:44:22.750
you know, practice actually kind of makes perfect when

889
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.969
it comes to fantasies, because there's going to be

890
00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:27.080
a learning curve, and there's going to be some

891
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.209
uncertainty, and there are going to be things that

892
00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:32.800
you didn't think about before you got into. THAT

893
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.050
situation, where maybe you'll have unexpected emotions that pop

894
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.050
up, or things just won't go according to plan.

895
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.810
And, and so, you know, acting on a fantasy

896
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:45.949
just brings some new risks that are different, because

897
00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:48.639
it's hard to anticipate what all the eventualities will

898
00:44:48.639 --> 00:44:51.770
be. And so, You know, I often like to

899
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.729
say, you know, if you're going to act out

900
00:44:53.729 --> 00:44:55.689
a fantasy, you probably need to try it at

901
00:44:55.689 --> 00:44:57.750
least 2 or 3 times to know for sure

902
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.850
that it's not for you, because the first time

903
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.729
is just, there's a big learning curve associated with

904
00:45:02.729 --> 00:45:02.989
it.

905
00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:09.340
Right. Are there circumstances where people should seek professional

906
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.100
help from a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist to

907
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.560
manage their sexual desires?

908
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.739
So the, the two big things that would come

909
00:45:21.739 --> 00:45:25.060
up here would be if you have fantasies about

910
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:31.419
something that are inherently nonconsensual or illegal, and it's

911
00:45:31.419 --> 00:45:34.300
coupled with the desire where it's something that you

912
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.770
want to do and you're afraid that you might

913
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.340
actually act on it, that's the case where it's

914
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.540
important to seek help in terms of managing those

915
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.540
desires so that you don't actually do that thing

916
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.360
that would hurt someone else. The other big category

917
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.080
in terms of help seeking would be if you

918
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.959
have a fantasy that feels like it's out of

919
00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:54.280
control or it is very distressing to you, and

920
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.239
this fantasy is interfering with your ability to, to,

921
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.639
to have a normal life in some way. For

922
00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:01.879
example, if it's interfering with your relationship or your

923
00:46:01.879 --> 00:46:04.679
job performance or, or something else like that, that's

924
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:07.040
another case where it would be important uh to

925
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.889
seek help. Now, I will say that, you know,

926
00:46:09.929 --> 00:46:12.850
a lot of people go and and seek help

927
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.949
from therapists because they just think their fantasies aren't

928
00:46:16.449 --> 00:46:18.449
normal and they think there's something wrong with them.

929
00:46:18.689 --> 00:46:21.689
And in a lot of cases, the therapists are

930
00:46:21.689 --> 00:46:23.560
able to solve this problem just with a little

931
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.790
bit of sex education. You know, it's often just

932
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.610
helping people to learn and understand that. Hey, you're

933
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.610
not alone in having this fantasy, and there's nothing

934
00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.209
inherently wrong with this, and, and here's kind of

935
00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:36.330
what you need to know about it. More often

936
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.050
than not, that solves the problem. But when you've

937
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.149
got those issues of distress, or when you've got,

938
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.729
you know, that non-consensual or illegal element that's coupled

939
00:46:45.729 --> 00:46:47.760
with an intent or desire to act it out,

940
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.270
that's when it's really, really important to, to seek

941
00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.709
professional help from a certified sex therapist.

942
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.070
OK, so finally, I would like to ask you

943
00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.310
perhaps one or two questions about a post from

944
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.909
your website. Uh, WHERE you talk about, I think

945
00:47:03.909 --> 00:47:07.899
it's from last December, December, December last year, uh,

946
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:11.290
where you talk about how many sexual partners most

947
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.350
people have had because there are many misconceptions, I

948
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.790
think that people have about these topics. So, uh,

949
00:47:20.229 --> 00:47:24.090
what, what kinds of data can we look into

950
00:47:24.189 --> 00:47:28.550
to learn more about that and what do we

951
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.149
actually know about. But the most common number of

952
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:36.590
lifetime partners that people have sexual partners in this

953
00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:36.870
case.

954
00:47:36.879 --> 00:47:39.050
Mhm. Yeah, so this is one of the most

955
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.189
common questions that readers of my website will send

956
00:47:43.189 --> 00:47:45.510
in is, you know, what's, what's a normal or

957
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.469
typical, quote unquote body count is the term that

958
00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:50.389
a lot of people use. I don't personally like

959
00:47:50.389 --> 00:47:51.830
that term, but it's the term that a lot

960
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.149
of people tend to throw around and it's kind

961
00:47:54.149 --> 00:47:56.629
of what the, the popular slang is on, uh,

962
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.649
social media. Now, there are lots of different data

963
00:47:59.649 --> 00:48:01.409
sources on this, and a lot of them actually

964
00:48:01.409 --> 00:48:06.330
come from nationally representative surveys. Now, uh, I should

965
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.110
mention that there are some caveats to the data

966
00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:13.010
on nationally representative surveys, which is that oftentimes they're

967
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:18.750
not necessarily using the broadest definition of sex. So,

968
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.770
historically, sex on national survey. WAS defined as penis

969
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.360
and vagina intercourse. And if you're asking people, well,

970
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.770
how many partners have you had where you've had,

971
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.689
you know, this specific type of intercourse with, that's

972
00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:33.169
a different question from how many partners have you

973
00:48:33.169 --> 00:48:35.129
had where you've engaged in oral sex or mutual

974
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:38.090
masturbation or, you know, other sexual activities because sex

975
00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:40.370
doesn't mean just one thing. So, you know, that

976
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:42.209
is a limitation of a lot of the data

977
00:48:42.209 --> 00:48:45.540
that's out there is that It defines sex in

978
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.379
different ways, and that's part of the reason why

979
00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:49.300
the numbers are kind of all over the map

980
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.750
in terms of what different studies are finding. But,

981
00:48:52.899 --> 00:48:55.260
you know, a lot of the recent studies are

982
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.179
suggesting that average number of partners is usually somewhere

983
00:48:58.179 --> 00:49:01.879
between 4 and 6. And for some people, that's

984
00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.780
really surprising cause they're like, that seems shocking, shockingly

985
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.149
low. And for other people, they're like, well, that's

986
00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:08.905
Seems really high, and then for others, they're like,

987
00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:11.435
yeah, that sounds about right, you know, and, and

988
00:49:11.435 --> 00:49:13.955
it's because everybody's coming from a different reference point

989
00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:17.375
with all of this. On average, there is a

990
00:49:17.514 --> 00:49:20.754
sex difference here, such that men typically report more

991
00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:23.915
sexual partners than women. And historically, if you look

992
00:49:23.915 --> 00:49:26.564
at surveys, men report having about twice as many

993
00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:30.360
sexual partners as women do. And even when you

994
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.280
just look at heterosexual folks, you're seeing that difference

995
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.080
there. And that's one of those cases where like

996
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.040
the math isn't really mapping, right? Because, well, who

997
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.939
are the men having all of this sex with,

998
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.439
you know, they're reporting having all of these excess

999
00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:47.280
sexual partners. And what we see in other research

1000
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.465
is that, you know, there is There is a

1001
00:49:49.465 --> 00:49:51.885
little bit of exaggeration that sometimes goes on there,

1002
00:49:51.895 --> 00:49:55.044
on the part of men. So, for example, uh,

1003
00:49:55.385 --> 00:49:57.945
Doctor Terry Fisher conducted the study that I love,

1004
00:49:58.064 --> 00:50:00.705
uh, some time ago, where she had male and

1005
00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:03.614
female college students come into a lab and hook

1006
00:50:03.614 --> 00:50:05.385
them up to a device that she convinced them

1007
00:50:05.385 --> 00:50:07.375
was a lie detector and could tell, you know,

1008
00:50:07.465 --> 00:50:09.604
when they were lying versus telling the truth and

1009
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.560
You know, ask them about the number of sexual

1010
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.639
partners they had, and then there was another condition

1011
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:16.959
in that study where participants were just reporting on

1012
00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:19.949
a, you know, sort of anonymous survey like the

1013
00:50:19.949 --> 00:50:21.919
number of sexual partners they've had, and what they

1014
00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:24.479
found was that When people were hooked up to

1015
00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:26.790
the lie detector, the gender difference between men and

1016
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.280
women kind of disappeared compared to, to other conditions,

1017
00:50:30.389 --> 00:50:32.959
right, which says like, hey, there, there's a little

1018
00:50:32.959 --> 00:50:35.919
bit of exaggeration going on here. But also men

1019
00:50:35.919 --> 00:50:38.439
are more likely to ballpark their number, whereas women

1020
00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:40.429
are more likely to, to count. So there's also

1021
00:50:40.429 --> 00:50:42.679
a difference in counting strategy that plays a role

1022
00:50:42.679 --> 00:50:46.810
there. And then also one other factor. Uh, IS

1023
00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.610
that you have a small number of men who

1024
00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.530
do report this very large number of partners, and,

1025
00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.250
and we don't know to what extent that might

1026
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.850
be exaggeration versus there might be a small number

1027
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.449
of men who do have a very, very large

1028
00:50:57.449 --> 00:51:00.110
number of partners, which kind of skews the average

1029
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:03.570
for all men. So, yeah, 4 to 6 is

1030
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.810
kind of what we're seeing is average number, but

1031
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.209
there is that gender difference, but lots of factors

1032
00:51:09.209 --> 00:51:11.530
contributing to why that gender difference might exist.

1033
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.149
I mean, one idea that came to mind when

1034
00:51:15.149 --> 00:51:19.070
I was reading your post was that there's this

1035
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:23.300
very common idea that nowadays, particularly in the West,

1036
00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.389
we live in a, in a hook hookup culture,

1037
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:31.070
but I mean, looking at the numbers and the

1038
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:36.350
percent of people that have 15+ partners, which tend,

1039
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.284
which seems to be low, and most people. Having

1040
00:51:40.284 --> 00:51:45.235
456 partners, I mean, don't you think that, that

1041
00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.794
perhaps contradicts that idea?

1042
00:51:48.264 --> 00:51:50.844
Mhm. Yeah, so there has been a lot that's

1043
00:51:50.844 --> 00:51:54.875
been said and written about hookup culture, and it's

1044
00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:58.405
interesting because as we've heard more and more about

1045
00:51:58.405 --> 00:52:00.554
hookup culture, at the same time, when you're looking

1046
00:52:00.554 --> 00:52:02.989
at the data and research, What we're seeing is

1047
00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:05.689
that people today across the board are having less

1048
00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:09.070
sex with fewer partners than ever before. Like some

1049
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:12.350
people have termed this the sex recession. And so

1050
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:14.320
on the one hand, we're hearing about hookup culture,

1051
00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.459
which makes it seem like everybody's hooking up and

1052
00:52:16.459 --> 00:52:18.830
having casual sex all the time, but by the

1053
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.669
same token, it's like, no, actually we're less sexually

1054
00:52:21.669 --> 00:52:24.469
active than, you know, any generation before in terms

1055
00:52:24.469 --> 00:52:27.389
of our kind of like recent recorded history. And,

1056
00:52:27.469 --> 00:52:29.050
and so there is a bit of a, a

1057
00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:32.729
discrepancy and a divide there. I, I think one

1058
00:52:32.729 --> 00:52:34.689
thing that is important to note though is that

1059
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:38.120
although people today do have fewer sexual partners on

1060
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.290
average than they did in the past, a greater

1061
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.629
proportion of their partners today are casual partners instead

1062
00:52:43.629 --> 00:52:46.120
of long-term committed partners. So, you know, that's where

1063
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.850
there is some truth, some elements to, to this

1064
00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.320
hookup culture, which, which is that, yes, we do

1065
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.050
have more casual partners than we did in the

1066
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.969
past, but overall, we actually have fewer partners and

1067
00:52:55.969 --> 00:52:57.010
we're having less sex.

1068
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.540
Yeah, that's really interesting. OK, so we're already reaching

1069
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.790
our time limit, so I'm just going to tell

1070
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:07.429
people that I'm going to leave a link to

1071
00:53:07.429 --> 00:53:10.110
