00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.190
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.829
today I'm joined for a second time by Will

4
00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.550
Starr. He is an author and journalist. Last time

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.550
we talked about his book The Status Game and.

6
00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.295
Today we're talking about his latest book, The Stories

7
00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:22.555
Deal How to Use the Science of Storytelling to

8
00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.895
Lead, motivate and persuade. So Will, welcome to the

9
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.604
show. It's a pleasure to have you back.

10
00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.684
Thanks, Ricardo, it's great to be back again. Thank

11
00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:31.045
you.

12
00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.069
So, what is the premise of your book?

13
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.259
Well, I wanted to write a book about how

14
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.560
the power that the story has to persuade people

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.610
to, to influence people, because it seemed to me

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.419
when I was doing my. Just general research for

17
00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:50.020
other books that, that, that, that the story has

18
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.700
this extraordinarily extraordinary ability to sort of to to

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.939
beguile people to completely take over their brains and

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180
really define their identity, so that that's what I

21
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.340
wanted to write about this time.

22
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.138
And what is storytelling? I mean, what are you

23
00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:08.739
referring to when you talk about storytelling?

24
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.849
Well, um, well, that's a big question. So, uh,

25
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.379
yeah, well, I, I, how do you define story?

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.180
So, so, so my working definition of story for

27
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.059
this book is, it's a unit of information that

28
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:23.709
describes the overcoming of an obstacle in pursuit of

29
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.540
a goal, which sounds sort of quite dry. But

30
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.779
that's basically what a story is, it's it's it's

31
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.269
a little bit of information about obstacles and goals,

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.550
um, um. And it You know, it works, it's,

33
00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:42.730
it's evolutionary purpose is to. Connect lots of individual

34
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.129
human brains together and get them all thinking as

35
00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.180
one about the obstacles and goals. Of, of the,

36
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.980
of the world outside them. So, so, so, so

37
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.139
that's sort of hints at it's power really, you

38
00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.779
know, humans are, we're one of five existing species

39
00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.139
of great ape, you know, we're not like an

40
00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.900
ape, we are an ape, but obviously we're very

41
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.059
different from the other apes. And that difference is

42
00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.699
essentially that we're part ape, part ant. So the

43
00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:06.440
other apes, even though they live in troops, they

44
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.350
overcome the obstacles and pursue their goals as individuals,

45
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.789
pretty much. Whereas humans don't, we do it as

46
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.688
we do it in the form of these superorganisms.

47
00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:16.298
So like an ant's nest, um, we, we get

48
00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:19.658
together and it's and cooperate, and it's the cooperative

49
00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.259
group that overcomes the obstacles in pursuits of the

50
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.188
goals, not the individual. That's how, that that that

51
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.298
that describes all of human life from a cult

52
00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:29.259
to a religion to an economy to a society

53
00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.779
to a football team, to a corporation, you know,

54
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.320
you name it, that's how we do it. And

55
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.839
that's that's kind of how we've taken over the

56
00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.960
world. And so how do you, how do you

57
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.320
get these apes, these individualistic apes to, to work

58
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.559
together to cooperate that we do it with a

59
00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.619
story. You know, you know, that, that, that, that

60
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.860
unit of information that describes an obstacle and a

61
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.899
goal, takes over your brain and, and you all

62
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.539
start thinking as one and that and that's how

63
00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.089
we do it.

64
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.100
So let's talk a little bit about the evolution,

65
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.679
evolutionary psychology of storytelling. So, first of all, what

66
00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.919
are the origins of storytelling in human societies? I

67
00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.279
mean, do we know how old storytelling is? Well,

68
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.490
no.

69
00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:14.625
Exactly, the, the, the, the, the nearest um date

70
00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.595
I could come across was somewhere between 300, and

71
00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.785
100,000 years ago. So somewhere in that bracket, we

72
00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:23.024
started using, you know, orienting our kind of lives

73
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:26.604
around story. And and the way I tell it

74
00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:27.824
in a story is a deal is that there

75
00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.625
are already 33 great phases of evolution of life

76
00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:35.179
on Earth. The first phase is the single-cell bacteria.

77
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.970
So if you were to, if you were to

78
00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.149
trace your family tree and go and go back

79
00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.539
3.8 billion years, you'd find at the root of

80
00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.339
your family tree the single cell bacteria, and for

81
00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.899
hundreds of millions of years, that was the only

82
00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:48.110
life on Earth. And so, so single cell bacteria

83
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.960
overgo obstacles in pursuit of survival reflexively. So it's

84
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.279
a reflexive technology, so it's quite straitjacketed. It's not

85
00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:59.910
dynamic, basically, if the conditions outside my single-celled body

86
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.360
in inverted commas are X I do Y. So

87
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.479
you know, I could do a lot with that.

88
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.300
But, but, but, but the problem with that reflexive

89
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.720
technology is that um it, it's not very good

90
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.880
for dealing with unpredictable environments, and of course what

91
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.919
is, what is life, but not, if not unpredictable.

92
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.580
So then the second great phase was the emotion

93
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.630
system, the well the feeling system out of which

94
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.230
comes emotions and feelings are amazing because they don't

95
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.309
instruct their owner what to do, they advise. So

96
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:24.470
if you imagine you're a cat and you're a

97
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.089
hungry cat in an alleyway. And someone's dropped a,

98
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.859
you know, half a Big Mac by the bin,

99
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.829
and you feel the feeling of hunger, and you,

100
00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.369
and so that, that makes you, that compels you

101
00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:33.640
to want to go and get the burger. But

102
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.390
then on a roof up there is a cat

103
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.429
staring at you, and that brings another feeling which

104
00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.410
is fear. And now you've got these two feelings,

105
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.869
and you can make a decision based on the

106
00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:43.190
unpredictable environment about what to do. So, you know,

107
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.299
an incredible invention, but it really is an amazing

108
00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:48.470
thing, and you know, for more hundreds and hundreds

109
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.859
of millions of years, it, it becomes the dominant

110
00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.769
technology on, on earth, um, for. Overcoming obstacles in

111
00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:56.179
pursuit of goals, I mean, of course, because we,

112
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.369
we come from single type bacteria, we come from,

113
00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:00.820
you know, these intermediate animals, um, we still have

114
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.420
all this technology within us, so the immune system

115
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.820
is reflexive like a bacteria, the digestive system is

116
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.109
reflexive like a bacteria. Um, WE don't have any

117
00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:10.670
conscious control over these things, they just happen. Um,

118
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.980
OF course we have a huge feed system, emotion

119
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.790
system, we're incredibly emotionally complex creatures. Yeah, but then,

120
00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:17.670
as I say, between 1300 and 100,000 years ago,

121
00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.920
this new thing came, which is even better than

122
00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.880
than the than the feeding system. That's the story

123
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.679
system. And story allows us to share information about

124
00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.239
obstacles and goals, swap information about obstacles and goals,

125
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.320
store it in culture in the form of oral

126
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.839
storytelling, and then subsequently writing. And of course, as

127
00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.679
I said before, it allows us most importantly to

128
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.369
cooperate, to to all um um cooperate, collude uh

129
00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.440
on, on, on obstacles and goals and work together

130
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.880
in the form of these ant-like super organisms. So

131
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.519
that in a nutshell is the is the history

132
00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.709
of life on Earth.

133
00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:52.429
Yeah, uh, and what are the functions of storytelling?

134
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.470
Does it serve specific social functions, for example?

135
00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:01.589
Yeah, so, so I guess it's all nested beneath

136
00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.220
that, the main goal which is to. Get, get

137
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.579
us, you know, working as individual members of these

138
00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:12.390
highly cooperative superorganisms, and but, but so, so, so

139
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.380
that's the kind of the, the, the ground level,

140
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.859
but nested beneath that is this, you know, how

141
00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:20.299
does storytelling. Affect us as individuals, so, you know,

142
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.339
so partly we, you know, most obviously we have

143
00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.420
these storytelling brains and uh um and by that

144
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.380
I mean that we have the the the the

145
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.500
human brain remixes reality and turns it into a

146
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.299
story. So, you know, we are, as Chris Smith,

147
00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.459
the neuroscientist, remember we said, the invisible actor at

148
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:36.700
the center of the world. And you know, you

149
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.640
know, unlike other animals have all these things going

150
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.239
on, we, we. We, um, have the plots of

151
00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:43.279
our lives, we've got these meaningful journeys that we're

152
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.160
going on, we want to get stuff and, and,

153
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.269
and we imbue our journeys with, with great meaning,

154
00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.429
you know, like, you know, great religious meaning or,

155
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.149
um, uh, you know, these sort of grand meanings,

156
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.309
um, we, um. Uh, WE, we, we have this

157
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.510
special effect of morality. So, you know, gossip was

158
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.149
one of the earliest, and perhaps the earliest form

159
00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.420
of storytelling, and gossip, you know, gives us this

160
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.190
sense of heroes and villains and allies and teachers,

161
00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:08.670
you know, that's this great storytelling kind of layer

162
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.739
that goes across, um, our, our, our, our, you

163
00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.269
know, the, the, the things that we're doing with

164
00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:15.420
our lives. Um, SO, so there are all kinds

165
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.290
of ways in which, you know, we have autobiographical

166
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.160
memory for the past, we imagine the future in

167
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.880
a way that no other, uh, no other animal

168
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.440
does, you know, we could, we could, we could

169
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.799
envision great quests, great, you know, great, great paradises,

170
00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:27.320
great heavens, you know, no other animal has the

171
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.929
concept of heaven. Um, AND you know, earthly heaven,

172
00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:31.540
which is could be the goal of some political

173
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.660
party or a spiritual heaven, which is the goal

174
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.040
of, you know, you know, the great religions. So,

175
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.059
so, so, so we, we have these storytelling brains,

176
00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.170
so of course that has, you know, profound and

177
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.720
immense, um, um, consequences for, for, for our, for

178
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.100
our individual lives.

179
00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.679
And why are we so attracted to storytelling? I

180
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:55.920
mean, is there any sort of uh psychological explanation

181
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.429
for that?

182
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.880
Yeah, so As I say, you know, storytelling is

183
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.480
the thing that allows us to work cooperatively. So

184
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.130
that's what nature wants to do, that's what evolution

185
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.350
wants us to do. It wants us to be

186
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.880
a successful cooperative animal. So it, it's always compelling

187
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.869
us to. Um, BE a good member of a

188
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:18.950
cooperative group. So what does that mean? Well, it

189
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.230
means two things. It means that a, we have

190
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.609
very powerful instincts within us that want to connect

191
00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:25.829
with other people. You know, we, we know humans

192
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:29.549
are universally driven to seek connection with, with, with

193
00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:32.469
like-minded others, not, not, not just anyone, with people

194
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.150
like us, with people who are good cooperative fit

195
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.869
for us who we can work together with. So,

196
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.789
so, so, so we're in this kind of restless

197
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.880
connect and detect mode, I call it, where, where

198
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.830
we're sorry, detecting connects so we're detecting, are you.

199
00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:45.635
Like me, that's how we dress the way that

200
00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:47.585
we do. We, you know, we have accents, we,

201
00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:49.434
we, we, we, we have this dense cloud of

202
00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:53.114
social information which broadcasts information about who we are

203
00:08:53.114 --> 00:08:56.155
to other people. And, and, and that and that

204
00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:00.554
broadcast is is for drawing us towards people who

205
00:09:00.554 --> 00:09:04.155
are like good cooperative partners and repelling those who

206
00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:05.635
might not. So of course that's the cause of

207
00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:08.114
a lot of amazing stuff in our lives. That's

208
00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.234
also the cause of cause of a lot of

209
00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:11.955
division and, and problems in in human society. So

210
00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:14.719
that's connection. So and if you think about some

211
00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.270
of the most profoundly important moments in your life,

212
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.880
a lot of them are gonna be about connection.

213
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.400
They're gonna be moments of love and joy of

214
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.760
joy of friendship, joy of family, community, all of

215
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.159
that stuff. Um, AND likewise, if you think about

216
00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.559
some of the worst moments in your life, it's

217
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:31.869
the opposite of that. So all universally humans dread

218
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.630
social disconnection, you know, rejection, ostracization. Um, uh, um,

219
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.909
THAT, that, you know, any kind of feeling that

220
00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:44.159
we're being rejected socially is deeply, you know, we,

221
00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:46.750
we'll be hurt, we will obsess over that thing

222
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.989
and try and fix it in our minds, try

223
00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:50.260
and repair it. Um, SO, so that's the first

224
00:09:50.349 --> 00:09:52.739
thing. You know, we, we, we want to connect

225
00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:55.460
into cooperative relationships, whether, whether that be a, you

226
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.219
know, uh, yad or a, or, or, or a

227
00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:00.700
group. The second thing is status. So once we're

228
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.299
in a cooperative relationship, we want to be useful

229
00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:04.750
to it. We want to be a good cooperative

230
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.940
partner. So, so we want um to, to, to,

231
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.250
to develop the reputation of somebody who is valuable.

232
00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:13.049
And and and and and that's the status system.

233
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.500
So, so, so status is simply. Um, THE information

234
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.960
from the people around us that we are of

235
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.320
value in some way, that we're competent, that we

236
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.719
are, um, you know, generous, selfless, virtuous in some

237
00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:26.000
way. So, so, so we also seek that. So

238
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.359
again, if you think about some of the your

239
00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:30.059
most. Pleasurable moments in life, some of the most

240
00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:31.580
exciting moments in life, they're gonna be connected with

241
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.659
status, you know, when your podcast achieved X or

242
00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:36.630
when you've got this dream guest on or whatever

243
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.099
it might be. When you've got your PhD, I

244
00:10:39.099 --> 00:10:40.619
don't know what it is. And you know, same

245
00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:42.909
as connection, some of the worst moments in life

246
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.099
are connected with humiliation, which is the sudden and

247
00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.809
public removal of your, of your status. I mean

248
00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:50.460
status, humiliation has been called the nuclear bomb of

249
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.780
the emotions, and it's connected with, you know, some

250
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.130
of the worst features of the human animal. So,

251
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.010
so, so, so. Connection and status are basically what

252
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.049
heroes in stories achieve. You think about, if you

253
00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:02.940
think about a hero at the end of an

254
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.929
archetypal story, everybody loves them and considers them important

255
00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:08.530
and amazing. And that's what we want in the,

256
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.010
in the story of our lives. We want, we

257
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.369
want those hero's awards of connection and status, and

258
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:15.570
we want them more than anything else. YOU know,

259
00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:16.969
we want those things more than our, you know,

260
00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:20.039
often we choose that kind of stuff more over,

261
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.969
you know, continuing to live our actual lives. That's

262
00:11:22.969 --> 00:11:24.609
how we, that's how mad we are for collection

263
00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:25.169
and status.

264
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.640
Yes. We'll, we'll come back to the topics of

265
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.679
connection and status later in our conversation. Uh, WHAT

266
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:38.479
kinds of stories do people usually like to tell?

267
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.440
People, well, that's that that that it depends on

268
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.109
what they're trying to get out of the story.

269
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.309
I, I, I guess people who are telling stories,

270
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.909
um. Uh, ARE trying to achieve ultimately, you know,

271
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.150
those two things connection and status. That's kind of

272
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.349
what we're always trying, we, well, we're trying to

273
00:11:56.349 --> 00:11:58.669
achieve three things survival, connection and status. Those are

274
00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:01.099
the three things that motivate humans. But, but, but,

275
00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:03.669
so, so, so often storytellers will want to, want

276
00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:07.229
to, um, uh, um. Achieve a sense of connection.

277
00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.219
So, so, so you might get a politician or,

278
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.960
or a, or, or a business leader that tells

279
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.799
stories in such a way that they want people

280
00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.679
to feel connected with their group and identified with

281
00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.280
their group, so they're loyal to it and passionate

282
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.599
about it and start to devote their time and

283
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.719
attention and behavior towards that group. And then of

284
00:12:21.719 --> 00:12:24.760
course the other thing is status, you know, storytellers

285
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.239
want to achieve the status of being a, you

286
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:30.789
know, a great storyteller, but also um successful leaders.

287
00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:33.719
Kind of give status with their storytelling, they kind

288
00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:34.960
of say I'm gonna tell you a story if

289
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.659
you join my group, if you join my mission.

290
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.159
If you buy my product. Your reward will be

291
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.320
status. If you buy this particular iPhone, if you

292
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.400
buy this set of training shoes, if you vote

293
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.559
for my political party, we're gonna make America great

294
00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.409
again, you're gonna be, you know, a think different

295
00:12:50.409 --> 00:12:53.520
creative genius like Apple promised you. You're gonna be

296
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.799
Michael Jordan, like Nike promised you. So, so, so,

297
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.640
so, so that, so, so connection states are the

298
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.669
kind of two things that storytellers are subconsciously offering.

299
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.820
So I would like to ask you now about

300
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.500
the concept that you talk about in your book.

301
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.710
What is active belief?

302
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.450
Yeah, active belief is, is this kind of concept

303
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.210
that I, that I I wrote about first in

304
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.890
the, in the status game, uh and I think

305
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.979
it's really important. So, so fundamentally, um, the brain.

306
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:26.580
What it wants more than anything is to. Achieve

307
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.010
connection and status, so it's always asking this question,

308
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.659
who do I have to be in this time

309
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.580
and place, in order to achieve connection and status?

310
00:13:33.609 --> 00:13:35.219
And, and those questions are especially important when we're

311
00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:36.820
growing up, that's what kind of childhood is, we're

312
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.010
figuring out our environment, we're figuring out our culture,

313
00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:41.830
we're figuring out. Who we have to turn ourselves

314
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.349
into and when we're doing that with, you know,

315
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.070
parents are telling us that, teachers are telling us

316
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.739
that, experience is telling us that. So so so

317
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.469
so that's what human brains are all that's the

318
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:51.989
question that human brains are always asking. And so

319
00:13:51.989 --> 00:13:54.390
that that's kind of why we're so um uh

320
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.950
vulnerable to story because story contains those answers, and

321
00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.830
the brain isn't particularly interested in the truth of

322
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.270
reality, there's no, no, no, no, no reason to

323
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.190
be. What it wants is to, is, is to

324
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.830
figure out who I have to be in order

325
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.799
to earn connection and status. So, uh, if you,

326
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.119
if you think about it in terms of, sorry,

327
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.349
that's my, um, this is my dog, hello James,

328
00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:15.080
you're on a podcast. Um, IF you think about

329
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.520
that in terms of religion, which is the easiest

330
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.359
one to explain, you know, someone you've got to

331
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.630
go away now. Um, SOMEBODY, um, wants to be

332
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.520
a Christian. And um so. In order to achieve,

333
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.799
you know, so because that's a status game, and

334
00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.429
we, you know, we want to achieve connection, we

335
00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:34.520
want to achieve status, so. Christianity is a great

336
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.789
status game to play because that's offering those things.

337
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.159
So how do we, how do we, how do

338
00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:40.200
we achieve those things? Well, to be connected into

339
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.080
the game of Christianity is pretty easy. You've got

340
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.299
to believe. And you, you've got to, the main

341
00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:45.599
thing you've got to believe is that Jesus was

342
00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:48.960
real and that he, he died, and he was

343
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.880
dead for 3 days and he rose again. And

344
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.080
if you believe that, you're a Christian, you're basically

345
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.960
going to be accepted into the wider Christian family,

346
00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:56.320
because that's that's what you have to believe in

347
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.669
order to be a Christian, OK? Um, BUT that's

348
00:14:58.669 --> 00:15:00.650
not really enough, so that's fine, you're a Christian.

349
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.940
But now you're a Christian at the bottom of

350
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.270
the Christian status game, now you wanna be a

351
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.619
good Christian, you wanna be able to go to

352
00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:08.020
your church every Sunday and have people look you

353
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.539
in the eye and go, there's a great Christian.

354
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.729
So that's where active belief comes in. It's not

355
00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:13.840
good enough for human beings just to believe something.

356
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.530
You have to allow that belief to take you

357
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.690
over. You have to, you, you have to allow

358
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.130
that belief to define your identity. You have to

359
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.020
become that Christian. So that means, you know, living

360
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.130
by the 10 Commandments, eating fish on Fridays, going

361
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.450
to church on Sundays, going to confession, um, you

362
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.809
know, and so on and so on and so

363
00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:32.650
forth, and of course every denomination of Christianity has

364
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.469
slightly different. You know, rules and and and ways

365
00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:38.070
of being which defines the Christian hero, so that

366
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.549
so that's active belief and that and that and

367
00:15:39.549 --> 00:15:42.190
that kind of works kind of across all all

368
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.669
groups, you know, if if if you go to

369
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:46.849
work for a corporation, they will have a. Um,

370
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.989
A model of perfect kind of ideal heroism that

371
00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:52.229
they want everyone to be, and, and the greater

372
00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:54.429
you adhere to that model of ideal kind of

373
00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:56.770
heroism in that, in that corporation, the higher you'll

374
00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.549
theoretically climb up the status scape of the company,

375
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.830
the more money you'll get, the more, you know,

376
00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:03.030
the more rewards you get and all and all

377
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.669
of that stuff.

378
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.359
Yeah. Uh, WHAT is the process of identification and

379
00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:12.280
what role does it play in storytelling?

380
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.760
Well, identification is, is really, um, critical to storytelling

381
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.010
and and and that's whether you're writing a novel

382
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.299
or whether you're leading a company or a political

383
00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:23.599
party. You know, and, and, and, you know, before

384
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:25.150
I was talking about that kind of detect and

385
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.140
connect mode we're we're always in, so we're always

386
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.960
subconsciously looking for potential cooperative partners, people, people like

387
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.020
us to hang around with. And um and it's

388
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.789
a natural thing. Um, AND it's, uh, as I

389
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:38.750
said, it's the cause of lots of terrible things

390
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.270
that we're upset about in the west, but it's

391
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.679
also an, an, any radical part of human nature,

392
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.429
you're not gonna get rid of that kind of

393
00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:50.200
people like us thing, um, and. And and so

394
00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:52.609
that's kind of what identification is. If we're reading

395
00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:55.130
a novel or watching a film and the person

396
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.140
on that screen is somebody that we identify with,

397
00:16:57.289 --> 00:16:59.489
then we're gonna be into that story because, because,

398
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.030
you know, that's somebody that we care about. It's,

399
00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:03.090
it's someone like us and so, sort of a

400
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.640
part of our brain, it kind of becomes us,

401
00:17:04.848 --> 00:17:07.130
and we start following that character's ups and downs

402
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.010
and trials as almost as if they're happening to

403
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.969
us. And the more we identify with that character,

404
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.329
the more we care about that character, the more

405
00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.170
we get kind of into it. Um, YOU know,

406
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.430
and, and that's also, you know, important for persuasion.

407
00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:19.930
So if, if a political party is trying to

408
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.890
get voters, if a corporation is trying to get

409
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.170
customers, they have to tell a story with which

410
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.420
their, you know, potential voters and customers identify. And

411
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.599
and if they identify with that with their story,

412
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.290
then they're gonna be in. And that and that's

413
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.770
kind of a magical thing for the leader because

414
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.449
once, once the people are in, um, they're in.

415
00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:37.329
You know, you've been your story has become part

416
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:39.530
of their identity, which means they're gonna defend your

417
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.520
group. Like they're defending themselves because in a sense

418
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.689
they are defend they're defending themselves, they've taken on

419
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:48.040
board, you know, they've folded your identity into their

420
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.689
identity.

421
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.630
And what kinds of psychological effects does identification have?

422
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.109
In the book, you go through several different examples

423
00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:03.420
like changes in personality, uh, the way we perceive

424
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.510
beauty, our political beliefs, our moral behavior. So could

425
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.050
you tell us about that?

426
00:18:09.469 --> 00:18:11.869
Yeah, so that's that, so that's so, so if

427
00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:13.500
you, you know, if you remember that the point

428
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.780
of this is that we become good cooperative partners.

429
00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:18.329
So it's not a passive process. Once we, once

430
00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:21.180
we once we join a group uh that we

431
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.920
identify with, um. That group starts to change us.

432
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.189
We, we, we become more like that group, and

433
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.880
so everybody in that, everybody's in that group becomes

434
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.000
more similar to each other. So that, that's the

435
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.760
persuasion and it's changing us quite profoundly. And there

436
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.560
are loads, there's lots of different work that shows

437
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.400
different ways this is, you know, this happens, you

438
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.239
know, 11 test look at, you know, fur, you

439
00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:42.760
know, furries, you know, people who dress up as

440
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.449
fur, you know, you know, furries if we have

441
00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:47.239
those furries. So, so, so, so when they, when,

442
00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.099
when they, um. Test the person to give furries

443
00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:53.270
big five personality tests, they find that when they've

444
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.349
got their first soda on, when they're all kind

445
00:18:55.349 --> 00:18:58.109
of suited up in their crazy animal costumes, their

446
00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:00.430
personalities all change in sync. You know, they become

447
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.579
more extrovert, they become less neurotic, they become um

448
00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:05.910
more open, you know, so, so their personalities, they're

449
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.989
big five personalities that all change, and they all

450
00:19:07.989 --> 00:19:09.589
change in the same direction, that's, you know, that's

451
00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:12.270
one. You know, probably my favorite, um, example of

452
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.859
this is about architects and about how identification changes

453
00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:20.410
our perception of beauty. So. You'll have noticed that

454
00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:23.020
that new buildings don't look like old buildings, like

455
00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.699
new, new buildings across the world. Um, THEY all

456
00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.339
look the same. They, they don't have a sense

457
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:30.099
of place, they don't have um lots of um

458
00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:33.540
architectural detail. They're flat, they're square, they have no

459
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.180
pitched roofs, they're flat roofs, they're shiny, and they

460
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.089
all look the same. And so, um. You might

461
00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:42.420
think, well, that's because people are obsessed with money

462
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.339
and these are cheaper buildings to build than the

463
00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:47.050
posh buildings we used to get in that old

464
00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:50.380
era. But that's not true. That those buildings that

465
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.579
people don't really like get built because architects think

466
00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:55.660
they're beautiful. So architects have this unique taste in

467
00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.939
which they love the aesthetics of modernism, and they've.

468
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.510
Loved the sense of modernism for getting on for

469
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.219
100 years now. They call it modernism, and it's

470
00:20:02.219 --> 00:20:05.739
actually very old, old fashioned look. And so there

471
00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:08.540
was a really fascinating study, um, uh, that, that

472
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.699
looked at how architectural students' aesthetic preferences change, and

473
00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:15.099
it tracks the changing of their preferences as they

474
00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:19.500
went through architectural, um, courses at university. So at

475
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.180
the very beginning of the course, they, they, they

476
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.540
tested their aesthetic preferences generally by showing them pictures

477
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.810
of beautiful people and ugly people. And they found

478
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.579
that they, when they compared the architects to the

479
00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:30.979
general public, they were the same. They found the

480
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.339
same people pretty and and sexy, and they found

481
00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:35.339
the same people ugly and and and you know,

482
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.310
unattractive fine. um AND they tested their um pre

483
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.859
their aesthetic preferences with buildings, and they, they weren't

484
00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:44.819
as similar, but they were pretty similar, they were

485
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:47.579
almost the same. But then every year they checked

486
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.930
them as they went through university, those architectural preferences,

487
00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:53.020
they changed, and they all changed in the same

488
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.260
direction. They all started to like flatness, shininess, no

489
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.619
roofs, you know, lack of ornamentation and detail, all

490
00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:03.050
the things that exist in the buildings around you.

491
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.739
And what's amazing to that is is it's like

492
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:06.750
you can't argue that that what happens is that

493
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.260
um these students are being taught. This aesthetic genius,

494
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.739
because, because they're not, like if they were all

495
00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:17.300
having different esoteric tastes and preferring different things, that

496
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.780
would be true, but they're not, they become more

497
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.219
and more conformist, and they all end up liking

498
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:23.819
these same shiny flat square buildings. And and that's

499
00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:26.260
the main reason we have such ugly hideous. That's

500
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.790
when you, when you go to a city. Everybody

501
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.170
wants to go to the old town. Nobody ever

502
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.219
wants to go to the new town, they don't

503
00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:32.770
want to go to the old town because we

504
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.530
have this curse of this, um, this architectural status

505
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.599
game which says that flat, shiny square is beautiful

506
00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:42.329
and people who like classical and old and and

507
00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:44.449
buildings that are appropriate to their place are low

508
00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:47.750
status and, you know, plebs, even though that that

509
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.209
that survey after survey after survey all around the

510
00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:52.369
world shows that by a long way the general

511
00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.079
public prefer the old style buildings. So so that

512
00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:58.209
that that's a really powerful example of how identification.

513
00:21:58.589 --> 00:22:01.069
CHANGES aesthetic preference. I mean there's, there's also there's

514
00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:02.829
there's even, there's a huge amount of work, which

515
00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:04.630
I'm sure you're aware of, which looks at our

516
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.510
political beliefs and and and even though people find

517
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.109
this idea repugnant, that, that, you know, what what's

518
00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:11.630
found over and over and over again is what

519
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.469
defines our political beliefs is not our own, you

520
00:22:15.469 --> 00:22:19.569
know, freely. Um, PERCEIVED, but, um, decisions about how

521
00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:20.969
the world works and how the world ought to

522
00:22:20.969 --> 00:22:23.569
work, what principally defines our political beliefs or what

523
00:22:23.569 --> 00:22:26.369
our political group believes, and, and, you know, so,

524
00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:30.180
so 11 study managed to persuade. Um, uh, YOU

525
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.459
know, Republicans in America to endorse lavish welfare schemes

526
00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:34.900
if they were if they were persuaded to believe

527
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.339
that that's what their party wanted, and, and, and

528
00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:39.500
likewise they, they, they managed to persuade Democrats to

529
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.060
slash welfare once they were persuaded that that's what

530
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.979
the Democrats wanted to do. So, so, so and,

531
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.150
and as you know, as I say, people hate

532
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.140
that idea, they, they really fight against it because

533
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.569
that's not. The story that we want to tell

534
00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:54.280
about ourselves, but, but, but identification is massively important.

535
00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:55.459
And, and of course it's one of those things

536
00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:57.050
you can see very much clearly in other people.

537
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.199
You don't like to think about yourself that way.

538
00:22:59.449 --> 00:23:00.489
But, but it's, but you can see it in

539
00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:02.329
other people, you know, you know, you can see

540
00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:05.089
in, in your daughter who becomes a swifty and

541
00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:07.439
suddenly becomes obsessed with Taylor Swift, talks about nothing

542
00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:10.780
but Taylor Swift, starts dressing like Taylor Swift. Holding

543
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.650
a body like Taylor Swift, you know, like they

544
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.060
become like a mini Taylor Swift because they've identified

545
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.300
so powerfully with her. And so it's, it's so

546
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.430
it's that process, you know, it's it's it's a

547
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.140
bit like, you know, the demonic possession from a

548
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.180
horror movie. It's what happens to us all the

549
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.660
time and the more possessed we we become by

550
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.660
our identity group, um, the more that active belief

551
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.900
kicks in and the more we more our entire

552
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.380
being, our entire self starts to mimic. You know,

553
00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:37.410
the, the, the values and roles and the the

554
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.140
the ideal model of hero that that group broadcasts.

555
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.650
Do we know how storytelling develops in infants? I

556
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:51.209
mean, when they start uh appreciating storytelling and, I

557
00:23:51.209 --> 00:23:55.530
mean, perhaps, uh, some of the steps they take

558
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.849
in terms of, um, how they become appreciative of

559
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:00.199
it.

560
00:24:00.949 --> 00:24:03.510
Well, yeah, so we, we do know quite a

561
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.750
bit about that. I mean, for me, one of

562
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.030
the most important things is, is this idea of,

563
00:24:07.109 --> 00:24:08.829
of gossip, because I, I, I think, you know,

564
00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:11.979
we, we start to really become storytelling telling animals

565
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.790
when we start to gossip. And gossip is thought

566
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.469
to be perhaps the earliest form of storytelling evolutionarily

567
00:24:18.469 --> 00:24:20.260
speaking, because it's gossip that allows us to work

568
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.839
in these. Highly cooperative, like, you know, um, super

569
00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:25.859
organisms, so, so what we, it was only when

570
00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.560
we could start to gossip and uh uh because

571
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.520
gossip is really information about is this person being

572
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.410
a good member of the superorganism or not. And

573
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.119
if they are, we, we, we raise them and

574
00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:34.560
if they're not, we punish them and and that

575
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.560
so that's, that's, that's how we police in the

576
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.364
group and getting the group to work. And so

577
00:24:38.364 --> 00:24:40.244
we know that that children start to gossip almost

578
00:24:40.244 --> 00:24:42.005
as soon as they can talk. So as soon

579
00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:43.685
as they can string a sentence together, they're telling

580
00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:46.084
these little tittle tattle stories about what my brother

581
00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:47.525
did and what my sister did, what somebody did

582
00:24:47.525 --> 00:24:50.005
at kindergarten, and someone pulled my hair. You know,

583
00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:51.694
it's completely innate and it and it and it

584
00:24:51.694 --> 00:24:53.285
and it and we do we we do it

585
00:24:53.285 --> 00:24:56.005
straight away. So, so, so from that perspective, it,

586
00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:58.084
you know, it kicks in really early. And of

587
00:24:58.084 --> 00:25:00.364
course, you know, from before we can talk, our

588
00:25:00.364 --> 00:25:03.849
parents are telling us stories, morally inflected stories. And,

589
00:25:03.859 --> 00:25:05.459
and, you know, uh, the book, my book is

590
00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:06.979
called A Story is a Deal, and that's what

591
00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:10.079
I mean, it's like a story, a successful story

592
00:25:10.079 --> 00:25:12.780
is always subconsciously making that deal with your identity.

593
00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.300
If you behave in the, in the way that

594
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.180
the story is modeling, you're gonna get connection, you're

595
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.650
gonna get status. So children's stories are very clear.

596
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.020
He he's he he's a hero, he's Goldilocks, he's

597
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.489
Jack and his beanstalk, and look what happened when,

598
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.349
when they were naughty. They, they, they lost their

599
00:25:27.349 --> 00:25:29.500
connection, they lost their status. Look what happened, they

600
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.260
were good. When they won the connection, they won

601
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.500
status. And we tell those stories over and over

602
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.660
and over and over again to our children and

603
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.660
our children become fascinated by them. They want to

604
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.859
hear them over and over and over and over

605
00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:43.380
again, and there's the deep subconscious reason for that

606
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.780
is because it's information about how do I get

607
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.569
connection, how do I get status, and it really

608
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:52.300
bursts into adult life in early adolescence. So it's

609
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.280
in early adolescence that we leave the family home

610
00:25:54.579 --> 00:25:57.060
and join our peer groups, and it's around that

611
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.060
it's in early adolescence that a part, a specific

612
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.949
part of our brain changes that, that, that, that,

613
00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:04.489
that, um. Makes us very sensitive to social judgment

614
00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:06.500
from from other people, so so so so so

615
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.180
that's when we start becoming, you know, we forget

616
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.900
about the family life and it's that our peer

617
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.020
groups, this which have much more influence over us,

618
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.380
so we, we, you know, that active belief starts

619
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.459
to be. About, you know, the, the, the, the,

620
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.839
the, the peer group that we're hanging out with

621
00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:24.130
as a 1213 year old at our, our new

622
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.770
big school.

623
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.770
So earlier we talked about identification. Tell us now

624
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:35.739
about the phenomena of identity growth and identity anxiety

625
00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:39.449
and how do they connect to storytelling.

626
00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:41.969
Yeah, so, so, you know, I said before that

627
00:26:41.969 --> 00:26:44.079
the, the, you know, connection and status of these

628
00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:47.270
things that humans overwhelmingly want and time and time

629
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.060
again humans choose status over, over their own actual

630
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.699
lives, you know, whenever a terrorist fires a, you

631
00:26:53.699 --> 00:26:56.369
know, blows up a suicide vest or. Or somebody

632
00:26:56.369 --> 00:26:59.959
goes to war, you know, we, we're choosing our

633
00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.109
identity over life. So, so, so we are completely

634
00:27:02.109 --> 00:27:04.359
obsessed with our connection and our status, and, and

635
00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:07.469
our brains are constantly monitoring. How are we doing?

636
00:27:07.589 --> 00:27:09.109
Does this person like me? Do they not? Does

637
00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:10.670
this person value me? Do they not? And if

638
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.229
we, if we get the knot, we start to

639
00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:14.229
get really, you know, we, we start to get

640
00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:16.540
really panicky, we start to get really, um, full

641
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.510
of anxiety. We even become physically ill. I mean,

642
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.550
you know, that it, it, it, it's been, we

643
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.430
know, we've been told time and time again over

644
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.300
the last 20 years how badly. How bad social

645
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.400
disconnection is for us, you know, loneliness is for

646
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.260
us, it has become well known now, but less

647
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.839
well known is also, it's, it's the same for

648
00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:35.329
status, you know, like, um, the, the, the, the,

649
00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:37.359
the, the, the less status we perceive that we

650
00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:38.839
have, the more likely we are to get ill.

651
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.280
There, there was one study that that gave a

652
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.560
bunch of people, they exposed them to rhinovirus and

653
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.680
the people at the top of the status hierarchy

654
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.199
were less likely to then get a respiratory infection

655
00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:50.520
as a result of the exposure than the people

656
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.439
at the bottom of the hierarchy. So, so, you

657
00:27:52.439 --> 00:27:54.869
know, so it's so, so there's lots of evidence.

658
00:27:55.969 --> 00:27:57.920
That that low status is, is bad for us

659
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.790
physically. So, so, so, so that's what I call

660
00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.869
identity growth. I identity growth is, you know, is,

661
00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:05.520
is, is we're living a great life is when

662
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.160
we, when we, when our energies grow, and by

663
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.680
that I mean, uh, you know, we, we, we're

664
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.800
getting ideally more connection than ever, but, but at

665
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.520
least it's stable. We're not losing connection, becoming lonelier

666
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.400
and lonelier, and, you know, we want to be

667
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.780
getting more status as we get older, you know,

668
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.160
ideally gradually, I think sudden rises in status are

669
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.959
very bad for us. Um, USUALLY, um, so, so

670
00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:28.260
that gradual rise in status, so that's identity growth,

671
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.800
um, but also that, you know, we get identity

672
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.599
anxiety where, when, when we sense that our stores

673
00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:36.520
of connection status are at risk and imperiled, we

674
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.239
get deeply anxious and I, and I, and I

675
00:28:38.239 --> 00:28:43.119
think that sense of identity anxiety is. Such a

676
00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:46.270
huge part of life in a 21st century market

677
00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.839
economy, you know, it's quite, you know, in a,

678
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.800
in a hunter gatherer group of 25 to 50

679
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.280
people, that's who we'd be living side by side

680
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.060
by every day. It's relatively straightforward. You've got to

681
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.349
be a half-heated person, you'll get your connection, you'll

682
00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:00.359
get your status, but we live in these vast

683
00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:02.270
groups now, we've got social media now, you know,

684
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:05.109
we've got these models of heroism, you know, they're

685
00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:08.670
they're literally models, you know, they're. The most, you

686
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.229
know, we, we, we, we see on our TV

687
00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:12.989
screens and our computer screens incredible superhuman feats. So

688
00:29:12.989 --> 00:29:15.030
that's, so we, so we're measuring against ourselves against

689
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.790
these, these extraordinary people, um, you know, connection is

690
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.599
harder and harder to, to sustain in these in

691
00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:22.430
in these big groups. So I think identity anxiety

692
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.750
is a is a is a very serious thing

693
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.319
and we know that. Um, IT correlates with suicide,

694
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.770
but you know, when, when people feel chronically lacking

695
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:34.170
in connection and status, and, and importantly, when they

696
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.010
feel that that lack is irreversible, when they think

697
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.209
they're stuck and that there's no, there's no good

698
00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:42.050
happy ending to their story, then they, then they're

699
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:46.979
very likely to become suicidal. And again, choosing. Identity

700
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.290
over their actual lives.

701
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.050
Right. But talking about connection, what kinds of psychological

702
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.010
effects does the feeling of being connected have on

703
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.439
people?

704
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.569
Psychological effects. Well, I mean, all the good ones,

705
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.930
I mean, we, you know, we, we, we, we

706
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.890
feel joy, we feel happiness, we feel like our

707
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.790
lives have meaning and purpose, you know, the, the,

708
00:30:10.849 --> 00:30:14.010
the feelings of, of being securely connected are, you

709
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.650
know, are, are, are, are profoundly important to the

710
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.329
human animal, because that's, so you know, 11 of

711
00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:21.770
the great things that, that the human brain wants

712
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.290
us to achieve because it's directly connected to our

713
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.890
survival, you know, as our brains are evolving, the

714
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.319
more securely connected we were. The greater the chance

715
00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:32.640
that we were going to survive and have children

716
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.349
that survived, and it is, and it's the same

717
00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:36.839
status, you know, like that that's, that's, that's just

718
00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:40.160
as important because the more in in hunter gatherer

719
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.560
groups, the more, you know, they they they they've

720
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.890
got relatively flat hierarchies, um, compared to our hierarchies

721
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.670
today, but still in hunter gatherer groups, the more

722
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.560
the status that you have in that group, the

723
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.030
more food you've got, the better food you've got,

724
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.000
the safer your sleeping sites, the greater your access

725
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.500
to choice of mates, which is obviously of course

726
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.920
something that people really want. Um, uh, YOU know,

727
00:30:55.959 --> 00:30:57.560
the great, the better the conditions of life for

728
00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.160
your children. So, connection status are both directly connected

729
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.000
to our survival and reproduction, which is why they're

730
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.189
so important to, to, to humans, and that's why

731
00:31:05.439 --> 00:31:08.640
we have such amazing feelings when we, when we

732
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.709
experience those things.

733
00:31:10.959 --> 00:31:15.079
How do political figures take advantage of the power

734
00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:19.750
of identification and connection in their speeches?

735
00:31:21.069 --> 00:31:23.819
Well, The main thing, as I say, is that

736
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:26.130
is that human brains don't really care about truth.

737
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.699
What they care about is what do I have

738
00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:29.500
to believe in order to get connection and status

739
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.739
within this group that I identify with. So, so,

740
00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:34.170
so, so, so, so that's a massive shortcut for

741
00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:36.180
leaders. They don't really have to tell you the

742
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.969
truth. You, you know, like. Brexit, to give a

743
00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:45.239
controversial example, it didn't matter, like it didn't matter,

744
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.449
um, uh, that, that the, the, the, I, I,

745
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.569
I suspect a lot of the Brexiteers knew full

746
00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:53.180
well that it was economically going to be an

747
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.849
absolute disaster for Great Britain. But they appealed to

748
00:31:55.849 --> 00:31:58.849
the story and so so so so so so

749
00:31:58.849 --> 00:32:02.569
they, they achieved identification by by saying we share

750
00:32:02.569 --> 00:32:04.170
your concerns and you know there were there were

751
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.969
famous adverts about endless queues of migrants queuing to

752
00:32:06.969 --> 00:32:09.089
get into Britain. We share your concerns, we're like

753
00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:11.410
you, so they're identified. And then they tell them

754
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.810
a story, we're gonna take back control, and that

755
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.540
story is um. A story that promises status, and

756
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.619
the most powerful political stories are always stories that

757
00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:23.089
promise status. So if you think about, you know,

758
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.579
Hope, the Obama story, uh, one of our most

759
00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:29.619
successful politicians, Tony Blair, New Labour, New Britain, you

760
00:32:29.619 --> 00:32:32.939
know, is an optimistic, hopeful, promising status, uh, Make

761
00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:36.780
America Great Again, uh, Hitler's Third Reich, um, the

762
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.140
communists and their paradise of equality that they were

763
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.459
going to achieve, uh, in which nobody would, would

764
00:32:42.459 --> 00:32:44.400
suffer and everybody would be living in. Kind of

765
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.000
this heavenly harmony, these are all promises of uh

766
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.239
of this kind of better tomorrow. So, so those

767
00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:52.319
are the stories that work. And you know, and

768
00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:54.680
still our lots of our politicians struggle to kind

769
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.319
of get their head around this. Um, YOU know,

770
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:59.910
Kamala Harris struggled to tell a story of hope.

771
00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:03.119
It was all about horrible Trumpy and horrible, you

772
00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:05.839
know, men and and all this stuff. It doesn't

773
00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:07.400
work and and and and we, we have a

774
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.280
similar problem in the UK, Keir Starmer, our current

775
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.699
Labour government. They they're getting a bit better at

776
00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:13.660
it, but, but they, they spent the 1st 3

777
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.819
or 4 months just telling it endlessly gloomy story

778
00:33:15.819 --> 00:33:18.420
about what an awful mess Britain was in because

779
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.459
of the last government. Uh, PEOPLE don't give a

780
00:33:20.459 --> 00:33:22.260
shit. It might be true. It doesn't matter, the

781
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.449
truth doesn't matter. It was, and and so they

782
00:33:24.449 --> 00:33:26.630
became incredibly unpopular, that government. They they're turning it

783
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.219
around a bit now, but they've become incredibly unpopular

784
00:33:29.219 --> 00:33:32.099
despite having, you know, won quite convincingly, uh, because

785
00:33:32.099 --> 00:33:34.219
the story said it was so bloody awful, it

786
00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:36.459
was just doom and gloom and misery, and nobody

787
00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:37.780
wants to hear that from up there from their

788
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.180
leaders.

789
00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:43.109
Do you think that the effects of connection are

790
00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:49.369
more salient in collectivist societies than individualist societies, or

791
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.939
is there no effect there?

792
00:33:52.349 --> 00:33:54.459
Yeah, I, I don't know any data that's looked

793
00:33:54.459 --> 00:33:57.150
specifically at that, but I certainly suspect that that

794
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.949
is true. But it but sometimes it's hard to

795
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:05.060
separate, you know, those things, um. Because if you

796
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.949
think about your, like if you're. If you're if

797
00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.550
you're in East Asia, a collectivist society and you're

798
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.739
a loyal communist. Um, uh, YOU know, um, you're

799
00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.020
still playing a, a status game because you want

800
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.659
to be seen as a good loyal member of

801
00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.060
the, you know, of the, of the Chinese Communist

802
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.069
Party, um, so. So, so, so, so yeah, I'm

803
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:29.947
not sure the differences will be as pronounced as

804
00:34:29.947 --> 00:34:32.918
you might imagine, like, like nobody is immune from.

805
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.228
The status game, as was discovered in the Soviet

806
00:34:36.228 --> 00:34:38.350
Union, which became, you know, which, which at one

807
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.989
point, sociologists found 12 distinct social classes in the

808
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.590
Soviet Union, um, or they didn't get rid of

809
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.469
the status game as they promised, they just inverted

810
00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:47.159
it so the people who were at the top

811
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.110
were out at the bottom and the people who

812
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.179
were at the bottom went out at the top.

813
00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.889
You know, and, and, and, and that's what that's,

814
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.120
that's always what happens with these utopians is they,

815
00:34:53.129 --> 00:34:54.760
is they, is they promise they're going to get

816
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.290
rid of the status game and they, and they

817
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.050
can't because it's in our brains. It's how we

818
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.479
experience the world. They just want the new hierarchy

819
00:35:00.479 --> 00:35:01.969
with themselves at the top and their enemies at

820
00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:03.570
the bottom. It's what, you know, that was the

821
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.750
woke thing as well, you know, they're just, they're

822
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.169
just trying to invert the hierarchy, they're not trying

823
00:35:07.169 --> 00:35:07.770
to get rid of it.

824
00:35:09.919 --> 00:35:12.959
Does what you explore in the book connect in

825
00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:18.719
any way with Robert Childalini's principle of persuasion of

826
00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:23.520
unity or people being motivated by shared identities?

827
00:35:23.879 --> 00:35:25.320
Yeah, exactly. I mean I I I think I,

828
00:35:25.439 --> 00:35:27.360
I think so, yeah, so that it, it sounds,

829
00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:32.689
it certainly sounds very similar, um. We are, you

830
00:35:32.689 --> 00:35:34.689
know, that that's what identification is really, you know,

831
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.489
we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we

832
00:35:36.489 --> 00:35:38.449
see somebody who with whom we somewhat share an

833
00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:42.010
identity. Um, AND we join that group, but it,

834
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.290
but it goes deeper than that because it's not,

835
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.479
as I say, it's not just that we share

836
00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:46.370
the identity. Once we, once we connect into a

837
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.639
group, we become more like that person, we become

838
00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:51.459
more like that group, it changes us in quite

839
00:35:51.729 --> 00:35:53.219
profound ways. And that, and like I said, that's,

840
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.370
that's true whether you're joining a religion or whether

841
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.169
you're getting married. I mean, you know, like, like

842
00:35:57.169 --> 00:35:59.050
in 20 plus years of marriage to my wife,

843
00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.290
I've become more like my wife. In, in lots

844
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.969
of ways I can tell, but also probably in

845
00:36:02.969 --> 00:36:05.250
a million ways I can't tell, and she's become

846
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.830
more like me. And, and that's because we're a

847
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.429
successful cooperative partnership, you know, and that's the kind

848
00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:12.520
of power of this, what they call shared reality.

849
00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:14.070
It doesn't it's not just that you join a

850
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.469
group of like-minded people, it's just you, you let

851
00:36:16.469 --> 00:36:18.870
that group take you over and you become more

852
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.590
similar to those people. So I think it's a,

853
00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:23.780
it's a. Even more kind of powerful concept than

854
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.020
the idea of shared identity.

855
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:30.459
Why do we like underdog stories so much?

856
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.239
So underdog stories are universally popular all around the

857
00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:36.800
world if you go through, you know, the folk

858
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.590
stories of, you know, Africa, East Asia, South America,

859
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.090
Russia, underdog stories are are are always told. We,

860
00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:47.479
we, we, we identify with underdogs. And I think

861
00:36:47.479 --> 00:36:48.820
there's a couple of diff there's a couple of,

862
00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:50.989
there's there's a couple of big reasons for that.

863
00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:54.800
So the first reason is, is, is that. The

864
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.090
underdog is the closest that we, we, we can

865
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.280
probably get to a universal description of the human

866
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.969
condition. You know, I, I said before about about

867
00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:04.840
a story being an account of obstacles and goals.

868
00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:06.320
I mean that's what we're doing as humans, we

869
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.909
are. Identifying goals and we're overcoming obstacles in pursuit

870
00:37:09.909 --> 00:37:11.350
of them. So that's what we're constantly doing, we're

871
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.750
constantly looking for goals and and fighting obstacles. So

872
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.750
that makes us automatically an underdog. I mean that's

873
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.229
one of the definitions of an underdog is that

874
00:37:17.229 --> 00:37:20.590
they're the, the, the problems of life seem immense

875
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.870
and almost insurmountable. So we, so we feel like

876
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.760
underdogs, and then certainly there are times of greatest

877
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.550
distress in our lives. We, we feel like underdogs.

878
00:37:27.669 --> 00:37:31.260
And that and that even goes for um. Some

879
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.659
of the highest status people in the world at

880
00:37:32.659 --> 00:37:34.179
the moment, like I expect Elon Musk at the

881
00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:36.260
moment, as weird as it might seem, feels like

882
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.979
an underdog, and then you, and you might go,

883
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.459
that's crazy because he's the richest man in the

884
00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:41.179
world. But also he's one of the most hated

885
00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:43.169
men in the world right now. So that's that

886
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:45.169
that that that's, that's that's pretty, that's pretty a

887
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.340
that's a pretty terrifying place to be. You know,

888
00:37:47.419 --> 00:37:48.949
I spent this part of Putin that feels like

889
00:37:48.949 --> 00:37:50.659
an underdog because he's got, you know, the, the,

890
00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:53.820
the, you know, the. You know, the, the, the,

891
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.979
the, the, the, the entire kind of west ranged

892
00:37:55.979 --> 00:37:58.939
against him. So unless you're, you're suffering from pathological

893
00:37:58.939 --> 00:38:01.419
narcissism, you, you pretty much feel like an underdog.

894
00:38:01.459 --> 00:38:03.300
So I think that's that that that's one of

895
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.929
the big reasons why underdogs are so um universally,

896
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.860
we identify with them so easily, it's because when

897
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.620
we see somebody who's trying desperately trying to get

898
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.580
something, but there's massive obstacles in their way, part

899
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.699
of our brain goes, oh that's me. I'm like

900
00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:17.419
that. Yeah, I get it, that, you know, so,

901
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.459
so that's that's one of the things. The other

902
00:38:19.459 --> 00:38:20.949
thing is to do with with status and and

903
00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:23.830
and how status games are played. Uh, IN, in

904
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.989
human groups. So the, the kinds of stats that

905
00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:31.199
we really care about are um. You know, the,

906
00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:33.689
the ones attached to prestige, a reputation, so, so

907
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:35.580
we want to be seen as a competent person

908
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.600
and, and a kind person, essentially, so success and

909
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.879
virtue are the are the kind of big things.

910
00:38:41.209 --> 00:38:42.929
And the thing about prestige is we can't claim

911
00:38:42.929 --> 00:38:47.370
it in human status, games in human groups, it

912
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.449
has to be earned, it has to be given

913
00:38:48.449 --> 00:38:50.449
to us by other people, and that makes sense

914
00:38:50.449 --> 00:38:52.510
when you think about the. It's purpose, which is

915
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.189
to get us to be cooperative members of a

916
00:38:54.189 --> 00:38:56.989
group. So status is a reward. You can't fucking

917
00:38:56.989 --> 00:38:59.189
go around demanding it. So if people go around

918
00:38:59.189 --> 00:39:01.149
demanding status from other people, it gets our backs

919
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:02.909
up partly because that's not how we play status

920
00:39:02.909 --> 00:39:04.830
games in human groups. We offer it to you,

921
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.830
you don't claim it, you know, and the other

922
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.669
thing is that status is relative. So if somebody

923
00:39:09.669 --> 00:39:11.879
comes, swaggers into the room, you know, the old,

924
00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:14.270
the big dick, um, and makes it clear that

925
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.030
they consider themselves the highest status person in the

926
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.030
room. Assuming you think they don't deserve it, I

927
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.659
mean, this might be like Tom Cruise coming in

928
00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:22.500
into a group of like amateur actors, and in

929
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.419
which case it might be acceptable. But, but like

930
00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:26.659
assuming you think they don't deserve it, he's gonna

931
00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:29.689
really piss you off how they're acting, and again,

932
00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:32.340
universally, you know, in hunter gatherer groups, there's lots

933
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.699
of policing that goes on with, you know, big

934
00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:36.820
shot behavior they call it, this idea that someone's

935
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.719
swaggering in being the. Being the big I am,

936
00:39:39.729 --> 00:39:41.899
so so so so so so so that's the

937
00:39:41.899 --> 00:39:43.550
other thing, the underdog, it's the opposite of the

938
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.300
overdog, like you don't want to be an overdog,

939
00:39:45.419 --> 00:39:47.459
because if you're an overdog, people are gonna hate

940
00:39:47.459 --> 00:39:49.060
you and they're gonna not just hate you, but

941
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.679
they're gonna plot. Uh, uh, TOWARDS your downfall, so,

942
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.820
so it's, so it's a very, it's a very

943
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.750
bad strategy for success in human groups.

944
00:39:58.159 --> 00:40:00.729
What is it that in your book you call

945
00:40:00.729 --> 00:40:03.000
story being? What is that?

946
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.979
Well, story being is, you know, I, I, I,

947
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.530
I, I think one of the things that I

948
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.280
wanted to do with the story a deal is,

949
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.330
is that there, there, there's a, there's a zillion

950
00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.250
books about persuasive stories, um, but, but, but they

951
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.389
all do that thing of talking about storytelling. So,

952
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.050
so how can I tell you a story which

953
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.929
is going to persuade you to do something, which

954
00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:23.739
of course makes a lot of sense. But I

955
00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:26.219
think it's actually missing the much greater piece of

956
00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:27.939
the puzzle, which is the fact that it's not

957
00:40:27.939 --> 00:40:29.820
just that we read stories and watch stories on

958
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.060
TV and on a stage, it's that our lives

959
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.419
are a story, we experience our daily life as

960
00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:37.209
a story, when we go to work every day.

961
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.620
It's a story, you know, and it, it might

962
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.149
be a boring story to everybody else on earth,

963
00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:42.870
but it's, but it's, but it's, it's, it's the

964
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.340
only story that really matters to us or the

965
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.520
main story that really matters to us. So, so,

966
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.860
so, so, so if you really wanna know how

967
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.100
to persuade other people, you've got to understand storytelling,

968
00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:51.300
not just the things that we tell, but it's

969
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.969
something that we do. So that's when I talk

970
00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:55.020
about story being, it's like if you want to,

971
00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.689
if you're a leader. That wants to persuade your

972
00:40:57.689 --> 00:40:59.679
team, if you're a politician that wants to persuade

973
00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:01.770
your electorate, you have to show up in their

974
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.330
lives as the right kind of narrative character, as

975
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.010
a hero or a light figure or whatever it

976
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.219
is that you want to do. So that that

977
00:41:07.229 --> 00:41:09.010
that that's what I mean by story being.

978
00:41:10.699 --> 00:41:15.739
Uh, WHAT constitutes persuasive storytelling? I mean, what are

979
00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:19.250
the characteristics associated with it?

980
00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:23.209
Well, Three things really, main things. One is, the

981
00:41:23.209 --> 00:41:24.850
first is identification, so you've got to tell a

982
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.010
story that people identify with, and then once they've

983
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.810
identified with it, you've got to offer them connection

984
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.600
and status. You know, so if you do those

985
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.929
three things. You know, you you you're you're an

986
00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:37.610
incredibly incredibly powerful person, you know, you're a leader,

987
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.479
you're a guru, you're a priest, you're a prophet,

988
00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:42.439
you know, whatever it is that you wanna be.

989
00:41:42.929 --> 00:41:48.620
Yeah. Um, SO tell us about because this is

990
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.149
something you also go through in your book. Tell

991
00:41:51.149 --> 00:41:55.929
us about an example of a successful marketing campaign

992
00:41:56.189 --> 00:42:00.649
and another example of a non-successful campaign.

993
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:05.000
Yeah, OK, so. Um, WHAT'S the example of a,

994
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.929
of a successful marketing campaign, so that, so, so.

995
00:42:08.719 --> 00:42:12.110
Um, ONE campaign which I'd never heard of, um,

996
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.689
was which, but if you're, if you've got Canadian

997
00:42:14.689 --> 00:42:16.340
listeners and viewers, they will have probably heard of

998
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.469
this, was, was a was a campaign in the

999
00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.649
year 2000 for Molson beer. So at the time,

1000
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.879
Molson was suffering. It was the number one beer

1001
00:42:23.879 --> 00:42:25.939
brand in Canada, but it was suffering because people

1002
00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:27.939
started getting into drinking wine, and they were starting

1003
00:42:27.939 --> 00:42:30.459
to get into um drinking you know, microbreweries, it

1004
00:42:30.459 --> 00:42:32.139
was that hipster phase of microbreweries was it was

1005
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:34.810
all in. So Molson was suffering, so, so they

1006
00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.919
got in a new um ad agency to to

1007
00:42:37.929 --> 00:42:39.129
to to to to to to try and rescue

1008
00:42:39.129 --> 00:42:41.570
them from the doldrums. And so the, the head

1009
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.590
of ad agency was a Canadian guy. And he

1010
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.580
was acutely aware of how irritating that Canadians found

1011
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.389
it when Americans, and everybody else actually, mistook them

1012
00:42:51.389 --> 00:42:54.469
as American. Like Canadians don't like that, you know,

1013
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.030
they just don't like that. It annoys them. So

1014
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.669
he decided to sort of build an advert around

1015
00:42:58.669 --> 00:43:01.179
this whole concept. And so so so so so

1016
00:43:01.189 --> 00:43:03.510
so this what happens in this ad is that

1017
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.750
um it's just a very ordinary looking guy in

1018
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.379
a plaid shirt and jeans goes on a stage.

1019
00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:10.929
And he starts talking about all the things that

1020
00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:14.290
Canadians are that aren't American, essentially, so it's Z

1021
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.780
not Z. Um, YOU know, we, we, we don't

1022
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.320
say a boot, we say about, you know, all

1023
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.159
the misconceptions, all the, all the mistakes, all the,

1024
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.979
all the things that differentiate from them being American,

1025
00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:24.469
and he gets more and more and more passionate

1026
00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:26.989
as he goes along, and, um, and it just

1027
00:43:26.989 --> 00:43:28.350
ends up with a big shot of a molsome

1028
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.110
beer. So if you look at that dispassionately, it's.

1029
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.469
Mental, it doesn't make any sense because there's nothing

1030
00:43:33.469 --> 00:43:36.199
in the advertising campaign about the beer. It doesn't

1031
00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:37.719
tell you about how much it costs, what it

1032
00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:40.879
tastes like, it's calorie content, that it's fucking foamy

1033
00:43:40.879 --> 00:43:42.389
head or whatever it is that you might wanna,

1034
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.600
you know, you you used to sell beer. There's

1035
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.250
nothing information. All it is is basically. A description

1036
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.500
of an identity, you know, it's offering connection, it's

1037
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.189
offering that identification, so, yeah, yeah, that's like me,

1038
00:43:54.379 --> 00:43:56.820
but it's also offering status, it's saying, look, you

1039
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.020
know, we're better than those Americans, you know, we,

1040
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.060
we are great as Canadians, we do, you know,

1041
00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:03.139
we are, you know, we, we police by consent

1042
00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:05.500
and all these other things that they mentioned. So

1043
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.449
there it was offering connection, it was offering status.

1044
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.040
They pulled this genius move, the foot it debuted,

1045
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.050
um, in the year 2000 in the uh during

1046
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.550
the Academy Awards, the broadcast of the Oscars. And

1047
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.149
it was directly after South Park performed their song

1048
00:44:19.149 --> 00:44:21.629
Blame Canada. So all the Canadians have watched South

1049
00:44:21.629 --> 00:44:23.760
Park do Blame Canada ad break, and he got,

1050
00:44:23.949 --> 00:44:25.229
you know, I am Canadian, which is what the

1051
00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:26.830
album is called I am Canadian. And it was

1052
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:30.020
instantly successful, you know, it became completely viral in

1053
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.810
kind of pre-social media, Canada, um. Oh, you know,

1054
00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:36.330
on Canada Day, groups of kids would would amass

1055
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.889
and recite the rant. Um, I, I forget how

1056
00:44:38.889 --> 00:44:40.689
many millions, but within, within, within a matter of

1057
00:44:40.689 --> 00:44:42.850
weeks, millions have been added onto the, you know,

1058
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:45.050
the share price of the Molson beer brand. It

1059
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.530
was just enormously successful. So that, so that's a

1060
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.260
really good example of a company that's that's that

1061
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.459
that that that's using identity to sell a product

1062
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:54.969
in a in a way that doesn't make sense

1063
00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:57.570
if you don't understand storytelling, because like so many

1064
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.050
successful ads, it isn't about the actual product, it's

1065
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.149
about, it's really about identity. Um, SO that's a

1066
00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:05.530
successful one. And I guess a really easy, uh,

1067
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.889
really, yeah, a couple of easy recent examples, relatives

1068
00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:10.489
of unsuccessful ones, are as I do the opposite.

1069
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.469
So I'm thinking specifically about the Gillette ad, the

1070
00:45:12.469 --> 00:45:14.590
best, is this the best man, I, I can't

1071
00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:15.510
remember what it was, but it was the one

1072
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.669
where basically they were painting men as toxic males

1073
00:45:18.669 --> 00:45:21.939
who were just interested in. Bullying and they painted

1074
00:45:21.939 --> 00:45:24.100
men as, especially white men, it was, it was

1075
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.979
white men in particular, you know, significantly as as

1076
00:45:27.979 --> 00:45:30.860
sex pest, bullies, just nasty pieces of work and

1077
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.669
was basically saying, um, you can do better men.

1078
00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.459
So, so that's what's that doing? It's taking status

1079
00:45:36.459 --> 00:45:39.580
away, um, you know, and and what was their

1080
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.899
reward where they got absolutely hammered. And then even

1081
00:45:41.899 --> 00:45:43.419
more recently there was of course the Bud Light

1082
00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:47.260
thing where, um, Dylan Mulvaney, who is a kind

1083
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.139
of symbolically somebody that. Just oozes wokeness and and

1084
00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:54.939
you know, trying to sell a product which is

1085
00:45:54.939 --> 00:45:57.500
target which is mostly drunk by straight white men.

1086
00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.719
So, so, so, so, you know, it's, it's like

1087
00:45:59.719 --> 00:46:02.760
getting Jordan Peterson to advertise tampons, you know, it's

1088
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.800
like it's just not gonna fucking work. So, so,

1089
00:46:04.879 --> 00:46:07.280
so again, you know, it's it's, it's taking status

1090
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.600
away, it's basically um removing connection from the, from

1091
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.159
Bud Light. It's basically if you, if you drink

1092
00:46:13.159 --> 00:46:15.409
Bud Light, you're a wokey now, you know, it's,

1093
00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.399
it's a total disaster and, and it was, and

1094
00:46:18.399 --> 00:46:20.290
both the Gillette Gillette ad and the Bud Light

1095
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:23.239
ad were were psychologically incompetent. And they, you know,

1096
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.060
and they were, they they they they were punished

1097
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.040
financially, especially the Bud Light, I don't think Bud

1098
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.439
Light have recovered from the, from, from their Dylan

1099
00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:32.409
Mulvaney ad campaign.

1100
00:46:33.209 --> 00:46:39.850
Yeah. So how can people write persuasive stories? What

1101
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.209
steps can they follow?

1102
00:46:42.129 --> 00:46:43.770
Well, the first thing you need to do is

1103
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.159
to figure out who you're trying to connect with.

1104
00:46:46.209 --> 00:46:48.169
You know, you can't tell a story, well, you

1105
00:46:48.169 --> 00:46:50.370
can. You, you, you can try to tell a

1106
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.070
story that appeals to a kind of mass, mass

1107
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.250
mass audience. But the but but the more mass

1108
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.810
you get, the blander the ad gets, and you're

1109
00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.479
gonna have to rely on basic things like humor,

1110
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.889
you know, get, get them laughing along. But if

1111
00:46:59.889 --> 00:47:01.360
you want to tell a really persuasive story, you

1112
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.409
need you need to really figure out who your

1113
00:47:03.409 --> 00:47:05.929
audience is, what's the story world that they're living.

1114
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:09.469
You know, in the middle of, um, what, what

1115
00:47:09.469 --> 00:47:11.790
language do they use? It's really important to figure

1116
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:14.110
out how do they define status, you know, what

1117
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.790
to them does a hero look like, because every

1118
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.739
status game has a different definition of a hero.

1119
00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:19.550
The status game with the Buddhist monk and the

1120
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.909
status game with the Wall Street banker have completely

1121
00:47:21.909 --> 00:47:25.830
different ways of talking, being, speaking, living, you know,

1122
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.469
you've got to be, you've got to understand their

1123
00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:29.770
story world and just reflect it back to them.

1124
00:47:29.989 --> 00:47:31.629
And so that's, so once you've done that hard

1125
00:47:31.629 --> 00:47:33.989
work of figuring that out, as the blame as

1126
00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:36.899
the. You know, I Am Canadian ad shows, it's

1127
00:47:36.899 --> 00:47:38.540
sometimes simply a case of reflecting that back to

1128
00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.379
them. You know, and even like a much more

1129
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:42.739
famous example is Apple's Think Different campaign, which, you

1130
00:47:42.739 --> 00:47:45.219
know, again, has no information about any Apple product

1131
00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:46.540
in it. It's just a series of black and

1132
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.659
white pictures of people who've changed the world. Gandhi,

1133
00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:52.540
Mother Teresa, you know, John Lennon, Think Different. It's

1134
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.500
basically saying, you know, creative world changers. If you

1135
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.770
see you as yourself as a creative world changer,

1136
00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.860
buy an Apple computer because that's gonna give you

1137
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.760
the identity of a creative world changer. So, so,

1138
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.399
so sometimes it can be, it can be enough

1139
00:48:04.399 --> 00:48:06.399
to just reflect, just in, in a very specific

1140
00:48:06.399 --> 00:48:09.800
and accurate way, reflect back that identity to the

1141
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.179
audience, and then once they see that they're gonna

1142
00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:13.969
be, they're gonna identify with you and they're gonna

1143
00:48:13.969 --> 00:48:15.889
be drawn to want to buy your product because,

1144
00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:19.010
you know. Part of what we're doing is is

1145
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.399
trying to broadcast who we are, and so your

1146
00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:24.360
product becomes part of our cloud of uh our

1147
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.370
our our our our cloud of social information. So

1148
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.129
you know the Apple laptop computer we hope is

1149
00:48:28.129 --> 00:48:30.979
going to broadcast to the. You know, women across

1150
00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:32.659
the coffee shop that we are a creative world

1151
00:48:32.659 --> 00:48:35.459
changer, you know, that's how that works. And then

1152
00:48:35.459 --> 00:48:36.620
of course, and then as well as that, you,

1153
00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:38.580
you, you can offer status, you know, you know,

1154
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.610
like um like a Nike ad that has Michael

1155
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.379
Jordan in it, you, you, or you know, you

1156
00:48:43.379 --> 00:48:44.939
can say, look, if you, if you use our

1157
00:48:44.939 --> 00:48:47.459
product, you're gonna become a people like us, but

1158
00:48:47.459 --> 00:48:49.580
a, an elevated version of that. You're gonna become

1159
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.219
this dream version of who, who you've always wanted

1160
00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:54.419
to be. And, and, and those are the those

1161
00:48:54.419 --> 00:48:56.760
are the persuasive stories that, that, that, that, that,

1162
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.199
that have huge impacts. But, but, but, but you

1163
00:48:59.199 --> 00:49:01.919
have to achieve the identification first, you have to.

1164
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.649
Connect with people's identities, and then once you've done

1165
00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:07.280
that, do the other stuff.

1166
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.560
I have one last question then you begin your

1167
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:16.439
book by talking about Theranos, the uh company. What

1168
00:49:16.439 --> 00:49:20.320
are the ways by which the power of storytelling

1169
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.030
can be used to deceive and exploit people?

1170
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.040
Well, I think the Theranos example is is just

1171
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.840
a really good way of of of kind of

1172
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:33.209
demonstrating what story being is. Um, SO, you know,

1173
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.010
I think everybody probably knows the story of Elizabeth

1174
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:39.219
Holmes. Um, SHE, um, said that she'd invented this

1175
00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:42.090
device called the Edison, and Edison was amazing. It

1176
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.899
was a, you know, it was just this great

1177
00:49:43.899 --> 00:49:46.379
device that was like, like, so at the moment

1178
00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:48.729
to do a full range of blood tests on

1179
00:49:48.729 --> 00:49:50.850
something, you've got, you know, take out like two

1180
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.929
big vials of blood. And the Edison could do

1181
00:49:52.929 --> 00:49:55.760
all that with one finger prick. So amazing, fantastic,

1182
00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.370
it's gonna save lives, it's gonna be brilliant. You

1183
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.209
just go into your Walmart, do a finger prick

1184
00:49:59.209 --> 00:50:00.929
blood test and it's gonna, it's gonna figure you

1185
00:50:00.929 --> 00:50:04.300
out completely. Yeah. So she goes out and she,

1186
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.979
she, she, she wants to get a board of

1187
00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:08.300
directors, she wants to get investors, and she does

1188
00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.500
it. She tells us, she, she, she, she, she

1189
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.899
dresses up as Steve Jobs. She, she wears the

1190
00:50:12.899 --> 00:50:15.739
black polo neck, um she she lowers her voice

1191
00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:17.260
and starts speaking like you know in a very

1192
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.010
masculine way. um, AND, and, and telling a story,

1193
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.459
and, and people start saying this is a, this

1194
00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:25.899
is the female Steve Jobs. That was her story

1195
00:50:25.899 --> 00:50:29.330
that she is this amazing genius tech founder. And

1196
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.290
you know, back then, and it's no different now,

1197
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.290
people are desperate, people are desperate for that story,

1198
00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.050
they want to hear that story, like the story

1199
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.010
where they tell of tech is it's full of

1200
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.689
tech bros. Where are the female founders, where are

1201
00:50:38.689 --> 00:50:40.370
the where are the women who've started in the

1202
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:45.070
incredible company. You know, led, you know, created incredible

1203
00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:46.350
products to change the world. Where are they? Well,

1204
00:50:46.429 --> 00:50:49.189
here she is. Here she is. So that became

1205
00:50:49.189 --> 00:50:51.229
an intoxicating story, and that's a story that offers

1206
00:50:51.229 --> 00:50:54.149
status. And so all of her board of directors

1207
00:50:54.149 --> 00:50:56.189
were men, I think it's important, all, all, you

1208
00:50:56.189 --> 00:50:58.659
know, men in late middle age, late middle age,

1209
00:50:58.709 --> 00:51:02.149
including um Henry Kissinger, er, including, you know, the

1210
00:51:02.149 --> 00:51:04.459
former director of the Centers for Disease Control, people

1211
00:51:04.459 --> 00:51:06.360
who really ought to have known better. Um, YOU

1212
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.320
know, investors included the founders of the, you know,

1213
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.320
the Walmart family, they included Rupert Murdoch. So, so

1214
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.439
Theranos was, was the Murdoch family's, Rupert Murdoch's biggest

1215
00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:19.719
investment he ever made outside, um, his family of

1216
00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:22.280
companies. And the really important thing to know about

1217
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.040
all of these people. Is that they didn't do

1218
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.080
any due diligence. So due diligence is a completely

1219
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.760
ordinary thing to do when you're investing in, of

1220
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.989
course it is, like someone's coming to your office,

1221
00:51:32.199 --> 00:51:33.719
making all these claims, and you've got to figure

1222
00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:37.040
out, is it true? Is it true? And so

1223
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.239
some people did do that. So somebody, so Google

1224
00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:42.040
Ventures were interested in in interested in um investing

1225
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.090
in Theronos. And so they sent something out to

1226
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.290
Walmart to get a Theranos blood test and to

1227
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.850
his astonishment, they took out two massive vials of

1228
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.330
blood from his arm. So he was like, this

1229
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:53.770
is, this is something's weird, something's wrong here, so

1230
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:55.570
they didn't invest. So some people didn't fall for

1231
00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:57.770
the story, but people like Rupert Murdoch and Henry

1232
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.850
Kissinger and, you know, the former director of the

1233
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.870
Centers for Disease Control, they did without. Doing any

1234
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.629
due diligence, and I think, you know, they did

1235
00:52:04.629 --> 00:52:07.550
it because her story offered status. They wanted a

1236
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.870
piece of her heroism. She was a hero. She

1237
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.110
was on uh on, on, on, you know, magazine

1238
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.030
cover after magazine cover. She was profiled in The

1239
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.669
New Yorker, she was on TED Talk stages, Forbes

1240
00:52:16.669 --> 00:52:20.350
magazine stages. She was the female Steve Jobs and

1241
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:22.510
they wanted a piece of it. And so that's

1242
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.510
why, but in my estimation, why they were so

1243
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:28.020
desperate to get involved with her is because of

1244
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.949
the story, her story being, it was a story

1245
00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:32.199
that she was representing. And at the peak of

1246
00:52:32.199 --> 00:52:34.870
her powers, you know, her machine was worth nothing,

1247
00:52:34.919 --> 00:52:37.560
it had no value because it didn't exist. But

1248
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.969
her story, her company was worth $9 billion. And,

1249
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.040
and, and, and I think that story is you

1250
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:48.040
know, it is important because of um the lack

1251
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.280
of due diligence, but it's also important because of

1252
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.629
the incredible. Success of the people who have felt

1253
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:56.500
for it. Rupert Murdoch, you know, Henry Kissinger, you

1254
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.840
know, these are incredibly smart, incredibly wily, incredibly successful

1255
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.020
people, and she did a number on every single

1256
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.100
one of them, and that's the power of storytelling.

1257
00:53:06.209 --> 00:53:10.370
So, but yeah, but in more general terms, how

1258
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:15.110
can it be used to deceive and exploit other

1259
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:18.610
people? I mean, what are the ingredients and the

1260
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:22.090
ways that we can use storytelling to do that?

1261
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:26.739
Well, I, yeah, I'm I'm, I'm a bit skeptical

1262
00:53:26.739 --> 00:53:31.530
about um this idea that people consciously use storytelling

1263
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:35.610
to. Exploit and manipulate people. I, I think most

1264
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.729
people like, I think, you know, there are the

1265
00:53:37.729 --> 00:53:40.290
Elizabeth Holmes's of the world for sure. But I

1266
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.250
think, but, but I think most people who are

1267
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.290
kind of leading groups that tell stories which we

1268
00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:46.489
know aren't true, they're not doing it in a

1269
00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.959
kind of Machiavellian ha ha ha kind of way.

1270
00:53:49.209 --> 00:53:51.810
They also genuinely believe their stories. I mean, I

1271
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.209
spent the first part of my career as a

1272
00:53:53.209 --> 00:53:55.929
journalist when I was a journalist. Doing lots of

1273
00:53:55.929 --> 00:53:58.409
work with cults and you know, people who believe

1274
00:53:58.409 --> 00:54:01.010
crazy things like UFOs and ghosts and um you

1275
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:05.010
know, Holocaust deniers and and so people talk about

1276
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.250
those people as if they're evil, they're exploiters, you

1277
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.879
know, like like you know like the the the

1278
00:54:08.889 --> 00:54:12.889
the um the TV mystic who's telling your. Future

1279
00:54:12.889 --> 00:54:15.689
and contacting your parents and you know, I found

1280
00:54:15.689 --> 00:54:17.489
a few of those people, but the vast majority

1281
00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:19.639
of the people that I ever met sincerely believed

1282
00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:22.429
the stuff, the bullshit that they were spouting. So,

1283
00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.000
so, so, you know, and you know, without, without

1284
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.810
knowing it, they were offering connection, you know, like

1285
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:29.889
that's what the spirituals doing, they're offering connection. That's

1286
00:54:29.889 --> 00:54:31.290
what religious people are doing. I mean, you know,

1287
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.969
this kind of work has changed my view on

1288
00:54:33.969 --> 00:54:35.889
religion. I used to be very, very anti-religion, you

1289
00:54:35.889 --> 00:54:37.449
know, I've always been an atheist, but now I

1290
00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:40.129
understand, I see. The, the, the, the, the value

1291
00:54:40.129 --> 00:54:42.610
of religion is that it offers connection and status

1292
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.610
to billions of people around the world, and we

1293
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.129
need those things in our lives and you know,

1294
00:54:47.179 --> 00:54:48.689
and it especially offers them to people who are

1295
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:51.889
who are living in much worse socioeconomic conditions than

1296
00:54:51.889 --> 00:54:54.449
we are in the West, so more power to

1297
00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:57.290
it, you know, in a way. Um, SO, so,

1298
00:54:57.409 --> 00:54:59.659
so, so, but, but I mean, to, to sort

1299
00:54:59.659 --> 00:55:01.590
of directly answer your question, I, the risk of

1300
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.000
repeating myself, you know, it is that it is,

1301
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.199
it, those are the things that we want, you

1302
00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:07.520
know, we, we, we want to join a group

1303
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.199
of like-minded people, and, and, and once we're in

1304
00:55:10.199 --> 00:55:11.600
that group of like-minded people, we want to feel

1305
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.239
that they value us and they respect us and

1306
00:55:13.239 --> 00:55:14.879
they esteem us and, and, and if we have

1307
00:55:14.879 --> 00:55:17.760
those things, we experience lives of meaning and purpose

1308
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.360
and, you know, and general satisfaction as long as

1309
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.399
things are going well, of course when things start

1310
00:55:22.399 --> 00:55:24.469
to go wrong, the pain comes.

1311
00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:29.189
Great. So the book is again, a story is

1312
00:55:29.189 --> 00:55:32.229
a deal, how to use the science of storytelling

1313
00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:35.510
to lead, motivate and persuade. I'm leaving a link

1314
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.149

about Um, you know, the, the, the kind of

1322
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.340
pitfalls and pleasures of, of, of, of having this

1323
00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:04.370
kind of storytelling brain, so, um, um, that's at
