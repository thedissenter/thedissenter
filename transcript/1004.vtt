00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.839
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.670
Decent. Today. I'm here with a fellow youtuber. Lawrence.

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.890
Anthony has a youtube channel on Anti Natal is,

4
00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.789
that's basically what we're going to discuss today. Anti

5
00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:19.059
Natal and also some other ideas, uh, topics associated

6
00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:22.000
with Antenatal is or some of the, some of

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.209
the ones people tend sometimes to associate with anti

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.059
natal. So, Lawrence, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.260
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.270
No, th thank thanks so much for uh, inviting

11
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.470
me and I've seen quite a few episodes of

12
00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.130
the Decent. So, um, now I'm on the other

13
00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:39.349
side I usually watch, but now I'm on it.

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.310
Yeah, that, that's great. So let me just ask

15
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:46.310
you perhaps I will start with a more personal

16
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.130
question. What got you into anti Natal? And, uh,

17
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.250
and, uh, when did you first get across anti

18
00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.639
Natal is why did it interest you?

19
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.310
Yeah. Well, the first time I came across it

20
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.849
as like a term and an idea was, I

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.980
guess around sort of like 6.5, 7 years ago

22
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:15.129
now. And I was on a study exchange in

23
00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:20.230
Sweden. I'd recently become vegan gotten involved in, uh,

24
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:24.059
vegan advocacy or animal rights activism. And I was

25
00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.720
at an animal rights demonstration or it was just

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.699
after the demonstration and I overheard two people having

27
00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.150
a conversation about anti Natal. And I, but I

28
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.349
wasn't involved in that conversation. Um, THAT, that's just

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.889
where I heard, like the term and the fact

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.650
that it was an idea. It was then a

31
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.330
few months later, I was at another animal rights

32
00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:45.660
demonstration and there were a few people I was

33
00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:48.180
talking to there, the topic then came up and

34
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.190
I was like, oh, that was that weird thing

35
00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:53.069
that I, I was kind of interested by, um,

36
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.730
that I'd heard a few months before. So then

37
00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.059
I had a full conversation with them and, you

38
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.239
know, they, they, they were anti natal lists themselves.

39
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.260
They explained it to me. I sort of asked

40
00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:05.650
them some questions, gave them a bit of pushback

41
00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:08.559
and then they sent me away with a few

42
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.729
sort of links to interviews to watch. Um, SO

43
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.679
I watched those and after that, I kind of,

44
00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.929
I felt that I didn't have any good counter

45
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.820
arguments. And so I adopted it as a view

46
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.300
myself. Um, WHY it was appealing to me? I'm

47
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:28.419
not entirely sure. The only thing I can say

48
00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.229
is that because I'd recently become vegan at the

49
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.059
time, that had been a big paradigm shift in

50
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.589
the way I thought. So. I think that made

51
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.119
me particularly then, although I think I've maintained quite

52
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.630
an open mind since then, but definitely around that

53
00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.550
period, I was very open to being completely wrong

54
00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.160
on fundamental things. Cos I'd found something that I

55
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.449
felt I was wrong on before. So I, you

56
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.509
know, I, I was probably more open than the

57
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.289
average person or, or than I generally am. Um,

58
00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.160
SO that, that probably made me more sort of,

59
00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.259
um, yeah, open to anti natal, even though it

60
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.610
was something I'd never heard before. And when I

61
00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.100
first heard it, I was kind of like, I,

62
00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.429
I find it very bizarre because I was very

63
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.089
much the opposite. I de, I definitely wanted Children.

64
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.610
Um, SO it was very strange to me to

65
00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.529
hear that, that opposing point of view. But, yeah.

66
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.380
Oh, so before you got into anti natal you

67
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.660
wanted to have Children and then that changed?

68
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:32.360
Yeah. Exac, yeah, exactly. Um, I, I probably wasn't

69
00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.139
much different from many other people. It's, of course,

70
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.020
it's very normal for people to want to have

71
00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.360
kids and that, to be one of the sort

72
00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.020
of main things they want to do in life.

73
00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.910
So it was very much, it was very much

74
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.660
like that. I don't think I would stand out

75
00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.500
from other people in that respect. But it, it,

76
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.009
it, it was a big shift and when I

77
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.850
started to grapple with anti natal is there was

78
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.610
a bit of emotional sort of friction there cos

79
00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.479
obviously it was pulling me away from something that

80
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.580
I wanted to do and, uh you know, was

81
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.279
a big part of what I saw my future

82
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.160
to be. So there was a bit of emotional

83
00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.279
discord there, but I don't wanna overplay it. I

84
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:12.039
actually think I had a relatively smooth transition. Um,

85
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.000
COS 01, once I feel something to be ethically

86
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.089
wrong, I, you know, my, my emotions tend to

87
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.140
come in line with that pretty quickly and, you

88
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.470
know, cos I just feel like I don't wanna

89
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.079
do that anymore. Um So yeah,

90
00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:27.350
a and you mentioned veganism and that you were

91
00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:31.420
already a vegan back then. So did you link

92
00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:36.250
immediately veganism with Antenatal is or did it take

93
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.769
uh some time for you to uh notice that

94
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.739
perhaps there were some commonalities there in terms of,

95
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.910
for example, how we approach uh sentient life and

96
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.619
suffering and stuff like that.

97
00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.600
Yeah, I mean, yeah, initially, um the my sort

98
00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:58.459
of coming across anti Natal and being convinced by

99
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.390
it, it occurred in like a vegan environment, but

100
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.559
I don't think I necessarily linked it to veganism

101
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.950
particularly. It's uh yeah, it's only been since then.

102
00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.679
Over time, I've become more aware of the, the

103
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.940
links between them. Um Initially, because when I was

104
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.429
having conversations with people about veganism and anti natal

105
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.369
separate conversations, you would often get the same kind

106
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.850
of responses back. Um So that, that was quite

107
00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:31.570
uh you know, like appeals to things being natural

108
00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:34.450
and stuff like this. Um OR, you know, we

109
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.559
have reproductive systems, we have canines, the, these sorts

110
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.899
of things, there were sort of similar pushbacks you

111
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.119
get on both. So that kind of made me

112
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.200
think. Well, you know, maybe, maybe there's a, maybe

113
00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.760
there's an actual link between these two. Yeah, between

114
00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:52.589
these two ideas or philosophies. Um So, and my,

115
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.570
my, my current understanding is that I do think

116
00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.750
there's a strong link between them. I don't think

117
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.269
one necessarily mandates another. But I think in practice

118
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.690
the like if one person accepts one, in practice

119
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.649
it, it there's a pretty strong case to accept

120
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.290
the other. I I'm not sure if there's a

121
00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:14.190
logical sort of like bridge between them in terms

122
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.079
of if one you have to do the other.

123
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.209
But I think there's a very, very strong relationship.

124
00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.790
Yeah. No, uh there are some very curious things

125
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.250
that you mentioned there. And uh I mean, I'm

126
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.739
not sure to what extent I'm going to talk

127
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.480
here today about my own personal position on anti

128
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.649
natal is and veganism. I think I will try

129
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.970
to save most of it for an in an

130
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.250
upcoming interview with Amanda Sukhani. She's going to interview

131
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.269
me in October. So maybe I will save uh

132
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.829
I will try to save as much as I

133
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:48.779
can for that. But I mean, for example, at

134
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.549
a certain point, you mentioned that and I asked

135
00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:55.002
directly about it that it was only after you

136
00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:58.572
got into Antenatal that you eventually decided that you

137
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:01.393
no longer wanted to have kids in my personal

138
00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:05.592
case. It's very interesting because, because it was way,

139
00:07:05.602 --> 00:07:09.653
way before me getting across anti natal is that

140
00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:12.446
I have already decided I didn't, I want to

141
00:07:12.506 --> 00:07:15.696
have kids. Basically. When I was 10 years old

142
00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.316
I really didn't want to have kids.

143
00:07:18.325 --> 00:07:20.705
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I find

144
00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:25.596
that, um, like that is something that, uh, is

145
00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:28.675
relatively common in anti natal circles. And I think

146
00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:33.660
it's probably because if someone's already decided that they

147
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.619
don't want Children, then like one of the, I

148
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.040
think one of the biggest barriers to people thinking

149
00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:43.230
clearly about anti natal is that it's, it's telling

150
00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:47.010
them something they deeply wanna do is ethically wrong.

151
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.260
But if you don't wanna do that thing, then

152
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.989
it kind of makes the thinking process easier. There's

153
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.890
less emotional friction. So it's, yeah, it's not, it's,

154
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.100
it's not uncommon to hear that sort of story.

155
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.940
Yeah. And also you mentioned that when you get

156
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.750
across ethical ideas that you can't really dispute or

157
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.739
don't have good enough counterarguments to you basically just

158
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.149
very quickly adopt them. And for me it's more

159
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.730
or less the same, for example, I was also

160
00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.869
vegan for four years. I mean, the reasons why

161
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.640
I stopped being vegan are mostly health related. I,

162
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:28.100
I won't get into that here. But anyway, I

163
00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:31.600
decided that I would become a vegan one day

164
00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:34.359
and the next day I was already eating vegan.

165
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:34.859
So,

166
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.260
yeah. Yeah, I, I was exactly the same. Like,

167
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.020
my, my shift was, was overnight and I think,

168
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.250
I don't know, maybe it doesn't happen with every

169
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.169
topic. But, um, like, generally if I find something

170
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.770
to be wrong I sort of have, yeah, I

171
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.880
don't know, like a, it and, and it accords

172
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.739
with some behavior I'm doing, um, or want to

173
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.099
do then. Yeah, I, I just, I don't know,

174
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.320
I just get a lot of, yeah, internal cognitive

175
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.039
friction.

176
00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:06.780
Yeah, me, me too. So, but let me ask

177
00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:11.080
you now, then what version of anti natal do

178
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.669
you espouse? Because there are diff slightly different versions

179
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.340
out there. Perhaps the most well known or the

180
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:22.049
most popular is the one by David Benatar. But

181
00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:26.479
uh basically how would you characterize or describe uh

182
00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:29.169
your own version of Antenatal?

183
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.700
Yeah. So when I first had sort of significant

184
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.469
conversations about anti Natal, they were primarily based around

185
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.000
uh or as I was discovering anti natal is

186
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.059
most of it was centered around the work of

187
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.979
David Benatar and like interviews he's given and stuff.

188
00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:52.409
Um And I would say so I think there's,

189
00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:55.099
there's a difference between the form of anti natal

190
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.700
that I find most resonates with me and the

191
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.929
form that would be most convincing to others. Cos

192
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.950
obviously different people are gonna be convinced by different

193
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.049
things. But the, the form of anti natal I

194
00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:11.729
that resonates most with me is um is the

195
00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:15.479
axe uh the antenatal conclusion that can be derived

196
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:20.849
from the axe. Asymmetry that Benatar describes. Um AND

197
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.510
yeah, he, I mean, he also espouses like a

198
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.919
senio centric form of anti natal. So I think

199
00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:33.900
that um anti natal is, is about moral agents,

200
00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:38.559
creating sentient beings, basically moral patients. I guess you'd

201
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.010
describe it as. So I know obviously, there's much

202
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.849
debate in antenatal circles about whether the reproduction of

203
00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:48.900
wild animals uh is included within anti natal is

204
00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.710
um I don't know if you wanted to touch

205
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:53.690
on that later, but that I see as something

206
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.070
separate. Um I see uh anti natal as as

207
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.770
being about the behavior of individuals who can make

208
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.599
decisions um uh and, and analyze them in a,

209
00:11:07.609 --> 00:11:12.099
in a, in a moral way, right? Um So

210
00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:14.950
it would include breeding of wild animals if it's

211
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.119
humans, breeding them, say for, you know, conservation efforts

212
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.210
or something like that. Um The reason I extend

213
00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:22.890
it to other animals, I mean, I have a

214
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.270
more detailed video on my channel, but in general,

215
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.710
it's because um I think in, in many of

216
00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:34.010
the sa many of the ways that humans can

217
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.390
be harmed, other animals can also be harmed in

218
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.880
those same ways, not every way identically, but I

219
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.549
think other animals are sentient, feel, you know, pain,

220
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:50.070
they have to different degrees emotional lives and these

221
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.580
are the things that we tend to care about

222
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.960
in humans. And so I think our care should,

223
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.549
um, you know, bridge the, the species barrier over

224
00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.239
to other, other species outside of our own species.

225
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.940
And so just as like with veganism, you know,

226
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.489
I'm against, you know, killing a person for, for

227
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.500
a, a sandwich, I'd be against killing a, an

228
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.700
animal for a sandwich. And it's the same with

229
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.599
Antenatal, just like I'd be against breeding a human.

230
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.599
Um I'd be against breeding, you know, a pig

231
00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:23.440
or a cow or a chicken. Um So yeah,

232
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.190
if you want me to cover how I see

233
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.539
anti Natal in any more detailed way, just, just,

234
00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:30.280
you know, prompt me with the question. But that's

235
00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:31.380
sort of like an overview.

236
00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:35.299
Yeah, great. No. And since you mentioned the asymmetry

237
00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:38.080
argument, uh I would like to get into that.

238
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.010
I have these questions for later, but perhaps let's

239
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.130
go ahead with it. Now. Um It actually the

240
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.229
asymmetry argument is one argument that when I first

241
00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:54.130
got across Bennet's work was very convincing to me,

242
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.429
but over time, I, I think that it is

243
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.450
actually weaker than it sounds uh w when you

244
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.559
first hear it because I mean, basically, and also

245
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.059
for, for the audience to know the asymmetry argument

246
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.229
is basically about the asymmetry. Uh SOME of the

247
00:13:11.239 --> 00:13:16.469
asymmetries that we see between uh uh between being

248
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.450
alive and never ever and, and never even having

249
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.119
started alive, never, never existing And so, uh since

250
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.789
beings who are alive, they experience pleasure and pain,

251
00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:32.599
pain, of course, is bad. Pleasure is good. And

252
00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:35.559
then if you were never even born to begin

253
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.070
with, you don't have, you don't experience any pleasure

254
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.229
nor any pain. The pain is good for you

255
00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:45.109
to not experience the pleasure. I mean, since you

256
00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:48.969
don't even exist, it basically doesn't matter. I mean,

257
00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:51.989
it's more or less along those lines. Right. So,

258
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.260
but, but one thing that I find a bit

259
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.989
weird now is that when we are talking about

260
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.390
a person or another kind of sentient being who

261
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.200
never existed to begin with it. I mean, it's,

262
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.150
it sounds a bit weird because we're basically talking

263
00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.169
about, we, we're not talking about and anyone, right?

264
00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:16.809
I mean, not existing, it's not uh I mean,

265
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.520
let me try to explain it in, in another

266
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.429
way. So, I mean, if someone doesn't exist, I,

267
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.969
I understand she wouldn't experience pain or pleasure, but

268
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:35.049
there wouldn't be anyone to not experience that pain,

269
00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:37.320
that pain and that pleasure, you know. So, I

270
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.460
it's more that I think I nowadays I think

271
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:44.770
that it sounds a bit weird to me to,

272
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.929
to talk in those terms. And also uh for

273
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.900
other people who are not even convinced by anti

274
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.619
natal is or haven't been exposed to anti Natal,

275
00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:59.010
it would also sound uh like AAA weird argument

276
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.250
to basically to be talking about things that aren't

277
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.369
even there someone who doesn't exist, but at the

278
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.830
same time, uh as some as the benefit of

279
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.469
not experiencing. So, I, I don't know if I

280
00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.809
was clear here that, I mean, my argument is

281
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.479
a little bit convoluted, I think.

282
00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:20.359
No, no. So, I, I actually, when you started

283
00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:21.960
speaking, I actually thought you were going to go

284
00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:26.830
down a slightly different road because, um, when, so

285
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.679
11 thing I found when I've spoken to people

286
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.099
about the Ax asymmetry is that often it pretty

287
00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:38.000
much comes down to what like the intuitions and

288
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.679
the values that the person holds anyway. So I

289
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:46.369
found that if someone already has the values described

290
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:52.190
by the Ax asymmetry, it it provides a sort

291
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.530
of very neat way of describing the values that

292
00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:57.429
they may not have been fully able to like,

293
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.919
intellectualize in their head. And that was probably the

294
00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:01.919
case for me and probably the case for many

295
00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:05.309
anti natal lists. But if someone doesn't already have

296
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.489
those values, I'm not sure how str apart from

297
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.770
like presenting someone with the consequences of their values

298
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.469
and seeing if they change as a result of

299
00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:18.969
that, it's quite hard to change someone's fundamental values.

300
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:23.690
So I have, I've found that the Ax Asymmetry

301
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:30.039
argument is both like strong and weak in the

302
00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:32.520
same time, like it's, it's strong in terms of

303
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.239
like it provides a very, um um what was

304
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.280
the word I even used before? I literally just

305
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:42.289
said it 30 seconds ago, it provides a neat

306
00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:44.729
way of someone understanding the values they have and

307
00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:47.090
consequences that it and, and sort of positions or

308
00:16:47.099 --> 00:16:49.979
consequences it may lead to. But as a t,

309
00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:52.799
as using it as a tool to convince someone,

310
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.489
I don't know how, um, how good it is

311
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.369
because often it bottoms out in because like Benatar

312
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.270
says, it's not a logical argument you can use

313
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.789
to cut, you know, catch someone out, you know,

314
00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:07.209
uh like making an illogical argument on their end.

315
00:17:07.348 --> 00:17:10.598
It's more just presenting, here's a set of values.

316
00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:13.250
If you have them, it likely leads to this

317
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.209
consequence ie anti Natal. But if someone doesn't have

318
00:17:16.219 --> 00:17:18.959
those values, it can be very hard to move

319
00:17:18.969 --> 00:17:21.520
them from that position. So that, that's the weakness

320
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.098
I've sort of um seen in it. And at

321
00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:26.479
the end of the day, it's like, I'm kind

322
00:17:26.489 --> 00:17:31.189
of fine with that personally. Like I don't feel,

323
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:33.770
you know, one person can only do so much

324
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.550
if I don't convince one person, I can just

325
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.699
move on to the next person, et cetera, um

326
00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:39.839
or try to use a different argument. But on

327
00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:43.239
what you're saying about how it's a strange argument

328
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.140
to use because it's talking about the absence of

329
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.550
pain being a good thing, even whilst there's no

330
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.900
one there to actually actively benefit from that good.

331
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.989
I agree with you. I think that, um I

332
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.359
think it sounds very strange but I think there

333
00:18:00.369 --> 00:18:04.800
are Um And I think that's because the way

334
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.050
that we've evolved, we've evolved to deal with things

335
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.589
that are physically around us and, and not philosophical

336
00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:12.969
discussion. And it can often be hard for us

337
00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:17.069
to sort of have discussions around things that don't

338
00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:20.920
exist or never exist. That's why many people will

339
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.069
struggle to deal with hypotheticals. Right? When you're having

340
00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:27.390
a, when you're having a discussion, I think many

341
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.449
of us in the anti natal sphere or people

342
00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:31.089
who are sort of like interact with the anti

343
00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:33.430
natalis sphere, we can often be quite used to

344
00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:37.050
having philosophical discussions. But if you go out and

345
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.030
have and try to have a philosophical, philosophical discussion

346
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.790
with an average group of people and you present

347
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.369
a hypothetical, they will say, well, that can never

348
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.910
happen. So why are you even discussing it? But

349
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.020
that's the point of a hypothetical, that's the whole

350
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.119
point. This thing is hypothetical. It's not real. Um

351
00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:56.060
So I agree with you. It can sound very

352
00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:58.599
weird. I do think though and I think Benatar

353
00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:02.160
makes this point in that. Um EVEN though something

354
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.729
may sound very strange if there's a peculiar, if

355
00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:07.959
some, if you're talking about a case, which is

356
00:19:07.969 --> 00:19:10.989
a peculiar case, a very strange case, even though

357
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.160
something sounds weird, it doesn't mean that it's necessarily

358
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.040
wrong. I can give like another peculiar case um

359
00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:22.189
of something being good where there's no one in

360
00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:25.010
particular who, who may be benefiting from it which

361
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.040
is death sometimes, right? Like, I'm sure you, I

362
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.670
don't know what your particular views are or if

363
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.199
you've interviewed people on this topic. Um, I'm sure

364
00:19:33.209 --> 00:19:36.670
you have but, um, those who advocate for like

365
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.079
euthanasia or assisted dying, you know, often we will

366
00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:42.079
refer to it as being, you know, someone may

367
00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:43.609
be being better off dead if they're in a

368
00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:48.800
situation where their life is, eee extremely bad and

369
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.380
there's no sort of prospect for recovery. It doesn't,

370
00:19:52.589 --> 00:19:54.540
it doesn't sound strange to me to say that

371
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.180
that person is better off dead because the situation

372
00:19:58.189 --> 00:20:02.420
that um is currently in existence, but, you know,

373
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.500
pertaining to them is, is so bad that simple

374
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.400
nonexistence would be a better state of affairs. It

375
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.949
would be, it would be a good thing, you

376
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:14.000
know, the action of, um, you know, helping them

377
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.079
fade out of existence, you know, obviously by, via

378
00:20:17.089 --> 00:20:20.859
ethical means, um would, would be a good thing

379
00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:23.430
even though that person no longer exists to actively

380
00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:25.510
benefit from that. And I kind of feel like

381
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.689
the, the opposite. Um, CASE of never bringing someone

382
00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:32.270
into existence. For me, the language doesn't sound strange.

383
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.380
Maybe originally it did. I, I can't really remember

384
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.520
in detail. Um But it, it doesn't sound strange

385
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.189
to me to say that it, you know, it's

386
00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.780
good not to bring someone into existence to suffer.

387
00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:46.229
Um I can maybe give like another quick example

388
00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:50.319
in that. Um And this, this one, this one's

389
00:20:50.329 --> 00:20:54.000
like a vegan example. So, um, it's, it's very

390
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.750
common for, you know, if you're doing vegan street

391
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.750
outreach and you're say you're presenting some footage of

392
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.939
a, of a farm or a slaughterhouse and you

393
00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:06.369
say to the people, you know, we need to

394
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.439
just stop breeding these animals and, and, and this

395
00:21:09.449 --> 00:21:11.650
issue will go away and the people will say,

396
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.760
well, then they won't, you know, come into existence,

397
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.660
they won't have lives and, you know, they'll never

398
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.550
live a life and vegans will say, yeah, good.

399
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.380
That's a, that's a good thing that they won't

400
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.359
come into existence because their lives will just be

401
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:27.420
hell. And I think in that instance it doesn't

402
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.619
sound so unintuitive because we recognize their lives are

403
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.520
gonna be so bad. I think it's maybe the

404
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.010
fact that when we say it's good for a

405
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.709
human not to come into existence, perhaps it sounds

406
00:21:39.719 --> 00:21:42.550
less intuitive because the life we're imagining them to

407
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.609
have is not as bad as being on a

408
00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:49.040
factory farm. And so perhaps we're, um, there's not

409
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.709
as much of a contrast for us to understand

410
00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:55.560
the use of the language within. Um, BUT personally,

411
00:21:55.569 --> 00:21:57.069
for me, I see it as equally valid. I

412
00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:58.670
don't know if that's gonna be convincing to you

413
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.760
or other people. But, um, yeah, that's, that's what

414
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.400
I have to say.

415
00:22:02.969 --> 00:22:04.949
I, I mean, you don't have to convince me

416
00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:08.050
because I'm already an Antenatal just that there are

417
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.189
there are certain specific arguments like that when that

418
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:14.869
to me sound now a bit weird. But anyway,

419
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.430
another thing that is also kind of goes together

420
00:22:18.439 --> 00:22:24.119
with that argument, the symmetry argument is evaluating life

421
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.729
as good or bad or evaluating something as negative

422
00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:32.099
or positive. Do you think that, do you really

423
00:22:32.109 --> 00:22:35.229
think that we can do that objectively? I mean,

424
00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:39.930
that we can objectively say that whatever it is

425
00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:45.219
we're talking about is absolutely negative or absolutely positive

426
00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:48.680
or absolutely good or bad? Because uh I mean,

427
00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:51.060
from my own perspective, and this is also a

428
00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.959
perspective I developed over the years with some of

429
00:22:53.969 --> 00:22:58.540
the conversations I have on the show. Um It,

430
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.030
it, it, it seems to me that different people

431
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:08.510
have different personality traits, different psychological predispositions and what

432
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.810
could be, what is good for someone could be

433
00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:15.670
bad for another person and vice versa. So do

434
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.469
you think that uh what do you think about

435
00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:20.910
that? And do you think that matters when it

436
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.229
comes to anti natal arguments?

437
00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:27.599
Yeah. So I agree with you in that, I

438
00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:32.420
think our experience of our own lives is of,

439
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.680
of course subjective. I mean, al I guess by

440
00:23:34.689 --> 00:23:37.359
definition, right? Because we are the subject experiencing it.

441
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.560
But um al also in, in the case of

442
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:43.589
like the, as you said, the same thing can

443
00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:45.300
happen to do d two different people and they

444
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.579
can experience it in very different way, right? Um

445
00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:54.560
So I think when, when we're talking about sort

446
00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:56.660
of like the human condition or it's also being

447
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.069
called the human predicament in the sort of pessimistic

448
00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:02.869
evaluation of human life. I think it is sometimes

449
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.489
hard to make objective claims about the nature of

450
00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:11.849
human existence or even like, or maybe it's even

451
00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:17.020
harder with an individual human's existence. One because we're

452
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.640
not, we're not experiencing that existence. So it's very

453
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.920
hard to make statements about someone else's life because

454
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.000
they're the only one experiencing it. Um So, yeah,

455
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.530
I think to a degree, it is, it is

456
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:35.050
subjective. Um BECAUSE um there's a saying which I'm

457
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.109
probably gonna butcher, but it's, it's something like the

458
00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:40.949
same person never crosses the same river twice because

459
00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:43.339
either the river has changed or the person has

460
00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:47.989
changed in that. Um You know, we all live

461
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.630
our lives and perhaps we'll go through an experience

462
00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:53.849
and if we're to go through that experience, we

463
00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.680
generally change as a person as a result of

464
00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:58.390
that experience. And so if we have the same

465
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.160
experience in 10 years time, w we won't be

466
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.530
experiencing it as the same person. Cos we'll have

467
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.040
grown from the, the first time. But also there's

468
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.160
just the intervening period where other things would have

469
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.050
happened and we would have changed. And so, um

470
00:25:14.069 --> 00:25:17.900
yeah, relating this back to, you know, the evaluation

471
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.270
of human existence being subjective is if we can't

472
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.780
even guarantee that the same individual will react to

473
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.030
the same stimuli in the same way, two different

474
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.130
times in their life, then it's, it would be

475
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.520
extremely hard to make accurate um um sort of

476
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.319
pronouncements about many different people's experience of their life.

477
00:25:40.449 --> 00:25:44.920
So I 100% agree that to an extent, the

478
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.449
evaluation of our own lives is subjective. And I

479
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:52.709
do struggle with the idea of because I hold

480
00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:55.560
a more pessimistic evaluation of, of the human condition.

481
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.369
But I find I, I do have this comfort

482
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.469
with going to someone and trying to convince them

483
00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:03.290
that their life is worse than they think it

484
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.369
is. You know, no, you're mistaken. Your life is

485
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.410
actually not as good as you think it is.

486
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.010
Your life is actually very bad. Now, I do

487
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.880
think there are things we can present to people

488
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.410
to make them evaluate their life in a more

489
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.000
rational way. But at the end of the day,

490
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.550
it, it's very hard to me as another person

491
00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:27.420
make hard and fast statements about their experience and

492
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.290
their condition because I'm not living it. They're the

493
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.890
ones living it and people will have different hedonic

494
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.349
set points. Um You know, for use of a

495
00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:39.560
ab or to use a s sort of simpler

496
00:26:39.569 --> 00:26:41.979
term like we all have different baselines. Some people

497
00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:44.180
have a lower baseline, some people have a, have

498
00:26:44.189 --> 00:26:46.699
a higher baseline for their general mental well being.

499
00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:52.199
Um So, but just, just to cover. So I

500
00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:55.670
just want to cover um, maybe just put a

501
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.349
very brief case for why I do generally take

502
00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:01.109
a pessimistic evaluation of the human condition. And then

503
00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:04.420
I can talk about the link to, to Antenatal.

504
00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:07.880
Um And I'm actually, I'm actually working on a

505
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.349
video at the moment on this very topic. Um

506
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.099
So 11 reason I take the pessimistic evaluation of

507
00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:22.260
human life is because I think, and Benatar describes

508
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.410
this and I'm sure other sort of like philosophical

509
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.910
pessimists have is that there are many asymmetries besides

510
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.670
the a one that we were talking about. But

511
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.130
there are many asymmetries in life that weight our

512
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.510
experience towards being more um more inclined to ill

513
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.459
being rather than well being. Um So Benatar presents

514
00:27:44.469 --> 00:27:46.750
some, some examples of like, you know, the worst

515
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.989
pains are worse than the best pleasures are, are

516
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.140
good. Generally, um dissatisfaction and pain can come to

517
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.640
us naturally with no effort of our own. You

518
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.910
know, uh us putting no effort in. So one

519
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.709
easier example is if we were just to sit

520
00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:07.260
here existing like malnourishment and thirst would obviously come

521
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.920
to us naturally. We don't have to put any

522
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.140
effort in for that stuff to come to us.

523
00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:13.729
You know, eventually we may become infected by a

524
00:28:13.739 --> 00:28:16.689
disease as well. Dis disease finds its way to

525
00:28:16.699 --> 00:28:18.479
us. We don't have to go seek it out.

526
00:28:18.689 --> 00:28:22.739
Um But we have to put effort in to

527
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.810
stave off these things. So we have to put

528
00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:27.459
effort into finding food in the modern context that

529
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:29.699
gen context that generally means working in a job.

530
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.930
Um Obviously the same with water with disease. Obviously,

531
00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:35.319
we need to practice like regular hygiene and things

532
00:28:35.329 --> 00:28:37.739
like this and be wary about the environments or

533
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:42.040
people we surround ourselves with. Um So there are

534
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.839
those asymmetries, obviously, there's a, there's a, there's a

535
00:28:43.849 --> 00:28:46.910
few others. Um So there's also an as asymmetry

536
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.530
of like injury can perform us very quickly or

537
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.300
we can lose knowledge very quickly with a blow

538
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.339
over the head. But generally, um if we're gonna

539
00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:56.609
recover from an injury that often takes a lot

540
00:28:56.619 --> 00:29:00.310
longer than sustaining the injury, accumulating knowledge takes a

541
00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:03.640
lot longer than our ability to lose it. Like

542
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.459
if, if you don't actively put effort into revising

543
00:29:07.469 --> 00:29:10.650
things and remembering things, you can just forget things.

544
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.349
You can put, like many of us can probably

545
00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:15.849
relate to this idea of like in the past,

546
00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:18.300
maybe 1015 years ago, we used to be really

547
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.530
knowledgeable about a specific thing and we used to

548
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.739
know all the facts and figures around it and

549
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.010
just the fact that we, we don't retain that

550
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.689
knowledge. It's not like once we get it, it's

551
00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:29.040
there over time, you lose it and you have

552
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.250
to actively um put effort into revising your knowledge

553
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.420
and updating your knowledge to, to maintain that. Um

554
00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:39.510
Yeah, and, and, and there's, you know, there's a

555
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.810
few other things in there, but it kind of

556
00:29:40.819 --> 00:29:42.459
strays off the topic to relate it to anti

557
00:29:42.569 --> 00:29:48.380
Natal though. I think the, the pessimistic evaluation of,

558
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.760
of, of human life and it being subjective, I

559
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.400
think it is important to anti natal cos it's

560
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.719
part of what informs us, viewing coming into existence

561
00:29:59.729 --> 00:30:02.400
as a harm, you know, if life was so

562
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.349
amazing. Um, AND it was extremely hard to understand

563
00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.609
it in a way that was pessimistic. Then maybe

564
00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:11.709
the case for anti Natal would, would be much

565
00:30:11.719 --> 00:30:18.069
weaker. Um The, but I'm I'm hesitant that doesn't

566
00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:21.050
mean that it's as relevant for us who already

567
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.410
exist. So some of us actually get meaning from

568
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.000
studying philosophical pessimism and we find it relatable and

569
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.420
we enjoy discussing it and reading about it. But

570
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.260
whether we should be going out and trying to

571
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.150
convince people of philosophical pessimism in, in that, you

572
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.979
know, you should evaluate your life to be much

573
00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:42.260
worse than it actually is, that would probably do

574
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.219
more harm to that person than benefit. The, the

575
00:30:46.229 --> 00:30:48.979
one benefit that could come obviously is that they

576
00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:51.479
may, they may have a more rational sort of

577
00:30:51.489 --> 00:30:54.040
approach to understanding the human condition or rational as

578
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.489
I see it anyway. And so that would maybe

579
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.930
reduce the chances that they'd bring other people into

580
00:30:58.939 --> 00:31:03.140
existence. Um But yeah, in terms of like getting

581
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.699
everyone to be a pessimist, I'm not sure that's

582
00:31:05.709 --> 00:31:08.000
the best way to go because, you know, probably

583
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:11.250
lead to more people having uh less good lives.

584
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.969
But yeah,

585
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.469
yeah, I was also thinking that when advocating for

586
00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:19.709
anti Natal is, or for example, if you are

587
00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:24.510
on the street approaching people to tell them about

588
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.260
anti Natal, I mean, one reaction that I see

589
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.439
a lot is I if you tell people or

590
00:31:32.449 --> 00:31:36.430
if you try to argue that life is objectively

591
00:31:36.619 --> 00:31:39.790
bad, uh I, I mean, there are lots and

592
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.229
lots and lots of people there uh out there

593
00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:46.770
that just don't agree with that at all, they

594
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.790
don't have that kind of experience. And uh I

595
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.670
mean, here it doesn't even matter much. I think

596
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.339
if it's because they are just uh not uh

597
00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:59.109
they are just forgetting more easily, the bad things

598
00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:01.239
that happened in their lives. I mean, like the

599
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.339
Polyana effect and stuff like that or, or if

600
00:32:04.349 --> 00:32:09.359
it's really that they uh or subjectively have experienced

601
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.819
things as mostly good instead of mostly better. A

602
00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:16.829
and uh and I think that it would probably

603
00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:21.209
be better to, instead of trying to uh use

604
00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:25.160
the, the objectivity argument to just tell people, hey,

605
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:31.060
look, whenever someone is born, we're basically tossing a

606
00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:33.890
coin because you don't know where it will land.

607
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.500
But the person can have, for example, depression can

608
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.459
suffer from other kinds of mental illness or have

609
00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:45.530
very, very negative experiences in their life. So, II

610
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.270
I think that that would be more convincing that

611
00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.619
that just tell people that there are many people

612
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.449
out there and this is 100% true for whom

613
00:32:56.459 --> 00:32:59.729
life is not worth it. And they would have

614
00:32:59.739 --> 00:33:03.689
been better not being born even to begin with.

615
00:33:03.699 --> 00:33:03.930
So,

616
00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:08.930
yeah, I, I, so, yeah, that, that's basically sort

617
00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:10.930
of, uh, the risk argument that you'd bring up

618
00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:14.829
to someone in, in anti natal. Um, AND I,

619
00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:17.300
I agree with you. I've done this when I've,

620
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.599
so, I've, I've had sort of like limited experience

621
00:33:19.609 --> 00:33:23.650
doing outreach on the street around anti Natal. And,

622
00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:26.130
yeah, of course, you, uh you know, a lot

623
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.410
of the people you will come across. Um, YOU

624
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.270
know, I, I do it in central London. A

625
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.949
lot of the people you come across. Yeah. Will

626
00:33:32.959 --> 00:33:35.640
not have the same experience of life as, you

627
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:40.640
know, maybe either of us. Right. So, um, but

628
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.119
basically everyone knows someone who's had quite a bad

629
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.280
life or they're at least aware of the fact

630
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.160
that some people around the world or many people

631
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.560
around the world will have bad lives. Um, PERSONALLY

632
00:33:54.569 --> 00:33:58.579
I haven't met anyone that hasn't acknowledged that. Um

633
00:33:58.589 --> 00:34:01.359
And so then, yeah, you can put, like you

634
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:03.719
said, you can put forward to them. Well, given

635
00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:06.319
the fact that with every new generation we create,

636
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.159
obviously the child, you create, you're creating, being part

637
00:34:09.168 --> 00:34:12.188
of that. Some of those are going to bear

638
00:34:12.197 --> 00:34:16.779
the burden of those really bad lives so that

639
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.829
you can create all the others that are gonna

640
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:21.079
have good lives that, you know, they never existed

641
00:34:21.089 --> 00:34:23.728
to one in the first place. But, um, the

642
00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:28.139
only time, oh, not the only time but the,

643
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:30.280
the main push back I get on on that

644
00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:35.569
is the, is, is generally from a religious perspective.

645
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.049
So often if I'm talking to someone who's an

646
00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:41.978
atheist or just more secular minded they will recognize.

647
00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:44.559
Yeah. Ok. Yeah. You know, when you're procreating you

648
00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:50.199
are taking a risk. Um, BUT when I've spoken

649
00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:56.830
to, um, religious people and at Speaker's corner where

650
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.610
myself and some others have done some anti natal

651
00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:04.659
outreach, it's, it's quite heavily dominated by religious people,

652
00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:08.159
predominantly Muslims. But there are Christians and, and Jews.

653
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.659
Um, BUT when I speak to people from those

654
00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:17.159
religious perspectives, es especially Islamic preachers. Um, WHAT they

655
00:35:17.169 --> 00:35:20.530
tend to say in those cases is that, well,

656
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.760
those people who have very bad lives, um, the,

657
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.870
it's still a benefit to them because they're living

658
00:35:26.879 --> 00:35:28.580
in God's image. You know, they're basking in the

659
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.629
glow of God. Um, AND I, if, if, even

660
00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:33.189
if they have bad life, if they die as

661
00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:35.340
Children, they're gonna go to heaven anyway. You know,

662
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.320
there's a lot of sort of glorification of the

663
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.879
death of Children, which I've said to them. Like,

664
00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:41.439
look, if you get to a point where the

665
00:35:41.449 --> 00:35:44.719
ideology you follow glorifies the death of Children, maybe

666
00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:49.060
you wanna reconsider. Um But, yeah, I found in

667
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.070
a religious context, even the acknowledgement that some lives

668
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.800
are bad that doesn't tend to hold any sway.

669
00:35:54.949 --> 00:35:56.500
But I think then you're in a whole another

670
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.919
ballpark cos you've gotta then convince someone that, you

671
00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:03.590
know, the, the re, the sort of whole reality

672
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.060
of the universe as they understand it is, is,

673
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.179
is not the case. Um And that's obviously very

674
00:36:09.189 --> 00:36:11.110
difficult to do and that's a separate conversation you've

675
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.800
gotta have with them.

676
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.070
Yeah. Sure. Uh And I mean, I was also

677
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.050
mentioning that or trying to tackle that issue, let's

678
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.229
say because it seems to me pretty obvious that

679
00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:26.449
for some people it's mu it's much easier for

680
00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:29.580
them to when they come in contact with Antenatal

681
00:36:29.649 --> 00:36:32.280
is accept it right away because of their own

682
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.649
personal experiences because of the, the way they experience

683
00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:38.370
life because they have gone through a lot of

684
00:36:38.379 --> 00:36:41.179
bad things in life or they suffer from an

685
00:36:41.189 --> 00:36:45.929
illness, something like that. Then someone for whom, when

686
00:36:45.939 --> 00:36:49.370
she or he thinks about their own life, they

687
00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:52.020
look at it as mostly positive. I mean, when

688
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.469
they are confronted with an argument, like life is

689
00:36:55.479 --> 00:37:00.239
objectively bad or there's objectively more pain than pleasure

690
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.110
in life. I mean, that they're just not going

691
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.199
to accept it because they, they're going to say,

692
00:37:05.209 --> 00:37:08.310
ok, that might be true for some people, but

693
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.070
it's not for me. So it

694
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.469
doesn't accord with their experience of reality.

695
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.270
Yeah. So let me ask you now about uh

696
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.959
death because, uh I know also that there are

697
00:37:20.969 --> 00:37:25.169
different views on death among anti natal lists. I

698
00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:29.530
mean, the way that you relate to pro moralism,

699
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.830
for example. But what, uh, what is your idea

700
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.909
on it? Uh, WHAT are your ideas on it?

701
00:37:35.919 --> 00:37:39.030
Because I guess that, uh, another thing that I

702
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.179
also got recently when talking about Antenatal is with,

703
00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:46.939
with another person is that who, who, at a

704
00:37:46.949 --> 00:37:50.399
certain point she told me and she accepts Antenatal.

705
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.219
But then she asked me, oh, but why is

706
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:57.179
it then that Ben Naar and other people say

707
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.360
that death is a harm? I mean, if life

708
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.830
is so bad, why is death a harm? Basically,

709
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.419
that was the question she posed to me. So

710
00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:09.260
what would be your answer?

711
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.399
Yeah. So I've got uh before I answer this

712
00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:15.820
question, I, I've, I've gotta say that this is

713
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:18.120
like a topic that is still open to me.

714
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.409
I don't fully, I don't fully know how I

715
00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:24.540
view death and I wanna be uh honest and

716
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.840
open about that because um I, I, I'm still,

717
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.159
I'm sort of pulled in both directions of because

718
00:38:33.169 --> 00:38:36.760
I view death as as bad and a harm.

719
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.899
But I find it hard to understand if I'm

720
00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:43.620
making that evaluation based on death itself or the

721
00:38:43.629 --> 00:38:46.870
things that surround death, like the suffering of the

722
00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:49.489
dying process, the grieving that others do and stuff

723
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.110
like that. And I'm still trying to understand in

724
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.449
my mind if I can separate those, those two

725
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:57.860
things out which I think you can do philosophically,

726
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.830
but I'm trying to understand my own, my own

727
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.649
beliefs on it. So, at the moment I still,

728
00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:05.250
yeah, I still view death as, as a, as

729
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.050
a, as a harm as a bad thing. Um,

730
00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:13.770
AND I think for the ease of communication, um,

731
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.979
I sort of, I mean, e even though that

732
00:39:16.989 --> 00:39:19.340
is what I believe, at least currently when I'd

733
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.129
be communicating anti natal to someone, I think in

734
00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:25.229
like if I'm talking to the average person on

735
00:39:25.239 --> 00:39:27.969
the street, I would still communicate in such a

736
00:39:27.979 --> 00:39:31.459
way where if death comes up, I would, I

737
00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.850
would take the position of death being a harm

738
00:39:33.899 --> 00:39:35.840
because I think that is the average view that

739
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.709
someone takes. And I don't think it's useful in

740
00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:42.139
a conversation about anti Natal is when you're trying

741
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:44.969
to convince them about that one topic to muddy

742
00:39:44.979 --> 00:39:50.290
the waters by introducing other controversial or even more

743
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.530
controversial views. Um But in terms of what the

744
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.590
person you were talking to said about, well, if

745
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.600
life is so bad, then why, why is death

746
00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.090
a harm? I can understand, um, what she's saying

747
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.689
and life can be so bad that like I

748
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.850
said, someone may be better off dead, right? I

749
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.909
don't think that necessarily means that I don't think

750
00:40:12.919 --> 00:40:15.639
that just making an evaluation that life is bad

751
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.110
necessarily means that death isn't a harm. It could

752
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.459
just be a lesser harm than continuing existing. So

753
00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:26.379
you can still think that life is awful and

754
00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:29.159
death is better, but it doesn't mean that death

755
00:40:29.169 --> 00:40:32.360
isn't also a harm. Um, ALSO, obviously you've got

756
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.120
to take into account that the bad things in

757
00:40:35.129 --> 00:40:37.659
life can be spread out. So I do think

758
00:40:37.669 --> 00:40:39.989
there are certain things in life that are bad

759
00:40:40.129 --> 00:40:43.280
that are pretty consistent all the way through life,

760
00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:48.110
but there are particularly bad things that can or

761
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.719
will happen to people in life that are concentrated

762
00:40:51.729 --> 00:40:54.510
in, in, in particular periods of life. Often they

763
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.550
can be towards the, you know, the elderly years,

764
00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.239
but they can be other things as well. You

765
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.540
know, if someone goes through a period of, of

766
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.149
deep depression, that may not necessarily be a, uh,

767
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:07.330
you know, uh your age may not be relevant

768
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.949
to that. So it could happen anywhere in your

769
00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:10.689
life. You know, there are the Children that, that

770
00:41:10.699 --> 00:41:16.280
affliction happens to adults, more elderly people. Um So

771
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.830
I can understand the sort of question that the

772
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.810
person you were talking to, um, like where that's

773
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.929
coming from. But I think it's a slight misunderstanding

774
00:41:25.939 --> 00:41:30.770
of, of the fact that you can hold one

775
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.689
situation ie existence is very bad, but also that,

776
00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:38.969
um, and, and that death is better, but also

777
00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:41.320
recognizing that that death is a harm as well.

778
00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:43.199
Um But yeah, to bring it back to my

779
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.850
own views. Uh Yeah, at the moment I view

780
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.179
death as a harm. I haven't quite figured out

781
00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:51.679
my intricate views on it. Um, BUT yeah, that,

782
00:41:51.689 --> 00:41:52.860
that's my sort of overview.

783
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.679
But do you think that that is a harm?

784
00:41:56.689 --> 00:42:00.030
But do you think it's also a harm if

785
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:05.649
someone decides for herself, that death is the better

786
00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:08.129
way? I mean, that they just want to, to

787
00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:11.919
exit life because it's unbearable or something like that.

788
00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:14.320
I mean, do you think that, uh, I, I

789
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.280
understand that tendency that most people have to think

790
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:23.270
that, oh, if that person suffered so much that

791
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.260
they wanted to do when their life and they

792
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.949
thought it would be better to not exist anymore,

793
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.435
then there's something wrong about even about the debt

794
00:42:32.445 --> 00:42:35.554
itself. It doesn't sound right also because we are

795
00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:37.794
living beings, of course, and we have this sort

796
00:42:37.804 --> 00:42:42.074
of instinct to continue on living. But uh but

797
00:42:42.084 --> 00:42:45.754
would you say that if someone said, oh, look,

798
00:42:45.764 --> 00:42:48.584
I, I was here for, I've been here for,

799
00:42:48.594 --> 00:42:51.455
I don't know many, how many years and uh

800
00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:54.145
I've experienced this, that this and that and they

801
00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:57.120
have these and that kind of problem. So, uh

802
00:42:57.169 --> 00:43:00.679
for me, I think it's better to just not

803
00:43:00.689 --> 00:43:04.310
exist anymore to, I don't know, commit suicide or

804
00:43:04.439 --> 00:43:08.239
seek medical help in the form of euthanasia or

805
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.909
something like that. So, in that specific case, would

806
00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:14.679
you still say that death is a harm or?

807
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.669
Yeah. So the first thing I want to say

808
00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:21.689
is that um identifying death as a harm doesn't

809
00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:26.379
necessarily mean that you would always advise people against

810
00:43:26.389 --> 00:43:29.919
it, of course. But yeah, in, in that, in

811
00:43:29.929 --> 00:43:33.050
that instance, I do get what you mean. It's

812
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.870
sort of difficult to see death as a harm

813
00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:40.179
because at least in that instance, it seems like

814
00:43:40.189 --> 00:43:42.209
it would be the only thing that can release

815
00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:45.330
you from the bad situation you're in. Um And

816
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.800
especially if you're able to seek um m medical

817
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.979
assistance in, in, in dying, you know, like assisted

818
00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:58.739
dying or euthanasia. Um And you're able to achieve

819
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.219
an end of life that is painless. And you,

820
00:44:01.229 --> 00:44:03.139
you know, you essentially like drift to sleep and

821
00:44:03.149 --> 00:44:05.389
just never wake up. It is hard to see

822
00:44:05.399 --> 00:44:07.860
how that could be a harm. I guess the

823
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.550
on the only thing I could say in support

824
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.179
of it being a harm is that presumably if

825
00:44:15.189 --> 00:44:21.800
the individual were um able to, of course, th

826
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.239
this is a hypothetical, this is not like gonna

827
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.989
happen in reality or I don't know, maybe there

828
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.139
are some instances, but if someone is in a

829
00:44:28.149 --> 00:44:31.530
terrible situation where they see death as the only

830
00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:36.919
practical way out, if, if someone like that were

831
00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:40.719
able to very easily change their conditions such that

832
00:44:40.729 --> 00:44:43.070
they would then pivot to having quite a good

833
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.840
life and move on from the situation they're in.

834
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.540
I would presume that at least some of the

835
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.689
people would take that option over ending their life.

836
00:44:52.949 --> 00:44:55.469
Um Because bo both of those options would release

837
00:44:55.479 --> 00:44:58.860
you from the current suffering condition you're in. Um,

838
00:44:59.919 --> 00:45:04.010
SO I guess in that way, if, if there

839
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.179
is an option that would be taken by someone,

840
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.169
but it's not available to them and death is

841
00:45:10.179 --> 00:45:12.689
the only option. And that's why they're taking death.

842
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.169
Then perhaps we could still see death as a

843
00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:17.649
harm as it's sort of like they are, they

844
00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:20.969
are taking it maybe even enthusiastically, but it's under

845
00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:26.070
coercive conditions, I guess, Um, not coercive from another

846
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.969
person, but just coercive from the sort of nature

847
00:45:27.979 --> 00:45:30.800
of their existence at that point in time. But

848
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.969
yeah, I'll have to think about it more. I,

849
00:45:32.979 --> 00:45:35.169
if, if death is a harm in that specific

850
00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:37.350
condition cos may maybe, yeah, maybe it wouldn't make

851
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.820
sense to, to call it a harm. I'd have,

852
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.429
yeah, I'd have to, I'd have to think about

853
00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:42.050
it some more.

854
00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:45.280
Yeah. Uh, AND let me ask you about another

855
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.719
kind of argument that many times antenatal lists bring

856
00:45:48.729 --> 00:45:51.899
to the table. And actually this one, at least

857
00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:55.899
in my perspective is one of the most compelling

858
00:45:55.909 --> 00:45:58.800
arguments. What do you think about the argument based

859
00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.479
on consent? I mean, the idea that we can't

860
00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:07.000
really get consent from, for example, the fetus before,

861
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.959
before it is born, we can't really ask the

862
00:46:09.969 --> 00:46:12.975
fees or the baby you want to be born

863
00:46:12.985 --> 00:46:15.054
or not. Do you want to have a life

864
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:17.135
or that time? Do you want to, to exist

865
00:46:17.145 --> 00:46:20.425
or not? Uh, DO you think that that's, uh,

866
00:46:20.435 --> 00:46:23.614
tends to be a strong argument. Do you have

867
00:46:23.625 --> 00:46:28.135
any experience, for example, uh, using that argument when

868
00:46:28.145 --> 00:46:32.215
talking with someone who is not convinced by anti

869
00:46:32.385 --> 00:46:33.304
Natal is more?

870
00:46:34.114 --> 00:46:37.145
Yeah. So personally, I, I do find that argument

871
00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:40.435
convincing, um, as, as, as well as the others

872
00:46:40.445 --> 00:46:45.350
we've spoken about in terms of it being convincing

873
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.709
to other people that I've sort of spoken to

874
00:46:47.719 --> 00:46:53.919
about it. I think if someone is already relatively

875
00:46:53.929 --> 00:46:55.820
open to anti natal is as a, as a

876
00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:01.830
general idea or viewpoint, um they tend to find,

877
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.860
they tend to find the consent point also convincing.

878
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.850
I wouldn't say that I have had many conversations

879
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.899
with people where they've not been convinced by multiple

880
00:47:13.909 --> 00:47:16.280
arguments for anti Natal is, and then I present

881
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:17.939
the consent one and they're like, oh, ok, that

882
00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:21.530
one's convinced me, generally, someone is either sympathetic to

883
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.429
the position or not and the consent argument is

884
00:47:24.439 --> 00:47:27.199
just sort of like an additional argument to convince

885
00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:30.300
them. But I haven't found that if someone is

886
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.139
generally not sympathetic to anti Natal, they then find

887
00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:37.649
the consent argument specifically convincing. Maybe there are some

888
00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:42.439
philosophers that um that, that are like that because

889
00:47:42.449 --> 00:47:45.080
they're thinking about it in, in a philosophical way

890
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.179
and they sort of find the nuances of the

891
00:47:47.189 --> 00:47:49.979
consent argument much more convincing. But if you're talking

892
00:47:49.989 --> 00:47:52.439
to or in my experience, talking to an average

893
00:47:52.449 --> 00:47:54.820
person on the street, I don't think the consent

894
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.479
argument has any particular power o or sort of

895
00:47:57.489 --> 00:48:01.560
influence over people that any of the other arguments

896
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:06.899
um uh may not have. Um, THAT being said,

897
00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:13.209
um One, there are sort of like two misunderstandings

898
00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:16.090
that I found like very people have uh quite

899
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.479
commonly about the consent argument. The first is that

900
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.219
people sort of rubbish the argument by saying, oh,

901
00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:26.399
well, this is a non point because they don't

902
00:48:26.409 --> 00:48:28.350
exist to be able to get consent from them.

903
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.030
So it's, it doesn't make sense to talk about

904
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.540
consent, which for me, I've never understood that. Push

905
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.100
back because that's the whole point is the fact

906
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.889
that they don't exist for you to get consent

907
00:48:38.899 --> 00:48:41.360
from them is the whole point. So referring to

908
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:42.810
that as a way to push back to the

909
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.050
argument, but that, that is the argument. Um SO

910
00:48:47.909 --> 00:48:51.169
the like whether or not an individual exists, if

911
00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:53.530
you're going to do something that will impact them

912
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.290
directly and significantly, and you can't gain consent beforehand,

913
00:48:57.969 --> 00:49:00.540
just like if someone is asleep at a party

914
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.909
and they're passed out, you know, you can't perform

915
00:49:03.919 --> 00:49:06.300
a sexual act on them. Even though in that

916
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:10.010
case, they do exist, you still can't attain consent

917
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.389
from them because they're unconscious, right? And so whether

918
00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:18.550
or not, you know, that person is passed out

919
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.830
of the party or they're a newborn baby, and

920
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.800
obviously they can't give consent cos they're a newborn

921
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.580
baby and they can't communicate in any meaningful way

922
00:49:25.689 --> 00:49:28.649
or even understand the concept of consent or if

923
00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:30.629
an individual doesn't exist at the point in time

924
00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:32.889
you're talking about if you're gonna do something that's

925
00:49:32.899 --> 00:49:38.590
gonna significantly impact them. Like for example, if I

926
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.290
have a newborn baby in front of me and

927
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.129
I sign ad ad a, a document saying that

928
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.810
it's OK to perform a circumcision on them. Personally,

929
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.540
I would, I would view that as unethical cos

930
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.010
you can't get the baby's consent. It doesn't matter

931
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.250
if you're signing that document when the baby already

932
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.219
exists or hasn't been born yet because you know

933
00:49:57.229 --> 00:49:59.889
that the circumcision will happen to them once they

934
00:49:59.899 --> 00:50:03.750
exist. So to say, if someone were to come

935
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.939
up to me and say, oh, well, it, you

936
00:50:04.949 --> 00:50:06.850
know, you can fill in that form, it's fine.

937
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.550
It doesn't make sense to talk about a baby

938
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.550
and consent cos the baby isn't born yet that

939
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.139
misses the forest for the trees because the impact

940
00:50:13.149 --> 00:50:15.929
that will happen, that is not consented to will

941
00:50:15.939 --> 00:50:21.050
happen once they exist. Um Then another thing I

942
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.489
find that people misunderstand is that they sort of

943
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.610
assu well, maybe it's not a misunderstanding, but it's

944
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.899
a push back that I think isn't valid. Is

945
00:50:29.909 --> 00:50:32.449
that many people will say, OK, well, we can't

946
00:50:32.459 --> 00:50:35.429
secure consent from someone to bring them into existence.

947
00:50:36.419 --> 00:50:39.000
But you know, the majority of people, once they

948
00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.989
have been brought into existence, they tend to look

949
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.510
back on being brought into existence as like, they're

950
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.439
glad they were born. Right. And so they sort

951
00:50:45.449 --> 00:50:49.590
of give retrospective consent. I don't find that convincing

952
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.050
because I've actually just released a video about this

953
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.469
on Stockholm Syndrome. I think once people are brought

954
00:50:55.479 --> 00:50:59.110
into existence, they suffer from all manner of biases

955
00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:03.429
that can lead them to accept a state of

956
00:51:03.439 --> 00:51:09.290
affairs where, um, where I, I think they shouldn't,

957
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.489
or at least the consent they're giving is highly

958
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:17.850
tainted by biases or, you know, uh rela a

959
00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.330
relationship to the person you've, that's brought you into

960
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.090
existence, which means you can't sort of make them

961
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.840
a, a rational assessment of, of the circumstances. Um

962
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:31.560
And uh there's an example given by Heta Hari

963
00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:35.379
um in a book called I think it's called

964
00:51:35.389 --> 00:51:38.199
the Limits of paternalism. I, I reference it in

965
00:51:38.209 --> 00:51:40.649
the video I've just made on Stockholm Syndrome. And

966
00:51:40.659 --> 00:51:44.209
basically, she says, if we're to accept this idea

967
00:51:44.219 --> 00:51:47.580
that people can, um we can do something to

968
00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.300
an individual as long as once it all comes

969
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:53.229
out in the wash, they retrospectively consent to it.

970
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.899
Well, that means that the government could just breed

971
00:51:55.909 --> 00:51:58.500
people into facilities and trade them as some sort

972
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.020
of radical. As long as part of the training

973
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.060
is to accept the condition that the government has

974
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.500
put you in right now. None of us would

975
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.330
look at this situation and think that is ethical

976
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.510
for the government to do. But if we're to

977
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.149
accept this base this, this standard of, well, if

978
00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:15.570
someone retrospectively consents to something, even after there's been

979
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:20.070
all manner of intoxicating influences, like, you know, indoctrination.

980
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.149
Well, like if we're to accept that as the

981
00:52:23.159 --> 00:52:25.429
standard, then we've got to accept the government being

982
00:52:25.439 --> 00:52:29.590
able to do things, things like this. Um So

983
00:52:29.889 --> 00:52:32.350
yeah, I, I don't find the idea of retrospective

984
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.469
consent uh particularly convincing. Um AL also just because,

985
00:52:37.479 --> 00:52:39.989
and I, and I've done a video even on,

986
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.030
on this idea of like the fact that most

987
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.750
people are glad to be born doesn't mean that

988
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.149
we can bring more people into existence. But it's

989
00:52:46.159 --> 00:52:49.219
just the fact that if you don't create them,

990
00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:51.500
there's no one missing out on the life that

991
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.479
they would have consented to anyway if you get

992
00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:57.820
what I mean? Um So yeah, that's, yeah, that's

993
00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:58.620
what I'd say to that.

994
00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:01.689
Yeah. And on that point, I totally agree with

995
00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:05.050
you that even when people react negatively to the

996
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.790
argument and they say, oh yeah, but you can

997
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.429
really talk about consent from someone who can't give

998
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.909
consent to her because she doesn't exist yet or

999
00:53:14.919 --> 00:53:18.750
something like that because that's the point, right? That's

1000
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.590
what we're, we're saying when you use that argument.

1001
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.310
Yeah, they're just repeating the argument back to us

1002
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.120
rather than actually making uh a sort of counter

1003
00:53:27.209 --> 00:53:27.760
argument. Yeah.

1004
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.239
So we, we've already gone through, I mean, some

1005
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.909
of the most common arguments that anti Natal lists

1006
00:53:35.919 --> 00:53:40.139
use to advocate for anti Natal. Do you think

1007
00:53:40.149 --> 00:53:42.860
that there are, or, or, or not? You think

1008
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:44.780
that there are? But what would you say are

1009
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.590
perhaps some of the most compelling arguments you've ever

1010
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.080
heard against anti NATO?

1011
00:53:52.969 --> 00:53:59.110
So I've never heard for me, I've never found

1012
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.729
any of the philanthropic arguments put against anti Natal

1013
00:54:03.739 --> 00:54:07.000
is convincing. So, just for anyone that's listening, that

1014
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.850
maybe doesn't understand what that means. So d generally,

1015
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.040
this isn't always the case, but generally people tend

1016
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.000
to break down arguments for or against anti Natal

1017
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:20.189
as sort of philanthropic or misanthropic philanthropic. Meaning the

1018
00:54:20.199 --> 00:54:23.449
argument is concerning the individual you're bringing into existence.

1019
00:54:23.729 --> 00:54:27.590
And misanthropic mean is essentially the impact of the

1020
00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.989
person you're bringing into existence, whether that's good or

1021
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.870
bad. Um So the arguments we've been covering have,

1022
00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:37.330
have all been philanthropic, but a misanthropic argument could

1023
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.179
be, for example, if you're gonna, if you're gonna

1024
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:44.189
create a human being, they are likely going to

1025
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.739
um consume, you know, many animals over the course

1026
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.790
of their life and this is gonna create, you

1027
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.469
know, much suffering. Um There are a range of

1028
00:54:53.479 --> 00:54:56.689
misanthropic arguments, but that, that's just an example. So

1029
00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:01.659
I've never heard a philanthropic argument against anti Natal

1030
00:55:01.909 --> 00:55:06.179
that has been convincing. The only arguments I've fo

1031
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.010
the only arguments I've come across that have given

1032
00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:14.620
me hesitation have been uh misanthropic ones about uh

1033
00:55:14.629 --> 00:55:17.659
e essentially making the case in it. And there's

1034
00:55:17.669 --> 00:55:20.010
a sort of a variety of flavors that this

1035
00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.830
will come in. But the basic point it's making

1036
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.469
is that if anti natal lists had their way

1037
00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.129
and we started to genuinely convince people to have

1038
00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:33.340
less Children, the wor the world would, we wouldn't,

1039
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.889
it's not practical that we would reach the anti

1040
00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:39.550
natal ideal of extinction. We would likely just make

1041
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.439
the world a worse place. And there are a

1042
00:55:41.449 --> 00:55:44.229
whole variety of reasons that they give for that.

1043
00:55:44.239 --> 00:55:48.110
It could be that more, you know, empathetic or

1044
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.750
more intelligent people are gonna adopt anti Natal, which

1045
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.260
I don't necessarily think is the case. But if

1046
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:55.889
that, if that were the case, then it's gonna

1047
00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:57.790
mean that, you know, that the world left behind

1048
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.320
is going to be run by people who are

1049
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:04.229
more callous and maybe less intelligent. Um Another one

1050
00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:07.870
is if, if Antenatal gets its way humans go

1051
00:56:07.879 --> 00:56:11.310
extinct or just have a massively reduced population, then

1052
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.830
uh wild animals will increase in number and, and

1053
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.149
there will be much more suffering in, in, in

1054
00:56:17.159 --> 00:56:21.860
the world. Um Now, of course, there are a

1055
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:27.179
whole sort of variety of assumptions that are made

1056
00:56:27.189 --> 00:56:30.260
by those arguments. People may see them as reasonable

1057
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:35.149
or unreasonable. Um I, I'm not saying I'm convinced

1058
00:56:35.159 --> 00:56:37.399
by those arguments, you know, obviously I'm still an

1059
00:56:37.409 --> 00:56:41.729
anti Natal, but I'm just saying that were if,

1060
00:56:42.689 --> 00:56:47.469
if one were to find II I, if you

1061
00:56:47.479 --> 00:56:51.090
were to the assumptions that those arguments make, which

1062
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.870
I actually think some of the argument, some of

1063
00:56:52.879 --> 00:56:54.500
the assumptions may be true. Some of them uh

1064
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:58.449
may be less well founded. Um If they were

1065
00:56:58.459 --> 00:57:02.709
to be true, then that argument that overall we're

1066
00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.939
just making the world a worse place by, by

1067
00:57:04.949 --> 00:57:09.199
preaching this philosophy that has given me some hesitation.

1068
00:57:09.209 --> 00:57:10.929
It hasn't gotten me to the point where, like

1069
00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:14.280
I'm gonna stop advocating for it or I'm, you

1070
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:16.550
know, going to have Children of my own or

1071
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.520
not be an anti natal. But they've just, they've

1072
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.949
given me hesitation and, and I've needed to think

1073
00:57:21.959 --> 00:57:27.810
about it. Um And the philanthropic arguments that have

1074
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.100
been put forward. Ob obviously I've thought about them

1075
00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:33.050
but, you know, I'm cos otherwise it would just

1076
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.489
be me ignoring them, but I've not found any

1077
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.250
of them to give me r like real pause

1078
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:45.379
for thought. But the misanthropic ones, um Yeah, they,

1079
00:57:45.389 --> 00:57:47.639
they, they've, they've given me more hesitation.

1080
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.040
Yeah. So, uh now for a bit of a

1081
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:56.899
thought experiment, let's say that someone approached you and

1082
00:57:56.909 --> 00:58:00.139
she told you, look, I have a button here

1083
00:58:00.149 --> 00:58:03.699
with me. If you press it, it, it will

1084
00:58:03.709 --> 00:58:06.040
be as if you never existed. I mean, you

1085
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:10.090
will be wiped off existence and it would be

1086
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:14.000
as if you never even existed. Everything related to

1087
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.239
you and all of that you will cease to

1088
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:20.209
exist. But uh everything related with every, everything that

1089
00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:23.389
you did, every person you interacted with, no one

1090
00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:25.770
will remember you. It will be as if you

1091
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.199
never existed to begin with. Do you think you

1092
00:58:29.209 --> 00:58:30.379
would press the button?

1093
00:58:30.969 --> 00:58:33.110
It's extremely hard to answer the question in a

1094
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.310
rational way because given the fact that I exist

1095
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.919
to press the button, I will be imagining in

1096
00:58:38.929 --> 00:58:40.830
my head that it's basically a button that kills

1097
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.580
me. Um, SO it, it's, it's, it's very hard

1098
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:47.669
to, so I don't know how to answer the

1099
00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:49.820
question, but I'll answer it. It, it, I'll answer

1100
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.229
it in a, in a slightly different way that,

1101
00:58:52.889 --> 00:58:56.929
yeah. So I, I find, I, I'm sure you're

1102
00:58:56.939 --> 00:58:59.610
aware of Amil Sharon. Uh, HE, you know that

1103
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.149
he's sort of anti natal, sort of pessimist. Yeah.

1104
00:59:02.159 --> 00:59:06.300
Yeah. So there's a quote from him which resonates

1105
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.280
with me a lot, which is something along the

1106
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:12.179
lines of, um, I do not hate life nor

1107
00:59:12.189 --> 00:59:15.850
do I desire death. I just regret being born.

1108
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.830
And that really resonates with me because I, I,

1109
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.929
at least at the moment don't hate my life.

1110
00:59:22.939 --> 00:59:26.419
I have AAA pretty reasonable standard of living. Um,

1111
00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.370
AND I enjoy my life and I'm, I'm very

1112
00:59:28.379 --> 00:59:30.709
lucky in that respect cos I realize that many

1113
00:59:30.719 --> 00:59:34.899
people today and throughout history, in fact, probably most

1114
00:59:34.909 --> 00:59:37.889
people have not been in that, in that situation.

1115
00:59:37.899 --> 00:59:41.360
I'm in a first world country with ample resources

1116
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:42.860
at my disposal. I, you know, I'm not rich

1117
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:45.139
or anything but I, I have like a supermarket

1118
00:59:45.149 --> 00:59:47.139
down the road. How many people in history have

1119
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:48.649
been able to say they have a supermarket down,

1120
00:59:48.659 --> 00:59:51.010
down the road and access to a modern healthcare

1121
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.000
system and stuff. So, um, I'm in a pretty

1122
00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.760
good situation at the moment. Obviously things could change.

1123
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.120
But, yeah, I don't, I don't hate life and

1124
00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:02.139
I don't, like, actively want my life to end.

1125
01:00:02.149 --> 01:00:04.520
I don't desire death, which is why it's hard

1126
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.389
to answer that question about the button because it,

1127
01:00:07.399 --> 01:00:08.939
it, it, it's, it's sort of given that you

1128
01:00:08.949 --> 01:00:10.639
exist to press it. It's sort of asking you

1129
01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.409
if you'd want to end your life rather than

1130
01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:17.979
never start it. Um But to, to sort of

1131
01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:21.610
answer the question in that, in a philosophical se,

1132
01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:23.169
I don't know what if I would actually press

1133
01:00:23.179 --> 01:00:25.100
the button, but in a philosophical sense, what you're

1134
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.320
trying to get at, I think is, um, you

1135
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.379
know, would you prefer not to have been born?

1136
01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:32.780
Ie would you press the button in that case?

1137
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.399
Yes, I think it would have been better if

1138
01:00:34.409 --> 01:00:37.699
I'd never come into existence. You better, concerning, concerning

1139
01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:38.870
me. It would have been a good thing that

1140
01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:41.699
I'd have never come into existence. But I think

1141
01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.590
that on like an intellectual level, not on an

1142
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.030
emotional level, like I don't, like I said, lament

1143
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.929
my life I don't constantly think about, I would

1144
01:00:47.939 --> 01:00:50.530
have been better never to have been born. Well,

1145
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.149
actually I do think about that a lot cos

1146
01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:54.850
I run a youtube channel about it, but I

1147
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.189
don't, like, actively think about it in a negative

1148
01:00:57.199 --> 01:01:00.629
way about my own life. Um, BUT I recognize

1149
01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:04.090
that never coming into existence would have been better

1150
01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:06.969
than coming into existence if I can put it

1151
01:01:06.979 --> 01:01:08.969
like that. So, it's sort of like, yes, I'd

1152
01:01:08.979 --> 01:01:11.959
press the button but it would feel very much

1153
01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:15.360
like I would be killing myself rather than never

1154
01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:17.500
coming into existence. But I'd be, I'd be pressing

1155
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.000
it for the, the not being born part of

1156
01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:20.199
it.

1157
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.939
Yeah, I admit that the, this thought experiment is

1158
01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:28.570
a bit weird because I'm asking you if you

1159
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.989
would do something that is not the same as

1160
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.699
death. I mean, it's very weird. We, we would

1161
01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:39.110
even need metaphysically speaking. We would even need a

1162
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.879
new word for this because it, it isn't exactly

1163
01:01:42.889 --> 01:01:45.530
the same as death, but it sounds like that.

1164
01:01:45.659 --> 01:01:48.909
So, uh anyway, let, let me ask you now

1165
01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:53.459
about because as anti natal lists, we are all

1166
01:01:53.469 --> 01:01:58.989
against, uh having kids, against producing new sentient beings.

1167
01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:03.770
Um, HAVE you ever come across an argument put

1168
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.500
forth by Natal list? People, people who are in

1169
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:11.649
favor of having kids that is not based on

1170
01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:13.979
selfishness. Be because I haven't.

1171
01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:17.030
Yeah. Well, I guess it depends what you mean

1172
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.469
by selfishness. So I've come across arguments people have

1173
01:02:23.479 --> 01:02:30.550
made for having Children that down serve to further

1174
01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.419
their own interests. But that doesn't mean I find

1175
01:02:36.429 --> 01:02:39.780
them just because of AAA just because an argument

1176
01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:44.409
isn't selfish, doesn't mean it's convincing obviously. But so

1177
01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:48.320
someone could make an argument about like, you know,

1178
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:54.479
I'm having a child to, um, help prop up

1179
01:02:54.489 --> 01:02:58.840
the welfare system so that elderly people can, you

1180
01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:01.580
know, continue receiving care. Now, maybe you could say

1181
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.120
that's still selfish cos that individual is gonna become

1182
01:03:04.129 --> 01:03:06.050
elderly. So they're propping up a system that they

1183
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.830
will fu in the future benefit from. So maybe

1184
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.550
it is still selfish in a way. Um I

1185
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.850
guess the only, so the answer I'm gonna, the

1186
01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.159
answers I'm gonna give that are ones where I

1187
01:03:20.169 --> 01:03:22.979
don't think they're selfish. Although I still don't think

1188
01:03:22.989 --> 01:03:26.860
that means they're convincing or good arguments are related

1189
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.290
to veganism. There are probably other ones but because

1190
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.070
I move in vegan circles, these are the ones

1191
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.899
that I'm familiar with. So it's quite common for,

1192
01:03:34.909 --> 01:03:38.899
to hear in vegan circles from pro Natal vegans

1193
01:03:38.909 --> 01:03:41.540
that we should have more Children because it will

1194
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.770
help bolster the animal rights movement and make the

1195
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.389
world better for animals. Basically, we can achieve animal

1196
01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:50.979
liberation quicker if, if vegans have lots of Children.

1197
01:03:51.949 --> 01:03:54.629
So whether that is true or not, we'll park

1198
01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:56.689
to the side. Let's just assume that is true

1199
01:03:56.699 --> 01:04:00.320
and then not buying into a delusion but, or,

1200
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:03.760
or buying into a falsehood that I wouldn't say

1201
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.379
is a selfish reason to have a Children. I

1202
01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:07.030
wouldn't say that's a good reason to have a

1203
01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.280
Children, to have Children. But IW, I wouldn't say

1204
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.760
that was a selfish reason because it's not based,

1205
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:15.939
they're not centering the reasons for creating someone around

1206
01:04:15.949 --> 01:04:20.080
their own desires. Um, THEY'RE centering it around trying

1207
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:25.020
to benefit uh uh, another group of individuals. Now

1208
01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:30.080
it's com, it's complicated though because whilst someone may

1209
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:36.070
espouse a reason for creating someone like that deep

1210
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.070
down, it probably is for selfish reasons that they're

1211
01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.909
having the child because it seems pretty ridiculous to

1212
01:04:42.919 --> 01:04:48.250
me for someone who doesn't want Children anyway to

1213
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.129
go, I really don't want Children. It'd be a

1214
01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:53.129
massive inconvenience. This is not what my preferences are,

1215
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.179
but I'm gonna have the kid because I wanna

1216
01:04:55.189 --> 01:04:57.760
save a pig in, in, in a factory farm.

1217
01:04:58.219 --> 01:05:01.760
That probably doesn't happen. I think people will put

1218
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:07.060
forward certain non selfish reasons to have Children on

1219
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.290
t on top, they sort of stack them on

1220
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.639
top of their already existing desire to have a

1221
01:05:11.649 --> 01:05:16.840
child. So I think when people have Children, generally

1222
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:19.409
the f the f the core motivations are always

1223
01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:21.989
selfish, but they may have like a garnish of

1224
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.209
non selfish reasons on top. Um But again, that

1225
01:05:26.219 --> 01:05:28.530
doesn't mean those reasons are convincing. It just, they

1226
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.310
aren't centered around their own interests.

1227
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.979
Yeah. So let's say that I'm a transhumanist and

1228
01:05:34.989 --> 01:05:38.409
I approach you and tell you, look, if we

1229
01:05:38.419 --> 01:05:42.459
wait 200 more years, we will get to a

1230
01:05:42.469 --> 01:05:47.760
point where we've been able to basically solve suffering.

1231
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:50.320
No one is suffering anymore. No one has any

1232
01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:54.985
illnesses, everyone, whatever happens in life, they experience it

1233
01:05:54.995 --> 01:05:58.294
as positive. Do you think that if something like

1234
01:05:58.304 --> 01:06:03.514
that would happen, it would justify uh procreating for

1235
01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:07.645
the next 200 years? And after that, uh life

1236
01:06:07.655 --> 01:06:10.215
would be worth living and you would stop, be

1237
01:06:10.225 --> 01:06:11.635
being an Antenatal.

1238
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:17.479
So personally, I wouldn't, I wouldn't think that justifies

1239
01:06:17.489 --> 01:06:21.699
the procreation just because those future generations didn't need

1240
01:06:21.709 --> 01:06:25.479
to exist in the first place. Um I think

1241
01:06:25.489 --> 01:06:27.280
I, I mean, I'm probably not gonna say anything

1242
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:30.409
new that David Benatar hasn't says, but uh ha

1243
01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:33.550
hasn't said, but obviously, he says that obviously, those

1244
01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.510
intervening generations will go through suffering just to achieve

1245
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.000
a future generation that we should be indifferent to

1246
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.860
creating um cos if they weren't to come into

1247
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:47.090
existence, no one would be deprived or harmed by

1248
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.820
that. Obviously, it's good if they do come into

1249
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:52.810
existence, it's good. They have blissful lives. But in

1250
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.669
my view, that's not a reason to create them.

1251
01:06:54.939 --> 01:06:58.290
The only additional thing I'd say is that utopias

1252
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.250
don't last forever. You can sacrifice those intervening generations

1253
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:06.550
to get to a state where everyone has blissful

1254
01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.250
lives. But there's no guarantee that's gonna last forever.

1255
01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.179
You know, that presumably to in practice, get to

1256
01:07:14.189 --> 01:07:16.770
a state where we all live amazing blissful lives,

1257
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.889
certain forms of genetic manipulation, certain technologies are gonna

1258
01:07:20.899 --> 01:07:25.719
be needed. These things can always be corrupted and

1259
01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:27.620
so we can get to a point where everyone

1260
01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:31.870
has blissful lives. But that doesn't mean history doesn't

1261
01:07:31.879 --> 01:07:33.760
just move one way. You know, we don't just

1262
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:35.620
make progress in one direction and then we reach

1263
01:07:35.629 --> 01:07:38.520
the pinnacle where there's no suffering, we can slip

1264
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:40.840
backwards. And there are many examples in history where

1265
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.979
there has been a slip backwards. And I would

1266
01:07:44.989 --> 01:07:49.489
say, even if, even if you ignore the philanthropic

1267
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.659
stuff or, or, or the stuff that, you know,

1268
01:07:51.729 --> 01:07:53.870
someone like Benatar usually talks about like we should

1269
01:07:53.879 --> 01:07:57.449
be indifferent or we shouldn't sacrifice the intervening generations.

1270
01:07:57.879 --> 01:08:03.469
It's just the fact that like utopian thinking is

1271
01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:07.090
very dangerous, many, many people have been killed and

1272
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.310
tortured because of utopian thinking. And I think this

1273
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.590
is a form of utopian thinking that we, if,

1274
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.360
if only we can just get to this place,

1275
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.189
things will be ok. And I just don't think

1276
01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.310
that's the case. Even if we do get to

1277
01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:23.359
that, that spot, that sweet spot where, where technically

1278
01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:25.620
people aren't harmed by coming into existence cos they

1279
01:08:25.629 --> 01:08:28.679
don't experience any harm. That doesn't mean that that's

1280
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:31.078
guaranteed to, to, to stay that way.

1281
01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:35.359
So I'm going to ask you now about one

1282
01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:38.890
last topic. Something that came to mind my mind

1283
01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:42.660
right now. So what are your thoughts on extinction?

1284
01:08:42.759 --> 01:08:46.009
Is, I mean, do you also advocate for extinction?

1285
01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:48.189
Is what I mean by that? Is that of

1286
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.970
course, if we are anti natal lists and we

1287
01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:55.859
don't want people to reproduce anymore, it will, it,

1288
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.970
it would inevitably lead to the extinction of our

1289
01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:02.620
species. But I I'm asking you apart from that,

1290
01:09:02.629 --> 01:09:05.979
do you look at the potential extinction of our

1291
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:11.180
species and even eventually other sentient beings as something

1292
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.580
good?

1293
01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:16.020
So, so I've I've done, I've actually done a

1294
01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:21.180
video specifically on this. So any videos I've mentioned,

1295
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:22.490
I can maybe send you a link if you

1296
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.770
put them, I don't know if you usually do

1297
01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:25.339
this, but if you want to, you can put

1298
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.160
them in the description. So yeah, and

1299
01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.479
I will also link to your channel in the

1300
01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:29.990
description.

1301
01:09:30.009 --> 01:09:35.069
Yeah, thank you. So, um I think obviously there's,

1302
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.740
there's a strong correlation between someone being an anti

1303
01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:42.120
natal and someone being an extinction and some anti

1304
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:47.700
natal lists sort of um sort of put their

1305
01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:50.669
extinction to extinction is to the forefront of how

1306
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.500
they advocate. So I don't think if you're an

1307
01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:57.580
anti natal, it necessarily means you have to be

1308
01:09:57.589 --> 01:10:01.009
an extinction. Now, one thing I wanna make clear

1309
01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:06.200
is um I think that a universe with no

1310
01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:09.399
sentient life would be the would be the best

1311
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:14.770
universe, but that doesn't mean that that's the universe

1312
01:10:14.779 --> 01:10:17.879
I wanna aim for now just because I think

1313
01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.930
that universe would be better than the universe that

1314
01:10:19.939 --> 01:10:24.419
we're currently in. Like we're now in a universe

1315
01:10:24.629 --> 01:10:27.580
where sentient life exists. And I kind of see

1316
01:10:27.589 --> 01:10:29.680
it as a Pandora's box that's been opened and

1317
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:33.810
it's not gonna go away And so given that

1318
01:10:33.819 --> 01:10:36.100
sentient life already exists, I don't think on a

1319
01:10:36.109 --> 01:10:40.879
practical level or on a philosophical level, an anti

1320
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.609
natal is committed to extinction is I'll start with

1321
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.620
the philosophical level, then I move to the practical.

1322
01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:48.500
So if someone's an anti natal list, it simply

1323
01:10:48.509 --> 01:10:53.830
means that they're against bringing new sentient beings or

1324
01:10:53.839 --> 01:10:56.919
human beings depending on their flavor of antenatal into

1325
01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:01.310
existence. That doesn't mean they want all human or

1326
01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:04.439
sentient beings to go out of existence. I can

1327
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:12.330
imagine a world where humans gain immortality through genetic

1328
01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:16.129
manipulation or some technology. There are certain species of

1329
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:20.229
animal that are biologically immortal, but they can still

1330
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.000
die from disease and stuff. But they just, they

1331
01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:24.879
don't like, they don't age to a point where

1332
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:28.040
they, where they would die. So obviously, it's possible

1333
01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:31.750
and perhaps someday humans will, will sort of engineer

1334
01:11:31.759 --> 01:11:35.600
that into ourselves. If I given I'm an antenatal

1335
01:11:35.609 --> 01:11:37.009
list, I still think it would be wrong to

1336
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.970
bring new humans into existence. But I'm not gonna,

1337
01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.129
I'm not gonna campaign against someone who wants to

1338
01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.310
become immortal. Obviously, if they become immortal and use

1339
01:11:48.319 --> 01:11:51.169
their own mortality to constantly create babies, then we've

1340
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.450
got an issue but just their immortality in itself.

1341
01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:55.919
I've got no issue with it. It's their life,

1342
01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.049
they do with it what they want. And so

1343
01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.529
as long as they're not harming others, so I

1344
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.359
think an anti natal would have no inherent issue

1345
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:07.140
with immortality. But an extinction would, because an extinction

1346
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:10.229
wants the species or all sentient life to be

1347
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.259
gone, which would include not producing any more. And

1348
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:16.629
the ones who already exist need to go away.

1349
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.589
Now, whether that means waiting for them to die

1350
01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.029
or killing them off, that's a question for the

1351
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.910
people who, who hold those positions. But personally, that's

1352
01:12:25.919 --> 01:12:29.629
why I'm not a philosophical extinction because once someone's

1353
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.540
here, if they have autonomy over their own life

1354
01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.950
and they wanna make decisions to prolong their existence,

1355
01:12:35.029 --> 01:12:36.990
I got no issue with that. That's their decision.

1356
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.220
Um And that's not for me to get involved

1357
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:43.549
in. So that's the philosophical side. The practical side.

1358
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:47.589
I don't, personally, I don't think anti Natal lists

1359
01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.129
should be. Um I don't think we should hide

1360
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.229
away from a conversation about extinction. If someone wants

1361
01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.580
to bring it up, then, you know, it's a

1362
01:12:54.589 --> 01:12:57.169
free place. People share their views. If someone asks

1363
01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.569
me, I will give them my opinion. Like you've

1364
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.129
just asked me now, I, I'll give you my

1365
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.810
opinion, but I don't think conversations about extinction should

1366
01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:07.000
be the predominant thing that we go to when

1367
01:13:07.009 --> 01:13:09.129
talking about anti Natal is for a couple of

1368
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.930
reasons. One again, I think it just buys into

1369
01:13:12.939 --> 01:13:15.799
utopian thinking like it's so far fetched and out

1370
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:20.740
there and far away, we as individuals now have

1371
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:24.470
no uh have no real influence over whether the

1372
01:13:24.479 --> 01:13:26.589
human race is gonna go extinct or sentient life

1373
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.589
is gonna go extinct. And if we f and

1374
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.589
it, it, it just elicits an emotional response from

1375
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.180
people so that they go, oh, you want extinction

1376
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:42.250
and use that to disregard everything you've said. If

1377
01:13:42.259 --> 01:13:44.209
you stay on the topic of Anti Natal is

1378
01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.529
one, even though it's a bizarre concept to many

1379
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.370
people, it's probably less alienating than you saying you

1380
01:13:50.379 --> 01:13:52.970
want everything to go extinct or e everyone to

1381
01:13:52.979 --> 01:13:56.160
go extinct. And if you keep the discussion on

1382
01:13:56.169 --> 01:13:58.830
anti natal is you're keeping it on something that

1383
01:13:58.839 --> 01:14:01.669
they have direct control over the person you're talking

1384
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.740
to has no control over whether the human race

1385
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.250
goes extinct, but they have full control over whether

1386
01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:09.589
they have a child, you know, removing any other

1387
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.350
circumstances of, you know, uh forced pregnancy and stuff

1388
01:14:13.359 --> 01:14:16.000
like that. Generally, if someone has control over their

1389
01:14:16.009 --> 01:14:18.109
reproduction, then they have full control over the decision

1390
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.109
you're talking about. Um So, yeah, and there was

1391
01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.709
another thing I was gonna say, but I've forgotten

1392
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.160
it. But I think tho those are some, those

1393
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:28.990
are some sort of like, yeah, there's a philosophical

1394
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.950
reason, I'm not an extinction and there's a practical

1395
01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:34.689
reason why I think we shouldn't make that a

1396
01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.819
predominant message in our advocacy. And also, let's be

1397
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:43.089
honest, anti Natal lists are a very small group

1398
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:47.220
of people who don't have significant power in society.

1399
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:51.149
We probably never will because of the inherent biases

1400
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:57.189
in humans from our evolution. So, trying to achieve

1401
01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.819
extinction, I just think is making the perfect the

1402
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.450
enemy of the good type thinking. And what we

1403
01:15:03.459 --> 01:15:07.629
should really focus on is what tangible goods can

1404
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.229
we do with our time and resources that we

1405
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.509
have now while we exist and try and do

1406
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.270
that? Um So yeah, that, that's what I'd say.

1407
01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.000
If there's anything else you wanted to explore with

1408
01:15:18.009 --> 01:15:20.450
extinction, then please please ask me, I don't want

1409
01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:21.589
to hide from anything.

1410
01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.109
No, I, I have one more question and this

1411
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.629
will be my last one, but also related to

1412
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.250
extinction is because there are people that when they

1413
01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:34.000
are confronted with the idea of human extinction, they

1414
01:15:34.009 --> 01:15:38.149
react in a negative way because they say that

1415
01:15:38.529 --> 01:15:42.830
uh as humans just by existing, we bring value

1416
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.459
into the universe in a way because we can

1417
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:48.939
create art, we can uh learn about the universe,

1418
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:51.959
we can do science and all of that stuff

1419
01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:57.609
that without us specifically as humans. Uh I mean,

1420
01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.750
there wouldn't be anything like that anymore. II, I

1421
01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:03.580
mean, I, I have to say that I, it

1422
01:16:03.589 --> 01:16:06.020
sounds a bit weird. That kind of argument to

1423
01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:09.669
me. Becau because when you're saying that the UN,

1424
01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.350
uh it seems like you're saying that the universe

1425
01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:16.049
has interests, that the universe itself is sentient and

1426
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.930
it would lose something if we weren't here. But

1427
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.209
you, you yourself, do you think that it makes

1428
01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.990
for a compelling argument at all?

1429
01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.350
Per I, I don't personally just because art science,

1430
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.250
you know, literature, these sorts of things that this

1431
01:16:34.259 --> 01:16:38.089
type of argument points to those only serve to

1432
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.359
benefit sentient beings once they exist, right? Like I

1433
01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:45.540
don't think uh like the scientific method is an

1434
01:16:45.549 --> 01:16:48.560
extremely good tool to use for us to understand

1435
01:16:48.569 --> 01:16:51.200
the universe. But if there are no sentient beings

1436
01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:54.049
in the universe, that that tool has, has no

1437
01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:58.229
use. Um COS there's no, there's no beings in

1438
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.299
existence to have interests that can be furthered by

1439
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.629
that tool. The same with the piece of art,

1440
01:17:03.799 --> 01:17:05.979
you know, the Mona Lisa is something that we

1441
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:09.270
can appreciate as an amazing work of art. Or

1442
01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:10.830
if you don't like the Mona Lisa, pick some

1443
01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:13.600
other work of art. Um, BUT if there, if

1444
01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:17.479
there is no one to experience the Mona Lisa,

1445
01:17:17.979 --> 01:17:20.580
the value is kind of lost a bit. Um,

1446
01:17:20.589 --> 01:17:24.669
YOU know, because there's no, there's, there's no beings

1447
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.359
in existence to experience value. Um So, yeah, I

1448
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.819
also find them uncompelling. I don't know if you

1449
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:33.049
heard, I'm sure there's multiple people who have put

1450
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.490
that argument forward, but I'm currently reading. Should we

1451
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.069
go extinct? In, in fact, it's just there on

1452
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.189
my, uh, on my bed. Exactly. Yeah. And, and

1453
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.390
I think, I mean, I've read, obviously I've read

1454
01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:50.109
like several books on Anti Natal for and Against.

1455
01:17:50.259 --> 01:17:52.649
I think it's in this book. He puts that

1456
01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.680
argument forward a bit. Um, BUT yeah, I don't,

1457
01:17:55.689 --> 01:17:57.330
I don't, I don't find it convincing.

1458
01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:00.620
Uh Yeah, I mean, there's even a sort of

1459
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:04.740
long term is version of that argument where some

1460
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:09.290
people uh are claiming that even if we have

1461
01:18:09.299 --> 01:18:12.839
to uh make, uh I don't know how many

1462
01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:16.899
people suffer until we get. That is the same

1463
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:20.770
sort of argument I was mentioning earlier. E even

1464
01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.740
if we have to go through another fight, years

1465
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:28.299
of people of making people suffer, we should uh

1466
01:18:28.319 --> 01:18:32.189
be here until we get to a point where

1467
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.009
we can, people can become immortal. And I mean,

1468
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.310
for me that's just a, no, this argument beca

1469
01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:42.509
because uh I, I mean, now how many people

1470
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.770
would they be willing to sacrifice just to get

1471
01:18:46.779 --> 01:18:47.240
there?

1472
01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:50.029
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, it's,

1473
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.850
it's the same with many things, you know, you'll

1474
01:18:51.859 --> 01:18:54.310
have it with utopian thinking of all types. Like

1475
01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.779
if we kill this many people cos they are

1476
01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:02.029
dissenters pun intended, you know, then we, we'll be

1477
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.990
able to get to this perfect political system, whether

1478
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.830
it is a narco capitalism or communism or whatever,

1479
01:19:08.839 --> 01:19:11.500
whatever utopia you want. I as long if we

1480
01:19:11.509 --> 01:19:13.779
just hide these people away and kill them off,

1481
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:16.069
you know, cos they're ruining it, then then we

1482
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.830
can reach this, this utopia and it's the same

1483
01:19:18.839 --> 01:19:20.649
sort of thing. You know, if we just get

1484
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.759
through this many generations where these people are gonna

1485
01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:25.069
suffer, then we can reach this utopia and it's

1486
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.810
just um Yeah, I think utopian thinking like there

1487
01:19:30.819 --> 01:19:34.310
will be things to aim for and get to

1488
01:19:34.319 --> 01:19:38.609
which will be valuable. But when you get to

1489
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.000
the point where you say we need to get

1490
01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:43.879
to it at all costs and you think, and

1491
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.390
you think the thing you're getting to is gonna

1492
01:19:45.399 --> 01:19:48.629
solve all problems, then you probably need to check,

1493
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.250
you know, your um yeah, you need to recheck

1494
01:19:52.259 --> 01:19:52.700
things.

1495
01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:57.160
Yeah, great. So just before we go apart from

1496
01:19:57.169 --> 01:20:00.290
your channel, which I will be linking to down

1497
01:20:00.299 --> 01:20:03.379
in the description, are there any other places on

1498
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:05.799
the internet that you would like to point to

1499
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:09.279
where people can find you or some anti natal

1500
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:12.009
list advocacy group, something like that.

1501
01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.060
Yeah. So anything I'm gonna mention is linked somewhere

1502
01:20:16.069 --> 01:20:18.830
on my channel, but there's my channel. Um THERE'S

1503
01:20:18.839 --> 01:20:21.740
a series I do called Antenatal around the world

1504
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.479
where I talk to anti natal lists in different

1505
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.879
countries that is also available as a podcast on,

1506
01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:31.089
on any podcast podcast platforms. I also run a

1507
01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.660
website called the Anti Na uh a, an anti

1508
01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:37.189
Natal handbook which cov again, th this is linked

1509
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.879
on my channel, but it covers common arguments people

1510
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:43.209
give against anti natal and it gives responses to

1511
01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:49.669
those. Um uh THERE'S uh a sort of anti

1512
01:20:49.819 --> 01:20:56.169
natal list slash effective altruist organization slash website that

1513
01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.339
at the moment it's just me running um called

1514
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:02.930
anti Natal advocacy. There's some good information on there

1515
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:05.939
and charities that are relevant to this topic people

1516
