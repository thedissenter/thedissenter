00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.650
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.409
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loop. And

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.829
today I'm Jane, but Doctor Thomas Tao, he's Professor

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.789
of Metaphysics of Science at the University of Bristol.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.129
He specializes in contemporary analytic metaphysics with an emphasis

6
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.674
on methodological and epistemic issues, namely meta metaphysics. And

7
00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.725
today we're going to talk about exactly that Metta

8
00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:29.684
Metaphysics, Metaphysics and some other related topics. So uh

9
00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:32.205
Thomas, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

10
00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:32.654
everyone.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.139
Thanks very much Ricardo. It's a, it's a pleasure

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.580
to be here.

13
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.029
So on the show, I've already had interviews on

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.040
physics on metaphysics, but he is the first, this

15
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.209
is the first one on me metaphysics. So I

16
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.400
guess that we will have to uh I, I

17
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.869
mean, walk a few small steps here into what

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.049
it is, but uh broadly speaking, what is Metta

19
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.860
mesic, how does it relate to metaphysics and what

20
00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.230
sorts of questions does it deal with?

21
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.959
Exactly. Yeah. Good. Um I suppose it makes sense

22
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.010
to say just a few words about what I

23
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:14.029
think metaphysics is uh before we get to the

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.260
metaphysic meta Metaphysics. So um I take a broadly

25
00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:22.319
Aristotelian view of uh of metaphysics uh as uh

26
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.930
be a study of being uh who are being

27
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.089
or being in itself. So something like um the

28
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.120
first philosophy uh as Aristotle would have put it

29
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.440
and uh uh that would include uh quite a

30
00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:40.940
broad range of topics, obviously, things like uh ontological

31
00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:45.459
categories and, and the relations between them. Uh But

32
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.970
uh you know, the whole spread of the usual

33
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.190
topics in metaphysics would would fall under, fall under

34
00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:54.930
that. And uh if we get to metaphysics, well,

35
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.300
uh the idea is just that there is something

36
00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:00.419
that it is like to do metaphysics or like

37
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.430
to study metaphysics. And uh Metta Mess would, would

38
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.040
ask that question, what it is to do Metaphysics.

39
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.000
So how do we get to knowledge or information

40
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.320
about those fundamental questions or philosophy that we study

41
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.050
in metaphysics? Um And that could take a number

42
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.320
of different shapes. So we could, we could look

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.809
at uh the epistemology of Metaphysics uh that would,

44
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.750
that would be part of Metta Metaphysics as scientist

45
00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.080
standard or the methodology of metaphysics more broadly speaking.

46
00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.509
So for instance, how does metaphysics relate to science,

47
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.500
natural science? How does it relate to uh the

48
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.130
a priori posti distinction again, back to epistemic issues?

49
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:43.690
Um How does it deal with things like uh

50
00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.550
modality? So, study of possibility and necessity are metaphysical

51
00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.850
truths necessary in some sense? Uh And if so,

52
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.539
in what sense um and uh broadly speaking, I

53
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.330
suppose metaphysics could also be seen to study the

54
00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.419
role of metaphysics in philosophy. So how does me

55
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.630
metaphysics relate to other philosophical areas of inquiry? Is

56
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.679
there something especially problematic or difficult about metaphysics given

57
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.529
that it claims to study uh philosophy in this

58
00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.630
sort of broader sense? Or if it's first philosophy

59
00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.850
as Aristotle put it, what does that mean exactly

60
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.899
for uh for its role in, in philosophy? So

61
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.529
that would be a very sort of rough uh

62
00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.610
list of topics that we could study in metaphysics

63
00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.100
as I see it.

64
00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.410
Oh OK. So several different uh topics that you

65
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.270
mentioned there that I would like to ask you

66
00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.809
a little bit more about just to clarify things

67
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.449
here. So when you say that Metta Metaphysics is

68
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.039
also interested in how in how metaphysics relates to

69
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.449
other areas in philosophy. Uh So it also asks

70
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.690
question about questions about how, for example, it relates

71
00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.479
to things like epistemology and perhaps other areas of

72
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.410
philosophy. But I would imagine that epistemology would be

73
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.080
a big one here, right? I mean, because uh

74
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:05.940
it's one thing to understand what reality is to

75
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.710
put it in simple terms or, or what reality

76
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.610
is composed of stuff like that. But another thing

77
00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.949
is for us to really understand to what extent

78
00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:19.670
we as humans can acquire knowledge about it. And

79
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.049
if we are acquiring, acquiring knowledge about reality, what

80
00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:29.839
are we inquiring about? Exactly, right. I mean, is

81
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.739
that right. Or?

82
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.670
Yeah. No, that's exactly, that's exactly right. Um, I,

83
00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:36.410
I often think of the relationship between metaphysics and

84
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.869
epistemology as being um two sides of the same

85
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.950
coin really. Uh BECAUSE you can't really uh do

86
00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.750
metaphysics if you don't have some view about how,

87
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.769
what it is that you're uh trying to know,

88
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.140
know about and, and how you are, you are

89
00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.220
going about uh that, that inquiry and, and similarly,

90
00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.579
you can't really do epi epistemology, if you don't

91
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.149
have a target for, for that uh that uh

92
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.769
knowledge that you are, you are seeking. So, um

93
00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.559
so I do think that they, they are very

94
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.230
closely related in, in that sense. Um And uh

95
00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:13.299
I suppose, I mean, maybe it would be useful

96
00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:16.630
to give a, give an example. So, so um

97
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:23.230
think about um uh think about the category of

98
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.260
structure of, of reality that we supposedly study, study

99
00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:29.950
metaphysics. Now, uh if you think that that category

100
00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.329
of structure of reality is something that is uh

101
00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.679
just made up by, by people, it's mind dependent

102
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.260
in some sense or dependent on our concepts or

103
00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:42.660
conceptualizations of reality, then it seems that the epistemic

104
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.880
question has to focus on the human mind. Uh

105
00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.019
I suppose this might be a canteen answer to

106
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.410
that question. You know, the categories are in the

107
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.269
mind and we have to study the human mind.

108
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.529
Now, maybe there's something out outside the human mind

109
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.079
that these uh uh categories of the mind are

110
00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.109
related to, but that might be um uh beyond

111
00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.339
our uh beyond our reach in, in terms of

112
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.739
uh of, of our knowledge of the world. Or

113
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.320
if you think that those categories of reality are

114
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.309
mind independent, then obviously you must, you must tell

115
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.420
us something about how you intend to get to

116
00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:16.829
those categories, perhaps involving the natural sciences or some

117
00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.500
sort of interplay between metaphysics and the sciences.

118
00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.359
Mhm And I guess that we also have to

119
00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.779
keep in mind and this is very important for

120
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.440
us people, particularly in more developed countries and contemporary

121
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.859
societies to keep in mind is that metaphysics is

122
00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:42.380
not necessarily a materialistic or about a naturalistic approach

123
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.730
when it relates to epistemology and naturalistic approach to

124
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:49.600
knowledge, right? I mean, it can be about other

125
00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:54.609
conceptualizations of reality that are not necessarily based on

126
00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.420
materialism or some other, some version of that that

127
00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:04.850
tends to go associated with the um scientific inquiry.

128
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.230
Sure, that's, that's true. So it's just as much

129
00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:12.350
a part of metaphysics and indeed meta metaphysics um

130
00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:16.059
to, to study reality from uh an idealistic point

131
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.140
of view, for instance, think of uh uh uh

132
00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:22.820
George Barclay, um who, who had an idealistic framework

133
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:26.420
where uh which is upheld by God, of course,

134
00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:30.154
uh in, in Barclay's philosophy. But uh uh the

135
00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:33.274
question is then how uh how do we construct

136
00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:35.575
the reality and how is it dependent on our

137
00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:37.994
minds or, or God's mind in, in, in Barclay's

138
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:40.545
case. Um And this is, this is not a

139
00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:44.325
naturalistic framework. Uh But it is a realist framework

140
00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:46.315
of sorts, even if it has this idealist uh

141
00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:49.195
underpinning. And similarly, you could, you could start from,

142
00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:52.265
from other starting points like that. Those would, those

143
00:07:52.274 --> 00:07:55.154
would be in the scope of metaphysics uh very

144
00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:56.704
much. So that's, that's true.

145
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.679
So let's put a pin on the realistic uh

146
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.309
bit of it, the realistic bit that you mentioned

147
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.190
there because we're going to get into that in

148
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.929
a second. But I I in your first answer,

149
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.820
you mentioned ontology or uh if I remember correctly

150
00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:20.070
ontological entities, for example, are there differences between metaphysics

151
00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:22.440
and ontology? Because o of course, I'm not a

152
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.320
philosopher myself, but I have to, to tell you

153
00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:29.019
that many times when I hear philosophers talking about

154
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:33.940
metaphysics and ontology, uh I'm not completely sure if

155
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.440
there's a strict separation there and if there's one

156
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.330
ex uh where exactly it falls. So

157
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.760
yeah, good. That is a good question to, to,

158
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.119
to ask. Um OFTEN the, the notions of metaphysics

159
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.119
and ontology are used more or less synonymously, but

160
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.349
we, we can definitely make a distinction between them.

161
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.940
Um And I suppose you might say that ontology

162
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.630
is a slightly narrower notion. So if on, on

163
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.719
ontology studies, what there is Metaphysics studies, uh something

164
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.020
um uh sort of a broader set of set

165
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.789
of things, let's say me metaphysics might include the

166
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:18.780
study of free will ontology perhaps not. So, um

167
00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:22.510
so uh this is a rough and ready distinction.

168
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.929
I must, I must say so we could, we

169
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.989
could make a, make a more formal distinction. But

170
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.479
given that people use these notions quite synonymously often,

171
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.179
it's not, it's not easy to do so. Um

172
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.909
SO sometimes equally, the notions of meta metaphysics and

173
00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:39.159
meal on technology are used uh like this. But

174
00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:42.034
you, I think that meta ontology is a slightly

175
00:09:42.044 --> 00:09:45.815
narrow area of uh of focus again, whereas Metaphysics

176
00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:49.075
studies Metaphysics as a whole or the methodology of

177
00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:52.104
metaphysics as a whole and ontology is focused on

178
00:09:52.294 --> 00:09:55.385
um something a bit more precise such as uh

179
00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.835
what falls into those categories uh of, of being

180
00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:00.294
and what, what does exist?

181
00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:05.150
Mhm Right. Uh And so what are the different

182
00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:11.020
theories about how we can classify and categorize reality?

183
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.960
Yeah, I mean, I, I guess that I've already

184
00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:15.450
ended up mentioning and you a few of them

185
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.580
like for example, the materialistic ones or the idealistic

186
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.799
ones. But how would you categorize, let's say the

187
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:25.989
different approaches out there?

188
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:30.219
Yeah, good. Yeah, we've, we've mentioned uh category ontological

189
00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:34.419
categories uh already a few times. Um And uh

190
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.489
then the sort of more um I suppose met

191
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:42.330
metaphysical positions which are realism and idealism or uh

192
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.469
sometimes also we talk about deflation is so we

193
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.840
shouldn't really be thinking about metaphysics at all on

194
00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:52.510
a deflationary uh conception because uh all the questions

195
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.309
studied in metaphysics would end up being studied in

196
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.960
one of the special sciences or in other areas

197
00:10:57.969 --> 00:11:00.950
of philosophy such as philosophy and language perhaps. So,

198
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.590
so there are a few different ways to, to,

199
00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:05.090
to look at that question. Um But you can't

200
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.159
really answer that before you have some idea about

201
00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:10.919
what metaphysics is about either. Um So, so the

202
00:11:10.929 --> 00:11:13.099
way I would see it, um and this is

203
00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:15.440
just one answer to it is that metaphysics is

204
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.890
indeed about studying those uh ontological categories. And uh

205
00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:24.400
the different theories about ontological categories could then be

206
00:11:24.409 --> 00:11:27.799
idealistic as well as realistic. So you might think

207
00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:31.630
that um the different categories of, of property and,

208
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.940
and uh and substance and relations and whatever those

209
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.679
categories are, we can talk more about that. But

210
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.440
you might think that some of those cations are

211
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.169
mind dependent or mind independent. So on either view,

212
00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:47.890
you would be studying the categorization of reality, right?

213
00:11:48.169 --> 00:11:49.989
But you would just have a, have a different

214
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.890
perspective on that.

215
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.590
I, I would imagine that probably one of the

216
00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:58.750
lys examples and please correct me if I'm wrong

217
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.119
of an idealistic stance on metaphysics would be Plato's

218
00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:08.950
right. Yeah, that's, that's right. So Plato's uh answer

219
00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:13.409
to, you know, a specific metaphysical problem that has

220
00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.700
a, has a venerable history. The problem of the

221
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.599
many what, what is similar across uh many different

222
00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:23.169
things um is, is an, is an idealistic problem.

223
00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:26.059
So, there's, there's a, there's a form or an

224
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:30.080
idea of, uh, something like, uh, beauty which is

225
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.349
shared across all, all beautiful things, of course. And

226
00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:35.760
for Plato, they would be in this Platonic heaven,

227
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.299
um, which I suppose is, uh, it is, I

228
00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:44.219
suppose a mind independent place in some ways but

229
00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:47.030
it's, uh, it's idealistic in, uh, in the sense

230
00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:49.390
that it's not, it's not in the material reality

231
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.859
in the same way. So how do you classify

232
00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:55.369
these different uh historical views is, is maybe controversial

233
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.179
but, but yes, there's a, there's a level of

234
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.929
idealism there,

235
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.780
by the way, you mentioned mind independent there and,

236
00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:05.760
and that's actually something that sometimes, uh it confuses

237
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.919
me a little bit when, for example, people in

238
00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:11.140
meta ethics uh use those kinds of terms. I

239
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.650
mean, about moral values, moral truths, the moral realists

240
00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:20.080
many times say that they are mind independent. So,

241
00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:23.794
uh I mean, because perhaps it's me that I

242
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:29.395
haven't studied math physics or meta ethics specifically or

243
00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:32.724
from a or at an academic level. So perhaps

244
00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:35.325
there is some of this is harder for me

245
00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:39.630
to understand because of that. But what does mind

246
00:13:39.989 --> 00:13:44.599
independent really mean? I mean, what would that correspond

247
00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:47.409
to? Because for us as humans that I guess

248
00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:50.780
that's very hard to understand when it comes to

249
00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:55.539
the metaphysical side of things, what that would correspond

250
00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:59.239
to exactly when we're talking about things like concepts,

251
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.359
moral values and other things like that

252
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.609
good. I mean, I, I think you're asking exactly

253
00:14:05.619 --> 00:14:08.429
the right question. I, I've, uh I've used the

254
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.099
notion of mind independence or mind dependence. Uh Partly

255
00:14:12.109 --> 00:14:14.969
because, um, we have some sort of intuitive idea

256
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.369
of what, what that might mean, but actually it,

257
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.590
it turns out to be quite difficult to specify

258
00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:22.590
it accurately. So, so you're, you're right to ask

259
00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:29.080
that question. Um So, um, well, maybe, maybe the

260
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.780
first thing to say is, uh human minds are,

261
00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:35.369
are, are of course part of reality, whatever that

262
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.820
reality is. So, in, in that sense, uh uh

263
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.369
it, it's, it's, it's strange to talk about mind

264
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.830
independence because we are, we are part of the

265
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.010
world and we're studying our own minds just as

266
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.909
well as we are studying the rest of reality.

267
00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:51.380
So, in that sense, uh everything, everything is dependent

268
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.469
on the minds in so far as minds are

269
00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:56.299
part of reality. But when, when we talk about

270
00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.619
mind independence and philosophy, the sort of first rough

271
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.469
and ready characterization might be something like, well, uh

272
00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:06.929
it's not made up by us, uh if it's

273
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.130
mind independent. So, uh it's not dependent on what

274
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.419
names we might call it or what our thoughts

275
00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:17.260
about. It might be this whatever this might independent

276
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.400
thing is. Um, BUT it's something, something, uh that

277
00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:23.469
would be exactly the way it is if we

278
00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:27.219
weren't here to observe it and conceptualize it. Um,

279
00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:32.130
NOW that's, uh, that's only a rough and ready

280
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.489
answer because you might think of different ways to,

281
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.619
to problematic it, think of um I'll, I'll give

282
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.849
you an example, think of something like um trans

283
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.900
Uan elements um which we synthesize in la laboratories,

284
00:15:45.909 --> 00:15:50.219
um uh elements like Einstein and now they're not

285
00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:54.450
naturally occurring. So, uh they wouldn't exist without us

286
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.580
being here to synthesize them, but that doesn't really

287
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.239
make them mind dependent in the sense that we

288
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.789
might be interested in here. Because you might think

289
00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:07.340
that, well, uh if the world had been configured

290
00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:10.270
slightly differently, those sort of elements, uh uh transgenic

291
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.700
elements could exist, they just have very short half

292
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.340
lives and they, they uh disintegrate very quickly. Um

293
00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.489
So even if we needed to give some sort

294
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.530
of active input to bring that thing into existence,

295
00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:25.260
it doesn't make it mind dependent in any kind

296
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.070
of very interesting sense. Uh BECAUSE we do not

297
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.200
design its nature in a way. We do not

298
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.080
design what it's like. We just uh use, use

299
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.880
our technological tools to, to uh to bring it

300
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.469
about. Um So I'm, I'm not sure if that's

301
00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:42.580
helpful, but uh maybe it gives you one way

302
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.469
to kind of get a more nuanced sense of

303
00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:47.020
what, what we might need me by my independence.

304
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.390
No, I this is a very interesting discussion to

305
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.479
have because I mean, I come from a s

306
00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:57.869
mostly scientific background and so perhaps when I think

307
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.469
about or when I hear people talking about mind,

308
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:07.959
independent entities, mind the independent something out there. Uh

309
00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:12.949
Perhaps it's because of my own uh intellectual framework

310
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:16.390
with the scientific background that I always tend to

311
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.410
think as things as instantiated, physically or materialistically. And

312
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.598
so perhaps there's a, there's an obstacle there in

313
00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:29.709
terms of my intellectual framework, in terms of understanding,

314
00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:35.485
how would something like uh concepts or moral values

315
00:17:35.495 --> 00:17:40.156
would be minded dependent. Because for me honestly, that's

316
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:45.686
almost meaningless because I can't really conceptualize uh the

317
00:17:45.696 --> 00:17:50.595
exis uh how uh things like that would exist

318
00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:54.645
in reality outside of human minds be because again,

319
00:17:54.656 --> 00:18:00.602
probably, I mean, instantiating them uh physically materialistically. So,

320
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:02.871
uh I, I mean, what by the way, what

321
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.421
do you think about that? Do you think that

322
00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:07.982
perhaps when it comes to these metaphysical or Metta

323
00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:13.511
metaphysical conceptualizations that perhaps the sort of intellectual frameworks

324
00:18:13.521 --> 00:18:18.552
we are operating under limit some of our understanding

325
00:18:18.562 --> 00:18:24.089
or perhaps uh understanding some uh alternative positions out

326
00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:28.349
there that are non materialistic or something like that?

327
00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:33.540
Uh Good, interesting. I mean, there's a few, there's

328
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.689
a few questions there. II, I mean, firstly, I

329
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.439
suppose I would, I would say, I would say

330
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:42.569
yes, surely our um our um framework, the framework

331
00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:44.920
that we start out with does limit uh the

332
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.589
way we conceptualize these things or, or conceive of

333
00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:50.349
them. But I mean, that's just the starting point,

334
00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:52.079
right? So we can, we can kind of uh

335
00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.959
discuss and and, and come to an agreement but

336
00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:58.439
on the, on the sort of, uh, the broader

337
00:18:58.449 --> 00:19:01.489
question on the background. So how, how would something

338
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.229
like, uh, you know, normative properties, you mentioned meta

339
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.739
ethics here and moral, moral properties like that, how

340
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.479
could they even be mind independent in any sort

341
00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:14.770
of sense? Well, I, I mean, there are positions

342
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.699
in, in sort of moral naturalistic um frameworks where,

343
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:22.199
uh, where you might think that uh there is

344
00:19:22.209 --> 00:19:25.000
a way to understand these uh moral properties as

345
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.420
ma material in a, in a sense. But that's

346
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.270
probably not the usual uh usual way to way

347
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.060
to go because we don't, we wouldn't describe normative

348
00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:37.479
properties to, you know, fundamental particles or something like

349
00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:40.229
that. But, but, you know, it could be done,

350
00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:42.959
people talk about it in panpsychism, of course, that

351
00:19:42.969 --> 00:19:46.430
there's something in, um, in something like a mind

352
00:19:46.449 --> 00:19:50.290
like, um substance already in, in, in, in fundamental

353
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.910
particles. But uh that's just to give a, give

354
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.479
a context for this problem. Uh The, the broader

355
00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.770
point you make is that if our minds are

356
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.079
indeed part of reality and normative properties are some

357
00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:08.250
somehow dependent on those minds, then perhaps there is

358
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.890
a, a way to understand those normative properties as

359
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.969
material just uh uh uh on the basis of,

360
00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:17.400
uh of how our minds minds work in as

361
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.989
instantiated in the material world as well. So if

362
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.329
you've got a, a physical or materialist view about

363
00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:25.979
the mind. There's no reason why you couldn't return

364
00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:29.119
normative properties in the same way. But now we've

365
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.900
stepped into ma ethics. Of course.

366
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.489
No, of course. I mean, let's try to, to

367
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.060
avoid that because it's really not something that falls

368
00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:41.500
under the scope of these interviews. So, uh, but

369
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:47.209
let's get into realist positions and anti realist positions

370
00:20:47.219 --> 00:20:50.390
in, uh, I guess we could say mathematics its

371
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.910
here. So, what is the realist position? What does

372
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.140
that mean? Exactly.

373
00:20:57.739 --> 00:21:00.300
Yeah. So uh we have anticipated this in a

374
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.520
bit, of course, because uh one way to, to

375
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.750
define a realist position is by way of mind,

376
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.579
independence that we have talked about. So you might

377
00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:13.619
say that if uh let's say the ontological categories

378
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.069
do exist mind independently in the world, be it

379
00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:19.180
be material or non material by the way. So

380
00:21:19.189 --> 00:21:22.260
the, the materialist part isn't necessary part of realism

381
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.229
here. Um But you, you could say that it's

382
00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:28.910
a realist position if those categories exist independently of

383
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.910
us. Um um uh Whereas an anti realist position

384
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.939
would, would then say, uh uh I mean, one

385
00:21:36.949 --> 00:21:38.790
version of it would, would say that it is,

386
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.010
it is up to us how to uh uh

387
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.479
uh how to conceptualize how to divide up reality.

388
00:21:45.489 --> 00:21:48.510
And uh the, the, the categories do not exist

389
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.869
outside our language or outside uh our own conceptualization.

390
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:55.219
I mean, that's a very rough and ready way

391
00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:59.650
to, to uh compare realism and anti realism. And

392
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.729
of course, uh I think it's always important to

393
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:06.709
note that uh you can be realist about some

394
00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:09.709
areas of metaphysics or inquiry and anti realist about

395
00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:13.099
others. So these aren't necessarily uh correctly conceived as

396
00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:17.709
global positions. So you might be realist about um

397
00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:21.060
there being a category of uh of universals, universal

398
00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:24.500
properties such as uh such as redness or, or

399
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.150
beauty as mentioned before from, from Plato. Uh BUT

400
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.619
you could be anti realist about, about other things,

401
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.979
let's say, um you could be anti realist about

402
00:22:32.989 --> 00:22:36.780
those normative properties or uh social categories or something

403
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.359
like that, you could have a different uh constructivist

404
00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:41.469
view about those sort of things which is mind

405
00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:43.800
dependent and anti realist in a, in a manner

406
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.069
of speaking. Uh And indeed, probably most of us

407
00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:50.010
are realist about some things and anti realist about,

408
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:51.280
about other things.

409
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.410
Mhm uh And so, uh I mean, let me

410
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.150
just ask you about an, an example that for

411
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.030
me perhaps gets a little bit into murky waters

412
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.949
because probably it's very hard to tell where's the

413
00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:10.209
separation here between metaphysics and epistemology. But getting into,

414
00:23:10.219 --> 00:23:14.959
for example, the position of uh Emmanuel Kent when

415
00:23:14.969 --> 00:23:17.739
he called, when he talked about the New Manon

416
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.500
and the phenomenon, um I mean, uh uh a

417
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.469
as I understand it, it would be then uh

418
00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:29.060
a realist position because at least when he talks

419
00:23:29.069 --> 00:23:32.290
about the Ninon, he is referring to the existence

420
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.569
of something that is mind independent, right? But when

421
00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:41.569
it comes to the phenomenon, uh I mean, is,

422
00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:43.969
or do you think that he would be referring

423
00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:50.520
to uh something metaphysical there or is strictly referring

424
00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.939
to epistemology in the sense that we as humans

425
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.319
with our perceptual limitations can only live, I guess,

426
00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:04.285
psychologically with in the these phenomenological world, but can't

427
00:24:04.295 --> 00:24:09.704
really get direct access into what uh the thing

428
00:24:09.734 --> 00:24:12.704
itself or the real world, I guess we could

429
00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:16.175
say is, I mean, what are your ideas about

430
00:24:16.185 --> 00:24:16.405
it?

431
00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:21.199
Yeah, I mean, I should, I should preface this

432
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:24.010
by saying that uh uh I'm no Kant scholar.

433
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.099
So I leave the K exegesis to, to, to

434
00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:30.010
those who can read the original German. But um

435
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.810
uh but I, I do know that uh it

436
00:24:33.819 --> 00:24:38.250
while Kant is usually interpreted as, as uh um

437
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.000
not quite an anti realist position but as something

438
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.640
that talks about um uh or is mainly focused

439
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.349
is mainly focused on the, on the mind dependent

440
00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:51.270
categories in our, in our minds, that there are

441
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.939
different interpretations of Kant where, where a sort of

442
00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:58.199
more realist uh position is possible. But you're right

443
00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:01.300
to say that uh the epistemic and the metaphysical

444
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.550
agendas are very mixed up here because it does

445
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.270
seem that uh Kant accepts the existence of objective

446
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.030
reality outside our minds. So it's rare this position.

447
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.579
But, but perhaps he thought that we just can't

448
00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:18.650
get any kind of information about it. So everything

449
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.469
that we perceive is filtered through these categories which

450
00:25:21.479 --> 00:25:26.750
are, are uh sort of anthropocentric uh uh biases

451
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.079
in a way. Uh So we, we can't get

452
00:25:29.089 --> 00:25:31.750
those, get those, those glasses of our, of our

453
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.430
eyes. Um But yes, I mean, you, you might,

454
00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:39.140
you might have this type of anti realistic reading

455
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.359
of, of content and that's perhaps what he thought.

456
00:25:41.369 --> 00:25:45.699
But the immediate question is, um where do, where

457
00:25:45.709 --> 00:25:49.140
do those categories uh that, that we have in

458
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.250
our minds? Where do those glasses come from? And

459
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.209
why do they filter reality in this sort of

460
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:55.689
way? Uh Is it, isn't it more likely that

461
00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:58.050
there is something of a glimpse of the true

462
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.050
structure of reality? Uh Even if it is filtered

463
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.770
through these glasses, um uh and uh indeed would

464
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.000
beings very, very different from us uh not share

465
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.319
at least some of those uh those categorizations.

466
00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:15.900
Mhm Yeah. II I mean, something that I was

467
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.349
trying to get at with that question is also

468
00:26:19.829 --> 00:26:24.459
to what extent um the things that we would

469
00:26:24.469 --> 00:26:29.910
classify as mind dependent would also or could also

470
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.530
be uh considered within a realist position that is

471
00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:38.780
if uh things that are that we consider to

472
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:44.209
be mind dependent uh could also be considered within

473
00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:50.060
uh Matam Mess uh as uh I mean, understood

474
00:26:50.069 --> 00:26:54.449
within a realist position, that is so, I, I

475
00:26:54.459 --> 00:26:57.160
mean, this is very hard to explain, to talk

476
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.329
about for me, but le let me try my

477
00:26:59.339 --> 00:27:03.329
best here. So for example, if we're talking about

478
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.260
uh red as a caller, there are people out

479
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.939
there that would just say that because it is

480
00:27:09.949 --> 00:27:13.395
uh or apparently at least if you understand it

481
00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:18.494
through a physics framework, it is just a construct

482
00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:22.295
of our, a useful construct of our brains to

483
00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:25.234
deal with certain aspects of reality. And then you

484
00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:29.214
can also add evolutionary theory to that and neuroscience

485
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:35.574
that the red itself does not exist, it just

486
00:27:35.584 --> 00:27:43.349
uh useful mind dependent construct of reality. So some

487
00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:46.719
people would just say so it's not real and

488
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.310
that, that's it. But then there are other people

489
00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:55.020
that probably would say that uh redness exists as

490
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:59.150
a some sort of property of reality, but that

491
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.869
property is not exactly what we experience through our

492
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.569
senses. And so, I mean, the property itself would

493
00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:12.910
be real but what we experience through our senses,

494
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.689
uh I mean, I guess they would say it's

495
00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:20.089
not uh real, it's just uh again a useful

496
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.130
construct. But then, I mean, are there positions where

497
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.209
perhaps even though what we experience might not correspond

498
00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:33.400
to whatever property is out there in reality, people

499
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:38.800
would still consider uh that mind, mind dependent construct

500
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.040
also real. And so there would be two layers,

501
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.380
let's say of reality or uh uh I mean,

502
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.839
uh perhaps I'm being a bit confusing here. I

503
00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:49.579
I'm not sure.

504
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.109
Well, no, I think you've um uh you've captured

505
00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:58.079
the situation regarding color quite, quite well there. And

506
00:28:58.089 --> 00:29:00.520
I, I am sympathetic to, to the idea that

507
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.680
you outlined there, which is uh which is a

508
00:29:02.689 --> 00:29:06.660
form of a limit is about color, so, or

509
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.829
anti realism about color if you like. So, uh

510
00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:12.560
so the color properties that we talk about redness

511
00:29:12.569 --> 00:29:15.520
and so on. Uh Well, you know, they're part

512
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.699
of our phenomenology um but, but they don't correspond

513
00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:20.829
to real properties in the, in the same sense

514
00:29:20.839 --> 00:29:27.540
as well. Nuclear charge might be. Um Now, of

515
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.609
course, people might, might often say when we talk

516
00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:32.130
about colors that well look colors, they just correspond

517
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.849
to the wavelengths of the, of the light. Um

518
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.839
But, but the color experience doesn't seem to follow

519
00:29:37.849 --> 00:29:40.969
that quite, quite in, in that way. And indeed,

520
00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:43.780
we know that um that women and men can

521
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.589
experience color quite, quite differently, partially because of uh

522
00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:49.739
uh physical characteristics, women are better at it.

523
00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:53.089
Yeah. And there are some women actually that are

524
00:29:53.109 --> 00:29:54.959
that chromatic. I think

525
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.680
that's what I had in mind. Uh So, so

526
00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:01.739
there are, there are differences in our color experiences

527
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.000
uh probably in other ways as well. Um So,

528
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.319
so all of these things do do make me

529
00:30:07.329 --> 00:30:10.530
um more sympathetic to the sort of anti realism

530
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.130
about color. It's unfortunate that color is also always

531
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.459
the example of a real property that's mentioned because

532
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:17.790
of this, but it is what it is. Um

533
00:30:18.489 --> 00:30:21.030
But maybe I'll give you another example, and we

534
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.869
can, we can uh we can uh get a

535
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.579
bit deeper into this because um there are cases

536
00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:28.069
which I think you were after that seem like

537
00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:31.500
they are mind uh dependent or indeed not quite

538
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.410
real in the same sense as some of those

539
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.579
other properties that we might talk about are. But

540
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:37.689
still we seem to think that we need to

541
00:30:37.699 --> 00:30:39.619
be able to talk about them and there's something

542
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.000
real behind them. So what's, what's going on there?

543
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:46.050
So think about uh a mental illness or a

544
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.500
psychological uh uh condition of, of some sort like

545
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.589
that. Well, that is very much dependent on, on

546
00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:54.829
the mind of, of the person who has that

547
00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:58.229
condition, I suppose. Uh NO one would all presumably

548
00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:00.119
deny that even if there is a physical uh

549
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.810
uh characteristic that underpins it. Uh But also we

550
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:06.699
wouldn't want to say that it's, it's not, it's

551
00:31:06.709 --> 00:31:09.469
not real, it's not real property to have a,

552
00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:12.729
have a certain kind of mental illness. Now, the

553
00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:16.219
right question to ask then is uh what, what

554
00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:19.780
underlies, what kind of mechanism perhaps underlies that condition.

555
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.770
And then we classify these conditions based on uh

556
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.910
you know, DS M five in, in, in, in

557
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.130
psychology. Um But often, often what uh what we're

558
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.729
sort of classifying where we're basing those, those uh

559
00:31:32.739 --> 00:31:38.079
classifications on are just uh um behaviors or something

560
00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:41.699
like that, that are externally perceivable like that. So,

561
00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:45.619
when we ask, when, when we try to identify

562
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.550
a condition, let's say depression. Um Well, we want

563
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.969
to know what the underpinning mechanisms are and is

564
00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:55.020
it a single condition or is it perhaps just

565
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.459
a, a variety of different things that come together

566
00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.939
and, and manifest in that sort of behavior that

567
00:31:59.949 --> 00:32:05.020
a depressed person typically uh manifests. Um But there's

568
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.390
something real behind there, we might, we, we might

569
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.290
just not know what exactly is, is giving rise

570
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.719
to this condition. And, and the right question to

571
00:32:12.729 --> 00:32:14.739
then ask is, is it, is it one thing

572
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:18.630
or is it several different things? Uh What, in

573
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.300
either case, there's something real there? Maybe there's a

574
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.390
real dere uh uh natural kind as we say,

575
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.199
called depression or maybe there are several different things

576
00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:28.510
going on under there and we just classified them

577
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.680
together as a sort of syndrome. Uh CALL it

578
00:32:31.689 --> 00:32:33.859
depression because we don't really know what the underlying

579
00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:36.430
mechanisms are. Does that make sense?

580
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.930
Yeah, it makes sense. II, I mean, perhaps uh

581
00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:44.000
a sort of metaphor or analogy here to pick

582
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.709
on uh Plato's allegory of the cave would be,

583
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.880
I mean, do you think that there are stances

584
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.920
in Metta mess where people would consider to be

585
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:02.180
real? Both the people outside the cave and there

586
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:04.609
are shadows inside the cave? I mean, do, do

587
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.280
you understand what I'm trying to uh to arrive

588
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.469
at here? I mean, are, are there instances where

589
00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:13.329
people would say OK, so there's something real out

590
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:16.150
there that is not what we experience, but what

591
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.469
we experience is also real. I mean, is there

592
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.810
something like that out there or not?

593
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.619
Yeah. Um HM I don't have a good example

594
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.829
in mind but uh but maybe we can talk

595
00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:32.599
about it in the abstract as well. So um

596
00:33:34.439 --> 00:33:38.939
so, so uh I mean, clearly we, we, we,

597
00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:41.150
if we think of the scientific context, we clearly

598
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.930
try to think that we're trying to map reality

599
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:46.099
in some ways, you know, we talk about, talk

600
00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.689
about properties that are fairly well defined, such as

601
00:33:48.699 --> 00:33:51.939
such as uh electric charge and so on. But,

602
00:33:52.449 --> 00:33:54.739
but let's say, let's say that we are in

603
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.369
Plato's Cave and what we're actually perceiving are just

604
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.750
those, those shadows right now. Uh I suppose any

605
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.079
kind of uh uh uh uh metaphysical realist might

606
00:34:05.089 --> 00:34:07.920
still like to say that um Well, even if

607
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.500
that is the case, um we are observing something

608
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.728
that is a glimpse of what the real world

609
00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.889
is is like. So, um so you, you might

610
00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:18.168
think that there's a, there's a kind of a

611
00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.695
magnetism to the real thing that is causing, seeing

612
00:34:20.705 --> 00:34:24.245
the shadow, even if it is uh in reality,

613
00:34:24.254 --> 00:34:26.094
uh a couple of different things that we're mixing

614
00:34:26.103 --> 00:34:29.114
up together like the depression case maybe or uh

615
00:34:29.135 --> 00:34:31.793
it's not exactly as we thought it is because

616
00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:36.165
of uh uh whatever, whatever biases or, or limitations

617
00:34:36.175 --> 00:34:39.225
of knowledge, we we might have. So, so you

618
00:34:39.235 --> 00:34:41.580
might think that there's a um I mean, you

619
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.889
could combine this to usual philosophy of science question

620
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.139
uh discussions like uh no miracles argument. There's, it

621
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:49.239
would be a miracle if we, if we were

622
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.800
able to be so successful in science and make

623
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.629
all the predictions in science. If we didn't, if

624
00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.520
we hadn't grasped something about the real connections and

625
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.750
uh in reality that underlie whatever the shadows on

626
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.840
the wall might, might show us. Um So perhaps

627
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.280
this is, this is uh tracking what you had

628
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:07.870
in mind. Um

629
00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:10.590
Y yeah, I, I guess it is, I guess

630
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.850
it is. So, uh le let's now move on

631
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.479
to another topic. Um You in your work, I've

632
00:35:17.489 --> 00:35:21.489
read about uh you writing about the distinction between

633
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.750
substance and property. So what is the distinction there?

634
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.610
What and what is the substance and what is

635
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.580
the property

636
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.850
exactly? Yeah. Good. So we're, we're getting uh to

637
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.459
the basics in that uh these are often uh

638
00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:40.850
candidates for fundamental ontological categories. So we talked about

639
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.639
ontological categories and substance. The category of substance. The

640
00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:48.409
category of property are probably the two most commonly

641
00:35:48.419 --> 00:35:53.949
mentioned ones. Um Now property is, is maybe easier

642
00:35:53.959 --> 00:35:57.090
to uh to grasp because property is just things

643
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.830
like, well, those color properties that we talked about,

644
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.530
be they real or not uh or indeed uh

645
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:09.959
charge or mass or um spin uh to take,

646
00:36:09.969 --> 00:36:13.989
to take sort of supposedly fundamental physical properties first.

647
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.250
Um uh And uh the usual way to talk

648
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.280
about this would be that uh the, the properties

649
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.260
are instantiated in some way. So, uh, so they

650
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.320
are in, in reality, uh And where are they

651
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.129
instantiated with? Well, they might be instantiated in a

652
00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:38.020
substance. So something that holds those properties to together.

653
00:36:38.939 --> 00:36:43.020
Uh So take an electron, uh if electron is

654
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.379
a substance, it's a, it's an, it's an object,

655
00:36:45.399 --> 00:36:49.129
it has properties, it has uh unit charge half

656
00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:52.689
in to spin and a certain mass. Now, those

657
00:36:52.699 --> 00:36:55.989
three properties are instantiated in that substance. The electron.

658
00:36:57.189 --> 00:36:59.810
The problem of course, here is which Barkley put

659
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.770
better than anyone else that I can think of

660
00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.959
is, well, when we observe these things such as

661
00:37:04.969 --> 00:37:07.770
an electron, well, we observe the properties, right, we,

662
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.570
we can measure the charge and the spin and

663
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.250
the mass. But once we take those properties away,

664
00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:17.040
where, where's the, where's the substance? We can't observe

665
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.719
the substance, we can't, we can't point to the

666
00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:23.169
substance uh unless it's just a matter that uh

667
00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:27.500
uh constitutes uh the uh the, the object. But

668
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.719
then if you take the mass and the, and,

669
00:37:29.729 --> 00:37:31.669
and all that away, then then that seems to

670
00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:34.820
be where the matter goes as well. So um

671
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:37.760
that's a, that's a nice way to, to immediately

672
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.860
problematic the, the distinction between substance and property. And

673
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.830
of course, some people think that there are no

674
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.540
substances, there's just properties bundled together. So a bundle

675
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.689
theory of properties would say that well, that's all

676
00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.429
there is to be an electron, it's to have

677
00:37:50.439 --> 00:37:53.399
those properties. But then you still have a problem

678
00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:55.790
of saying, well, what, why do those properties go

679
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.679
together? What unifies those properties into a single object?

680
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.830
And that's the to problematic the other side of

681
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.540
it. So, so I think it's nice to think

682
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.780
about uh the uh the, the obvious thing that

683
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.510
uh the obvious uh distinction that we, we can

684
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.479
make here. But uh the difficulty of actually uh

685
00:38:16.489 --> 00:38:20.219
making either one of those solutions uh work. But,

686
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.719
but by the way, when we talk here about

687
00:38:24.729 --> 00:38:30.540
substances, we are assuming a substance ontology, right? Because

688
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.669
there are, there's also other alternatives like a process

689
00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:38.925
ontology. And I've just recently started getting into this

690
00:38:38.935 --> 00:38:43.074
on the show, I've got into process ontology, approaches

691
00:38:43.084 --> 00:38:48.915
to psychology, neuroscience, biology and other scientific disciplines. But

692
00:38:48.925 --> 00:38:52.435
we are making that assumption here, right? That substance

693
00:38:52.445 --> 00:38:54.875
ontology is correct.

694
00:38:55.909 --> 00:38:58.719
Yeah. So uh w when people talk about substance

695
00:38:58.729 --> 00:39:02.310
ontology, they, they generally have in mind something like

696
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.129
uh well, something resembling a sort of traditional Aristotelian

697
00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:10.860
picture where, where substance is, is uh uh in

698
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.010
some ways the primary category. Uh So uh so

699
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.899
you have to have a substance and it has

700
00:39:16.909 --> 00:39:19.850
to be uh characterized by some properties as, as

701
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.409
we just talked about. Um But yes, you could

702
00:39:22.419 --> 00:39:25.360
have a different kind of ontology. So So we're

703
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.750
just talking about the two categories. So you could

704
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.669
have a two category ontology, you have substance and

705
00:39:28.679 --> 00:39:31.780
you have properties. But uh you could, you could

706
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.090
just have the properties. People have tried to, tried

707
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.820
to get it by with just one category of

708
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.050
properties. But then uh some people have proposed that,

709
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.479
well, if you really want to capture everything that's

710
00:39:41.489 --> 00:39:44.060
going on in reality and in, in science, uh

711
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.719
you have to talk about events or processes as

712
00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:49.489
well as you as you've pointed out. So some

713
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.520
people think that we need a category of event

714
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.419
or process. Uh And indeed, that is uh really

715
00:39:56.429 --> 00:39:59.820
a fundamental category because things develop over time, uh

716
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.919
like processes do and we can't really understand um

717
00:40:04.129 --> 00:40:08.820
what reality without, you know, including that dimension as

718
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.979
a fundamental part of it. So I think that

719
00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:15.139
that's something that motivates process onto uh biological processes

720
00:40:15.149 --> 00:40:17.850
in particular if we want to understand those. Um

721
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:19.199
So, um

722
00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:22.080
yeah, but by the way, as you understand it

723
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:26.250
uh process onto, do you think that they are

724
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.139
completely excluding? I, I mean, to put it perhaps

725
00:40:31.149 --> 00:40:37.949
in simplistic terms, uh things, substances, objects out there

726
00:40:37.959 --> 00:40:40.709
beca because I mean, I mean, maybe again, this

727
00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:43.909
is perhaps some of the limitations that are inherent

728
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:47.800
to uh the way we approach science in the

729
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.649
West. This is something that I've already also talked

730
00:40:50.659 --> 00:40:52.879
about on the show. I mean, we tend to

731
00:40:52.889 --> 00:40:57.489
think about uh things about atoms, for example, electrons.

732
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.699
And perhaps we're going to get into that later

733
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:02.120
on when we talk, when we talk about building

734
00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:06.520
blocks. But um me even the process onto unless

735
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.889
you just uh talk uh about things in mathematical

736
00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:13.719
terms, like in complexity science, I mean, you don't

737
00:41:13.729 --> 00:41:18.719
need to use terms like atoms, electrons. Uh I,

738
00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:23.459
I don't know, um personality traits or something like

739
00:41:23.469 --> 00:41:26.090
that. I if you just want to uh uh

740
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:31.040
present things, method in mathematical terms, but uh even

741
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.100
in psychology and neuroscience and so on, people still

742
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.899
talk about uh uh things. I mean, it's, it's

743
00:41:37.909 --> 00:41:42.340
not just the process itself but a thing. So

744
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.989
uh I mean, are they excluding co or completely

745
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.560
excluding something that we would call uh substances or

746
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.239
that people in metaphysics would understand their substances or?

747
00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.399
So uh so not necessarily. So you could, you

748
00:41:58.409 --> 00:42:01.750
could think that processes or events are a fundamental

749
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.370
ontological category, but you could still also accept substances,

750
00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:07.719
you know, processes could be something that happens to

751
00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:10.520
the substances and the substances carry their properties with

752
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.760
them through this process or something like that. So,

753
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.840
uh uh you know, you could have, you could

754
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.620
have uh as you know, I had 10 categories,

755
00:42:19.629 --> 00:42:23.919
fundamental categories. Um AND some of them included events

756
00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:27.699
like uh categories, uh contemporary metaphysicians try to get

757
00:42:27.709 --> 00:42:31.750
away with fewer ontological categories. So you, you would

758
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.100
see a trend that, well, if you can get

759
00:42:34.195 --> 00:42:37.205
way just with processes, you, you, you should probably

760
00:42:37.215 --> 00:42:42.284
try that. And similarly, um uh there are people

761
00:42:42.294 --> 00:42:45.175
who think that relations are the fundamental category. So

762
00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:48.344
structural realism is, is a position in this space

763
00:42:48.354 --> 00:42:50.645
where you, where you try to eliminate the category

764
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:54.729
of substance. And uh uh and just uh say

765
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:58.060
that um relations are, are the more fundamental or

766
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.790
at least equally fundamental as, as as the things.

767
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.209
So, so, you know, all of these options are

768
00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:06.419
open in the, in the logical uh space, but

769
00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:09.199
all other things being equal, if you think you

770
00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:11.399
can do all the explaining you need in science

771
00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:14.959
and in metaphysics with fewer categories, then you should,

772
00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:17.389
you know, get a get by with fewer categories

773
00:43:17.399 --> 00:43:20.754
that I think that's a widely shared sharing motivation.

774
00:43:21.044 --> 00:43:24.375
OK. So could you tell us now what is

775
00:43:24.385 --> 00:43:28.705
uh first philosophy, what it really means? Because, II,

776
00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:31.685
I mean, when I was 18 years old, I

777
00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:36.485
ventured into reading the carts uh meditations on first

778
00:43:36.495 --> 00:43:41.854
philosophy. And perhaps you now can finally explain to

779
00:43:41.864 --> 00:43:44.735
me what that really means because back then I

780
00:43:44.745 --> 00:43:46.584
was really confused,

781
00:43:47.879 --> 00:43:51.610
good. Um I think I mentioned uh first philosophy

782
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.050
in passing uh in, in uh in giving my

783
00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.570
Aristotelian motivation. So it, it, it's a term that

784
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.860
comes from, from Aristotle, OK. Descartes was reflecting on,

785
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.580
on the same, same topic and, and, and many

786
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.709
people after him. But um but it's an Aristotelian

787
00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:12.020
idea um where metaphysics is something like um the

788
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:17.560
foundation of our um of our philosophical inquiry. So

789
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.649
um uh so then if you study, if you

790
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.540
study some of the so called special sciences, um

791
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.149
you study biology or you study physics, you know,

792
00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:32.040
I Aristotle physics uh included here, then, then those

793
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.600
would be uh somehow more constrained areas of inquiry,

794
00:44:36.719 --> 00:44:39.820
whereas metaphysics would be studying the whole of reality.

795
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:43.659
Uh And uh and not perhaps going into the

796
00:44:43.669 --> 00:44:45.820
same level of detail, but all those other things

797
00:44:46.229 --> 00:44:49.719
now, maybe, maybe from a contemporary perspective, you, you

798
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:52.510
could just talk about philosophy and then the special

799
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.709
sciences. Um BUT metaphysics, at least to, to my

800
00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:57.939
mind does have this sort of a prior role

801
00:44:57.979 --> 00:45:00.310
um to, to other areas of uh of, of

802
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.514
philosophy. Um PRECISELY because you can't really say very

803
00:45:04.524 --> 00:45:08.074
much about any of the specialist topics such as,

804
00:45:08.084 --> 00:45:12.215
you know, ethics or, or indeed, epistemology, if you

805
00:45:12.225 --> 00:45:14.264
don't have some idea of what, what the metaphysics

806
00:45:14.274 --> 00:45:17.475
are like. Um Now that doesn't necessarily mean that

807
00:45:17.485 --> 00:45:20.879
you always start um in a temporal order first

808
00:45:20.889 --> 00:45:23.270
doing metaphysics and then doing these other things. Uh

809
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.189
It's, it's more of a, more of an ontological

810
00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:30.050
claim that uh that you need a metaphysical underpinning

811
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.030
for whatever it is that you're doing because you

812
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.790
can't otherwise uh you know, constrain your inquiry in

813
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.350
the, in the correct way if you like. Um

814
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.129
NOT sure if that's going to uh solve all

815
00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:44.310
your, your problems from your, from your youth and

816
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.209
reading the car. But uh but I hope it,

817
00:45:46.219 --> 00:45:46.989
it makes sense.

818
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.879
Yeah. No, it makes sense. And another thing that

819
00:45:50.889 --> 00:45:53.120
I read about in your work is about the

820
00:45:53.129 --> 00:45:57.840
notion of a minimal truth maker. So what is

821
00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.729
that, what we, what are we talking about here

822
00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:04.300
in the context of uh Metta metaphysics?

823
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.139
Uh Good. So uh uh to keep it simple,

824
00:46:09.149 --> 00:46:13.739
let's, let's first uh just uh uh specify what,

825
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.360
what a truth maker is. So the truth maker

826
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.370
is, is thought to be something. Um I mean,

827
00:46:19.379 --> 00:46:21.300
people have different views about exactly how this is

828
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.300
to be specified, but it's, it's something that makes

829
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:28.860
a given sentence, a given proposition true. So if

830
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.949
you have a uh if you have a uh

831
00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:36.020
a claim such as there are electrons in the

832
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.659
world, well, that claim we, we think is true

833
00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:42.719
and it's made true by uh by the fact

834
00:46:42.729 --> 00:46:45.760
that there are electrons or indeed by the actual

835
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.689
electrons, the entities that uh that exist, you know,

836
00:46:48.699 --> 00:46:52.310
assuming that they exist. So, uh we want to

837
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.510
be able to, to track the truth values of

838
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.060
our, of our sentences, the truth of our propositions.

839
00:46:58.229 --> 00:47:00.350
And to do so we need to be able

840
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.169
to uh uh give uh uh or point to

841
00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:07.270
the, the relevant truth maker. So, so the proposition

842
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.060
or the sentence would be the truth bearer and

843
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.590
whatever makes it true uh is the truth maker

844
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.260
Um So some people just talk about facts, like

845
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.610
I mentioned the fact that there are electrons, but

846
00:47:17.649 --> 00:47:20.169
the fact that there are electrons could uh be

847
00:47:20.179 --> 00:47:23.060
thought to consist of uh of the actual uh

848
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:28.020
material things in the world, the electrons now. Uh

849
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.080
So that's, that's, I think a fairly intuitive sense

850
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.610
of uh of, of a, of truth maker. So,

851
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.449
so we need something that makes things true. There

852
00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:40.590
might be things that are um uh you know,

853
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.360
that where there's difficult to point to the truth

854
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:45.310
maker such as uh some necessary truths. Uh uh

855
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.360
And there's a discussion about these things. But uh

856
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:52.030
but these are, these are kind of uh uh

857
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:56.050
specific uh specific issues of how you, you specify

858
00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.649
the truth maker theory. So you might think that

859
00:47:57.659 --> 00:47:59.739
not all truths need truth maker in this sort

860
00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.030
of this sort of way as well. But I

861
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.149
do think that the notion of, of minimal truth

862
00:48:05.159 --> 00:48:07.750
maker that you've mentioned has a, has a special

863
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.469
importance because uh you might say things like this,

864
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.959
you know, someone asks, well, um what, what makes

865
00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:18.080
it true that there are, there are electrons, what,

866
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:21.320
what makes it, what makes anything true? And someone

867
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.830
can give you an answer that that is correct,

868
00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.639
strictly speaking, which is to say that well, the

869
00:48:25.649 --> 00:48:28.389
world, the world makes it. So, you know, the

870
00:48:28.399 --> 00:48:32.010
world as a whole, the universe, you know, you,

871
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:35.330
you might hear an answer like this and you

872
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.850
know, strictly speaking, it's, it's a correct answer because

873
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.129
the world does include those electorates as well. But

874
00:48:41.139 --> 00:48:43.020
it includes all the other things as well. It

875
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.300
includes, includes everything, absolutely everything. So just to say

876
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.620
that, well, all, all the true claims that you

877
00:48:49.629 --> 00:48:52.129
might utter are made to by the world as

878
00:48:52.139 --> 00:48:55.229
a whole is not very informative. And this is

879
00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:57.379
where we need the notion of minimal truth maker,

880
00:48:57.389 --> 00:49:01.120
which is just the uh smallest portion of reality

881
00:49:01.129 --> 00:49:05.129
that does make that proposition true. Now, using the

882
00:49:05.139 --> 00:49:09.110
same example, there are electrons, that proposition is made

883
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.120
true by any one of the individual electrons. If

884
00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:15.050
there are many uh that exist, you need just

885
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.310
one of them for that proposition to be true.

886
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.229
Uh But uh you don't need to mention anything

887
00:49:21.239 --> 00:49:23.040
further than that first one of them that you

888
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.070
encounter to uh uh to give, you know, the

889
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.219
full truth maker for that, for that uh proposition

890
00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:34.570
as it were. So uh uh we want to

891
00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.560
be, we want to be able to track uh

892
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.879
the truth of the of whatever claims we made

893
00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:41.110
as accurately as possible. We might not always be

894
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.699
in a position to do so, in which case,

895
00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:45.340
we could go to the higher level. But that's,

896
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.040
that's the goal

897
00:49:46.709 --> 00:49:52.239
a and what are natural kinds? I mean, when

898
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.919
we in philosophy, people refer to natural kinds, what

899
00:49:56.929 --> 00:49:59.080
do they mean by that

900
00:50:01.209 --> 00:50:04.949
good? Um This is a topic that I've uh

901
00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:08.899
I've written a lot about and uh I actually

902
00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:11.800
think that natural kinds are one of the fundamental

903
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:15.340
categories. Uh One of the fundamental anthology categories which

904
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:20.280
we've talked about. So um the good way to

905
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.310
think about this is, is uh is by, by

906
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.879
mentioning those examples, I've been using the electron example

907
00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:28.939
all the time. Uh So electrons would be uh

908
00:50:28.949 --> 00:50:31.850
a potential uh example of a, of a natural

909
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.560
kind as would be things like uh water or

910
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:40.100
gold or uh you know, things like that. Also

911
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:44.370
biological species I mentioned as, as candidates, there's controversy

912
00:50:44.379 --> 00:50:48.189
about what exactly uh should be, should be contained

913
00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:51.709
in, in, in those natural kinds. And uh people

914
00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:56.229
debate especially about whether things like psychological kinds. I

915
00:50:56.239 --> 00:51:00.270
mentioned depression before more social kinds such as money

916
00:51:01.149 --> 00:51:04.909
or, you know, race or gender would, would those

917
00:51:04.919 --> 00:51:10.649
be natural kinds? Um Either way uh what makes

918
00:51:10.659 --> 00:51:14.120
a natural kind real is, is often thought to

919
00:51:14.129 --> 00:51:17.320
be something like that criteria of mind independence. In

920
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.280
which case, some of those social kinds that I

921
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:22.959
mentioned would be uh immediately problematic, but they're less

922
00:51:22.969 --> 00:51:27.270
problematic if we specify that mind dependence criterion a

923
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.209
bit more. But, but usually uh the sort of

924
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:35.409
less controversial examples are supposed to be more fundamental

925
00:51:35.419 --> 00:51:38.639
uh kinds such as such as those chemical kinds,

926
00:51:38.649 --> 00:51:43.229
you know, gold uh or water or indeed electrons.

927
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.209
But there's debates about all of these um as

928
00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:49.850
as a matter of fact. But um I think

929
00:51:50.669 --> 00:51:53.429
the sort of broader motivation here is to answer

930
00:51:53.439 --> 00:51:55.169
one of the questions that I mentioned earlier, which

931
00:51:55.179 --> 00:51:58.810
is what um what keeps the properties together of

932
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.449
uh of something like an electron. Well, if you

933
00:52:01.459 --> 00:52:05.879
can uh refer to the natural kind, uh universal

934
00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:09.560
that is underlying uh any kind of natural kind

935
00:52:09.649 --> 00:52:12.060
such as an electron, then that would be responsible

936
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.689
for keeping those properties uh together uh whether or

937
00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.209
not you have substances in fact.

938
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.010
So uh I mean, I guess that it's important

939
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.570
to keep in mind here that when people talk

940
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:28.879
about natural kinds, they do not necessarily have a

941
00:52:28.889 --> 00:52:32.649
reductionist approach to them. There is they are not

942
00:52:32.659 --> 00:52:37.209
necessarily trying to reduce everything to physics. For example,

943
00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:39.810
as some people try to do or some people

944
00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.169
suggest that we should do.

945
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:47.270
Right? Yeah, that's true. So um some people take

946
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.270
the view in philo science that uh a natural

947
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.110
kind is whatever we need um in in science

948
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:59.129
to um uh make inductive generalizations and, and predictions.

949
00:52:59.139 --> 00:53:01.679
So, and you might think that you need all

950
00:53:01.689 --> 00:53:04.810
sorts of higher level kinds for that purpose, including

951
00:53:04.979 --> 00:53:08.350
uh psychological kinds that, that we've, we've mentioned here.

952
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.949
Um And you might think that there's nothing particularly

953
00:53:11.959 --> 00:53:18.959
um uh uh well, particularly metaphysically interesting behind those

954
00:53:18.969 --> 00:53:21.840
things except that they are a useful epistemic tool.

955
00:53:21.989 --> 00:53:24.350
So that might be, you might take a sort

956
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.600
of an instrumental view of, of kinds as well.

957
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.800
Uh So, so it depends on, on what you,

958
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:32.179
what you regard natural kinds to be, uh what

959
00:53:32.189 --> 00:53:35.020
their reality is, is in this sense. But you're

960
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:36.560
right to say that you don't have to be

961
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:41.449
reductionist, uh about, uh, about kinds. Um, ALTHOUGH I'm

962
00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:43.889
sympathetic to some, some of the more reduction views

963
00:53:43.899 --> 00:53:44.669
about them, I should say.

964
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.649
Yeah. No, I, I mean, I actually have to

965
00:53:47.659 --> 00:53:50.070
tell you that I, I used to be one

966
00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.770
of those people that thought that perhaps we should

967
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:58.189
try to idealistically reduce everything to physics, but perhaps

968
00:53:58.199 --> 00:54:00.909
the way I got out of there was not

969
00:54:00.919 --> 00:54:04.080
very common, it was just that uh I noticed

970
00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:07.030
that I was not intelligent enough to, to deal

971
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.739
with physics. I just prefer to deal with things

972
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:18.120
in biological, even chemical and psychological terms. It's easier

973
00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:18.560
for me.

974
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:21.830
I uh if I can add one thing on

975
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.409
that, I think uh we shouldn't confuse the reductionist

976
00:54:25.419 --> 00:54:28.949
project as, as uh um you know, reducing everything

977
00:54:28.959 --> 00:54:32.169
to the, to the language of theoretical or fundamental

978
00:54:32.179 --> 00:54:34.260
physics if you like. So you could still, you

979
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.209
could still hold on to those uh uh terms,

980
00:54:37.219 --> 00:54:40.360
the biological concepts for instance, or chemical concepts, even

981
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.939
if you thought that uh metaphysically there, there is

982
00:54:43.949 --> 00:54:46.750
a reduction down there. But um I mean, that

983
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.929
doesn't mean that it's easy to, you know, perform

984
00:54:48.939 --> 00:54:50.659
that reduction. But I don't think that we have

985
00:54:50.669 --> 00:54:53.610
to eliminate all the high level terminology even if

986
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.479
we have a reduction.

987
00:54:54.729 --> 00:54:57.350
Sure. And I, I guess that, uh, I, I

988
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.989
hope this is a good point to introduce this

989
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.270
topic because I had save it for later on

990
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.540
in our conversation. But since you've already mentioned, uh,

991
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:11.270
terms like fundamental here several times, what does that

992
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.145
mean exactly? Beca because some, uh, it might seem

993
00:55:15.155 --> 00:55:19.844
obvious, but perhaps the notion of fundamentality in metaphysics

994
00:55:19.854 --> 00:55:24.104
is more complicated than just thinking that, oh, it's

995
00:55:24.114 --> 00:55:28.804
something that is really at the basis of reality

996
00:55:28.814 --> 00:55:30.945
just to put it in simple terms, perhaps it's

997
00:55:30.955 --> 00:55:32.995
more complicated than that.

998
00:55:33.225 --> 00:55:36.649
Right. Well, it's so the way we use the

999
00:55:36.659 --> 00:55:39.419
notion of fundamentality in philosophy and metaphysics, it's certainly

1000
00:55:39.429 --> 00:55:43.010
related to the sort of colloquial use of fundamentality.

1001
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.790
So we talk about fundamental physics. Well, what does

1002
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.810
it deal with? Well, something like the standard model

1003
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.860
of particle physics, it lists uh uh all these,

1004
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.850
all these things that uh do not have further

1005
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.889
structure that we know of anyway. Um AND uh

1006
00:55:57.899 --> 00:56:00.889
and they sort of build up other things in

1007
00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:05.149
some ways. Yeah. So, so that, that is one

1008
00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:07.389
view and I suppose a fairly common view about

1009
00:56:07.399 --> 00:56:10.860
fundamentality. Uh BUT it has, it has in its

1010
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:14.550
uh background, the idea that uh the whatever the

1011
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.179
the bigger things are, what the higher level things

1012
00:56:17.189 --> 00:56:19.959
are, they depend in some sense on the lower

1013
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:23.139
level things. So, so often we, we are interested

1014
00:56:23.149 --> 00:56:26.510
in this sort of comparative fundamentality, we say well,

1015
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.179
you know, electrons are more fundamental than uh than

1016
00:56:30.409 --> 00:56:33.620
uh the atoms that uh they are part of.

1017
00:56:34.659 --> 00:56:37.250
Uh SO the, the part of is key there.

1018
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.889
So we, we're looking for the, the smallest parts

1019
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:42.810
in some ways, but that's, that is just one

1020
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.610
way to think about fundamentality. Um YOU know, the

1021
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.310
sort of a mereological part, whole structure. And in

1022
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.399
fact, you might think that there are reasons uh

1023
00:56:51.419 --> 00:56:55.270
uh to conceive of the whole, the bigger part

1024
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.270
of the universe as it were as the more

1025
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.489
fundamental one. So Jonathan Schaffer famously argues for this

1026
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.030
type of view. Uh BUT uh you might, you

1027
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.659
might look at fundamentality slightly differently as well. You

1028
00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:09.639
might, you might think that, well, it's not necessarily

1029
00:57:09.649 --> 00:57:12.080
the smallest thing or the, or the largest thing,

1030
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.770
but it's, it's whatever you need to get everything

1031
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.949
that there is. So what I mean by that

1032
00:57:18.959 --> 00:57:21.489
is that uh that you, you need some sort

1033
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.090
of a basis um and not necessarily the smallest

1034
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.889
thing basis, but some, some sort of ontological basis

1035
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.399
uh that is, is minimal and that you don't

1036
00:57:31.409 --> 00:57:33.850
need anything else just like with minimal truth maker.

1037
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.530
Um BUT it's sufficient to give you all the

1038
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.899
other structure or all the, all the other entities

1039
00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:41.840
that they are in the world. And that basis

1040
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:44.669
could then be uh complicated in various ways. It

1041
00:57:44.679 --> 00:57:49.659
could involve uh dependence, relations among its itself. Uh

1042
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.939
And it could improve, include bigger and smaller things

1043
00:57:52.949 --> 00:57:55.959
perhaps. But that would give you, you know, everything

1044
00:57:55.969 --> 00:57:57.929
that there is. So that's, that's one way to

1045
00:57:57.939 --> 00:58:00.300
look at fundamentality. You, you, you try to focus

1046
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.060
on the smallest uh group of entities or facts

1047
00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.580
if you like that, give you everything else.

1048
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.239
A a and when it comes to fundamentality as

1049
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.350
we tend to think about it in the context

1050
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.250
of physics, for example, I mean, I guess that

1051
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:19.969
the picture over time is getting increasingly complicated because

1052
00:58:19.979 --> 00:58:24.270
now we not only have electrons but also quarks

1053
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:28.689
and other smaller entities, I guess we could call

1054
00:58:28.699 --> 00:58:32.439
them. So, I mean, it really, if you're trying

1055
00:58:32.449 --> 00:58:37.590
to build a picture of fundamentality in metaphysics or

1056
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.100
reality, whatever you want to call it, then on

1057
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:45.469
the basis of the smallest possible entities that we

1058
00:58:45.479 --> 00:58:48.840
can find, uh I guess that over time it's

1059
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:54.310
getting increasingly complicated to really uh uh find the

1060
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.179
smallest possible thing that we can find out there.

1061
00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:02.860
Yeah, definitely. And of course, we've, uh we've, we've

1062
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.560
assumed a number of times or science has assumed

1063
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.370
a number of times that we're already there. We've

1064
00:59:07.379 --> 00:59:10.590
found the smallest things. Uh BUT there's further substructure

1065
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.939
that is, is just been discovered uh afterwards. And

1066
00:59:13.949 --> 00:59:15.770
who's to say that there wouldn't be even further

1067
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.600
substructure now, that doesn't matter so much for the

1068
00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.629
philosophical idea of fundamentality. Uh If you just think

1069
00:59:22.639 --> 00:59:25.659
that it's, well, whatever the smallest things are. But

1070
00:59:25.669 --> 00:59:30.110
uh if there were to be an infinite sequence

1071
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.620
going down, then that would be, that would be

1072
00:59:33.629 --> 00:59:36.120
a problem. And that's perhaps where you could motivate

1073
00:59:36.129 --> 00:59:38.320
some, some alternative views. So if there isn't a

1074
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.360
bottom level to be, to, to be discovered, if

1075
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.879
there is some, some sort of infinite descent of

1076
00:59:43.889 --> 00:59:47.179
uh of dependence on, on uh uh lower down,

1077
00:59:47.469 --> 00:59:49.310
then, then that would be a problem for some

1078
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.149
of these, some of these views. Now, of course,

1079
00:59:51.159 --> 00:59:53.239
there wouldn't be any way to, to really know

1080
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:55.479
that that's the case because if it's an infinite

1081
00:59:55.489 --> 00:59:57.350
descent, then, you know, you're never gonna get to

1082
00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.340
the end. But of course, there isn't really a

1083
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:01.760
way to know that there isn't such a dissenter

1084
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:05.860
either because, uh, you know, you, you, you've only

1085
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.399
seen as much as you've seen.

1086
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.399
Right. And, and perhaps, uh, I mean, in, uh,

1087
01:00:11.409 --> 01:00:15.219
to some extent this would warrant, or at least

1088
01:00:15.229 --> 01:00:18.110
some people would immediately bring to the table an

1089
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.040
anti realist position or stance and say something along

1090
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.820
the lines of, oh, I, I mean, there's nothing

1091
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:30.350
really more fundamental or smaller out there. It's just

1092
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.550
the way you are conceptually, uh, uh, conceptually parsing

1093
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.889
reality out. Right. Something along those lines.

1094
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:45.439
Yeah. Uh, I suppose that's true. I mean, I'm

1095
01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:47.300
not quite sure what the end result of that

1096
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.370
line of reasoning is though, is it just that

1097
01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.689
there's, we should just focus on reality as a,

1098
01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:55.649
as a whole rather than its parts. Um, BUT

1099
01:00:55.659 --> 01:00:57.875
you might still think that they are dependent relations

1100
01:00:58.135 --> 01:01:00.955
between those parts. So, so there's still questions that

1101
01:01:00.965 --> 01:01:04.354
we might, we might ask. Um, BUT, but you're

1102
01:01:04.364 --> 01:01:07.415
right. I mean, especially if there isn't epistemological any

1103
01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:09.735
way to know the truth. It might seem that,

1104
01:01:09.745 --> 01:01:12.344
uh, that it's, it's more of a conceptual um

1105
01:01:12.354 --> 01:01:15.129
exercise. Now. I, I mean, one thing that people

1106
01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:18.250
also say in this, in this uh uh discussion

1107
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.620
about fundamentality that is sort of supposed to get

1108
01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:23.780
your intuitions rolling is that, well, the fundamental is,

1109
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.110
is, is just what, what God had to do

1110
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:30.060
to make the world, what it's like uh give

1111
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:33.179
that sort of a, that sort of metaphor. Um

1112
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.100
Now, I'm not saying that I necessarily like that

1113
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.060
metaphor, but it does give you the idea that,

1114
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.330
well, you, you just get the minimal bits in

1115
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.719
place whatever they are, you know, they could be

1116
01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:46.639
idealistic pieces as well. Uh And uh if that's

1117
01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:49.280
enough to get you going with the world, then,

1118
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.639
then, then so be it. Um YOU know, the

1119
01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:54.620
alternative is to list every single thing that there

1120
01:01:54.629 --> 01:01:56.050
is in the world, I suppose.

1121
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.179
Yeah. And I mean, I guess that we also

1122
01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:01.310
have to keep in mind that when it comes

1123
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.830
to the more epistemological side of things here, there's,

1124
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.969
it's always the case that whatever approach you have

1125
01:02:09.979 --> 01:02:14.510
to epistemology, it doesn't necessarily have to be the

1126
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.350
epistemology that works within science or the scientific method

1127
01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.929
it can be any other sort of epistemology. But

1128
01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:24.879
when you really get down to it, there's a

1129
01:02:24.889 --> 01:02:28.419
certain number of axioms that you just have to

1130
01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:33.179
accept as true and can't really be proven. Uh,

1131
01:02:33.189 --> 01:02:35.689
OTHER, I mean, you just have to take them

1132
01:02:35.699 --> 01:02:39.469
at face value and believe in them to really

1133
01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:44.139
then build up the rest of your epistemological approach.

1134
01:02:44.149 --> 01:02:46.409
I mean, at the end of the day, there's

1135
01:02:46.419 --> 01:02:50.040
nothing that we can do about that, right? It's

1136
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.330
just how things work, I guess.

1137
01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.429
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, it sounds to me

1138
01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.959
that you're kind of describing a sort of foundational

1139
01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:01.754
epistemology where you have to take some primitives, you

1140
01:03:01.764 --> 01:03:05.004
know, that you express your commitment to those and

1141
01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.935
then you try to try to construct the rest

1142
01:03:07.945 --> 01:03:10.504
of your epistemology on, on the basis of that

1143
01:03:10.774 --> 01:03:12.705
and, and, and I mean, that's right, although not

1144
01:03:12.715 --> 01:03:16.344
everyone accepts that sort of view of epistemology either.

1145
01:03:16.354 --> 01:03:19.495
So you could have a sort of uh what

1146
01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:23.754
might be called a coherent view of reality. Uh

1147
01:03:23.844 --> 01:03:28.709
uh Where, where you have all, all your different,

1148
01:03:28.719 --> 01:03:31.050
all, all the different parts of your epistemic framework,

1149
01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.689
sort of um uh being related to each other

1150
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:38.459
and even being circularly dependent in some, some ways.

1151
01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:41.550
Um Now how, how exactly you specify that is,

1152
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.530
is, is problematic because um it seems to violate

1153
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.469
some of the basic principles that we have in

1154
01:03:47.479 --> 01:03:50.489
mind, which is uh uh that, you know, there's

1155
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.169
always an explanation. Uh And the explanation isn't circular,

1156
01:03:54.179 --> 01:03:56.270
you know, if you, if you just keep on

1157
01:03:56.489 --> 01:03:59.379
uh giving the same answer to, to the why

1158
01:03:59.389 --> 01:04:01.689
question, then it doesn't seem like you're giving a

1159
01:04:01.699 --> 01:04:03.310
satisfactory answer necessarily.

1160
01:04:04.229 --> 01:04:07.709
But are there many, I, I guess we could

1161
01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:11.139
call them coherent iss out there? I mean, to,

1162
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.290
to what extent is the uh how, how popular

1163
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.530
is this view?

1164
01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:20.590
That that is a good question. I, I'm not

1165
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.739
sure if I've got a good sense of how

1166
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:26.520
popular it is in epistemology more broadly speaking. But

1167
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.370
uh it has been been spilling into this discussion

1168
01:04:29.379 --> 01:04:33.790
of fundamentality, this idea of metaphysical coherent system. And

1169
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.189
uh I mean, it's not a popular view, but

1170
01:04:36.199 --> 01:04:39.760
it is a view that is um um I

1171
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:44.409
suppose defended by some explicitly and entertained by others

1172
01:04:44.419 --> 01:04:47.389
as, as one possible way to uh way to

1173
01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:52.360
understand reality where um I suppose you could motivate

1174
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.860
it with, with contemporary science as well because we

1175
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.629
don't seem to find those sort of independent building

1176
01:04:57.639 --> 01:05:01.489
blocks so easily, you know, uh uh for instance,

1177
01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:05.889
um if you consider uh quantum theory, uh things

1178
01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:08.685
seem to have dependencies that we uh wouldn't have

1179
01:05:08.695 --> 01:05:11.094
thought that they do if in uh in entangled

1180
01:05:11.104 --> 01:05:13.935
systems, for instance, and so on. So that gives

1181
01:05:13.945 --> 01:05:17.344
you, gives you a motivation to um to look

1182
01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:20.235
at, look at a more holistic or coherent explanation

1183
01:05:20.245 --> 01:05:22.814
uh of, of uh of the phenomenon that, that

1184
01:05:22.824 --> 01:05:23.915
we're exploring

1185
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.479
Yeah. A a and please don't get me wrong

1186
01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.100
you when my audience, uh, by asking you whether

1187
01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:32.560
it is popular or not or how popular it

1188
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:35.120
is. I was not trying to make an, a

1189
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:39.770
popular argument here. I mean, because that's also usually

1190
01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.955
a fallacy. It can be informed to some extent,

1191
01:05:42.965 --> 01:05:46.254
but it's usually a fallacy. So I was just,

1192
01:05:46.264 --> 01:05:50.364
uh, out of curiosity trying to know or understand

1193
01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:54.104
better if there are many people out there defending

1194
01:05:54.114 --> 01:05:55.854
this view or, or not. Yeah,

1195
01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:58.084
I understand that. No. Yeah. But it's, it's a,

1196
01:05:58.094 --> 01:06:01.929
it's an alternative that's receive serious consideration. I'll give

1197
01:06:01.939 --> 01:06:02.340
you that.

1198
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.639
OK. OK. So ju just to cover a few

1199
01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:10.719
more concepts here before we get into our last

1200
01:06:10.729 --> 01:06:14.899
question. So we've talked about things like natural kinds,

1201
01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:18.639
for example, what is essence, I mean be because

1202
01:06:18.649 --> 01:06:23.040
that's also another word that probably in common parlance

1203
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:27.260
we use in slightly different ways than the philosophers

1204
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:30.889
in metaphysics or Matam Metaphysics would use. So, what

1205
01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:33.120
do the philosophers mean by that?

1206
01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.679
Yeah. Good. I, I've, I've avoided the notion so

1207
01:06:36.689 --> 01:06:39.090
far because I suspected we might talk about it

1208
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.879
as well and because it's uh it's, it's a

1209
01:06:41.889 --> 01:06:45.239
notion that um has an air of mystery about

1210
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.750
it for a lot of people. So uh let's

1211
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.379
start with an example. So, so um uh we

1212
01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:55.300
talked about natural kinds and it's, it's sometimes said

1213
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.310
that the essence of a natural kind such as

1214
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.629
gold is that. Well, it's just the element with

1215
01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:02.679
atomic number 79. So you look at its microstructure

1216
01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:05.090
or something like that. So its essence or its

1217
01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.270
nature is that it has that sort of microstructure

1218
01:07:09.679 --> 01:07:13.290
or look at Aristotle exam. Aristotle's examples of essence.

1219
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.820
I mean, it's an Aristotelian notion really. So the

1220
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:19.110
uh the essence of Socrates is that, you know,

1221
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.850
his rational animal or something like that or capable

1222
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.020
of humor, what have you, you know, uh you

1223
01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.280
can give all sorts of examples. It doesn't really

1224
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:32.379
matter what the uh what the uh what, what

1225
01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:34.250
the correct answer is in, in some of those

1226
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.810
cases, the point is that when you give the

1227
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.750
essence of some entity, uh you, you're trying to

1228
01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.169
give something like it's like it's nature, it's uh

1229
01:07:44.179 --> 01:07:47.629
it's definition, but not just uh its definition in

1230
01:07:47.639 --> 01:07:50.979
language, but its real definition as Aristotle puts it.

1231
01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:53.459
So what it is to be that very entity

1232
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.560
and it turns out to be quite difficult to

1233
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.419
specify that uh you might start by listing uh

1234
01:07:58.429 --> 01:08:01.479
sort of necessary properties you think. Well, Socrates is

1235
01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:06.760
necessarily uh uh human uh Socrates couldn't have been

1236
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:10.199
uh uh you know, a, a plant for instance.

1237
01:08:10.739 --> 01:08:12.969
Uh So, so that seems to tell you something

1238
01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:15.399
about the nature of Socrates. But, but in some,

1239
01:08:15.409 --> 01:08:17.799
some ways that's just uh your, your intuition about

1240
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.910
it. Now, when, when I specify the notion of

1241
01:08:20.919 --> 01:08:23.459
essence, I, I like to, I like to give

1242
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:26.220
a very precise uh account of it, which is

1243
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:28.319
to say that, well, when you give the essence

1244
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:30.410
of a given entity, when you, when you state

1245
01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:34.959
it, you're stating its identity and existence conditions. So

1246
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.009
what it is to be that kind of entity

1247
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.200
and what it would it take for it to

1248
01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:42.689
exist. And that's saying something a bit more than

1249
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.660
just giving those sort of um intuitive uh accounts

1250
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:50.810
of it because uh for something to exist, uh

1251
01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:53.490
you, you also know, need to know what other

1252
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.660
things need to hold for that thing to be

1253
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:59.270
able of existing. So, um you might think that

1254
01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.759
uh well, you might think that the natural kind,

1255
01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:07.970
water which is often thought of having as its

1256
01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.810
essence as it being H2O well, in some ways,

1257
01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:15.890
I mean, that's debatable, but there's something true there

1258
01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:18.160
for sure, which is to say that uh you

1259
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:20.350
couldn't have water if you didn't have oxygen and

1260
01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:23.810
you didn't have hydrogen and not only that, but

1261
01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.140
oxygen and hydrogen need to be arranged in a

1262
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:29.859
specific way. Uh So that you have, you have

1263
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:33.029
the water molecule there. Uh So, so what you're

1264
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.500
trying to do when you're trying to then give

1265
01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.850
the, the essence of, of some natural kind like

1266
01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:38.540
that is, is to try to figure out all

1267
01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:41.689
those connections that it might have to other entities.

1268
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.700
Uh What are the conditions that need to be

1269
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:46.600
in place for it to exist? And that I

1270
01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:49.799
suggest is something that you, you get partially with

1271
01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.689
the help of science and, and partially by uh

1272
01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.879
by the help of sort of more better physical

1273
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:59.459
reasoning about it. Um But that's, that's just one

1274
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.939
view about essence. Uh SOME people would regard it

1275
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:04.140
as a, on a more conceptual basis that it

1276
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:07.819
is uh something that uh that we capture in

1277
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:11.839
language or that uh it's just the necessary properties

1278
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.859
that something has or you know, some sort of

1279
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.220
a bundle of the properties that uh that thing

1280
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:20.459
has. So there's debate about what exactly essence, how,

1281
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.379
how we should metaphysically characterize essence.

1282
01:10:23.069 --> 01:10:28.279
Do you think that uh scientists use terms like

1283
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:32.580
essence in a similar way that philosophers do? Because

1284
01:10:32.589 --> 01:10:37.529
for example, in biology nowadays, it's very common for

1285
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.930
us to hear from evolutionary biologists that we shouldn't

1286
01:10:40.939 --> 01:10:46.830
think about species in essentialist terms that there are

1287
01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:52.649
many anti essentialist stances in science out there, not

1288
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:57.299
only in biology, but also many times in sociology

1289
01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:00.779
when it comes to terms like race, for example,

1290
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.569
and stuff like that. So, uh uh I mean,

1291
01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.689
as a philosopher, how do you look at the

1292
01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.490
way uh scientists in those examples and others use

1293
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.850
the term essence? Do you think that it's similar

1294
01:11:14.859 --> 01:11:18.370
to the way philosophers use it or not?

1295
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.080
Well, it's, it's similar to the way that some

1296
01:11:22.089 --> 01:11:25.240
philosophers have used it in the past, at least.

1297
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:29.580
So, uh those those anti essentialist tendencies in in,

1298
01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:32.089
in biology, for instance, that you, you mentioned uh

1299
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.089
have as their source. Um KIND of what I

1300
01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.810
think is an obsolete view of uh of essence,

1301
01:11:38.819 --> 01:11:41.930
which is to regard essence as something that's necessarily

1302
01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:45.830
intrinsic. Uh So something like the DNA of a

1303
01:11:45.839 --> 01:11:48.790
biological species, for instance, so that is what, you

1304
01:11:48.799 --> 01:11:51.069
know, crypt and partner at one time when they

1305
01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.250
popularized, talk about as of natural clients might, might

1306
01:11:54.259 --> 01:11:57.839
have thought or certainly wrote. Uh But that is

1307
01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.689
a, that is a very constrained view of, of

1308
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.040
what, what essences are, it might be correct for

1309
01:12:02.049 --> 01:12:05.229
some things. But um uh from the description that

1310
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.439
I just gave you, uh it can't be the

1311
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:10.120
whole story because uh to give the essence of

1312
01:12:10.129 --> 01:12:12.589
something ID, IIII, I think that we need to

1313
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.370
give the relations that it has to other things

1314
01:12:14.379 --> 01:12:17.120
as well. So for a biological species that would

1315
01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:20.330
presumably in include its history or its uh or

1316
01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:24.319
its lineage, not just its, its DNA. So this

1317
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:26.759
is debated. There, there are people who still uh

1318
01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:30.740
defend forms of biological essentialism, but they are almost

1319
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:35.419
exclusively people who uh somehow include extrinsic properties such

1320
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:39.120
as the historical lineage that um uh biological species

1321
01:12:39.129 --> 01:12:41.430
might have. And I think that that's the only

1322
01:12:41.439 --> 01:12:44.450
way that we should ever have understood essentialism. So

1323
01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:47.069
there's a bit of a misconception and a bad

1324
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.750
reputation for the notion of essence because of this.

1325
01:12:50.459 --> 01:12:55.080
Mhm So we've talked about essence Uh I wanted

1326
01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:59.540
to ask you also about uh concepts like ground

1327
01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:04.209
and modality and then to understand the relationship that

1328
01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:08.970
essence, ground and modality have among them. So tell

1329
01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:11.899
us first perhaps about ground and then we'll go

1330
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:12.990
through the rest.

1331
01:13:14.049 --> 01:13:18.549
Yeah, good. Um So, so the notion of, of

1332
01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.319
ground or grounding is, is, is uh kind of

1333
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.180
a term of art in philosophy right now, which

1334
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:26.669
has been enjoying AAA lot of popularity in recent

1335
01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.589
years. Uh But we've already, I think because we've

1336
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.839
already touched on topics like fundamentality, it might be

1337
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.330
easiest to specify it in, in those terms. So

1338
01:13:35.339 --> 01:13:38.854
some people think that uh what fundamentality is about

1339
01:13:38.865 --> 01:13:41.964
is, is really just about what grounds what, so

1340
01:13:42.765 --> 01:13:46.375
I've thought about this in terms of dependence and

1341
01:13:46.384 --> 01:13:49.484
grounding is a type of metaphysical dependence relation. Uh

1342
01:13:49.495 --> 01:13:52.615
If, if usually, usually it's conceived in this sort

1343
01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:56.390
of way. So you might say that, well, let's

1344
01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:59.220
start from the H 2 h2o molecule. Uh You'd

1345
01:13:59.229 --> 01:14:01.419
say that the existence of the H2O molecule is

1346
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:04.689
grounded in the existence of the hydrogen and the

1347
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.899
oxygen or the fact that the hydrogen or oxygen

1348
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.390
exist and the existence of those atoms is grounded

1349
01:14:10.399 --> 01:14:12.729
in the, in the fact that their, you know,

1350
01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.430
parts exist and so on. And you might end

1351
01:14:15.439 --> 01:14:18.620
up at the fundamental level like this. So this

1352
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:21.390
is just a type of dependence uh dependence structure

1353
01:14:21.399 --> 01:14:23.930
really which uh which is captured with the notion

1354
01:14:23.939 --> 01:14:27.430
of of grounding, uh something holds in virtue of

1355
01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:31.370
something else. Uh There's, there's a bit of a

1356
01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:35.029
debate about how best to characterize grounding, what, what

1357
01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.140
the, what the properties of this type of relation

1358
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:39.529
is. And there's a debate also about whether this

1359
01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.609
is the only notion of dependence that we need

1360
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.870
or whether there are different kinds of notions of

1361
01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.540
dependence. Uh I'm perhaps more inclined to think that

1362
01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:50.370
the latter that uh while grounding is a useful

1363
01:14:50.379 --> 01:14:53.310
concept, we may need other notions of dependence as

1364
01:14:53.319 --> 01:14:56.720
well. But um it's probably the most popular way

1365
01:14:56.729 --> 01:15:00.240
to formulate this notion of fundamentality. It's just trying

1366
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.140
to find the ground level as it as it

1367
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:06.459
were or what, what uh everything bottoms out out

1368
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.709
on

1369
01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.500
and then what is modality

1370
01:15:11.819 --> 01:15:16.640
good. So, modality is um is a broader term

1371
01:15:16.649 --> 01:15:20.669
that in philosophical context is usually uh captured with

1372
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.220
possibility and necessity, but it includes other things as

1373
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:26.930
well in philosophy. Uh We talk about deontic modality

1374
01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.649
for instance. So uh I have a, I have

1375
01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:33.040
a duty to uh be respectful for other people

1376
01:15:33.049 --> 01:15:35.399
that would be a sort of a, a moral

1377
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:39.270
concept. Um But uh but the most common usage

1378
01:15:39.279 --> 01:15:42.209
is probably uh to uh to the notions of

1379
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:47.129
possibility and, and necessity. So, uh uh those are,

1380
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:51.109
those are moral concepts and mortal epistemology would study

1381
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.549
the epistemology of those moral concepts. How do we

1382
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.509
know that something is necessary for instance?

1383
01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:02.919
And so what is then the relationship between essence

1384
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.509
ground and modality.

1385
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:12.029
So um if we start with essence and modality,

1386
01:16:12.299 --> 01:16:15.459
uh they were, they were conceived uh at some

1387
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:19.859
point to be uh really the uh two sides

1388
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:22.020
of the same coin again. So you might say

1389
01:16:22.029 --> 01:16:26.740
that uh uh what is uh what is necessary

1390
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:31.620
is essential and what is accidental is, is possible.

1391
01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.930
So, um so I listed those necessary properties that

1392
01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:38.490
Socrates might have, you might give the essence of

1393
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.979
Socrates in this sort of way, but that isn't

1394
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:44.560
quite right according to sort of Aristotelian line of

1395
01:16:44.569 --> 01:16:48.430
thinking, um essence would, would be a prior notion

1396
01:16:48.439 --> 01:16:50.819
to modality in this sort of way. So all

1397
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:53.419
the, all the moral truths that you might have

1398
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:57.100
all the truths that you might state about neces,

1399
01:16:57.109 --> 01:17:01.379
necessity or possibility would ultimately be um made true

1400
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:03.959
in virtue of the natures of things, the essences

1401
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:07.040
of things. So if that's right, then essence is

1402
01:17:07.049 --> 01:17:10.200
the prior uh prior concept and you can explain

1403
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:14.390
modality or reduce modality to essence. Now, that's it's

1404
01:17:14.399 --> 01:17:16.819
a slightly controversial view, but there is a significant

1405
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:19.109
number of people in the sort of the r

1406
01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:21.850
Cilian camp who would, would subscribe to something like

1407
01:17:21.859 --> 01:17:25.040
this. And in fact, you could, you could try

1408
01:17:25.049 --> 01:17:28.060
to express this relationship in terms of grounding. So

1409
01:17:28.069 --> 01:17:31.709
sometimes you, you would hear people saying that modality

1410
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:35.509
of necessity is grounded in essence. Now, I actually

1411
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.100
don't think that that's quite right. But uh uh

1412
01:17:38.109 --> 01:17:40.740
that's uh how you might see that these, all

1413
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.990
these three notions would be related that that grounding

1414
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.470
is uh is something that explains these uh these

1415
01:17:46.479 --> 01:17:50.200
relations between different things and uh what the relationship

1416
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:53.859
between essence and modality is just this. Um But

1417
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.560
uh this is slightly complicated because uh if you,

1418
01:17:56.569 --> 01:17:59.279
I I just said that you could reduce modality

1419
01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:01.959
to essence grounding is not always thought of as

1420
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.770
a reductive concept like this. So you might think

1421
01:18:04.779 --> 01:18:07.589
that even if the higher level things are grounded

1422
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.430
in the low level things that doesn't make the

1423
01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:11.979
higher level things any less real than the low

1424
01:18:12.049 --> 01:18:14.729
level things. So it's just expresses a notion of

1425
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.379
dependence between them. So how exactly you relate, all

1426
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.689
these notions will depend a little bit on how

1427
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.609
you think about uh the correct way of of

1428
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.939
cashing out both grounding and uh and the relationship

1429
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.439
between us and some modality if you like. Mhm

1430
01:18:29.799 --> 01:18:31.290
That's a very brief introduction.

1431
01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:35.520
Yeah. Sure, sure. Maybe somewhere in the future, we

1432
01:18:35.529 --> 01:18:40.160
can dive deeper into the, the questions that would

1433
01:18:40.169 --> 01:18:42.609
arise here. But I, I mean, I would imagine

1434
01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.759
that when it comes to thinking, for example, about

1435
01:18:45.979 --> 01:18:50.379
what is, I guess we could say essential to

1436
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:54.930
a particular um category. Le le le let's say

1437
01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:57.930
we are talking about humans. What is a human?

1438
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.680
Uh I mean, we could say, oh, it's an

1439
01:19:00.689 --> 01:19:04.339
individual from the species, almost sapiens or it's a

1440
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:08.160
living being that has these or that kind of

1441
01:19:08.169 --> 01:19:13.080
uh psychological properties, for example, that distinguishes them from

1442
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.859
individuals of other uh species out there. Uh And

1443
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:20.810
we perhaps everyone would agree that when it comes

1444
01:19:20.819 --> 01:19:23.609
to the accidentals, I mean, the fact that I

1445
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.319
was born in Portugal and Portuguese, I guess that

1446
01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:30.500
everyone would agree that, that when it comes to

1447
01:19:30.509 --> 01:19:33.290
thinking about what the human is, that would be

1448
01:19:33.299 --> 01:19:36.439
just an accidental property and the fact that I

1449
01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:39.799
have brown hair and all of that. Right?

1450
01:19:41.799 --> 01:19:45.259
Um Yes, I mean, all, all that you say

1451
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:48.509
is, is, is right? But um maybe I missed

1452
01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.660
on with what question you want me to focus

1453
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:51.009
on.

1454
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.040
Uh I mean, I was just, I was just

1455
01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:55.899
giving that for, for the audience that uh as

1456
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:58.319
an example, I mean, in terms of the, perhaps

1457
01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:02.799
some of the ways by which sometimes philosophers think

1458
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:08.020
about something that is necessary or something that is

1459
01:20:08.029 --> 01:20:09.939
just accidental.

1460
01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:13.180
That, yeah, that's right. Yeah, I mentioned the accidental

1461
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:17.100
properties without really uh describing that. But yeah, that's

1462
01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:20.419
right. Uh All those sort of things or it's

1463
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:23.200
accidental that, that I'm a philosopher or that Socrates

1464
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:25.939
was a philosopher rather than a carpenter or something

1465
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:29.259
like that. Uh That's, that's usually right. But then

1466
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.120
when it comes to specifying the, the really necessary,

1467
01:20:32.129 --> 01:20:34.810
more essential properties, then that, that may be uh

1468
01:20:34.819 --> 01:20:36.879
a more difficult question.

1469
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:41.029
Mhm Right. No. Yeah. Be because again, we can

1470
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.569
try to perhaps ground it in a way in

1471
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:49.060
uh DNA, differences in DNA, between different species or

1472
01:20:49.069 --> 01:20:51.649
even do not think about species at all. And

1473
01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.970
cash it in nonbiological terms. What, what makes for

1474
01:20:55.979 --> 01:20:58.709
a human and what is a nonhuman? I mean,

1475
01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.544
it's, it's very complicated. It can and cash it

1476
01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:04.915
in religious terms if you want it. I guess

1477
01:21:04.924 --> 01:21:08.154
so and base it all in, I don't know,

1478
01:21:08.165 --> 01:21:12.634
revealed truth or something along those lines or some

1479
01:21:12.645 --> 01:21:17.145
sort of theology. But anyway, moving on, um I,

1480
01:21:17.154 --> 01:21:19.955
I want to ask you about another concept before

1481
01:21:19.964 --> 01:21:23.234
we get into our last question. So what is

1482
01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.354
the structure?

1483
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:28.970
Mm Structure. Yeah, we've, we've talked a lot about

1484
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:33.129
structure of reality actually in, in passing here. Uh

1485
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.689
BUT just in a sort of uh superficial uh

1486
01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:42.120
such just as a superficial notion really. So the

1487
01:21:42.129 --> 01:21:44.149
notion is used as a, as a sort of

1488
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.479
specific technical technical term. But I think that maybe

1489
01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:50.549
the best way to, to conceive of it is

1490
01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.529
as uh uh dependence relations. So whatever dependence relations

1491
01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.490
hold in the world, that's a notion that I

1492
01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.990
keep going back to as well. So whatever structure

1493
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.430
that is that there is in the world must

1494
01:22:03.439 --> 01:22:08.000
be, must be somehow um governed by dependence relation

1495
01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:11.640
of, of, of some sort. Um And they could

1496
01:22:11.649 --> 01:22:14.979
be the sort of uh existence conditions. So something

1497
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:17.370
depending for its existence on another thing that would

1498
01:22:17.379 --> 01:22:20.609
give you a sort of a structural relation. Uh

1499
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.649
And uh and some people think that when they

1500
01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.020
talk about structure, they are just talking about fundamentality

1501
01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:30.899
or grounding or the relationship between those. So all

1502
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:34.209
of these notions are, are very closely related. Um

1503
01:22:34.529 --> 01:22:38.729
But uh people might differ then uh depending on,

1504
01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.250
on how they specify one of those notions, what,

1505
01:22:42.259 --> 01:22:43.490
what happens to the others.

1506
01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.950
Mhm And, and so the final question I would

1507
01:22:46.959 --> 01:22:50.310
like to ask you is you wrote this very

1508
01:22:50.319 --> 01:22:55.180
interesting article where you argue that there are no

1509
01:22:55.189 --> 01:23:00.580
building blocks to reality. So what is the main

1510
01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:03.620
argument there? And by the way, what, what do

1511
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:08.160
you mean by building blocks in this particular context?

1512
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:13.040
Yeah. So uh I think you're referring to a,

1513
01:23:13.049 --> 01:23:15.459
a AAA popular article that I, that I wrote

1514
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:18.479
on this, um which I, I think that the,

1515
01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:20.959
the title is, is, is more provocative than I

1516
01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:23.310
would like to be because I, I, I'd like

1517
01:23:23.319 --> 01:23:26.439
to be more neutral on the question. But, but

1518
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:30.310
often, often, often we journalists want us to, to

1519
01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:34.700
have a Clickbait titles just to get that out

1520
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:37.240
of the way. But uh but II, I do

1521
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.879
take that option seriously in any case. So I'm

1522
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:43.729
happy to talk about it. So uh so start

1523
01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.029
with the building building blocks. So, so the building

1524
01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.759
blocks is just a um an intuitive term for

1525
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:54.609
whatever, whatever the fundamental things might be. So, so

1526
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.319
I like to think of it in terms of

1527
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:59.839
uh what I specified before. So the minimal uh

1528
01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.169
sort of minimal set of, of, of things or

1529
01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.049
even conditions that gives you everything else. But you

1530
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.759
could think of it just as the, you know,

1531
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.120
the standard model of particle physics or something like

1532
01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:13.270
that. Um So, so if those are your building

1533
01:24:13.279 --> 01:24:15.279
blocks, what does it mean if there aren't any,

1534
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:19.069
well, it might mean something like the infinite structure

1535
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.359
that we sort of uh uh passed, passed on

1536
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.919
in, in passing. So, so uh uh there are

1537
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.919
no building blocks if there is an in, in

1538
01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:31.819
infinite descent of, of, of structure, if you like

1539
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:34.899
going and, and there's never any, any bottom level

1540
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:38.839
that you, you encounter. Um But I think that

1541
01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:41.970
uh even in that sort of scenario, there is

1542
01:24:41.979 --> 01:24:44.500
a way to, to, to develop an interesting view

1543
01:24:44.509 --> 01:24:48.640
because uh even if you had an infinite descent,

1544
01:24:48.899 --> 01:24:50.560
uh it could be, it could be uh uh

1545
01:24:50.569 --> 01:24:54.399
repeating in some sense. So, so if you, if

1546
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:57.600
you think of um uh us finding some sort

1547
01:24:57.609 --> 01:25:00.189
of substructure in electrons, for instance, there's some sub

1548
01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.930
electrons and uh and then you, then you were

1549
01:25:03.939 --> 01:25:06.359
to find that uh there's some sort of patterns

1550
01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:08.649
that repeat in that, in that structure that you

1551
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.740
find from that, that maybe that you could express

1552
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.080
in a, in a, in an algorithmic form of

1553
01:25:13.089 --> 01:25:15.770
some sort. Uh Then that would give you a

1554
01:25:15.779 --> 01:25:20.919
principle that would sort of produce uh whatever you

1555
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:23.839
have in reality, the minimal conditions for producing whatever

1556
01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:26.419
else you have in reality. So even, even in

1557
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:29.020
that sense, um there could be something that could

1558
01:25:29.029 --> 01:25:32.709
be conceived of as a, as a structure and

1559
01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.419
as even potentially fundamental structure, even if you wouldn't

1560
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.629
really have that, that sort of building blocks uh

1561
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.799
metaphor in a, in a, in a sensible uh

1562
01:25:41.899 --> 01:25:44.620
sense because you wouldn't have the, the smallest things

1563
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:47.979
in a, in a way. So, um uh if,

1564
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:50.259
if we're open minded to, about what those building

1565
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:53.000
blocks might be, then uh then I, I feel

1566
01:25:53.009 --> 01:25:56.109
uh that it's unlikely that there wouldn't be any

1567
01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.740
but uh uh I would leave the option open.

1568
01:26:01.819 --> 01:26:03.950
OK. But, but do you think that if this

1569
01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:09.100
view would be right? Um That we, uh I,

1570
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:12.700
I mean, even going uh just a level above

1571
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:16.750
electrons and protons that it would make sense for

1572
01:26:16.759 --> 01:26:20.779
us to still talk about things like atoms or

1573
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:23.830
that we should just, when it comes to the

1574
01:26:23.839 --> 01:26:27.839
f the fundamental structure of reality, perhaps we should

1575
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:31.500
try to cash it out in different uh terms.

1576
01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.220
So, uh are you asking if this view were

1577
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:38.859
true that there weren't any building blocks in reality?

1578
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:42.379
Then, then would that would that undermine our, our,

1579
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:45.250
our talk of to build

1580
01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:50.500
our, our talk of um part, let's put it

1581
01:26:50.509 --> 01:26:53.790
in terms of particles. So OK, so, so perhaps

1582
01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:58.339
even moving one level above electrons and protons to

1583
01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:02.399
the level of atoms? I mean, would that also

1584
01:27:02.410 --> 01:27:05.189
be undermined in some way or?

1585
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:10.620
Yeah. Yeah. Ok. I see. Yeah. So, people, uh,

1586
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:14.680
people have argued that if you, if you didn't

1587
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:18.810
have any building blocks then, then, uh, uh, these

1588
01:27:18.819 --> 01:27:21.959
sort of compost entities like atoms, you know, wouldn't,

1589
01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.240
wouldn't get off the ground as it were because

1590
01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:26.299
you don't have, you don't have any basis for

1591
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:30.759
them. I don't think that's, that's quite right because

1592
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:34.790
um you would still have these dependence relations that

1593
01:27:34.799 --> 01:27:37.640
we've been talking about in place. Uh So you

1594
01:27:37.649 --> 01:27:39.830
would have structure in this sort of sense. Uh

1595
01:27:39.839 --> 01:27:44.839
So, uh even, even if, um even if you

1596
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.439
couldn't give, give uh the sort of reductive basis

1597
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:49.919
for those things, uh the, at, at, at the

1598
01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:52.240
level of atoms, for instance, because you wouldn't be

1599
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:54.160
able to point on the smallest things that they

1600
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:58.359
depend on. You would still have uh uh isolated

1601
01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:02.430
uh uh uh sort of networks of dependence that

1602
01:28:02.439 --> 01:28:04.750
could be informative for you. So you could still

1603
01:28:04.759 --> 01:28:08.379
say that, well, the atoms definitely depend on um

1604
01:28:08.459 --> 01:28:10.669
the protons and the neutrons and the electrons in

1605
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.640
some way. Uh And that would be informative and

1606
01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:16.839
true. Uh Even if you, even if you didn't

1607
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.600
know what, what comes after that, so it depends

1608
01:28:19.609 --> 01:28:22.220
how you, how you constrain that, that discussion. But

1609
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:23.779
I do think that it could still make sense

1610
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:25.220
to talk about these things. I mean, it better

1611
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:26.899
make sense because we talk about them.

1612
01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:31.319
Uh But, but do you think that this would,

1613
01:28:31.330 --> 01:28:34.359
uh, if that was true, it would warrant a

1614
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:39.459
sort of uh relational ontology instead of a substance

1615
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.959
ontology or not necessarily?

1616
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:45.089
Yeah, I mean, it could speak in favor of,

1617
01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:49.220
of some sort of relational uh ontology. Um But

1618
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:54.129
uh the trouble with that relational ontology, well, 11

1619
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.189
issue with relational ontology is that we often think

1620
01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.439
of relations as being relations between things between entities,

1621
01:29:01.859 --> 01:29:06.109
not necessarily substances, but between things or potentially properties.

1622
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.069
So it's difficult to, to uh get rid of

1623
01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:12.310
that idea. And in fact, there's the opposite idea

1624
01:29:12.319 --> 01:29:14.770
that you could, you could develop. It's that there

1625
01:29:14.779 --> 01:29:18.200
are really no relations, there are just uh the

1626
01:29:18.209 --> 01:29:21.890
things that have dependencies between them but, but those

1627
01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:25.660
dependencies are entirely explained by whatever properties those two

1628
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:29.410
things have. Uh SO that the relation between them

1629
01:29:29.419 --> 01:29:33.069
is, is entirely uh internal, we might say. So,

1630
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:35.740
uh let's say, let's say that uh you are

1631
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:37.549
taller than me. I don't know if that's true,

1632
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.370
but let's say that you are taller than me.

1633
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.020
Um Well, that relation between us holds just in

1634
01:29:43.029 --> 01:29:46.660
terms of uh your height and my height, but

1635
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:49.529
the taller than relation doesn't exist necessarily in reality.

1636
01:29:49.939 --> 01:29:52.540
So that this way we can problem either of

1637
01:29:52.549 --> 01:29:55.359
you really. So the relational ontology, uh are there

1638
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:58.560
just the relations or uh some sort of a

1639
01:29:58.569 --> 01:30:01.000
substance ontology or property ontology? Are there just those

1640
01:30:01.009 --> 01:30:04.560
things rather than the relations. And, um, it's not

1641
01:30:04.569 --> 01:30:06.740
easy to come up with a conclusive argument for

1642
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:07.850
either of you, in fact.

1643
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.870
Yeah, I guess that this, in a sense goes

1644
01:30:10.879 --> 01:30:13.790
back to something that we discussed earlier when I

1645
01:30:13.799 --> 01:30:17.759
mentioned process ontology and now I've been talking about

1646
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:21.430
it over the past few months with psychologists, neuroscientists

1647
01:30:21.439 --> 01:30:24.870
and so on because I, I mean, again, they

1648
01:30:24.879 --> 01:30:28.620
still mentioned the substances there,

1649
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:33.500
right? Yeah. Uh Even if you don't mention substances

1650
01:30:33.509 --> 01:30:36.049
by name, it's difficult to get around the idea

1651
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.390
that there is uh there's something that sort of

1652
01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:42.100
holds properties together or something that uh the relations

1653
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:46.359
relate. Uh SO uh or, or something that survives

1654
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:49.229
through a process, you know, has identity over time.

1655
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:51.430
Um UNLESS you look at the process in a

1656
01:30:51.439 --> 01:30:55.140
more holistic uh holistic fashion. So uh yeah, I

1657
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.700
think all, all these options are are on the

1658
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:58.279
table.

1659
01:30:58.779 --> 01:31:02.729
Yeah, maybe we need more Buddhists in science to

1660
01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.729
help us deal with, with real, with cashing things

1661
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:12.709
out in e exclusively relational or process ontology terms

1662
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.529
and just doing away with substances. Maybe it's a

1663
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.200
limitation of uh our Western culture. I don't know.

1664
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.450
Well, you could be, you could be right. Um

1665
01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:27.299
I mean, there are, there are examples of process

1666
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:29.790
onto just in western Western culture as well, of

1667
01:31:29.799 --> 01:31:31.600
course, but you may be right that it's a,

1668
01:31:31.609 --> 01:31:35.330
it's a more um uh sort of more well

1669
01:31:35.339 --> 01:31:39.609
researched topic uh outside the, the uh the western

1670
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.169
uh metaphysics if you like. And I mean, and,

1671
01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.129
and same goes actually for some of those uh

1672
01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.569
other topics that we mentioned the sort of coherent

1673
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:51.810
networks, holistic views and in indeed those infinite uh

1674
01:31:51.819 --> 01:31:55.819
networks as well. So, um uh so people in

1675
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:59.890
uh studying fundamentality have, have uh uh drawn inspiration

1676
01:31:59.899 --> 01:32:03.370
from uh from Eastern uh philosophy for these, these

1677
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:04.259
topic as well.

1678
01:32:04.439 --> 01:32:07.740
So, so perhaps we're taking in reverse and it

1679
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.910
would be the highest levels that would be the

1680
01:32:10.919 --> 01:32:14.729
fundamental, it would be actually culture, that is the

1681
01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:19.490
fundamental level of reality. And then you would derive

1682
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.060
all the rest from uh that

1683
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:26.299
perhaps. So, perhaps so, uh I don't know if

1684
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:28.069
that's still going to be realist.

1685
01:32:29.089 --> 01:32:33.520
Well, we, we would have to perhaps discuss that

1686
01:32:33.529 --> 01:32:36.640
with o other people as well and in another

1687
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:40.560
conversation. So, uh doctor uh or Thomas just before

1688
01:32:40.569 --> 01:32:43.080
we go, would you like to tell people where

1689
01:32:43.089 --> 01:32:45.040
they can find you and your work on the

1690
01:32:45.049 --> 01:32:45.520
internet?

1691
01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:49.490
Yeah. Um It'll, it'll be easy because my name

1692
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.560
is very unique if you can spell it, right?

1693
01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:54.259
Uh So, so Google is your friend but uh

1694
01:32:54.450 --> 01:33:00.299
my, my website is just uh TT A hko.net

1695
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.319
and uh all my papers are there, but they're

1696
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:05.970
also on Google scholar and Phil papers uh which

1697
