00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.250
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.170
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.970
today I'm joined by Norbert Peters. He's a teacher

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.569
at Waningen University and a PhD student at the

5
00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.969
Institute for Philosophy at Leiden University. His research is

6
00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:21.850
focused on an investigation of the philosophical and historical

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.194
roots, implicit founding. Suppositions and argumentative structure of the

8
00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:31.514
concept of wilderness and its practical application in Dutch

9
00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:36.154
wildlife conservation projects. And today, we're going to talk

10
00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:42.345
about botanic philosophy, Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, Wilderness,

11
00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.834
and some other related topics. So Norbert, welcome to

12
00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.625
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:49.514
Well, thank you for the invitation.

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.319
So what is a botanic philosophy? And I mean,

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.799
I have to be honest here, I wouldn't have

16
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.189
come across it if it wasn't for my patronanick

17
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.160
Punter who got me in contact with your work

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.680
and then also, uh, in consequence with botanic philosophy.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.230
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know that it existed. So

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.110
what is it?

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.830
Yeah, that's a good question. Uh, I mean, it's,

22
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.610
it's definitely when I get asked a lot, right?

23
00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.330
Because botanic philosopher is quite an odd moniker to

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.010
go by, especially because philosophy usually deals with human

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.319
affairs, right? It's about maybe ethics, maybe, uh, epistemology,

26
00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:35.129
maybe philosophy of science, but usually quite human centered.

27
00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.650
Maybe from the last decades, we get a little

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.879
bit of like animal philosophy as well, animal ethics.

29
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.150
There's even, of course, some environmental ethics, but Um,

30
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.720
yeah, botanical philosophy or plant philosophy is not really

31
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.519
something that, that is very, that is very popular,

32
00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.919
but I think it does, or at least I

33
00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.870
usually try to describe it when, or comparing it

34
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.919
to like a a botanist or a plant scientist,

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.309
right? I'm not a botanist or a plant scientist.

36
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.120
I've had a little bit of training in that,

37
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.199
but I'm definitely not a qualified botanist. And I

38
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:07.559
think the main difference is that, you know, as

39
00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.080
a scientist, you, you know, you're after facts, observations,

40
00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.639
experiments. And you, you know, you test new hypotheses

41
00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.000
and stuff like that, and this is not what

42
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.919
I do. But I, I do deal with, I

43
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.059
think something that's been noticed by multiple writers, philosophers

44
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.479
that Well, in, in, in science, you can, you

45
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.399
can do these things, right? Find new facts, new

46
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.639
observations, test new hypotheses, but you can also, sometimes

47
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.039
it happens that a new way of looking at

48
00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.160
the facts or a new way of, yeah, of

49
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.509
valuing the facts, uh, sort of arises, right? Sometimes

50
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.360
called a paradigm or a paradigm shift. And I'm

51
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.119
interested in, you could say I'm sort of interested

52
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.399
in the paradigm shifts that occurred in the history

53
00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.860
and in the history of humans interacting with plants.

54
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.149
So, How we have come to value plans and

55
00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.089
look at plants and and and um Yeah, I

56
00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.220
mean, but also just what a plant is, and

57
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.570
then you can see over time that our notion

58
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.490
of what a plant is, but also our own

59
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.970
relationship to plants and the way we look at

60
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.529
plants, the way we value plants has changed tremendously,

61
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.850
right? So, for instance, like 18, 19th century, you

62
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.369
see the rise of the notion of carnivorous plants,

63
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.839
insectivorous plants, right? Plants being able to lure, catch

64
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:27.720
and digest uh animal prey. Now that is a

65
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.809
very new way of looking at plants, and when

66
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.690
that sort of first occurs, that is a very

67
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.259
strange notion to botanists that there are these plants

68
00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.509
that seem to have sort of shifted the order

69
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.270
of nature and where usually animals eat plants, right,

70
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.259
or maybe pollinate them, but. Then all of a

71
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.029
sudden we have plants that start eating animals. So

72
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.179
this really distresses a whole lot of people in

73
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.740
the 18, 19th century. And I'm, I'm usually quite

74
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.619
interested in when this shift occurs and how it's

75
00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.779
received and how anomalies are, um, you know, sort

76
00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:04.020
of being identified in the old paradigm. And and

77
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.300
I think it's just very interesting that that our

78
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.389
relationship with plants has shifted so much in recent

79
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:09.649
history.

80
00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.660
I mean, uh, it's very interesting, and we're going

81
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.510
to get into some of the questions that you

82
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.619
explore in that discipline, but uh what a plant

83
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:26.619
is, shouldn't that be a question for the biologists

84
00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:28.579
or the botanists to answer?

85
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.820
I, I think for the, for the most part,

86
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.809
yes, although I don't think that any botanist or

87
00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.399
plant scientist is really trying to answer the question,

88
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.809
what is a planned, right? It's more or less

89
00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:44.290
implied what a plan is. Um, BUT that the

90
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.880
answer to that question, and that's what I find

91
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.890
interesting, that that the answer to that question has

92
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.859
had many different answers over the centuries, and, and,

93
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.779
and, and these different answers are are very um.

94
00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.290
How do you say that? Well, yeah, these, these,

95
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.459
these, these, these, the answers to this this question

96
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.570
have shaped the way we tend to view plants.

97
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:09.760
So, for instance, If we take Aristotle or Theo

98
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.079
Faustus, a a a a student of Aristotle who

99
00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.450
who wrote a couple of famous books in in

100
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.839
botany, so we're talking ancient Greece. The plant is

101
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.040
a very, very different thing, right? And, and for

102
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.959
a long time, their view on plant has been

103
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.510
very dominant. So, for instance, uh, mushrooms were still

104
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.799
part of the plant kingdom, right? Uh, A mushroom

105
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:34.829
was a, a non-green, uh, cryptogamic plant, uh, until

106
00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:38.359
20th century, middle 20th century, when we finally start

107
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:39.959
to see that the fungal kingdom is really its

108
00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.989
own kingdom, closely related to animals than to plants.

109
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.839
Um, BUT also things like, I mean, The meaning

110
00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.720
of a root, right? Um, FOR the longest time,

111
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.950
and we're talking millennia, people have thought that roots

112
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.160
were the feeding organs of plants, and that plants

113
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.279
really sort of ate, yeah, ground, right? Uh SOIL

114
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.679
together with water, and this was the nutrition of

115
00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:05.880
plants, and this is to some people still a

116
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.799
sort of common notion a little bit. But you

117
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.720
have fertile ground, right? Um, AND of course, they

118
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.440
take some things from the ground. They take a

119
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.200
couple of minerals, right? They take water, and roots

120
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.640
take care of stability, but the root is definitely

121
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.079
not the feeding organ of a plant. But for

122
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.359
thousands of years, this has been the central dogma

123
00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:26.269
in, in, in, in botany. And then sort of

124
00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.000
19th century, we see a shift in this and

125
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.079
people start to discover photosynthesis, which is really something

126
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.760
that, well, hasn't hadn't been around for a very

127
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.799
long time. So I, I guess In that sense,

128
00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.450
a philosopher maybe answers that question as well. What

129
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.489
is a plant? Or at least notices that throughout

130
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:48.250
the centuries, different answers have been formulated and these

131
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.130
answers are insightful as to what is a plant,

132
00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:53.179
but also what is our relation to a plant,

133
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.239
and uh yeah. That's why I think.

134
00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:00.160
Yeah, very interesting. So tell us about the concept

135
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.290
of plant blindness.

136
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.260
Yeah, so, um What's also interesting, and not only,

137
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.130
of course, we, we see plants, right? We can,

138
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.869
we can value plants, but it is noticeable. It's

139
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:16.630
something I noticed in my own life as well

140
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.269
before I started to study botany and get more

141
00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:22.869
into plants and especially the sort of philosophical side

142
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:26.230
of plants, that we have a huge indifference towards

143
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.230
plants. And that indifference shows it shows his face

144
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.839
in all sorts of fields, right? So, I think

145
00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.480
for the most part, even the plants in our

146
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.799
vicinity, we usually tend to walk by them without

147
00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:41.799
really paying any close attention to them. We don't

148
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:44.480
necessarily pay a lot of attention to the flowering

149
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.269
or the seeds of plants we don't necessarily use.

150
00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:51.160
Um, WE can definitely appreciate plants, we appreciate flowers,

151
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.279
we can appreciate a nice park. But to a

152
00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.079
lot of people, even very basic concepts in botany

153
00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:01.220
are not really part of general knowledge. Um. Usually

154
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.100
plants are more or less the background, right? Somewhat

155
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.579
neglected. Um, YOU can see it in nature documentaries

156
00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:10.420
where oftentimes plants are only the background, and really

157
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.540
it's animal lifes, sort of the soap opera of

158
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.019
animal lifes that has been displayed, um, and plants

159
00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:19.679
play a very minute role in that. So, so

160
00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:22.519
I think, probably in everyday life as well, but

161
00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:25.600
even in, even in academia, I notices as well,

162
00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:28.809
there's a lot more animal scientists, right? There's a

163
00:08:28.809 --> 00:08:31.079
lot of more animal science students and also in

164
00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:36.039
biology, when students start to pick their specialization, oftentimes,

165
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.400
they do not end up, uh, focusing on the

166
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.960
plant kingdom. Uh, BUT also in journals, um, in

167
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.359
popular science books, plants get a lot less stage

168
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.799
time, you could say. Than animals do, and also

169
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.919
of course than than than humans do, but I

170
00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:55.320
think, yeah. Usually, we tend to prefer animals a

171
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.669
bit over plants, and, and, and, and, and this

172
00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.640
indifference is I mean, it's definitely, I, I, I

173
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.400
think it's very noticeable, at least, or at least

174
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.630
when you start to pay attention, it's quite noticeable.

175
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.400
For instance, right, we, we look at the illegal

176
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.440
trade of endangered animals, but there's very little press

177
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.640
attention to the illegal trade in plants. So we

178
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.229
know of very many uh animal species that are

179
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.150
near extinct or going extinct, but do we know

180
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.359
of one plant example, right? That, that is, that

181
00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:27.260
is facing a similar problem. So I think You

182
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.099
can see it in, yeah, you can see it

183
00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:32.719
in different ways. Now, the word itself, planned blindness,

184
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.530
was coined by two Americans, two American botanists, James

185
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.099
Woner and Elizabeth Schusler, and they were just in

186
00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:43.390
academia and noticing these declining student numbers, but also

187
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.619
just a general lack of interest for for poor

188
00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:51.140
plants. Um, PLAN journals are being valued as highly

189
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.580
as as animal oriented journals, etc. ETC. So they

190
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.409
came up with this plan that's sort of a

191
00:09:57.409 --> 00:10:01.619
synonym for other words like plan neglect or zocentrism

192
00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:05.330
there that were already around, but um I know,

193
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:07.049
I, I, I go back and forward with the

194
00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:08.809
term. I, I, I like it in a certain

195
00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:11.049
sense. I think it's sort of conjures up a

196
00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:12.929
nice idea where indeed we have a sort of

197
00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:16.659
indifference towards plans, but then calling it blindness. It's

198
00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:20.409
a bit of a I don't know, it's, it's

199
00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:23.250
a bit of a medical metaphor almost. And or

200
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.559
at least it, it quickly raises the question like,

201
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.890
what is the cure to plan blindness? And I

202
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.609
think that therein lies a little bit of a

203
00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:33.049
problem that, oh, I'm not sure how much of

204
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.119
a cure there is, right? But maybe we ask

205
00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:38.130
if there's a cure because we call it plan

206
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.969
blindness, right? Um, WHICH, which also maybe sort of

207
00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:44.130
entails that we can maybe lose this a little

208
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.049
bit, or we can, we can open our eyes

209
00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:48.880
to plants a little bit more, but um But

210
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.549
that might be very difficult.

211
00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:56.590
And why do you think that, uh, for us,

212
00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.780
plants are usually part of the background and we

213
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.739
don't pay much attention to them. Is it because

214
00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:06.299
they're sort of, at least for the most part

215
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:10.289
static. I mean, They're just there. They don't move

216
00:11:10.729 --> 00:11:14.210
much. So, and we have to pay attention more

217
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.640
to other animals because they move and particularly because,

218
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.760
um, our predators are all animals, or, I mean,

219
00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:24.609
what's

220
00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:27.450
the reason? I mean, I mean, in, in the

221
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.729
literature, there is a, there's a bit of a

222
00:11:29.729 --> 00:11:31.609
discussion about this. Like, is this, is this a

223
00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:33.770
nature thing? Is this a nurture thing, right? Is

224
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.289
it, are we, are we indifferent towards plants because

225
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.869
Many of us are city dwellers, right? We interact

226
00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:43.989
with plants, but that's usually maybe aesthetic plants like

227
00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:47.830
street trees or hedges or flowers we see outside

228
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.109
that don't really have a utility to us other

229
00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:53.869
than just being aesthetically pleasing. Um, WE have a

230
00:11:53.869 --> 00:11:57.700
lot of, like, plant-based food, of course, plant-based medicine,

231
00:11:57.909 --> 00:12:01.099
plant-based drinks, but for the most part, I think

232
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.150
city life is pretty devoid of greenery or interacting

233
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.419
a whole lot with plants. So, Some people claim

234
00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:10.619
it's an industrialized society problem, right? There we see

235
00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:13.619
a lot more plant uh indifference, uh, and you

236
00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:16.409
could well imagine that an agricultural society or even

237
00:12:16.409 --> 00:12:18.729
like a hunter gatherer society, would have a lot

238
00:12:18.729 --> 00:12:21.580
more interaction with plant life and also therefore maybe

239
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.059
some more knowledge. And people notice this as well,

240
00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:25.940
right? If you talk to a grandfather or a

241
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.219
grandmother, they oftentimes have a little bit more of

242
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:31.830
a clue on different native plant species around you,

243
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.380
right? Um, SO it seems to be also a

244
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.859
little bit of a modernity problem, maybe. But then

245
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:39.080
you wouldn't feel all the way towards the nurture

246
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.000
side. Well, you're addressing sort of more the biological

247
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.440
nature side in in in the sense that Yeah,

248
00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:48.340
I mean, large animals, especially, of course, big cats,

249
00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:51.780
um, big carnivores, were a threat to humanity, right?

250
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.419
So, um, so it's definitely like we pay a

251
00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:56.659
lot more attention to that danger, right, that danger

252
00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:59.340
of wild animals. Now, of course, there's also some

253
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.580
danger to wild plants, right? Especially when you start

254
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.169
eating them. Um, BUT yeah, far less so. And

255
00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:07.780
indeed, like you said, they, they, they are, they

256
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.900
appear to us very static, right? And they appear

257
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.869
to us to not be doing a whole lot,

258
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.169
to be quite passive elements in a in a.

259
00:13:15.109 --> 00:13:19.640
In the environment. Yeah, so I, I don't know,

260
00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:21.799
right? In a certain sense, maybe it's nurture, maybe

261
00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:23.739
it's nature is is usually a question I pose

262
00:13:23.739 --> 00:13:25.919
to my students as well, like, where do you

263
00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:28.039
veer towards? Is it more nurture? Is it more

264
00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:31.169
nature? I like to look at it. So I'm

265
00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:33.159
taking this a little bit from the philosopher Ludwig

266
00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:38.510
Wittgenstein, where he says, Um, in your interaction with

267
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.159
the world, there can be sometimes a rise of

268
00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:43.830
an aspect of a thing, and he talks about

269
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.510
sort of this, this aspect, this sort of birth

270
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.460
of an aspect, and then also the, the, uh,

271
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:51.469
the, the hiding away of an aspect, or there's

272
00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:54.020
the sort of, uh, losing of an aspect. So,

273
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.840
oftentimes he uses images like the duck rabbit, or

274
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.989
you have this sort of necker cube, or these

275
00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:04.289
images where you can you sort of go. To

276
00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:07.330
two ways of looking at it, right? Uh, WITH

277
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.219
the, um, the duck rabbit, right? Sometimes it appears

278
00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:11.969
as a duck, sometimes it appears as a rabbit.

279
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.770
And he calls these aspects, and he says, sort

280
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.049
of like, if one aspect rises, the other one

281
00:14:17.049 --> 00:14:19.690
sort of disappears. So, it's very sort of, in

282
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.630
a sense, it's close to the notion of paradigms.

283
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.900
And I think it's more Aspects lighting up, right?

284
00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:29.830
So, for instance, we've been interacting with flowers for

285
00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:33.140
centuries, right? We, we've grown flowers, we sold flowers,

286
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.450
we kept flowers in our garden, but cross pollination

287
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.729
and the relationship between pollinators and flowers was really

288
00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:46.280
not. Seen understood until 18th, but really 19th century.

289
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.770
And that really gives a completely different meaning towards

290
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.530
a flower and what a flower actually is, and

291
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.809
that a flower is adapted to this pollinator, right?

292
00:14:55.849 --> 00:14:57.570
And that's why it has colors, that's why it

293
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.789
has perfumes, pollen, nectar, all these other things. Um,

294
00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:04.200
AND that's really like, I see that almost like

295
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:07.510
as an aspect, like you, because, for instance, Lina

296
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.510
is. He does not believe in cross pollination. He

297
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.349
knows of insects visiting flowers, but he thinks that

298
00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:16.119
serves no function. Now, you can definitely not say

299
00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:17.919
that Linnae is his plan blind, right? He is

300
00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:21.159
a botanist, most famous botanist, maybe of history, and

301
00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.559
yet he failed to see this. So what is

302
00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:26.719
this failing to see? So, I think in a

303
00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:30.150
certain sense you could say this blindness is also

304
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.650
maybe being blind to certain aspects of a plant

305
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.010
that arise later on in history, maybe. So, of

306
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.849
course, all of a sudden, when we do have

307
00:15:38.849 --> 00:15:41.729
this paradigm shift in the meaning of flowers, we

308
00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:44.260
all of a sudden completely understand, like, of course,

309
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.330
that's why a flower is shaped this way. That's

310
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.770
why a flower has nectar, that's why there's all

311
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.530
these other things. All these things seem to fall

312
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.039
into place. Um, SO, I, I, so I like

313
00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:57.280
to use like where it says aspect and aspect

314
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.679
blindness. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it correctly,

315
00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:02.760
but But I yeah, yeah, I think that's, that's

316
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.840
more um in line with the truth, I think

317
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.299
in a certain sense, or yeah.

318
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:13.640
Mhm. So historically, when did people start becoming more

319
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.840
interested in studying plants?

320
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.520
Yeah, so this is um This is a this

321
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.559
is a strange thing in the sense that Of

322
00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:24.440
course, we've been interested in plants for a very

323
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.080
long time. So in our evolutionary history, plants play

324
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.039
a vital important, like a vital role. Now we

325
00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:33.640
know of many of the other great apes that

326
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.679
are still there that they hold quite a lot

327
00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:39.239
of plant knowledge, right? A gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan

328
00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:43.559
are very capable of making distinctions between multiple plants,

329
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.760
right? They have plants that they eat from, they

330
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.520
have even plants that use medicinally. So, I think

331
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.469
in a certain sense, Primates have a a good

332
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:55.280
grasp of plants in their surroundings most of the

333
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.679
time, and of course, When humans are hunter gatherers,

334
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.080
plants play in a very vital role in in

335
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.589
survival. But then, of course, with, with farming, agriculture,

336
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.780
The relationship with plants becomes a lot stronger, I

337
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.719
think. But then it still takes an awful long

338
00:17:11.719 --> 00:17:14.390
time before they are really like an object of

339
00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.400
uh investigation, more or less. So, of course, in

340
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.118
classical times, in, in Greece, you find Some botanical

341
00:17:23.118 --> 00:17:26.388
works, right? I already named Theo Frosti, he wrote

342
00:17:26.388 --> 00:17:28.918
two, or from him we have two books on

343
00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:32.828
plants, um, which were quite influential and in classical

344
00:17:32.828 --> 00:17:34.698
times you, you will find some books and plants,

345
00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:38.639
but for the most part, this, yeah, for the

346
00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:40.718
most part this deals with plants that are very

347
00:17:40.718 --> 00:17:43.659
useful to human beings, especially plants that have medicinal

348
00:17:43.659 --> 00:17:46.629
properties, and for, I think in the early days.

349
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.859
When we see botany as a science arise, it's

350
00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:53.329
really a sort of sister sense of medicine and,

351
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.040
and, uh, yeah, health, right? So, so the apothecary

352
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.829
is really a garden and we take medicinal plants

353
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:02.750
from the garden and we use this to, to

354
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.229
heal ourselves. So the interest is very anthropocentric, you

355
00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:08.270
could say, right? It's, it's really what does the

356
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.349
plant mean for our survival and, and, and the

357
00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:13.750
plants that are important are those plants that are

358
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.130
important to our survival. Now, in, in modernity, and

359
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.930
this is sort of a little bit strange is

360
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.170
that we do find that botany is one of

361
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.520
the first natural sciences, you could say to enter

362
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.930
modernity. So, early modernity, we see, so 16, 17th

363
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:36.130
century, but 16th century, we see. Several modern herbals,

364
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.890
you could say, right? So, a herbal is, is

365
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.770
really, again, a book that is used by a

366
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.010
doctor or an apothecary to find the medicinal properties

367
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.160
of certain plants, but these herbals become a lot

368
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.800
more extensive, and also a lot more There's a

369
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.359
lot more scientific rigor to it. So, you get

370
00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:58.790
certain, like people like Leonard Fuchs, uh, Hieronymus Bo,

371
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.800
um Otto Bruenfels, these are like early botanists that

372
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.280
write these sort of modern herbals that seem, well,

373
00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:09.229
that are a lot more intelligible to us, right?

374
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.599
When we read them, you, you can already see

375
00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.969
that they are. Ordering plants in a, in a

376
00:19:14.969 --> 00:19:17.729
sort of familiar way to us. So to put

377
00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:21.410
the grasses together, for instance, and earlier herbals, you

378
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.849
could just find maybe an alphabetic order of plants,

379
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.579
right? Or a different order of plants, but In

380
00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:28.849
these modern herbals, we find a lot more information.

381
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.160
We also find information on where they grow, we

382
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.930
find some interesting attributes, maybe, a, a clear description

383
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.530
of the parts of the plants. So this really

384
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:43.560
rises maybe, yeah, early modernity. But like, real experimental.

385
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.900
Uh, uh, uh, PLANT science is really a late

386
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.109
child, right? So a late bloomer, so we're talking

387
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:54.030
18th century, but really 18, 19th century, we really

388
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.880
see the plant, you know, entering sort of the

389
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.380
laboratory and being experimented on a lot more heavily.

390
00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:03.910
But that takes an awful long time. Yeah.

391
00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:10.300
So, in modernity, what was the effect of the

392
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.449
romanticists on our view of the natural world? What

393
00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:17.339
role did they play?

394
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.130
So, so the, I think the romantic period, or

395
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.209
So this is a recent, or not recent discovery

396
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.910
I made, but This is something that I, I

397
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.109
find very interesting. I'm not sure if it's completely

398
00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.819
holds true, but You can see in the romantic

399
00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:35.979
period, we see, of course, a little bit of

400
00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:41.459
a critique on enlightenment, we see Um, also critique

401
00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:44.260
on the way science is being professed in enlightenment,

402
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.459
and one of the critiques that comes forth when

403
00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:49.630
it comes to botany is, is being addressed by

404
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.819
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the, the French philosopher, but also a

405
00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:57.469
bit of an amateur botanist himself, and In one

406
00:20:57.469 --> 00:21:00.949
of his final books, He sort of, he has

407
00:21:00.949 --> 00:21:03.589
all these walks, and he talks a lot about

408
00:21:03.589 --> 00:21:06.420
botany there, and he notices that in his day,

409
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.989
18th century, we see that plants are still part

410
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:12.469
mainly of herbals. And he sort of addresses this

411
00:21:12.469 --> 00:21:15.310
problem of, yeah, we only seem to find plants

412
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.589
interesting for as far as they help us survive,

413
00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.540
right? Or as far as they're useful to us.

414
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.550
So we don't really look at a plant, we

415
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.229
immediately pluck it out of the ground, we start

416
00:21:23.229 --> 00:21:25.349
to ground it up, and we start to make

417
00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:27.390
medicine out of it. And he says, do we

418
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.979
not What do we lose then, right? He's sort

419
00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:33.339
of almost calling for a botany for botany's sake.

420
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.479
Don't you find plants interesting in and of themselves?

421
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.270
And should we not be interested in plant life,

422
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.579
maybe regardless of human life. Now, this is always

423
00:21:42.579 --> 00:21:45.780
a little bit of an idealistic step because can

424
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.420
you really say that botany after that is is

425
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.859
becoming a science that's really detached from? Utility, profits,

426
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.089
anthropocentrism, not really, but it is somewhat curious that

427
00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:01.050
after so, you do find that, for instance, mosses

428
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.319
get a lot closer attention, right? Or ferns, or

429
00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:08.209
plants that usually do not foster a whole lot

430
00:22:08.209 --> 00:22:10.400
of attention because they're not very useful to us.

431
00:22:10.569 --> 00:22:12.170
You know, think of all the different moss species.

432
00:22:12.209 --> 00:22:14.209
How many of these species do we use? Not

433
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:17.910
a whole lot, but we do find Detailed microscopic

434
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.989
studies of mosses all of a sudden, right? We

435
00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:22.420
find people being interested in how do they fertilize,

436
00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:24.780
how does their sex life work? How do they,

437
00:22:24.949 --> 00:22:27.750
uh, how's does their ecology work? And it's not

438
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.599
just true for mosses, but also for, you know,

439
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.229
many other plants that usually do not foster a

440
00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:35.989
whole lot of interest. So we see a sort

441
00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:38.109
of in this romantic period, we see a little

442
00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:40.790
bit of this notion of science that science should

443
00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.550
be for science's sake, and botany should also be

444
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.640
for botany's sake, and that Almost the best thing

445
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.400
you can be as an amateur botanist, right? Somebody

446
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.609
who doesn't have a A stake in it, or

447
00:22:52.609 --> 00:22:56.119
no monetary, like, uh, how do you say advantage,

448
00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:58.770
but really just studies plants because he's very interested

449
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.170
in plants. And, um, in that sense, I think,

450
00:23:03.209 --> 00:23:05.770
yeah, I think there is some influence from the

451
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.890
Romantic period, and we do find a little bit

452
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.949
of this. Yeah, this this interest for plants in

453
00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:14.189
and of themselves because they're interesting themselves. And I

454
00:23:14.189 --> 00:23:16.630
think this is still something that we, that is

455
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.239
still a very popular stance nowadays, right? I mean,

456
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.170
also nowadays is, you know, many parts of botany

457
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.260
are not human oriented or are not are not

458
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.670
dealing with utilization of plants, but are, but are

459
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.989
just because we're interested in the ecology of plants,

460
00:23:32.069 --> 00:23:35.390
we're in the physiology of plants, etc. Yeah.

461
00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:42.630
Right. So one major, major figure here is Alexander

462
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:47.030
von Humboldt. So I, I would imagine that most

463
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.949
people would at least heard of him, but if

464
00:23:50.949 --> 00:23:54.819
not, uh, tell us about him, uh, I mean,

465
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.829
who was he, tell us about perhaps some of

466
00:23:58.829 --> 00:24:03.739
his main contributions and achievements, particularly when it comes

467
00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:05.750
to the study of plants.

468
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.270
Yeah, so Alexander von Humboldt is maybe not your

469
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.189
usual character to discuss when you talk about the

470
00:24:12.189 --> 00:24:15.390
history of botany. Um, SO like I said, experimental

471
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.589
botany arises in the 18th century, people like Stephen

472
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:23.400
Hills, uh, we see. Um, PEOPLE looking at plants

473
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.959
under microscopes, we see sort of first fertilization experiments

474
00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:30.800
with flowers and people establishing that plants are sexual

475
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.439
organisms and that fertilization and pollination is important, not

476
00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:38.959
yet cross pollination, but, but they at least know

477
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:43.810
that there's pollination occurring, right? Um. But then Alexander

478
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.209
von Humboldt is a strange character in this because

479
00:24:47.209 --> 00:24:48.969
he's not really seen as a botanist or discussed

480
00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:51.569
as a botanist. And in a certain sense, he's

481
00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:55.130
a home universalist, right? A polymath. He does many

482
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.650
different things in science, and throughout his life, we

483
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.760
can see this, right? He has a geology interest,

484
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.239
uh, volcanoes, he's very interested in, you know, weather,

485
00:25:05.569 --> 00:25:10.229
pre precipitation, ocean currents, all these different. All these

486
00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:13.709
different fields, but also animal electricity, um, and then

487
00:25:13.709 --> 00:25:16.829
plants, I think, play a far more important role

488
00:25:16.829 --> 00:25:20.630
in his life than usually is admitted by biographers

489
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.550
or people that write about his life. So, I

490
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.390
think especially nowadays, he's a bit of a more

491
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:30.109
well-known character, especially because of the biography uh by

492
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:33.260
Andrea Wolff, the inventor or the invention of nature.

493
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.790
I think this Place him a little bit more

494
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.310
at the forefront again, right? Uh, AS, as a

495
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.380
very important scientist, and she sort of sees him

496
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.880
as an early climate scientist or discusses him in,

497
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.560
in this fashion. And then you can, you can,

498
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.819
you can make a case for that. I don't

499
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:51.300
think it's a very strong case, but you could

500
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.300
make a case for that. But I think we're

501
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.020
also this polymath thing when it comes to Alessandro

502
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.489
von Humboldt is also a bit in the way

503
00:25:58.489 --> 00:26:02.089
of Seeing what his focus really is, especially when

504
00:26:02.089 --> 00:26:05.770
he's traveling. So, I think Alexander van Humboldt is

505
00:26:06.209 --> 00:26:09.170
most well known for his travel to South America

506
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.489
and North America. So this is, you know, uh

507
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:16.729
late 18th century, early 19th century, right? We, he

508
00:26:16.729 --> 00:26:18.550
travels for 5 years to get rid a friend

509
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.089
of his, um Bolon, who was a botanist. Um,

510
00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:25.640
HE travels to South America, North America, and, you

511
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.050
know, he I mean, again, he does many things

512
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.410
here, right? He studies many things. He studies people,

513
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.339
culture, uh, art, but also a lot of nature,

514
00:26:33.949 --> 00:26:35.329
right? AND a lot of, and a lot of

515
00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:37.660
different subjects. But you can see in his travel

516
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.849
very early on, even when he, you know, he

517
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:42.689
makes a stopover in Tenerife, which was common that

518
00:26:42.689 --> 00:26:45.650
day, right? You stopped to go to, uh, South

519
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.410
America, you stopped in Tenerife, and then immediately there

520
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.319
you can see that he has a different project

521
00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:53.489
in mind. He, when he's climbing the volcano in

522
00:26:53.489 --> 00:26:57.060
Tenerife, the Altaira. He starts to make a lot

523
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.900
of notes on the different vegetation layers on that

524
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.459
volcano, and to see sort of how are they

525
00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:06.500
characterized? What are the main vegetation types you would

526
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.859
find, right? So, near the base, he finds uh

527
00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:12.359
a lot of banana plants being grown, sugar cane

528
00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:15.500
being grown, you know, subtropical tropical plants. And of

529
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.869
course, moving up that mountain, you could find um

530
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.380
the laurel forests. And higher up, you find a

531
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.780
sort of pine forest, and even higher up, you

532
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.859
know, you go past the tree line, and it

533
00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:29.739
comes to shrubs and and alpine plants, and then

534
00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:31.449
you reach the sort of, you reach the top.

535
00:27:31.739 --> 00:27:35.650
And he sees a sort of An order in

536
00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.969
these, in these different types of vegetation layers. And

537
00:27:39.969 --> 00:27:42.609
when he goes to South America and he travels

538
00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:45.459
the Andes, and he climbs many of the, the

539
00:27:45.459 --> 00:27:49.420
volcanoes and mountains in Ecuador, but also Mexico, he's

540
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.849
starting to notice that this is not just occurring

541
00:27:51.849 --> 00:27:54.930
in Tenerife, this is actually occurring in South America

542
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.770
on these mountains too. You see the same sort

543
00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.969
of order and what he's really interested in is

544
00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:04.420
Trying to determine what really determines where a plant

545
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.430
grows, right? It's almost this He's coming from a

546
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.449
time when People like Linnaeus and other people are

547
00:28:12.449 --> 00:28:15.770
saying, well, the plants have their place because we,

548
00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:17.890
well, we have a creation, we have maybe a

549
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.410
Garden of Eden, and then either the plants dispersed

550
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.500
from the Garden of Eden, or some people think,

551
00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:26.569
no, God just places the different species in different

552
00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:31.750
places. And Humbel is dissatisfied with this this idea,

553
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.380
right? Because he sees a sort of order, but

554
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.869
it seems strange to say that God has placed

555
00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:40.469
all these different plants only in different locations. He's

556
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:44.079
far more of the idea that, no, it's more

557
00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:47.469
the elements more or less, the surrounding the environment

558
00:28:47.469 --> 00:28:49.790
of a plant that dictates what can grow there

559
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.989
and whatnot, right? So we know what cactus can

560
00:28:51.989 --> 00:28:55.229
grow in desert, you know, a conifer tree usually

561
00:28:55.229 --> 00:28:59.140
goes in a a boreal forest. Now, he As

562
00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.239
he's scaling these mountains, he's making a lot of,

563
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.380
he's taking a lot of instruments with them, and

564
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.410
making a lot of notes and observations on temperature,

565
00:29:08.579 --> 00:29:10.790
on the boiling point of water, the blueness of

566
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.339
the sky, the geology, animals, etc. ETC. ETC. RIGHT?

567
00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:17.729
He, he gathers all this information, basically to say,

568
00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:20.540
OK, if we know that a certain plant grows

569
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.500
here, maybe it's because of these environmental conditions that

570
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.680
it can grow there. And this is this will

571
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.589
become highly important, like 19th century when we really

572
00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:35.069
see large movements of plants, you know, uh, from

573
00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:37.709
colony to colony, basically, right? People take the vanilla

574
00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.829
orchid from the middle of America, all the way

575
00:29:39.829 --> 00:29:43.030
to Indonesia. People steal the rubber seeds of the

576
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.229
rubber tree in Brazil, they take it to England,

577
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.510
and they take it to Singapore. We see all

578
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.030
these movement of plants, and I think in a

579
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:55.239
certain sense, this plant geography. Alexander von Humboldt puts

580
00:29:55.239 --> 00:29:58.800
on the map, becomes really instrumental in finding out

581
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.670
where can we grow certain plants in certain places.

582
00:30:03.079 --> 00:30:06.430
So the British Empire's thinking, now, do we have

583
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.359
the climate conditions, the environmental conditions, similar to the

584
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:12.760
ones in Brazil where we see this rubber tree

585
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.319
growing? Because if we have those conditions, we can

586
00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:17.959
take seeds there, and we might be able to,

587
00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:21.479
yeah, grow it in a completely different place. Now

588
00:30:21.479 --> 00:30:24.000
this has happened for centuries that people have moved

589
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.640
plants around, but, but it becomes a lot more

590
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.449
conscious after Humboldt. So we see a lot more

591
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.319
people thinking about, OK, where can we place these

592
00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:34.829
different plants, and this becomes highly important in, you

593
00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:38.280
know, industrial revolution and and uh basically colonial, the

594
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.619
colonial period. So that's very short. I mean, there's

595
00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:43.219
a lot to say about Arkander von Humboldt. I

596
00:30:43.219 --> 00:30:45.780
didn't really touch on his like life or biography,

597
00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:48.680
but I think it's It's of the highest importance

598
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.369
that we see him as a plant geographer first,

599
00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:54.560
right? That, that this is really what's the focus

600
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.810
of his journey, but also the focus of this

601
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.689
sort of research that he's trying to do. He's

602
00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:00.969
trying to figure out why do plants grow in

603
00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:03.010
certain places. And I think that's still, you know,

604
00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:05.410
that's still to this day a question that that

605
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.250
um requires research.

606
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.760
Interesting. So another figure that we don't tend to

607
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.599
think about as a botanist is Charles Darwin. I

608
00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:21.390
mean, we usually associated him with the pigeons and

609
00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:25.040
uh things like that. But in what ways was

610
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.109
he a botanist as well?

611
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.609
Yeah, so I think in the case of Charles

612
00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:32.130
Darwin, you could because with Alexander von Humboldt, you

613
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.170
can really see, he's writing all these different types

614
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.199
of books, right, that deal with very different subjects,

615
00:31:37.209 --> 00:31:38.969
and this is true for Darwin, of course, as

616
00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:41.609
well, but with Darwin, you can really say that

617
00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:45.150
he Well, at least his botanical work is of

618
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.989
the highest importance when it comes to. His career,

619
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:53.069
so. I mean, he's somewhat of a curious figure

620
00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:54.869
in in in the history of science that we

621
00:31:54.869 --> 00:31:56.829
know oftentimes a little bit more about him than

622
00:31:56.829 --> 00:31:58.589
we know about others, right? We, we know of

623
00:31:58.589 --> 00:32:00.989
the, the, the kite of Benjamin Franklin, or we

624
00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:04.229
know of the the bathtub and Archimedes, but with

625
00:32:04.229 --> 00:32:07.640
Darwin, usually people can say like Galapagos Islands, finches,

626
00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:10.640
like you said, pigeons, right? Evolutionary theory. We also,

627
00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:12.310
we seem to know a little bit of the

628
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.510
facts of his life. But I think some of

629
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.479
the facts get a lot more attention than than.

630
00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:20.660
If you take a look at his life and

631
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.510
what he does. So, About 1/3 of everything he

632
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.869
writes is about botany, and even his major books,

633
00:32:26.989 --> 00:32:29.869
Origin of Species, uh, or his major book, The

634
00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:32.900
Origin of Species, talks a lot about, uh, plants

635
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.069
and animals, right? And And it's interesting to see

636
00:32:36.069 --> 00:32:38.949
that botany really plays a very important role very

637
00:32:38.949 --> 00:32:41.390
early on. Now, again, he's similar to von Humboldt,

638
00:32:41.469 --> 00:32:44.479
he's interested in geology, he's interested in animals, but

639
00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:46.670
plants seem to play a lot more of an

640
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.939
important role than we usually admit. Um. So, this

641
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:53.619
really starts, most of it is, most of this

642
00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:55.979
starts after his journey with the Beagle. So, I

643
00:32:55.979 --> 00:32:59.500
would argue that the far more interesting side of

644
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.219
Darwin's life is not so much the beagle travels,

645
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.739
even though, of course, you know, he goes to

646
00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:07.140
all these far flung flung places and finds all

647
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.020
these interesting animals and plants and and geology. But

648
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.699
I think his life in Kent in downhouse, settling

649
00:33:13.699 --> 00:33:17.300
down, is far more interesting scientifically because there he

650
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.310
really starts to experiment, and I think One of

651
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.270
his strong suits is that he's a very strong

652
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.910
experimenter, right? He thinks of all these usually very

653
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:31.969
simple experiments. So, for instance, Nobody's ever looked at

654
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.310
the vitality of seeds after being exposed to seawater.

655
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.150
Now, you could say, that's quite important, right, to

656
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.349
have a look at, and nobody really did. They

657
00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:44.829
just sort of assumed that either seawater was gonna

658
00:33:44.829 --> 00:33:49.469
kill seeds, or that seeds would survive in seawater

659
00:33:49.469 --> 00:33:51.709
for some time. But nobody had a look, nobody

660
00:33:51.709 --> 00:33:55.270
experimented. So he's taking All these little pots, filling

661
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.619
them with water, adding a certain amount of salt,

662
00:33:57.829 --> 00:34:00.390
and then adding seeds to them, and just seeing

663
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.790
how long can they withstand, uh, salt water. Because

664
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.739
salt is usually quite detrimental to planned life. Now,

665
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:10.530
this very simple experiment, and then he writes about

666
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.300
it in the Garda's Chronicle, he gives some, you

667
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.610
know, his experimental details, and he asks other people,

668
00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.360
can you also experiment, or do other people have

669
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:21.389
any, you know, uh, experience with this, uh, type

670
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.260
of experimentation? And then he finds out, some seeds

671
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.399
are indeed quite capable of floating on saltwater for

672
00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:32.360
weeks on end. Now, if you then take, you

673
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.560
know, certain ocean currents, you could well establish this

674
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.280
idea of long distance dispersal, right? So, you can

675
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.760
start to answer questions like, well, how did the

676
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.550
plants end up at the Galapagos? If we know

677
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.320
that the Galapagos Islands arose from the sea floor

678
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.639
by volcanic activity. So, basically they came out of

679
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.500
this the ocean as a sort of blank slate.

680
00:34:53.668 --> 00:34:56.580
How were they filled? And then with these simple

681
00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.659
experiments, he's trying to explain, oh, you know, we

682
00:34:59.659 --> 00:35:04.060
can see, um, seeds can can disperse themselves by

683
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.419
seawater for quite a long time. So this maybe

684
00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:09.770
explains partially why we find vegetation on the Galapagos.

685
00:35:10.129 --> 00:35:13.489
Uh. So it's, so he's a really strong experimenter,

686
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.689
and he starts to really write a whole lot

687
00:35:15.689 --> 00:35:20.800
about Uh, uh, different botanical subjects. But in that

688
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.600
sense, he's, because he's looking at plants from maybe

689
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.199
more of an evolutionary perspective, he's starting to really

690
00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:32.000
reevaluate, reevaluate plant life and really for the maybe

691
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.679
for the first, as one of the first seeing

692
00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:37.399
the real complexity of plant life, or at least

693
00:35:37.399 --> 00:35:40.320
not trying to, yeah, sort of noticing that plants

694
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.370
are a lot more complex than we oftentimes uh

695
00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:45.239
uh grant them, yeah.

696
00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.820
So what were the major ideas that influenced how

697
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.979
we view the natural world and where did they

698
00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:56.570
come from?

699
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.209
Yeah, so this is something that, and that's why

700
00:36:00.209 --> 00:36:02.449
I wrote my first book on on uh on

701
00:36:02.449 --> 00:36:06.270
Charles Darwin's botanical studies, because It it it it

702
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.949
is strange to me that there, there was one

703
00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.340
book before, and now there is a little bit

704
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.709
more, but there was one book before, I think

705
00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:14.310
in the 70s, uh about Darwin's botany, but I

706
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.820
think he's such a revolutionary character, so very early

707
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.340
on, so after The Origin of Species. He starts,

708
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.300
he starts, well, a couple of lines of experimentation,

709
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.939
and a couple of lines of experimentation in different

710
00:36:27.939 --> 00:36:30.969
subjects. So he starts with the fertilization of orchids.

711
00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:32.949
So he's already started this work a little bit

712
00:36:32.949 --> 00:36:35.620
when he's writing The Origin of Species, but it's

713
00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.780
very clear that in the fertilization of orchids, he

714
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.580
wants to show that orchid flowers have all these

715
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.010
different adaptations to ensure cross pollination. And this is

716
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.679
really a first in his day. So people thought

717
00:36:51.129 --> 00:36:54.370
flowers were not all that important. We know from

718
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.889
the names that they were that they were important

719
00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:59.689
in fertilization, and they grow seeds, but there was

720
00:36:59.689 --> 00:37:04.060
no notion of cross pollination yet. So he starts

721
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.179
to see that, or starts to experiment with orchid

722
00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:09.939
flowers and showing that they have all these different

723
00:37:09.939 --> 00:37:13.419
adaptations to ensure cross pollination, and that they're very

724
00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:17.139
well fitted to certain types of pollinators, that certain

725
00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:19.260
types of pollinators can pollinate a flower and others

726
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.469
can definitely not. So, He's starting to become more

727
00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:27.120
and more interested in fertilization of flowers, and he

728
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.629
really starts to give experimental evidence for that cross

729
00:37:30.629 --> 00:37:33.320
pollination is of the highest importance in the feral

730
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.120
kingdom. So this is really his sort of first

731
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.840
line of interest, and he does a lot of

732
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.439
fertilization experiments. So he's really, you know, he has

733
00:37:41.439 --> 00:37:44.169
all these flower beds, and he's really crawling through

734
00:37:44.169 --> 00:37:46.560
them with his pencil, trying to fertilize all these

735
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.600
different flowers to establish what is more important, self-fertilization

736
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.080
or cross-fertilization, but also looking at how are all

737
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.280
these different flowers adapted to all these different pollinators.

738
00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:04.389
Um, MORE physiological. Theme is when he goes into

739
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.550
the question of carnivorous plants. So, he's really the

740
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.919
first to have experimental evidence of how, and but

741
00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:16.520
also answering the question why plants take on this

742
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.399
peculiar habit of luring in insects and devouring them,

743
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.570
right? So, In England, he, he's he's taking notice

744
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.129
of a couple of plants that have been said

745
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:29.760
to be carnivorous, like a sundew, all these different

746
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.250
plants, but also, of course, abroad, we find a

747
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.939
lot more carnivorous plants, and he's experimenting with these

748
00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:39.590
plants a whole lot. Now, He's experimenting with them

749
00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.750
because he has good friends at Kew Gardens, right?

750
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.429
His best friend is the director, Joseph Hooker, so

751
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:46.149
he gets a lot of plants from there, and

752
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:48.060
he has his own little greenhouse, which is still

753
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.850
there. So in this greenhouse, he's growing all these

754
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.330
different plants, and he's experimenting, for instance, with sundews

755
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.370
to see to what do sundews react, right? Cause

756
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.209
the sundew is like a leaf with tentacles on

757
00:39:00.209 --> 00:39:02.290
it, with a little bit of, almost glue on

758
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.840
it. And you can see in the wild that,

759
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.610
you know, a lot of insects sort of, you

760
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.169
know, are lured to this, to these leaves. They're

761
00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:11.969
caught up in these tentacles, and then these tentacles

762
00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:13.810
seem to close or these leaves seem to close

763
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.560
around these insects, and then they open up again,

764
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.899
and then the insect is disappeared, right? Um, SO

765
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:24.090
he's testing to what do they react, and, um,

766
00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:26.459
you know, what the different substances. So he, you

767
00:39:26.459 --> 00:39:28.020
know, he he puts a little bit of tea

768
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.409
on them, a little bit of urine, a hair,

769
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.570
glass, stones, all these different things, finding out that

770
00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:37.739
they only seem to respond to to material that

771
00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:41.489
has very high nitrogen content. And then he starts

772
00:39:41.489 --> 00:39:45.520
to think like, OK, this may be explaining something,

773
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.689
because, of course, these plants are curing nitrogen poorer,

774
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.770
you know, phosphorus poor surroundings. So, where there's very

775
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.370
little concentration of these minerals in the soil, like

776
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:59.010
a marsh, or, you know, mountainous range, and you're

777
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.850
starting to see that these plants are actually adapted

778
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.280
to living in these sort of poor nutrient environments,

779
00:40:06.459 --> 00:40:08.570
and that they have become adapted to catching their

780
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.790
own sort of nutrients. So, not only showing how

781
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.550
this um digestion works and how they catch these

782
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:20.550
different insects, and how complex these, these, these traps

783
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.310
are, but also showing, OK, but then why? Why

784
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.830
did they do this, right? Why do we find

785
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.159
this adaptation? And then from there on, he's sort

786
00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:31.629
of not necessarily from there on, not growing very

787
00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:34.679
chronologically, but he also writes on climbing plants. He

788
00:40:34.679 --> 00:40:37.639
writes one of the first studies to show what

789
00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:42.179
different habits and movements climbing plants show. And from

790
00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:44.879
there, we really get his, like his most famous

791
00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:48.120
and also last botanical book, which is, um, about

792
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.679
the power of movement in plants, which talks a

793
00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:52.919
lot about plant movement, and he's sort of the

794
00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:55.610
first one to show what we now know from

795
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:59.520
EPs images that Actually, all plans move. It's not

796
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.060
so much that they're, they appear passive to us,

797
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.090
but they're not passive themselves, right? And not just

798
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.120
that, he's not just showing that plants move, but

799
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.929
he's also showing that plants experience their surroundings, that

800
00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:16.010
they're able to react to light, to gravity, to

801
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:20.129
moisture, to all these different environmental cues. Plants seem

802
00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:23.040
to react, even though they lack clear sense organs.

803
00:41:23.449 --> 00:41:26.250
So, he's really starting to view the plant as

804
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:32.760
a Moving, spontaneously moving, interacting with its surroundings, and

805
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.280
sort of experiencing this world. Um, YEAH, you're starting

806
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.540
to look, yeah, very differently at plants. So he's

807
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.370
one of the first ones, for instance, to show

808
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.100
that roots follow the center of gravity. And also

809
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.739
locates what actually in the root is sort of

810
00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:51.739
causing this, right? He finds out that the root

811
00:41:51.739 --> 00:41:55.090
tip indeed seems to sense the center of gravity,

812
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.260
and, uh, and, and sort of sense chemical messengers

813
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.060
up the root to make sure that it sort

814
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.979
of bends in the right way. Um. I mean,

815
00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:07.860
there's a lot of unanswered questions to him still,

816
00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:09.989
but you can really see, and he also writes

817
00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:12.790
this in his autobiography, that he, it's really been

818
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.939
his sort of purpose to to re-evaluate plants, to

819
00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:18.899
to to show that they are highly organized beings,

820
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.350
and that they have their own evolutionary history.

821
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.229
Yeah. But I mean, we've talked about the romanticists,

822
00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:31.479
Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin. When it comes to

823
00:42:31.479 --> 00:42:36.229
how we view the natural world, what would you

824
00:42:36.229 --> 00:42:39.419
say are the main ideas that influence it?

825
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.449
The main ideas that influence Darwin, you mean, or

826
00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:46.280
now how we view the natural world.

827
00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:50.149
Well, I think we're coming to terms with these

828
00:42:50.149 --> 00:42:53.500
discoveries that Darwin made in the 19th century. That,

829
00:42:53.629 --> 00:42:55.949
I mean, for a lot of people cross pollination

830
00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:59.310
and the relationship between insects and flowers or and

831
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.270
other animals that act as pollinators, it's it's quite

832
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.489
apparent, right? Many people know this. To be true,

833
00:43:05.629 --> 00:43:08.040
and we know that. So, so this is something

834
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.030
that Darwin popularized. It was not necessarily him that

835
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.629
he didn't really necessarily discover cross pollination. It was

836
00:43:14.629 --> 00:43:16.669
discovered in the 18th century, but he really was

837
00:43:16.669 --> 00:43:19.679
the first one to experiment with it, to show

838
00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:22.360
proof of it, and, and also to make it

839
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.060
more popular. So, I think in, in a certain

840
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.310
sense, we've come to terms with that, right? And

841
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:31.260
we also know of carnivorous plants, right? So, In

842
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.620
in in a certain sense, he's definitely shaping the

843
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.100
way we view plants nowadays, but there's also a

844
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.750
lot of Things he discovered that aren't really necessarily

845
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.870
known all that widely. So, I don't think a

846
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:45.510
lot of people realize that a root is also

847
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.080
a sort of sensory organ, or at least a

848
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.709
root tipus, that reacts to all these different environmental

849
00:43:51.709 --> 00:43:54.659
cues, right? And that all these root tips, and,

850
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.820
you know, uh, a mature plant can have, well,

851
00:43:57.919 --> 00:44:00.760
thousands of them. And all these different individual root

852
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.550
tips are indeed sort of sensing their surroundings and

853
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.520
navigating through the soil, right? I don't think people

854
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.030
usually tend to look at plants that actively, that

855
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.649
sort of intentionally, um. But also seeing plants as

856
00:44:13.649 --> 00:44:17.250
a sort of sensory organism that has this complex

857
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.689
interaction with its environment, and I think that's, we're

858
00:44:19.689 --> 00:44:21.590
still sort of coming to terms with that. So,

859
00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:24.919
in a certain sense, I think he's deeply influenced

860
00:44:24.919 --> 00:44:27.959
the way we are viewing viewing plants, but we're

861
00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:30.479
also, it's not, not all of it is has

862
00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:33.159
landed yet. But then more in general, the natural

863
00:44:33.159 --> 00:44:41.320
world, I Um, I think, well. What, for instance,

864
00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:44.689
very interesting is that the, the metaphor he chooses

865
00:44:44.689 --> 00:44:49.639
to describe life. BECOMES radically different from the metaphor

866
00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:52.449
people used to use to describe life. So, the

867
00:44:52.449 --> 00:44:55.449
chain of being, or the ladder of nature, was

868
00:44:55.449 --> 00:44:59.169
really the dominant metaphor for thinking about nature right

869
00:44:59.169 --> 00:45:01.530
up until Darwin, and Darwin even still uses it

870
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.689
quite a lot, right? Talks about higher animals, lower

871
00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:07.530
animals. So he, he uses this still, this, this

872
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:12.600
hierarchical thinking. So this stems from Aristotle, the ancient

873
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.629
Greeks, basically, but it's, it's very dominant right up

874
00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:18.229
until the 19th century, where it's really seen as

875
00:45:18.229 --> 00:45:22.149
though plants are like a step below animals, right?

876
00:45:22.189 --> 00:45:24.879
And then stones and minerals are a step below

877
00:45:24.879 --> 00:45:27.610
plants, and then above plants we have animals, human

878
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.350
beings, and maybe if you're Christian, an angel, god,

879
00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:35.110
etc. But this, this latter, like, Viewing of the

880
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:39.070
natural world is, of course, well, it, it, it

881
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.600
really Stresses this point that this plan, that plants

882
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.280
are sort of passive, uninteresting organisms because they're lower

883
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.800
on the scale of being, right? Or they're lower

884
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.840
in this chain of being. Um, AND I think

885
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.679
Darwin with the metaphor of the tree, the tree

886
00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:56.000
of life, and the and the same metaphor occurs

887
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.360
to Alfred Wallace when he is in Tenata, right?

888
00:45:58.439 --> 00:46:00.280
They're, they're both thinking of the same metaphor at

889
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.120
the same time, that in fact, we should, we

890
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.840
should look at affinities between different species as a

891
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.929
tree-like, uh, in a sort of tree-like diagram. And

892
00:46:10.929 --> 00:46:14.850
I think this is Well, again, right, nowadays super

893
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.459
super influential that we take this sort of botanical

894
00:46:17.459 --> 00:46:20.899
metaphor, this, this tree-like metaphor of life, and that

895
00:46:20.899 --> 00:46:23.179
we view life in in in in uh through

896
00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:26.010
this lens. And and and I don't think we

897
00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:29.449
Well, we fully appreciate how important that is, right?

898
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.750
That we take a non-hierarchical view of our surroundings,

899
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:36.489
right? Because that immediately undermines the idea that we

900
00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:40.570
are somehow better than plants. No, we've all survived,

901
00:46:40.649 --> 00:46:43.840
right? Plants are here, so they have what's necessary

902
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.770
to survive for all these millions of years, and

903
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.239
we are here as well. And there's really no

904
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.770
measure by which you can say we are better

905
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:56.250
than uh plants or other life forms. So I

906
00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.629
think in this evolutionary approach, Darwin is really Um,

907
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.929
It sort of sets Darwin up to really start

908
00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:06.770
to approve differently appreciate plants. But it's interesting that

909
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.669
he does this through this sort of different metaphor,

910
00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:11.360
that he uses this botanical metaphor to make sense

911
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.770
of the plant world, and to sort of see

912
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.820
if we can um Get rid of this, these

913
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.729
presuppositions, these assumptions about plants being passive, uninteresting, simple

914
00:47:22.939 --> 00:47:23.530
creatures.

915
00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:28.919
So, now let me ask you a question about

916
00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:32.610
related to a topic that I think you personally

917
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.520
are very interested in. What is wilderness?

918
00:47:37.629 --> 00:47:41.129
Yeah, so this is completely different indeed completely different

919
00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:43.409
topic, or we're sort of leaving the planned world

920
00:47:43.409 --> 00:47:45.949
a little bit behind then. Um, SO this is

921
00:47:45.949 --> 00:47:48.610
something that in recent years have become more and

922
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:53.209
more interested in. In that, um, And this was

923
00:47:53.209 --> 00:47:55.169
also, like you said in begin mentioned at the

924
00:47:55.169 --> 00:47:57.330
beginning. So it used to be my PhD project.

925
00:47:57.409 --> 00:48:00.090
I've, I've, I've, I've switched topics, but this used

926
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.489
to be my PhD project. To look into wilderness

927
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:06.489
and the wilderness notion, and especially the influence of

928
00:48:06.489 --> 00:48:09.290
the romantic era, and, and the, uh uh maybe

929
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:13.169
especially American romanticism in the way we view wilderness

930
00:48:13.169 --> 00:48:19.439
nowadays. So, it's been noted. Especially by uh the

931
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:23.600
Chicago School in Environmental History, that like people like

932
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.479
William Cronin, but also maybe later on, like Bart

933
00:48:26.479 --> 00:48:31.760
Callicott, uh, Emma Marris, people that have critiqued our

934
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.239
view or our notion of wilderness, that for a

935
00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:38.229
very long time, and I mean, still to this

936
00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:41.790
day, we we tend to think of wilderness as

937
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.979
this. Yeah, we tend to take this dualistic approach

938
00:48:44.979 --> 00:48:48.610
to our surroundings, where the city is really like

939
00:48:48.979 --> 00:48:53.100
the human dominated landscape, the least wild, you could

940
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.929
say, and then on the on the opposite end,

941
00:48:55.939 --> 00:48:58.979
you find wilderness, the space where humans are least

942
00:48:58.979 --> 00:49:02.129
dominant, where we find very little influence of humans,

943
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.340
and where we find sort of this idea of

944
00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.219
sort of pristine nature of nature unadulterated by human

945
00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:12.820
beings, untouched by human beings. And I think Especially

946
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.310
in America, I mean I think for good reasons,

947
00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:20.979
uh, this idea has been critiqued that this notion

948
00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:24.969
of wilderness is somewhat more common to a myth

949
00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:29.620
or a cultural idea that perhaps has served its

950
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.649
has served its purpose, right? Or at least, um,

951
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.899
how do you say, it's sort of out of

952
00:49:34.899 --> 00:49:38.860
touch, um. Uh, ESPECIALLY on the knowledge we now

953
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.419
have of these places we used to call wildernesses,

954
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.500
right? Like North America, or like the Amazon. We

955
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.300
now know that many of these places were not

956
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.139
only heavily populated, but also heavily managed by the

957
00:49:51.139 --> 00:49:54.300
people that live there, right? And that, um, There

958
00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.219
was definitely management of the natural environment, and there

959
00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:00.500
was, well, even agriculture, of course, we know, right,

960
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.080
and Huper animals and all these different um So

961
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.219
that that that's notion of of wilderness or seeing

962
00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:10.699
places as being wilderness is definitely a little bit

963
00:50:10.699 --> 00:50:15.760
outdated. Yeah, but it's a, yeah, so you go

964
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.959
ahead. Sorry, I'm talking,

965
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.239
no, no, no, no, you're not talking too much

966
00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:23.040
at all. So, uh, but, uh, I mean that's

967
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.840
about wilderness, but what is rewilding them.

968
00:50:28.699 --> 00:50:35.010
Well, I think, well, before maybe we reach rewilding,

969
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.389
it's so, like I said, it's in the in

970
00:50:37.389 --> 00:50:40.969
the romantic period where we find We find a

971
00:50:40.969 --> 00:50:46.899
sort of Re-evaluation of what wilderness is. So, um,

972
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.330
I think, you know, when does the notion of

973
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.780
wilderness come about? And I think we could trace

974
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.580
that back to the origin of something else, which

975
00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.979
is sort of the opposite also, similar to the

976
00:50:59.979 --> 00:51:01.739
city, and opposite of the wilderness, which is the

977
00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:04.620
garden, right? I think we get wilderness or this

978
00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.870
notion of wilderness as soon as we start to

979
00:51:07.679 --> 00:51:10.600
Garden the plot of land, because then that distinction

980
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.570
becomes interesting because the garden needs to be protected

981
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.620
from the wilderness, right? We don't want wild animals

982
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.929
in the garden eating the plants. We don't want

983
00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:22.989
other plants supplanting the, the crops we have, we,

984
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.020
we cherish. So I think in a certain sense

985
00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.810
you could say with the rise of agriculture, you

986
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:32.020
get this notion of, you know, the wilderness, uh,

987
00:51:32.209 --> 00:51:35.280
outside, and then cultural landscape is more the garden,

988
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:39.709
the agricultural field. The city. Um, AND in a

989
00:51:39.709 --> 00:51:43.639
certain sense, you could say, the wilderness. Before the

990
00:51:43.639 --> 00:51:46.760
Romantic period is seen as a negative place, as

991
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:52.239
a place of horror, of fear, of danger, and

992
00:51:52.239 --> 00:51:55.159
of course, this is how we know wilderness partially,

993
00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:57.280
right? Uh WE appreciate it, but we also know

994
00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.899
that there's dangers involved. And I think it's even

995
00:52:01.899 --> 00:52:03.699
if you look at, like, for instance, Paradise Lost.

996
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.229
So when Milton describes Paradise and Paradise Lost, it's,

997
00:52:08.419 --> 00:52:11.610
it's the Garden of Eden that's surrounded by wilderness,

998
00:52:11.979 --> 00:52:14.540
and this wilderness is impenetrable, right? And it's sort

999
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.659
of like when the people are expelled from the

1000
00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:19.820
garden, they enter the wilderness, and they have to

1001
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.860
make their own gardens again. And they have to

1002
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.780
slave and toil in these gardens to, to supplant

1003
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.939
the wilderness. And you see really in, in, in

1004
00:52:27.939 --> 00:52:30.459
the biblical notion that the wilderness is the place

1005
00:52:30.459 --> 00:52:33.020
of temptation, it's the place of the devil, right?

1006
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.689
And we should bring civilization to wilderness, you know,

1007
00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:38.219
it's sort of this notion of, you can find

1008
00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:39.699
this in one of the Bible books. I'm not

1009
00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:41.860
very fluent, but it's sort of like, make the

1010
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.060
desert bloom like a rose, right? Make and the

1011
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.500
desert is a word for wilderness, right? So it's

1012
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.340
make the wilderness bloom like a rose. So it's

1013
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.449
really this. TASK of humanity to supplant the wilderness

1014
00:52:52.449 --> 00:52:54.929
and to make civilize uh to, to, to create

1015
00:52:54.929 --> 00:52:59.500
civilization. And I think In romantic periods, we see

1016
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.629
a sort of switch in this evaluation of the

1017
00:53:02.629 --> 00:53:05.510
wilderness, where all of a sudden, we start to

1018
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:11.530
become very critical of gardens, agriculture, cities. And we

1019
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:15.100
start to become very positive about wilderness, wild beasts,

1020
00:53:15.209 --> 00:53:18.760
right? Wolves, forests, waterfalls, and these start to become

1021
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.129
places where we go to, and they start to

1022
00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:22.969
become even a little bit touristic in the sense

1023
00:53:22.969 --> 00:53:25.689
that, you know, they attract tourism, and people start

1024
00:53:25.689 --> 00:53:28.729
to see sort of the beauty of wilderness, where

1025
00:53:28.729 --> 00:53:30.959
before the wilderness was really seen as a dangerous

1026
00:53:30.959 --> 00:53:33.570
place, a place that you did not really aesthetically

1027
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.219
appreciate. It, it, it turns into this place that

1028
00:53:36.409 --> 00:53:38.979
has a lot of appreciation, right? And And we

1029
00:53:38.979 --> 00:53:42.379
start to really appreciate this wilderness. And I think

1030
00:53:42.379 --> 00:53:45.679
this re-evaluation is very important in a romantic period,

1031
00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:49.790
but it leaves the dichotomy, the dualism alive, right?

1032
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.570
It, it just changes places and it's ways, it's,

1033
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.719
it's valued. So, What happened sort of in the,

1034
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.719
well, last century in this century, that people are

1035
00:54:00.719 --> 00:54:04.679
starting to critique this dualism that, for instance, people

1036
00:54:04.679 --> 00:54:06.280
start to call the city wild as well, right?

1037
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.159
It's sort of like if you listen to hip

1038
00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:10.560
hop, it's, it's about the city being a jungle,

1039
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.889
right? It's about, um, there's a wilderness to the

1040
00:54:13.889 --> 00:54:16.459
to the city. And then there's also a sort

1041
00:54:16.459 --> 00:54:20.500
of artificiality oftentimes we think to wilderness, where a

1042
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.739
lot of national parks are very managed, right? The

1043
00:54:23.739 --> 00:54:25.860
way we take care of pollution, we have all

1044
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.699
these rules, so they're almost as if it's a

1045
00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:31.899
garden, right? So, I think in modernity or in

1046
00:54:31.899 --> 00:54:34.209
modern days, we are sort of in this sort

1047
00:54:34.209 --> 00:54:37.699
of post-structuralist era where we don't really see it

1048
00:54:37.699 --> 00:54:41.260
as a very strict dualism anymore. So we see

1049
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.659
that wilderness is a little bit on the side

1050
00:54:42.659 --> 00:54:46.070
of civilization, and civilization and Human influence is a

1051
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.020
little bit on the side of wilderness, right? Also,

1052
00:54:48.389 --> 00:54:51.939
where on earth is their pristine wilderness, right? Human

1053
00:54:51.939 --> 00:54:56.520
beings have influenced pretty much about. Everything, not, not,

1054
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.639
I mean, this much. I mean, we're not changing

1055
00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:01.840
Mount Everest, but we're definitely polluting Mount Everest, polluting,

1056
00:55:01.919 --> 00:55:03.560
you know, Mount Everest is cannot be seen as

1057
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:09.520
a pristine wilderness anymore. So, I guess, you know,

1058
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.120
we're in a time where people are really critiquing

1059
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.679
this notion of wilderness, and, and, and, but we

1060
00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.760
also have this trend, rewilding, and that is very

1061
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.639
strange, because rewilding is sort of built on this

1062
00:55:21.639 --> 00:55:25.159
old notion of wilderness. So, it appreciates wilderness, it

1063
00:55:25.159 --> 00:55:28.719
sort of has this romantic idea of wilderness, and

1064
00:55:28.719 --> 00:55:36.260
it tries to reestablish this pristine nature. So, The

1065
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.040
idea is that you take a plot of land

1066
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.979
that used to be cultivated by humans, and you

1067
00:55:40.979 --> 00:55:46.939
leave it, you implement some changes to make sure

1068
00:55:46.939 --> 00:55:50.939
that there is a sort of uh ecosystem surfaces

1069
00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:53.340
are up, right, and everything is in place, and

1070
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.649
then you leave it alone, right? And then you

1071
00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:00.419
rewild, right? It's sort of like making something, yeah,

1072
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.850
yeah, making something wild again, right? If we can

1073
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.209
use the sort of Trumpian approach. Um. And this

1074
00:56:06.209 --> 00:56:08.050
was very popular, especially in the Netherlands. We see

1075
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.770
very early rewilding projects here in the Netherlands. For

1076
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.010
instance, Oslosses is, sort of known as one of

1077
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:15.449
the first rewilding projects. So this was a plot

1078
00:56:15.449 --> 00:56:18.479
of land as well. There was Basically boarded off

1079
00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:22.120
from humans, not ecologists, but humans. You can go

1080
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.360
on safari there, and they've introduced quite a lot

1081
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.469
of big grazers, right? So they introduced deer, uh,

1082
00:56:29.479 --> 00:56:34.030
cattle, um, to, in order to rewild this place.

1083
00:56:34.719 --> 00:56:37.939
But I think And and maybe from my assessment,

1084
00:56:37.979 --> 00:56:39.899
you can sort of already hear that. I'm quite

1085
00:56:39.899 --> 00:56:41.979
critical of this notion, because I think it really

1086
00:56:41.979 --> 00:56:45.870
leans on this old notion of wilderness as a

1087
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.020
Landscape that is free of human influence, and that

1088
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.219
is just let, you know, left to its own

1089
00:56:52.219 --> 00:56:56.860
devices, basically. And I, I, I'm highly critical of

1090
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.510
uh this notion. Yeah.

1091
00:57:01.169 --> 00:57:04.610
Yeah, but I mean, do you think that uh

1092
00:57:04.889 --> 00:57:08.969
ideas of rewilding, connect in any way or linked

1093
00:57:08.969 --> 00:57:11.719
to environmentalism in any way?

1094
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:17.780
Well, I think it's seen as this. So for

1095
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.540
instance, Rousseau says, right, everything that comes out of

1096
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.330
the hands of the creator is good. And everything

1097
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.669
degenerates in the hands of man. And I think

1098
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.399
this is sort of central to this rewilding notion

1099
00:57:31.399 --> 00:57:36.199
that for some reason we've become very dominant on

1100
00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:40.590
Earth. We're we're in this so-called Anthropocene, right? Where

1101
00:57:40.879 --> 00:57:45.070
we are a very important factor, um. Uh, IN

1102
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.669
the environment, and I think this is sort of

1103
00:57:47.669 --> 00:57:51.459
like a It's a reaction to that, right? It's

1104
00:57:51.459 --> 00:57:53.780
a reaction to our dominance and the fact that

1105
00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.060
we have this sort of little bit of a

1106
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.699
planetary control, right? There's the planetary trade, there's, well,

1107
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.639
you know, there's international trade, there's international tourism, there's

1108
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.610
we, we definitely span the planet in, in, in

1109
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.320
one form or another. And I think this is,

1110
00:58:07.449 --> 00:58:10.080
this rewilding is a reaction, but it's a very

1111
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.500
Um, I think in most cases it it's a

1112
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.820
it's a it's it's based on this, I think,

1113
00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:20.260
outdated notion of what wilderness is. I don't think

1114
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.340
that there's no wilderness, it's just that as long

1115
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.739
as you view wilderness as this place that is

1116
00:58:25.739 --> 00:58:30.219
untouched by humans, and that is somehow Devoid of

1117
00:58:30.219 --> 00:58:33.580
human influence, then, well, first off, we have no

1118
00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:36.139
wilderness because there's no such place on earth, but

1119
00:58:36.139 --> 00:58:39.580
also, should this really be the idealistic situation you

1120
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:45.070
want to steer towards? And also, Yeah, I mean,

1121
00:58:45.149 --> 00:58:47.560
rewilding sort of implies that you want to go

1122
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.120
back to a certain place in time, right? Usually

1123
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.219
before human dominance. But, but, but how do you

1124
00:58:55.219 --> 00:58:57.659
select where to go back to, right? Where to

1125
00:58:57.659 --> 00:59:02.219
stop, um, why are we still, well, we're calling,

1126
00:59:02.419 --> 00:59:04.659
we're calling it rewilding, but we're doing a whole

1127
00:59:04.659 --> 00:59:07.899
lot of management, right? These places are not unmanaged.

1128
00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:10.179
There's a lot of human influence. You could even

1129
00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:12.899
say, well, there's, there's a ton of human influence,

1130
00:59:12.979 --> 00:59:15.820
right? We introduce animals, right? We, I mean, and

1131
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.979
we use all sorts of reasonings for this, right?

1132
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.909
We say, well, We're missing very important ecosystem surfaces,

1133
00:59:22.929 --> 00:59:25.010
if we don't have a large grazer, we don't

1134
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.290
have a large carnivore in place. So, to have

1135
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:33.020
a rewilded really rewilded environment. We need to bring

1136
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.219
back these predators too, and we need to bring

1137
00:59:35.219 --> 00:59:37.620
back these herbivores, you know, and, and animals that

1138
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.739
in the past we've we've hunted to extinction. We

1139
00:59:40.739 --> 00:59:42.979
need to bring them back so we can have

1140
00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:47.750
this sort of idealistic wilderness. And I, I find

1141
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.929
it to be troublesome. Really all the ways I

1142
00:59:50.929 --> 00:59:53.129
look at it, is that, yeah, yeah.

1143
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:59.820
And what is the difference between being native and

1144
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:03.320
being exotic? What, I mean, what's the difference there?

1145
01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.110
Also this plays into a little bit to this

1146
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:08.510
rewilding. So, of course, one of the things also

1147
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.350
done in rewilding is looking at, so what do

1148
01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.280
you want to recreate, right? Do you want to

1149
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.709
recreate a certain wilderness that was maybe there in

1150
01:00:16.709 --> 01:00:20.429
the past, but humans have since influenced the landscape

1151
01:00:20.429 --> 01:00:23.709
that much that many of these animals and plants

1152
01:00:23.709 --> 01:00:27.800
have disappeared. Now, rewilding also means you want to

1153
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.959
have native animals and plants in place, right? Cause

1154
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:34.870
you want to have a sort of wilderness. So,

1155
01:00:34.919 --> 01:00:37.800
what's also done in rewilding is that usually we

1156
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.439
try to take out all the different exotic plants

1157
01:00:40.439 --> 01:00:43.449
that are there as well. So it's, so it's

1158
01:00:43.449 --> 01:00:46.689
also this brings forward this notion of, you know,

1159
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.399
only having yeah, only having native plants, only having

1160
01:00:50.399 --> 01:00:52.489
native animals. And of course, if we look at

1161
01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:54.250
our surroundings, this is not what we find at

1162
01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.330
all. We, well, not only do we cultivate many

1163
01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.820
exotic plants, but of course, also in the wild,

1164
01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:03.489
you find many plants that, you know, were introduced

1165
01:01:03.489 --> 01:01:06.409
in the past by human beings, sometimes willingly, sometimes

1166
01:01:06.409 --> 01:01:09.850
unknowingly. And, um, you know, if you go outside,

1167
01:01:09.909 --> 01:01:13.350
you can find plants from, from North America. I'm

1168
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:15.350
talking here in the Netherlands, right? But you can

1169
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.389
find plants from North America, you can find plants

1170
01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:20.060
from Argentina, uh, in the wild, right? Doing quite

1171
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:26.889
well. Um, SO, I think because We have international

1172
01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:30.040
trade, because we have tourism, because we're transporting people

1173
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.969
and goods across the planet. We've also, you know,

1174
01:01:34.139 --> 01:01:36.969
uh, um, yeah, we've also taken on board many

1175
01:01:36.969 --> 01:01:39.169
a plant and animal, and and some of these

1176
01:01:39.169 --> 01:01:41.919
plants and animals have done quite well in these

1177
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:45.100
new surroundings. So just to make a little bit

1178
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.659
of a bridge between rewilding and native and exotic.

1179
01:01:47.739 --> 01:01:52.360
Now, Um, of course, so this is what my

1180
01:01:52.689 --> 01:01:55.050
PhD project is, is, is really about, is this

1181
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:59.100
sort of this. The philosophical roots and roots of

1182
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.149
this. Distinction between native and exotic. When do people,

1183
01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:06.040
not necessarily when do the first exotics arrive in

1184
01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.000
Europe or elsewhere, but more when do people start

1185
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.639
to realize that some plants hitch hitch a ride,

1186
01:02:13.719 --> 01:02:17.469
right? That some plants are transported by human beings

1187
01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:21.199
and start to become wild and really uh survive

1188
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:24.899
in this other in these other surroundings. And I,

1189
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.060
I found that this was really a question that

1190
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.620
wasn't answered yet. People sort of assumed that in

1191
01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.620
the 19th century, it started to occur to people

1192
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.330
that you had these different types of exotic plants

1193
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.580
that were somehow introduced by human beings, but I

1194
01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.860
found that already as early as the 18th century,

1195
01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:43.659
and even before that, people are noticing that sometimes

1196
01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:47.540
exotic plants appear in in in their surroundings.

1197
01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:53.770
OK, so it's still linked to the difference between

1198
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:58.000
being a native and being exotic when it comes

1199
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.360
to exotic or non-native species. What is an invasive

1200
01:03:04.649 --> 01:03:05.320
species?

1201
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.580
So this is, so to nowadays there's, I think

1202
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.219
in almost every country, there is quite a lot

1203
01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:16.070
of talk about invasive species. Also, the IPBS has

1204
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.929
has said that uh uh invasive exotic species is

1205
01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.790
one of the #1, it's like in the top

1206
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:27.540
five threats to uh biodiversity. You know, uh, other

1207
01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.379
than land use and pollution and all these other

1208
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:33.379
types of things, invasive exotics are also causing the

1209
01:03:33.379 --> 01:03:36.340
disappearance of many native species. So they're definitely seen

1210
01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.139
as a, as a sort of global, one of

1211
01:03:38.139 --> 01:03:42.139
the global issues we face nowadays. Now, like I

1212
01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:45.540
said, I, I'm interested in. When do we start

1213
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.659
to notice this distinction between native and exotic? And

1214
01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:52.139
I think this really has to do with a

1215
01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:55.060
rise in, so I said, like, Alexander von Humboldt

1216
01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.659
is one of the first planned geographers. That's not.

1217
01:03:58.439 --> 01:04:02.979
Entirely true. Before him we see a botanical topography.

1218
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.280
So for instance, Linnaeus, but also other people have

1219
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.879
already Started to pay attention to what plants can

1220
01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:12.159
we find in certain regions. And we see in

1221
01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:14.959
the 17 18th century the rise of the so-called

1222
01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:18.199
flora. And the flora is really a book that

1223
01:04:18.199 --> 01:04:20.489
showcases all the wild flora you can find in

1224
01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:25.540
a certain region. And by mapping out what species

1225
01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.040
you can find, Now, in this mapping, this is

1226
01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.919
where we start to notice that there are exotics

1227
01:04:31.919 --> 01:04:35.360
slipping in as well. So Linaus looks at, for

1228
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.639
instance, at different floras that were written in a

1229
01:04:38.639 --> 01:04:41.120
certain century, and he sees that there's new additions

1230
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.510
in the new flora. And sometimes these new additions,

1231
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.389
of course, are just a scientist paying more attention,

1232
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.649
right? Or looking more closely at what grows in

1233
01:04:48.649 --> 01:04:52.239
a certain region. But there's also new additions. They're

1234
01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:55.520
definitely not the product of being overlooked. They seem

1235
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.709
to be plants that have been introduced and have

1236
01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:01.820
gone wild in a certain sense. So, with the

1237
01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.459
rise of floras and the rise of this botanical

1238
01:05:04.459 --> 01:05:08.580
topography, people start to notice, hey, there's exotics coming

1239
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.770
in. And then Linnaeus is one of the first

1240
01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:13.120
ones to sort of, uh, how do you say?

1241
01:05:13.419 --> 01:05:16.989
Syatize that or categorize that, and he writes a

1242
01:05:16.989 --> 01:05:20.620
short uh uh uh text on all the different

1243
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.379
plants and in recent history have entered Europe and

1244
01:05:23.379 --> 01:05:26.360
Sweden by by means of humans, but also by

1245
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.060
natural means. And he sees this as a very

1246
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.639
positive thing. So he likes these new additions to

1247
01:05:33.919 --> 01:05:36.899
Swedish nature and European nature, and he, it sort

1248
01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.510
of heals them as, you know, the more successful

1249
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.310
the better, right? If you are successful as an

1250
01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:43.550
exotic plant, you get what he says, you get,

1251
01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.739
uh, sort of like a city rights, right, or,

1252
01:05:46.949 --> 01:05:49.070
uh, you get sort of, um, yeah we say

1253
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.590
in Dutch Burge but a civil rights, you get

1254
01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:54.370
sort of civil rights. So if you're very successful,

1255
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.270
you could become part, you naturalize into the environment.

1256
01:05:58.399 --> 01:06:00.760
So, you become part of the Swedish nature, or

1257
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.159
part of European nature. So, he's very positive. And

1258
01:06:04.159 --> 01:06:07.419
then, It becomes invasive when we go to Darwin.

1259
01:06:07.909 --> 01:06:11.830
So when Darwin travels with the Beagle, travels South

1260
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:17.409
America. He finds in Argentina and in Paraguay, when

1261
01:06:17.409 --> 01:06:21.530
he's walking through the Pampas, he finds that There

1262
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.929
is a certain garden plant that it was introduced

1263
01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:27.489
by the Spanish that has gone wild and is

1264
01:06:27.489 --> 01:06:30.770
making whole populations in the pompas. And this is

1265
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:34.080
a cardoon, this is a a type of artichoke

1266
01:06:34.409 --> 01:06:38.129
uh species, and this is a very, this plant

1267
01:06:38.129 --> 01:06:41.290
does very well. And then he writes, I don't

1268
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.870
think there's a single case of an alien plant

1269
01:06:44.409 --> 01:06:48.510
invading. On a territory and causing this sort of

1270
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:52.310
extinction of aboriginal species. And this is really the

1271
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:55.030
first time that we find this word invade in

1272
01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.429
connection to plants. So, of course, we knew of

1273
01:06:58.429 --> 01:07:02.909
human beings invading, but plants invading, animals invading is

1274
01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:06.750
really a sort of evolutionary notion. So, it, it

1275
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:11.030
really, it's sort of a militaristic metaphor that describes

1276
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:14.340
or Makes us understand, like, what is actually happening.

1277
01:07:14.439 --> 01:07:16.719
So, it's not like Linnaeus said it's a perfect

1278
01:07:16.719 --> 01:07:19.820
addition to nature. No, Darwin is seeing that, no,

1279
01:07:19.879 --> 01:07:23.760
the success of this newcomer is actually detrimental to

1280
01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.360
the native species that are there. And then he

1281
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.040
uses this word invasive. Now, I think from there

1282
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.000
we get our idea, right, of when certain plants

1283
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.320
are very successful and they come from abroad, they've

1284
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.520
been introduced by human beings, so they're exotic in

1285
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.439
that sense. And when they're very successful, we call

1286
01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:43.590
them invasive because, well, they take the place of

1287
01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.550
native plants that were, that used to grow there.

1288
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.500
But that would make you think that Darwin was

1289
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.260
very negative on on that notion. But in a

1290
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.860
certain sense you could say that introducing this term

1291
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.560
invasion is for him only also a way of

1292
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.959
describing how plants migrate, and that Not necessarily saying

1293
01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:06.959
it's a bad thing, it's more like this is

1294
01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:09.679
what happens in nature, right? Also without human beings,

1295
01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:12.919
we see this long distance uh dispersal of seeds,

1296
01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:16.140
right? So, in a certain sense, a plant by

1297
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:20.160
itself could invade a new territory. But as human

1298
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.100
beings have, of course, introduced a whole lot of

1299
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.850
plants and has speeded up this process quite a

1300
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.240
lot, right? And have introduced plants to regions where

1301
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.270
they're definitely not native. But we really see the

1302
01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:33.660
sort of rise of the invasive exotic with Darwin.

1303
01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:37.029
Um, SO I really, yeah, I, I, I think

1304
01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.430
that's also something that is unknown to people, right?

1305
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.790
That, uh, but of course, when you think about

1306
01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.870
it, it really ties up nicely with the idea

1307
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.950
of the struggle for existence, uh, where indeed you

1308
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:49.470
could also find that newcomers take new places in

1309
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.990
nature, right? And you could even argue that Darwin

1310
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:55.549
says every species is an invasive exotic, in a

1311
01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:59.089
sense that In the evolutionary history of every species,

1312
01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:01.399
there have been times where it had to be

1313
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.209
migrating to new places and become very successful in

1314
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:09.020
these new places, in order to survive, right? So

1315
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.350
I guess in a sense today invasive is really

1316
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.709
seen as a negative quality, right? It's just something

1317
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:17.990
that we do not want, but in a certain

1318
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.669
sense you could say it's, it's really uh key

1319
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:24.779
to life, right? That all plants and animals have

1320
01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:26.950
this invasive property to them.

1321
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.520
So still on the topic of invasiveness, does the

1322
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.140
size of non-native species have anything to do with

1323
01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.069
their being considered invasive or not?

1324
01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:49.720
Uh It, that's a difficult, hm. I think yes

1325
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.608
and no. In a certain sense. Uh, INVASIVE exotics

1326
01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:57.708
are sort of this new category of weeds, right?

1327
01:09:58.048 --> 01:10:02.168
Where weeds are usually plants that we don't like

1328
01:10:02.168 --> 01:10:05.929
in our gardens or in our, uh, agricultural fields.

1329
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.140
Uh, THESE plants are also seen as weeds, but

1330
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.259
not, not so much weeds in in a human

1331
01:10:11.259 --> 01:10:14.049
domain, but weeds in a natural domain. They're sort

1332
01:10:14.049 --> 01:10:17.350
of the weeds of nature. And we need to

1333
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.720
weed them out. And because they're sort of the

1334
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.439
weeds of nature that also implies oftentimes many weeds

1335
01:10:24.439 --> 01:10:28.279
are like year yearlings or maybe uh biennials, right?

1336
01:10:28.319 --> 01:10:30.439
So they take either 1 year or 2 years

1337
01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:32.640
to grow. So many of the weed species that

1338
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.479
we we find and also many of the invasive

1339
01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:38.009
exotics are usually like these annuals or biennials, right?

1340
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.000
That that grow for maybe a year or 2

1341
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.709
years. Um. Think of giant hogweed, for instance, right?

1342
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.990
This is a biennial. So first, it makes a

1343
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:48.589
big leaves, makes big leaves and and uh the

1344
01:10:48.589 --> 01:10:50.350
first year, and then the second year it makes

1345
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:54.669
this huge inflorescence, right? And uh definitely seen also

1346
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:56.700
here in the Netherlands as an invasive exotic, but,

1347
01:10:57.069 --> 01:11:00.720
um, so usually I think it's annual annuals, but

1348
01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.509
then there's also Invasive exotics that are longer lived,

1349
01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:06.790
right? That are trees. So for instance, we have

1350
01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:10.430
what's called the tree of heaven here, uh, Aleonus.

1351
01:11:11.339 --> 01:11:12.629
Let me see if I can find the name.

1352
01:11:14.919 --> 01:11:19.120
Yeah, yeah, Aliontus Altissima, for instance, is the tree

1353
01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.879
of heaven. So that's really a tree species and

1354
01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:25.040
you can see it growing, uh, um, well, basically

1355
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.279
everywhere in the Netherlands, um, uh, as, as, as

1356
01:11:28.279 --> 01:11:30.600
a, as an invasive exotic, but it's definitely a

1357
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.009
tree species, so. I'm not sure if size matters.

1358
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.830
What, what is interesting is that usually when there

1359
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:39.620
is a certain use to a plant, when they're,

1360
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.910
or when they're very aesthetically pleasing, we don't mind

1361
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.549
as much if they're a bit invasive. So, for

1362
01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:49.950
instance, we have cranberries here on the Wadden Islands

1363
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:52.549
in the Netherlands, and that's an exotic, but it's

1364
01:11:52.549 --> 01:11:55.229
grown a lot by people too, and it's very

1365
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:57.149
appreciated and it's part of the sort of the

1366
01:11:57.149 --> 01:12:01.790
diet of people and But also other other trees

1367
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:04.290
and plants are, are highly prized even though they

1368
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:07.990
are exotic and sometimes even successful. Um, SO, yeah,

1369
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:11.020
so sometimes when they serve other purposes as well,

1370
01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:13.310
they're treated a little bit differently, but I don't

1371
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:15.549
think size matters all that much and when it

1372
01:12:15.549 --> 01:12:16.830
comes to invasive species.

1373
01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.580
OK. So are plants intelligent? I mean, is there

1374
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:28.009
such a thing as plant intelligence? And if so,

1375
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.020
in what ways are they intelligent?

1376
01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:35.220
Yeah, so this is, this has caused a little

1377
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.700
bit of a, or at least there's a little

1378
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.890
bit of a discussion about this, and I think

1379
01:12:39.799 --> 01:12:41.879
So I usually in my classes don't really answer

1380
01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:44.120
the question if they are really intelligent or not,

1381
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.000
cause I think the one of the main problems

1382
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.379
is that Like, similar to that, we don't really

1383
01:12:50.379 --> 01:12:52.660
know what wilderness means. I don't think we also

1384
01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.899
really know anymore what what intelligence means, right? Now,

1385
01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.450
we use it all the time and we don't

1386
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.700
have a problem using it, and oftentimes when we

1387
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.500
talk about intelligence and all the different connotations it

1388
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.700
has, it deals with human beings, maybe a little

1389
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.810
bit with animals, right? Some of the animals, um,

1390
01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.299
but, uh, or, or maybe these days a lot

1391
01:13:10.299 --> 01:13:12.879
more animals are are are are seen as intelligent.

1392
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:16.319
Um, THERE'S definitely Champions of this idea, right? I

1393
01:13:16.319 --> 01:13:19.120
mean, people like Frans de Wall or other thinkers

1394
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.160
as well that, that talk about other minds, right?

1395
01:13:21.279 --> 01:13:26.029
Uh, WE know of cephalopods octopide being very Being

1396
01:13:26.029 --> 01:13:29.029
very intelligent. Um, SO I think animal intelligence is

1397
01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:31.589
becoming more of a general notion, but then we

1398
01:13:31.589 --> 01:13:33.700
reached the plant kingdom, right? Or the fungal kingdom

1399
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.779
or bacteria, and I think There it becomes too

1400
01:13:37.779 --> 01:13:40.299
many people very strange to talk about intelligence because.

1401
01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.390
Intelligence applies so much for us, right? It implies

1402
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:46.540
IQ EQ, you know, all these different. You know,

1403
01:13:46.899 --> 01:13:49.979
um, yeah, differences between people and how smart they

1404
01:13:49.979 --> 01:13:52.990
are, etc. ETC. RIGHT? And And of course, with

1405
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.629
plans that so that becomes a lot a lot

1406
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:56.509
more tricky, but I, I think it's sort of

1407
01:13:56.509 --> 01:13:58.629
a sign of the times that that we don't

1408
01:13:58.629 --> 01:14:01.189
really have a good answer to this question. What

1409
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:06.540
is intelligence, right? Um, THERE'S this great article. By

1410
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.279
Shane Hutter and uh. Chain leg and oh and

1411
01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:12.850
I forget about the name, but it's, but it

1412
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:15.549
basically starts this article with, well, we talk about

1413
01:14:15.549 --> 01:14:17.759
artificial intelligence, but it's sort of a little bit

1414
01:14:17.759 --> 01:14:19.399
of a problem that we don't really know what

1415
01:14:19.399 --> 01:14:22.200
intelligence is, right? There's all these different definitions and

1416
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.120
all these different fields, but do we really know

1417
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.620
what it is and I'll tell you to, so

1418
01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:31.580
This was the So the interesting thing is this

1419
01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.129
is really an idea that starts with Darwin again.

1420
01:14:34.379 --> 01:14:36.620
So, in the final book that Darwin writes on,

1421
01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.779
on, on plants, the power of movement in plants,

1422
01:14:38.899 --> 01:14:42.700
he finishes in a very strange manner. So, for

1423
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.259
pages on end, he talks about all the different

1424
01:14:46.259 --> 01:14:50.140
environmental cues that Planned roots, but also other parts

1425
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.540
of the plant take from their surroundings to dictate

1426
01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.660
sort of, or to help navigate their surroundings, to

1427
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.540
help move, to help, you know, put their leaves

1428
01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.790
in the right position, etc. ETC. And after sort

1429
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.229
of writing about this for a long time, he

1430
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:08.770
ends on this notion of, OK, so if a

1431
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.850
plant root, the plant, the tip of a root

1432
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:13.990
takes in all these environmental cues to help it

1433
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:17.810
navigate the soil. Could we not say that it's

1434
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:21.049
comparable to, like, the brain in the anterior end

1435
01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:23.930
of a lower animal, like an earthworm? You know,

1436
01:15:24.009 --> 01:15:25.529
is is a root tip not a little bit

1437
01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:28.890
comparable to an earthworm, where an earthworm also takes

1438
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:31.689
any environmental cues from its surroundings and navigates the

1439
01:15:31.689 --> 01:15:34.560
soil. How is it different from this plant root?

1440
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:37.930
And there we see this notion of planned intelligence

1441
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:40.129
arising, right? What's later been called the root brain

1442
01:15:40.129 --> 01:15:45.020
hypothesis, that for some reason, The root tip acts

1443
01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.930
a little bit like the brain of an animal.

1444
01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:51.120
Now, This is highly debated, right? Because you can't

1445
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.189
really look into a plant and find a brain,

1446
01:15:53.319 --> 01:15:57.040
right? Um, THERE'S no central nervous system. There's, they

1447
01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.040
lack many things, right? But nonetheless, for Darwin, the

1448
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.990
reason is, well, If we take in, if it

1449
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.109
takes in all these environmental cues, it would still

1450
01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:09.540
need to deliberate. It would still need to make

1451
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.870
a sort of choice, right? So, say, though, there's

1452
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:16.439
a center of gravity, but there is also an

1453
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:21.209
an obstacle, right? Um, IT can't really then navigate,

1454
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.520
you know, downwards and follow the center of gravity.

1455
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.060
It would sort of need to say, OK, we're

1456
01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.819
not following the direction of gravity. I'm doing something

1457
01:16:28.819 --> 01:16:32.379
completely different because I've hit an obstacle. So, these

1458
01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:35.859
different environmental cues are given different sort of, there's

1459
01:16:35.859 --> 01:16:38.140
sort of this hierarchy, right? That if we reach

1460
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.299
an impediment, no longer follow the center of gravity,

1461
01:16:42.419 --> 01:16:46.149
but take a different route, right? Um. So, he,

1462
01:16:46.259 --> 01:16:48.979
in this deliberation and this sort of making choices

1463
01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:52.939
on how to navigate, he sees this as maybe

1464
01:16:52.939 --> 01:16:57.140
a very preliminary form of intelligence, and especially his

1465
01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.750
son Francis Darwin, takes this notion a bit further,

1466
01:16:59.819 --> 01:17:04.129
right? And I think what I What I like

1467
01:17:04.129 --> 01:17:05.930
about it is that they're sort of having this

1468
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:10.959
cybernetic argument on intelligence, where later on, when the

1469
01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:14.089
rise of cybernetics, and people like Norbert Wiener, uh

1470
01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:17.970
my namesake, right, he, he says that In order

1471
01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:20.770
to have an intelligent machine or or an animal

1472
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.410
or a plant, you really need to stack different

1473
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:26.160
feedback mechanisms on top of one another, right? And

1474
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.970
you need to have a sort of feedback mechanism

1475
01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:29.930
where there's a perception of the surroundings, and there

1476
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:33.810
is an automated process and that whether you look

1477
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.930
at life or you look at machinery, if you

1478
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:39.049
want to have goal oriented behavior, if you want

1479
01:17:39.049 --> 01:17:42.169
to have complex behavior, you really need a whole

1480
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:45.149
lot of feedback mechanisms. And that maybe in essence,

1481
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:47.629
this is what intelligence is about. It's a sort

1482
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:52.040
of feedback mechanism. And Francis Darwin takes this to

1483
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.459
mean that, well, maybe that means that intelligence is

1484
01:17:56.459 --> 01:17:59.660
not something that is predominantly human, maybe not even

1485
01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.540
something that occurs with humans and some of the

1486
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.500
higher animals, but that intelligence is really something that

1487
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.100
occurs in life, and that life is sort of

1488
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.779
characterized by intelligence. And some people nowadays claim like

1489
01:18:11.779 --> 01:18:16.259
that evolutionary process is a blind process that comes

1490
01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:19.640
up with intelligible solutions to problems. Right? That's so

1491
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.509
that the whole process in and of itself. Makes

1492
01:18:23.509 --> 01:18:28.419
intelligence solutions arise more or less. So, this is

1493
01:18:28.419 --> 01:18:31.939
the reason that Darwin talks about plant intelligence, right?

1494
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:36.700
And I I like it, but it also I

1495
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.529
think it leaves me wondering like, I don't think

1496
01:18:39.529 --> 01:18:41.370
we know what intelligence means. I just don't think

1497
01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:44.209
there's one there's gonna be one definition. So maybe

1498
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:46.450
it really has to do with how useful is

1499
01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:49.970
this notion to us. And also, do we want

1500
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:52.919
to use the same word, maybe even, right? Uh,

1501
01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:54.970
LIKE, for instance, I find with Darwin that many

1502
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:57.250
times he doesn't like to use the same word

1503
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.009
as we use, for instance, with animals. So when

1504
01:18:59.009 --> 01:19:03.060
he talks about The so-called sleep movements of plants,

1505
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.419
so many plants, when, you know, the sun sets,

1506
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.580
they drop their leaves, or they fold their leaves

1507
01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.410
up. And then when the sun rises again, they

1508
01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:12.410
open up their leaves. And he says, I don't

1509
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.810
want to call this sleep because does it serve

1510
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:18.450
the same biological function as sleep? Probably not. So

1511
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:20.479
he, he, he comes up with a different word,

1512
01:19:20.569 --> 01:19:22.770
right? And I think this sort of stresses this

1513
01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:25.919
point where And that's maybe the main problem with

1514
01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:30.319
plant intelligence that you also don't wanna turn the

1515
01:19:30.319 --> 01:19:33.120
plant into an animal, saying or turn a plant

1516
01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.759
into a human, saying, well, all the characteristics we

1517
01:19:35.759 --> 01:19:39.819
have, the plant also shares, where, in fact, it

1518
01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.910
could very well be the case that plants are

1519
01:19:43.439 --> 01:19:46.680
very, very different from us, and that, well, maybe

1520
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.759
you don't need a brain to survive, right? They

1521
01:19:48.759 --> 01:19:51.279
clearly show that without a brain you can survive

1522
01:19:51.279 --> 01:19:54.120
pretty well, so maybe we've put far too much.

1523
01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.850
Uh, HOW do you say? Attention on intelligence, right?

1524
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:01.640
Or far too much importance on intelligence, and that

1525
01:20:01.649 --> 01:20:04.049
maybe having a brain is all not that important,

1526
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:07.040
right? That you're perfectly capable of surviving without one.

1527
01:20:08.759 --> 01:20:12.899
So I, I go back and forth between If

1528
01:20:12.899 --> 01:20:14.620
plants are really intelligent or not, but I think

1529
01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.410
the nice thing about the question is that it

1530
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:19.779
highlights that this problem we have, that it's it's

1531
01:20:19.779 --> 01:20:22.060
very, becomes, it's becoming very hard for us to

1532
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.009
explain what intelligence is. Mhm.

1533
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:29.509
So, uh, of course, if plants have some sort

1534
01:20:29.509 --> 01:20:34.180
of intelligence, I'm not sure if we would be

1535
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.100
able then to talk about plant psychology as well,

1536
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.660
but, uh, do we know if the plant, OK,

1537
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:42.109
OK,

1538
01:20:42.209 --> 01:20:45.959
that's fine. Some people, some people do. I, you

1539
01:20:45.959 --> 01:20:49.810
know, I, it doesn't really help. So for, yeah,

1540
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.680
but, but, but continue because you were you were

1541
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.790
you were heading somewhere.

1542
01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:56.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was going to ask you,

1543
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.120
do we know if plants have some kind of

1544
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.040
personality?

1545
01:21:03.419 --> 01:21:10.009
Um, So it's something that Um, so I think

1546
01:21:10.009 --> 01:21:12.089
here you run, you sort of run into that

1547
01:21:12.089 --> 01:21:15.370
problem, right? Where we take this word that has

1548
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.009
a whole lot of meaning when it comes to

1549
01:21:17.009 --> 01:21:19.540
humans, also has some meaning when it comes to

1550
01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:23.049
animals, maybe, and we see if we can find

1551
01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:26.180
an equivalent in the plant kingdom, and I think

1552
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.589
in some cases that that's maybe a bit misguided,

1553
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.080
right? So, um, for instance, plant communication is something

1554
01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.799
that's well established. We know that Plants can release

1555
01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:39.879
volatile chemicals, and that these volatile chemicals can be

1556
01:21:39.879 --> 01:21:43.879
messages that warn other plants or that do even

1557
01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:47.229
more complex things, right? Have show more complex ecological

1558
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:51.390
interactions. So there's really no debate on plant communication,

1559
01:21:51.479 --> 01:21:53.910
even though it's a wild notion, right? To think

1560
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:58.479
of plants having this chemical language, and to, and

1561
01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:01.959
then them being able to communicate, um, that is

1562
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.479
quite a wild notion, but it's not debated as

1563
01:22:04.479 --> 01:22:08.640
such. Well, I think plant intelligence maybe it's it's

1564
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.720
a little bit harder to show, OK, but why

1565
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.270
do we need it, right? Why do we need

1566
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.490
to have this word, or especially also with personality.

1567
01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.439
Do we need the word personality when it comes

1568
01:22:16.439 --> 01:22:21.729
to plants? Does it explain something, right? And now

1569
01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:25.930
I found that. Indeed, if you take personality to

1570
01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:30.160
mean that they are so so called individual differences,

1571
01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:33.919
right, between different members of the same species. So,

1572
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:39.830
for instance, one plant. Has um a certain reaction

1573
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.669
to it being attacked by aphids, for instance, right?

1574
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:46.939
So, it starts to change its chemical composition, uh,

1575
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:49.509
or it might respond to certain communications, right? Um,

1576
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.990
AND then a different plant will have a little

1577
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:54.430
bit of a different response, and this is repeatable,

1578
01:22:54.509 --> 01:22:56.910
right? It, it's clearly shown that they have a

1579
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:59.589
little bit of different strategies on how to allocate

1580
01:22:59.589 --> 01:23:03.939
energy, how to How to Sort of interact with

1581
01:23:03.939 --> 01:23:07.149
their environment. Now there have been studies showcasing this,

1582
01:23:07.259 --> 01:23:10.270
right? That there are indeed these sort of individual

1583
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:14.250
differences between plants. Now I say individual, because this

1584
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:17.370
is wherein lies the problem is that Well, a

1585
01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:20.120
personality, it would be nice to have an individual,

1586
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.819
something that is not easily divided. But of course,

1587
01:23:24.569 --> 01:23:26.810
Here we reach a sort of the ontology of

1588
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:29.160
a plant is that a plant is not an

1589
01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.729
individual in that sense, right? Like we are an

1590
01:23:32.729 --> 01:23:36.950
individual. So a plant Well, for the first part,

1591
01:23:37.029 --> 01:23:39.029
it has a very plastic nature, right? So we

1592
01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:42.419
can see that. Like our brain is very plastic,

1593
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:44.520
but our body is not so plastic, right? We

1594
01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.759
have a certain. Ontogenetic plan, and there's, you know,

1595
01:23:48.799 --> 01:23:50.759
from an embryo to a human being, that's a

1596
01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.799
pretty, that's a, I mean, there can definitely be

1597
01:23:52.799 --> 01:23:56.049
environmental conditions that can influence your growth, but for,

1598
01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.919
for the most part, it's a sort of fixed

1599
01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:02.399
track or trajectory. While in plants, that's not the

1600
01:24:02.399 --> 01:24:04.520
case at all, right? A dandelion growing in between

1601
01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.049
the cracks of the pavement looks different than when

1602
01:24:07.049 --> 01:24:09.720
it's in a, in a lawn, right? The the

1603
01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.720
leaves are different. There can be all sorts of

1604
01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.830
differences. So this plasticity is definitely, I'd say, a

1605
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:18.790
lot more there in plants, right? Like, we have

1606
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:20.790
a very plastic brain. Plants seem to have a

1607
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:25.850
very plastic physiology. Um, BUT They're not really individuals

1608
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:28.029
in a certain sense, because you can divide them,

1609
01:24:28.109 --> 01:24:31.339
right? So some people say they're divium, right? They're

1610
01:24:31.339 --> 01:24:34.890
there's something that doesn't really have a center. It's

1611
01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:39.569
more decentralized. It's more of a modular type of

1612
01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:41.500
growth, right? Almost like a fractal type of growth,

1613
01:24:41.569 --> 01:24:44.089
where you can take, um, you know, you can

1614
01:24:44.089 --> 01:24:45.729
take a cutting from a plant and, and, and,

1615
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:47.450
and, you know, fix it to another plant, or

1616
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:51.049
you can take, um, you know, maybe root stock

1617
01:24:51.049 --> 01:24:53.129
and then have another plant, right? We know this

1618
01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:56.689
because we use it in agriculture. So In that

1619
01:24:56.689 --> 01:25:01.029
sense, I think it's tricky, like, right, that You

1620
01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:02.390
want to sort of stay clear of a sort

1621
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:08.549
of uh anthropomorphizing plants, right? Making them into human

1622
01:25:08.549 --> 01:25:12.569
beings with personalities. Now, I think we also sort

1623
01:25:12.569 --> 01:25:15.129
of need to appreciate how different, even though we

1624
01:25:15.129 --> 01:25:17.209
share a common ancestor very, very far back in

1625
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:19.890
evolutionary history, there's so much difference to us as

1626
01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:23.209
well, where We don't really necessarily know a whole

1627
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:25.439
lot about what we're dealing with, right? It's not

1628
01:25:25.439 --> 01:25:29.580
individual, it's not. I mean, It's not really um

1629
01:25:31.479 --> 01:25:34.490
But nonetheless, it's, it's it's interacting in a very

1630
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:36.529
complex way with its surroundings, right? So maybe we

1631
01:25:36.529 --> 01:25:39.319
have still just a very poor understanding of this,

1632
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:43.200
of this complexity. Now I say this. Of course,

1633
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.640
there are great scientists working on what plants do

1634
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.040
on a microscopic and a microscopic and an ecological

1635
01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.180
scale. Definitely not wanting to say that they're, they,

1636
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.470
they are somehow missing something. But I think maybe

1637
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:57.049
in general, the general public, it's not sometimes maybe

1638
01:25:57.049 --> 01:25:59.290
missed a little bit like how, how different, how

1639
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.479
other the plant is, and that we might not

1640
01:26:02.479 --> 01:26:05.640
be very capable as a primate, you know, having

1641
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.799
done science for a couple of centuries, to, to

1642
01:26:07.799 --> 01:26:12.140
really unlock all these diff all these um You

1643
01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.270
know, to, to, yeah, to, to really find out

1644
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:16.910
all these differences, right? And to really appreciate these

1645
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:21.220
differences. Like, are we smart enough to To know

1646
01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:25.819
about planned intelligence. You know, you know, what we

1647
01:26:25.819 --> 01:26:28.600
hold as intelligence, it's very human oriented, right? Tool

1648
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.720
use, communication, altruism, you know, all these different characteristics

1649
01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.439
that are characteristic to our evolutionary trajectory. We've, we,

1650
01:26:37.479 --> 01:26:40.850
in our evolutionary track, we have, uh, you know,

1651
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.959
tool making and tool use. Many animals, of course,

1652
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.120
don't. Uh, DOES that make them less sophisticated? Well,

1653
01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:50.319
probably not, right? We don't really have a measure

1654
01:26:50.319 --> 01:26:54.259
to say, well, tool making, and we have I

1655
01:26:54.259 --> 01:26:57.979
don't know, like bat bats use sonar, right? How

1656
01:26:57.979 --> 01:27:00.490
do you compare the two? Which one is better?

1657
01:27:01.169 --> 01:27:03.609
You know, that, that, that's very, that becomes very

1658
01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:06.410
hard to say. So, this is a complex answer

1659
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:08.330
to maybe an easy question, like do plants have

1660
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:10.770
a personality? I think in a certain sense, you

1661
01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:12.930
could definitely talk about these sort of individual differences

1662
01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.009
in plants, but to call it a personality, I

1663
01:27:15.009 --> 01:27:18.120
think it implies too much, right? It's almost like,

1664
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.640
It shows this, this, this tendency to make plants

1665
01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.189
and animals into equivalents, while there are actually also

1666
01:27:26.319 --> 01:27:27.759
wide differences between the two.

1667
01:27:29.399 --> 01:27:32.600
So I have one last question and then perhaps

1668
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.189
we should have tackled it right at the beginning,

1669
01:27:35.359 --> 01:27:37.799
but I left it for the end because I

1670
01:27:37.799 --> 01:27:40.040
think it would be very interesting for you to

1671
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.029
tell us your ideas about it, uh, just before

1672
01:27:45.029 --> 01:27:50.419
we wrap up our conversation. So, Why should people

1673
01:27:50.419 --> 01:27:54.240
care about plants? I mean, since we have this

1674
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.479
plant blindness as we talked about in the very

1675
01:27:57.479 --> 01:28:01.200
beginning of our interview. Yeah. Uh, I mean, what

1676
01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.959
are, what would you say are the main reasons

1677
01:28:03.959 --> 01:28:07.580
why people should care about plants? Why do plants

1678
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.000
matter?

1679
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:17.100
So, Um, So, uh, a twofold answer. So first

1680
01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.770
of all, I think they matter a whole lot

1681
01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:24.770
because uh as compared to our primate relatives, we

1682
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:29.009
are a gardening ape, right? Uh, EVEN though many

1683
01:28:29.009 --> 01:28:31.729
of the, the, the great apes have great knowledge

1684
01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:34.609
of plants, uh, we're the only ones that have

1685
01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:37.259
gardens, and we just don't just have one garden,

1686
01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:41.189
we have uh a whole plethora of different garden

1687
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:45.930
types, and It shows that, I mean, Choosing this

1688
01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:50.060
path, right, this symbiotic path of plants and humans.

1689
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:54.549
Has, well, not only changed us. A whole lot,

1690
01:28:54.589 --> 01:28:58.290
but has made us highly dependent on planned and

1691
01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:02.729
planned survival. I mean, And I mean, this has

1692
01:29:02.729 --> 01:29:04.569
been appreciated by other people as well, right? There's

1693
01:29:04.569 --> 01:29:06.649
this great book that's called The Death of Grass,

1694
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:09.649
right, which talks about uh a virus breaking out

1695
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:13.520
amongst rice plants that mutates into a virus that

1696
01:29:13.689 --> 01:29:16.490
hits all grass species. And then the protagonists in

1697
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:19.140
the story find out how dependent we are on

1698
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:24.330
Grain, right, or wheat, rice, corn. These three grass

1699
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:28.049
species, only 3 grass species, right, of 11,000 grass

1700
01:29:28.049 --> 01:29:31.069
species, take care of 50% of our calorie intake

1701
01:29:31.069 --> 01:29:36.129
worldwide. That's Let's say that's a very weak foundation

1702
01:29:36.129 --> 01:29:40.319
to build a civilization on three dominant grass species,

1703
01:29:40.649 --> 01:29:43.450
especially considering the fact that they can be hit

1704
01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:45.649
by diseases, right? We know this to happen, to

1705
01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:49.879
occur. And this is true for Many of the

1706
01:29:49.879 --> 01:29:52.759
plants we use, we hardly usually know anything about

1707
01:29:52.759 --> 01:29:54.750
their origins. We don't really know where they come

1708
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.290
from. We don't really know who who cultivates them,

1709
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.509
unless you're from the place. But we're highly dependent

1710
01:30:00.509 --> 01:30:02.910
in our survival, right? It's the wood in our

1711
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.589
construction, it's the clothes we wear, it's the fuel

1712
01:30:05.589 --> 01:30:07.950
we put in our cars, it's, I mean, plants

1713
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:10.910
are all around and our, I mean, we are

1714
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:13.359
not as dominant if if we didn't, we didn't

1715
01:30:13.359 --> 01:30:16.270
make sure that plants, some plants are dominant as

1716
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:18.850
well, right? So, I think this is a point

1717
01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:22.080
that's not, that that's not really appreciated, especially since

1718
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.319
we're so city orientated, right? We don't necessarily take

1719
01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:28.770
take into account farming as being so important, but

1720
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:32.160
this is a mutualistic situation, right? We talk about

1721
01:30:32.529 --> 01:30:35.089
the domestication of plants and animals, but they've domesticated

1722
01:30:35.089 --> 01:30:37.979
us as well, right? It's a, it's a mutualistic

1723
01:30:37.979 --> 01:30:40.609
track we're on. So, we're really dependent on their

1724
01:30:40.609 --> 01:30:43.649
survival as well. But we're not really necessarily very

1725
01:30:43.649 --> 01:30:45.569
interested in their survival, right? And this is where

1726
01:30:45.569 --> 01:30:48.459
it becomes a bit stressing. Is that, of course,

1727
01:30:48.529 --> 01:30:50.729
there's many people interested in the survival of rice

1728
01:30:50.729 --> 01:30:54.689
and corn, etc. BUT then many people don't have

1729
01:30:54.689 --> 01:30:57.250
a clue. And I think for the survival of

1730
01:30:57.250 --> 01:31:00.979
our species, it's, it's it's it's utmost importance that

1731
01:31:00.979 --> 01:31:03.850
plants thrive as well. Now, beside it, cause that's

1732
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:06.450
a very human-centered way of looking at things, right?

1733
01:31:06.529 --> 01:31:08.490
They're very important for our survival, so we should

1734
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.729
have maybe a bit more appreciation for the fact

1735
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:13.470
that they are there. Um, BUT then there's just

1736
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:15.290
also just, and this is a bit the romantic

1737
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:18.549
in me. Of finding the planned world to be

1738
01:31:18.549 --> 01:31:22.029
highly interesting, right? And not only their capabilities, but

1739
01:31:22.029 --> 01:31:26.850
also their diversity, um. I mean, I'm always When

1740
01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:29.379
I started this sort of track and reading more

1741
01:31:29.379 --> 01:31:32.029
in botany and collecting books on botany, and visiting

1742
01:31:32.029 --> 01:31:35.350
botanical gardens, my appreciation for plants has only grown

1743
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:37.189
and grown and grown, right? It's so, I mean,

1744
01:31:37.229 --> 01:31:40.740
it's a, it's an amazing world to, to, to

1745
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:42.350
to be able to look into. And we have

1746
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:44.229
so much information on plants as well that we

1747
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:47.609
can, we can really appreciate all the plant kingdom

1748
01:31:47.609 --> 01:31:49.069
for, for, for what it is and all the

1749
01:31:49.069 --> 01:31:52.830
ecological surfaces it has, right? Uh, SO I guess

1750
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:55.270
also just maybe a little bit more decoupled from

1751
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:58.990
humans, I think. Plants are just super interesting, so.

1752
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.080
Maybe we should, you know, scratch ourselves a little

1753
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.009
bit behind the ears and, and, and sort of

1754
01:32:04.009 --> 01:32:06.609
think about why do we place so much attention

1755
01:32:06.609 --> 01:32:09.770
on animals, right? Why, uh, I mean, for good

1756
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.009
reasons, and animals are very interesting too, but we

1757
01:32:12.009 --> 01:32:14.770
should not forget that plants are, well, at least

1758
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:17.830
as interesting as animals as well, right? So, so,

1759
01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:19.089
I I I think it's also sort of a

1760
01:32:19.089 --> 01:32:22.250
call to say, you know, if you look into

1761
01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.100
Plants, you, you're gonna find a whole lot of

1762
01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.620
surprising uh things about life, right? And about and

1763
01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.759
great examples of evolution and great examples of ecology.

1764
01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.390
And uh so, so in that sense, I think

1765
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:36.290
appreciation of plant life is definitely do.

1766
01:32:37.879 --> 01:32:43.240
Mhm. And what kinds of topics will you be

1767
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.870
working on in the near future when it comes

1768
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:47.439
to botanic philosophy?

1769
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:50.770
So I've I've I've finished my dissertation, which needs

1770
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:52.649
to still be checked by the commission. So hopefully

1771
01:32:52.649 --> 01:32:56.649
doing my defense. And uh um so about invasion

1772
01:32:56.649 --> 01:32:58.810
ecology and the sort of the the the the

1773
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:02.250
rise of this this knowledge of invasive exotics, which

1774
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:05.279
we discussed, um, and I really want to work

1775
01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:06.879
on my, on my book on this sort of

1776
01:33:06.879 --> 01:33:10.640
cultural and natural history on weeds. Cause I think,

1777
01:33:10.979 --> 01:33:13.299
you know, weeds is a is a very interesting

1778
01:33:13.299 --> 01:33:15.620
category of plants because they don't exist without humans,

1779
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.609
right? It's a sort of, what is a weed

1780
01:33:17.609 --> 01:33:20.299
is a sort of relational property, right? It's certain

1781
01:33:20.299 --> 01:33:24.060
plants that we dislike. And um I'm just curious

1782
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:25.979
to find out why do we dislike him? What

1783
01:33:25.979 --> 01:33:28.379
reasons did we make for this? How are we

1784
01:33:28.379 --> 01:33:31.419
using weeds also in a metaphorical sense to talk

1785
01:33:31.419 --> 01:33:34.589
about humans, to talk about, well, I mean, there's

1786
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:36.950
Well, there's a lot to say about weeds, and

1787
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:39.709
I think it really also showcases uh our own

1788
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:42.979
nature, right? And, and how, how we are gardeners,

1789
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:45.109
and how we, you know, all of us have

1790
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:48.589
weeded plants before, which is quite astonishing, right? And

1791
01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:51.299
all of us are weeders in that sense. Um,

1792
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:53.649
SO yeah, I think that that question is super

1793
01:33:53.649 --> 01:33:55.750
interesting, like, what is a weed and and why

1794
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:58.009
do we think of certain plants as being so

1795
01:33:58.009 --> 01:34:01.870
villainous or so, so, uh, so detrimental, yeah.

1796
01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.470
And where can people find you and your work

1797
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:07.580
on the internet?

1798
01:34:08.839 --> 01:34:11.750
Uh, SO I, I, I, I have a website,

1799
01:34:11.959 --> 01:34:15.240
um, or maybe just Google my name, Norah Peters,

1800
01:34:15.299 --> 01:34:18.040
and then Botani Sofita Sofi Pinel is my, is

1801
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.200
my website, which is not super up to date,

1802
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.200
but there's definitely some lectures I gave in my

1803
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.799
books that I wrote, and, um, you can find

1804
01:34:24.799 --> 01:34:28.830
me at Wani University where I teach, um, and,

1805
01:34:28.839 --> 01:34:32.759
um, yeah, just Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, I'm on all

1806
01:34:32.759 --> 01:34:35.649
the social media platforms as well. So, uh, yeah,

1807
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:37.169
definitely have a look. I mean, most of the

1808
01:34:37.169 --> 01:34:38.850
things I write are in Dutch, and most of

1809
01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:40.290
the talks I do are in Dutch too, but

1810
01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:44.290
there's definitely also some English stuff there, um, yeah,

1811
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:47.529
and hopefully in the future more, so, yeah, that's

1812
01:34:47.529 --> 01:34:47.930
about it.

1813
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:51.990
Yeah, great. So, Norbert, thank you so much for
