00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.800
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.350
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Steven

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.399
Heine. He is distinguished university scholar and professor of

5
00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.439
social and cultural Psychology at the University of British

6
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.465
Columbia. I'm leaving a link in the description. BOX

7
00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.555
to our first interview and today we're talking about

8
00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:26.795
his latest book, Start Making Sense How Existential Psychology

9
00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.875
Can Help us build meaning meaningful lives in absurd

10
00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.834
Times. So, Doctor Hein, welcome to the show. It's

11
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.275
a pleasure to have you on again.

12
00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:38.380
Hi, Ricardo. Great to talk with you again.

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.619
OK, so let me start by asking you, since

14
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.779
we're going to talk about existential psychology today, what

15
00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:51.459
is existential psychology and how does it relate to

16
00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:53.819
other subfields in psychology?

17
00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:58.610
Yeah. Well, existential psychology, um, I think you could

18
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.830
describe it as the, the science of being and

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.919
becoming. And it's very much, um, uh, um, use,

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.650
uh, an approach using scientific methods to, to study

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.000
questions about how we live our lives. It's, uh,

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
it's about trying to, uh, Understand questions that were

23
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.690
originally asked by the existential philosophers, um, um, but

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.569
using scientific methods. And, and so these are questions

25
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.730
such as, you know, um, uh, how is it

26
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.190
that we can live our lives authentically with our,

27
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.010
with our, uh, lives aligned with the choices that

28
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.639
we make. Um, HOW is it that, uh, we

29
00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.089
can lead um meaningful lives? Um, HOW is it

30
00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:47.224
that we can cope with, um, Our existential anxieties

31
00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:50.175
about, about our mortality, about the idea that, that

32
00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:54.415
all of our, our lives will someday inevitably, uh,

33
00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.544
come to an end or questions about how we

34
00:01:57.544 --> 00:02:00.044
come to, to narrate our lives. How do we,

35
00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.665
we, uh, have a, a meaningful, um, narrative about,

36
00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.504
about what's going on in our lives and, uh,

37
00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:10.695
questions about, um, how we, uh, can be resilient

38
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:14.110
in, in the face of, of life stressors. And

39
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.229
questions about how we can try to make sense

40
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.750
when when things don't make sense, when when our

41
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.029
life uh sort of becomes absurd. How, how can

42
00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.339
we, uh, go forward, um, when, when things just

43
00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.800
don't seem to make sense at all. And, uh,

44
00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.889
so that's largely what the field is about. It's

45
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.080
a fairly recent field in psychology, I would say,

46
00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.270
even though these questions are very old questions. These

47
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.070
questions date back to sort of every tradition of,

48
00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.080
of wisdom kind of, uh, addresses these questions, but,

49
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.449
but now we're using the, the tools of modern

50
00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:47.250
psychological science to address them.

51
00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.339
Great. And do you think that now was a

52
00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.419
particularly important time to write a book on existential

53
00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.639
questions, and if so, why?

54
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.800
Yeah, I, I do think this is a very

55
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.419
timely um period to address the question of our

56
00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.869
our existential anxieties because this has been a very

57
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.789
anxious time around the world. Um, JUST sort of

58
00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.740
one way I think that we can make sense

59
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.309
of this is that in the 1990s, a group

60
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.389
of economists put together something they called the uncertainty

61
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.710
Index. And this was taking, keeping track of all

62
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.380
the times that uh stories in the news mentioned

63
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.509
things that were uncertain. And they started in the

64
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.009
90s and for, for about a decade or so,

65
00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.740
this, this index was always at around level about

66
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.009
10,000 or so. Then September 11th, 2001 hit with

67
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.169
terrorist attacks in the US and this jumped, jumped

68
00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.570
right away to to about 28,000, I think it

69
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.160
was, and then it's continued to go up until

70
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.330
actually the peak point was in May 2020. It

71
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.770
hit 55,000, so like 5 times the level of

72
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.279
uncertainty that it had been through these periods before.

73
00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.779
And we're feeling this uncertainty. We're, we're feeling this,

74
00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.740
this stress uh rates of anxiety are high all

75
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.950
around the world, uh, especially, uh, with, with youth.

76
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.798
And so I think this is a time when,

77
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.625
when people are, uh, especially struggling. Struggling with their

78
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:26.265
anxieties. And I think one reason that they're struggling

79
00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.584
with their anxieties is that, uh, their lives just

80
00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:33.325
don't feel as meaningful right now. And, and feeling

81
00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.065
that your life is meaningful is one thing that

82
00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:37.864
helps to, to buffer you against the stress and

83
00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:40.105
anxieties that come with the uncertainty of life.

84
00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.869
Mhm. And at a certain point in the book,

85
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.980
you say that humans have evolved to seek meaning.

86
00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:50.230
Could you, could you explain this? I mean, even

87
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.420
before we get into how we have evolved, uh,

88
00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.140
to seek meaning, first of all, what is meaning?

89
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.769
Yeah, that's, that's a great question. What, what does

90
00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:04.940
meaning mean? And um uh so there's been a

91
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.459
lot of uh research and discussion exploring this, and

92
00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:13.500
to simplify, ultimately, meaning comes down to connections. Uh,

93
00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.109
WHAT something means to you is all of the

94
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.730
ideas that you can connect to it. So, you

95
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.190
know, if I think of what is your podcast

96
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.910
mean to you, Ricardo, I would think it probably

97
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.589
means to you all of the, the, the people

98
00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.760
that you've gotten to know through this, the, the,

99
00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:32.510
the. The feelings of, of pride that you, you,

100
00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.350
uh, might have from, uh, doing this so well,

101
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.720
the feelings of the challenges that you faced, uh,

102
00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:41.600
in, in doing it, um, uh, the, the, you

103
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.239
know, the, the, the, the talks that were, uh,

104
00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.459
especially, uh, uh, provocative and interesting to you. That

105
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.660
all of these kinds of connections that you have

106
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.859
to it are, are what provide, um, your podcast

107
00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:54.779
with, with a sense of meaning to you. And

108
00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.179
if, and if any of these kinds of connections

109
00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:00.700
change dramatically, then what your podcast would mean to

110
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.000
you would would would also change. And that's meaning

111
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.989
in a, in a general sense. And we can

112
00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:09.459
apply that sort of same kind of general sense

113
00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:12.799
of meaning based on connections to a more specific

114
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.579
kind of meaning, uh, the meaning of our lives.

115
00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:18.420
And, and I think the meaning of our lives

116
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.019
too can ultimately be understood by the connections that

117
00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:23.899
we have in our life, that a that a

118
00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:28.730
richly connected life is an especially meaningful life. And,

119
00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:31.500
and the kinds of connections that matter are are

120
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.329
connections that give our life a sense of purpose,

121
00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.250
that we have a sense of we're doing things

122
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.839
for uh for a reason. Um, CONNECTIONS that our

123
00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.670
lives matter in some way, that what we're doing

124
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.480
has some sort of impact, um, in the grand

125
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.079
scheme of things, and also that, uh, these connections

126
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.000
are, are coherent and that that the different parts

127
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.260
of our lives, um, make sense. And these uh

128
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.269
kinds of connections here, um, uh, some kinds of

129
00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:06.660
connections seem to be especially important, I think, to

130
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.299
gaining a sense of uh meaning in life. And

131
00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.739
the kinds that seem to be most important are

132
00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:15.100
one are interpersonal connections in life that are close

133
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.779
interpersonal relationships are, are especially important in providing a

134
00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:21.179
sense of meaning that what happens to us is

135
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:24.779
kind of shared with our our our close relationships.

136
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.399
Um, ALSO, uh, we, uh, the kind of connections

137
00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:30.839
that we have with our communities, that the sense

138
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:32.670
that we belong to something that we have in,

139
00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:36.500
uh, that influences our identity is especially important to

140
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.790
a sense of meaning, um, connections that we have,

141
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.760
uh, with our work, um, that, uh, that, you

142
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.570
know, give us a sense of. Uh, OF mastery,

143
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.470
give us a sense of purpose and giving a

144
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.089
sense of belongingness, and also, uh, connections with what

145
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.670
transcends us sort of spiritual connections, connections with something

146
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.630
that goes beyond just our, uh, the, the material

147
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.390
world, that these kinds of connections are especially associated

148
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.220
with feelings that life is more meaningful. Mhm.

149
00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:10.140
And how have you, have we evolved to seek

150
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.299
meaning them. I, I, I mean, what were the

151
00:08:13.299 --> 00:08:16.239
perhaps the main steps that we had to take

152
00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:18.459
to evolve this capacity?

153
00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:22.660
Yeah, well, I think it's, it's useful to compare

154
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.390
ourselves with our, our closest animal relatives, which are

155
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.299
chimpanzees. We shared a common ancestor with them about

156
00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:32.979
7 million years ago. And one thing that I

157
00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.299
think is noteworthy is that primatologists and given over

158
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.979
all the many years of study of chimpanzees have

159
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:45.869
never observed a chimpanzee to commit suicide. Um, THAT'S

160
00:08:45.869 --> 00:08:49.500
something that we don't see, uh, with chimpanzees, and,

161
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.789
uh, sadly it's, it's, uh, something that we do

162
00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:55.789
sometimes see, uh, with, with humans. And so I

163
00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:58.309
think it's questionable, how is it that that we

164
00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:01.150
became, uh, what I think here is an existential

165
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.010
ape that that we've become. Um, AND that is

166
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.530
that we're in a predicament where like other species,

167
00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:09.130
we all face these external challenges that we have

168
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.010
to confront, you know, concerns with, with famine, concerns

169
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.330
with, with, with, with threat and and getting our

170
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.080
basic needs met. We share that with other species,

171
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.859
but we also have here these needs. That and

172
00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.190
threats that come from within us, that uh that

173
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.979
uh we need uh uh to feel that that

174
00:09:26.979 --> 00:09:29.289
our life is making sense, that that we have

175
00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:31.280
a sense of purpose and that that we we

176
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.099
matter, and that if we don't feel that that

177
00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:37.090
our life is so meaningful, we, we really struggle.

178
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.020
So how did we become this, this species now

179
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.159
that is so attuned to these kinds of existential

180
00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:47.580
concerns? And I think the uh the the best

181
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.219
way uh to make sense of this is to

182
00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:54.119
realize that ultimately, um, humans live in, I think,

183
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.419
an ecology of meaning, um, in ways that I

184
00:09:57.419 --> 00:10:00.070
don't think other species do. And what I mean

185
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.099
by this is that uh when humans get together,

186
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.880
uh, uh, we share meanings with each other. We,

187
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.669
we, we communicate with each other, and what happens

188
00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:12.349
when we do so is that we quickly create

189
00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:14.830
a set of norms, uh, a, a set of

190
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.750
norms that guide us, um, sort of which comes

191
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.989
from the sense of a shared reality that we

192
00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:23.630
perceive by sharing, uh, our experiences, uh, with each

193
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.929
other so much. And, and so that this shared

194
00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:30.900
reality forms our, our cultures. And, and these cultures

195
00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:33.340
don't take all that long to to form. There,

196
00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:35.760
there's been studies that, that find that like in

197
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.179
university dorms, at university dorms, uh, generate a distinctive

198
00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:43.099
culture, and, and it, it's evident, it's measurable after

199
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:45.739
only a few months of students living together that

200
00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:50.260
they start to create these dorm distinctive cultures, uh,

201
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.380
that, that emerge from people, uh, sharing their interactions

202
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.140
with each other. And so whenever we Belong to

203
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.760
a social network where we are sharing our experiences,

204
00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:01.400
we, we developed the sense of a shared reality

205
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.200
and these shared norms and, and, and this can

206
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.210
be at, at a small level, such as a

207
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.210
university dorm, but also exists at, at a like

208
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.609
a national level, so, uh, that we have a

209
00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:15.010
national culture where we're sharing the same institutions, sharing

210
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.080
the same media that that we are, uh, sharing

211
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.669
uh a lot of the, um, the same interactions

212
00:11:20.929 --> 00:11:23.609
and sort of really. Any kind of group where

213
00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:27.219
we are regularly interacting, we, we are forming these,

214
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.679
these cultures and, and so we belong to many

215
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.960
cultures, we belong to cultures of our region, we

216
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.080
belong to cultures of our country, we belong to

217
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.739
cultures, say, like LGBTQ culture, or we might belong

218
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.719
to a culture of a sport, like a hockey

219
00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:42.559
culture, or or you can talk about uh like

220
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:46.080
a corporate, a corporate culture, like Microsoft culture. So

221
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.969
we belong to many of these cultures. And what's

222
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:51.690
important about these cultures is that they provide for

223
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.049
us the these norms with regards to what is

224
00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:58.489
valued, what is seen as appropriate, and, and what

225
00:11:58.489 --> 00:12:03.590
is not tolerated. And we evaluate our lives alongside

226
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.385
these, these culturally shared. Norms and we sort of

227
00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:08.145
are in the position to ask ourselves, you know,

228
00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:10.744
how am I doing? How am I doing here

229
00:12:10.744 --> 00:12:13.385
with these, these shared norms of how I, I

230
00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:15.174
think I'm supposed to be the kind of life

231
00:12:15.174 --> 00:12:18.145
that, that, that I should be, be living that

232
00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:21.984
we, we get through our interactions with others, um.

233
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.719
And that they create these standards that we are

234
00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:28.080
sizing ourselves up against. And I think this is

235
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.520
a way that we can understand that we, yeah,

236
00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:32.150
we live in this ecology of uh of meaning

237
00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:35.429
and that uh um we've we've evolved to then

238
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.760
um sort of uh try to uh um live

239
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.000
a life that meets these, these standards from, from

240
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.719
our cultures.

241
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.599
And how important are stories and narratives for us

242
00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:51.320
to find meaning in life and what kinds of

243
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.710
stories do we need?

244
00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:56.849
Yeah, that's, that's, uh, an important focus of, of

245
00:12:56.849 --> 00:13:01.460
much of existential psychology is this, this realization that,

246
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.030
uh, we, we are living our lives in the

247
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.869
context of a story that we are narrating the

248
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.049
events of, of our life in terms of a,

249
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.510
a story. And this is, uh, um, something that

250
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.390
we might not necessarily be always aware of like.

251
00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:18.640
Feels that I'm have direct contact with, with reality,

252
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:21.159
that what, what's happening out there is, you know,

253
00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.440
is, um, how I'm perceiving it. But we're always

254
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.159
perceiving things through this, this filter through, through a

255
00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:29.559
perspective, really of, of the, the meanings that we

256
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:33.109
have, uh, around us, and that we're narrating things

257
00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:35.969
in the, uh, uh, events of a story. And,

258
00:13:35.979 --> 00:13:39.229
um, so one way maybe that we can see

259
00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:41.340
how, how we are living our lives in the

260
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.169
events of a story rather than experiencing it directly

261
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.760
is, uh, there's a lot of research on, uh,

262
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.940
false memories. And, and this research shows that it's,

263
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.619
it's not that difficult to, uh, implant a false

264
00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:55.859
memory in, in, in people, and that's what these

265
00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:58.880
studies do. They, they, they interview people's families and

266
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.400
find out what has happened in their lives. And

267
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.919
then they say, uh, well, remember that time that

268
00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:05.960
this thing happened, something that really didn't happen to

269
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.630
people, and they quickly can, uh, have the feeling

270
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.190
that yes, this happened, and they integrated into their

271
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.320
life and they connected to other aspects of their

272
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.039
life, and they become fully convinced that this did

273
00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:20.760
happen. So we, we are telling stories and, and

274
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.729
they're. You know, we each have our our own

275
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.299
stories and, and so the same thing might happen

276
00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:27.940
in the world, but because of how we integrate

277
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.219
in our stories, we can experience it quite differently.

278
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.799
I think we really saw this with the uh

279
00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:35.840
the COVID pandemic, that it really was the same

280
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.400
pandemic unfolding across the world, but to some people,

281
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.599
they told a story about how this is, you

282
00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:45.150
know, uh, the worst, uh, you know, uh, health,

283
00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:47.960
uh, challenge that the world's faced since the, the

284
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.469
Spanish flu, um, that it was, it was so

285
00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:52.960
dangerous, we, we needed to, to overcome it. We

286
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.099
needed to, you know, employ all these strategies to,

287
00:14:55.109 --> 00:14:58.640
to. IT, it's caused a great anxiety. And other

288
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.609
people instead told the story that this is no

289
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.239
big deal, uh, that this is all, you know,

290
00:15:04.429 --> 00:15:07.070
uh, um, fake news. This is the result of

291
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.789
a, you know, a totalitarian government trying to take

292
00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:13.719
away people's freedoms. And so, uh, that the same

293
00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.739
events might happen in the world, but, but how

294
00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:17.830
we perceive them, how we experience them as a

295
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.340
result of, of stories that we tell. And uh

296
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.210
and there's even though we are all telling our

297
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.820
own story, they they often share some similar features

298
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.299
with with other people's stories. Um, AND, uh, for

299
00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.539
example, that, uh, some kinds of stories, uh, for

300
00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:39.739
example, there's a story of redemption is one kind

301
00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:42.299
of theme that's quite common in people's stories and

302
00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:45.460
that talks about, it's a story about how people

303
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.929
overcome a challenge. Their life that, you know, I

304
00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:50.530
had this real difficulty that that I was facing

305
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.890
and, and I've sort of overcome it. And, and

306
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.609
this is a very constructive story that that when

307
00:15:55.609 --> 00:15:58.179
people are framing their life in these ways, they,

308
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.289
uh, it tends to be associated with, with greater

309
00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:04.869
well-being. Um, ANOTHER kind of story theme that that

310
00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:07.270
people might tell is a, uh, a story of

311
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.710
contamination, which is when, uh, they tell a story

312
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.390
about how things have been going well in their

313
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.070
life, and then that something happened and their life

314
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.510
just kind of fell apart after that and they

315
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.729
sort of broken by by those events, um, and,

316
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:22.929
and this is a a kind of story that,

317
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.869
that is quite, uh, you know, destructive towards one

318
00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:28.900
and and this. Bad for for one's well-being. But

319
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.900
yeah, so that we are experiencing our life through

320
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.900
the, the story that we are narrating. We, it's

321
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.650
research suggests that it's around adolescence that we start

322
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.780
putting the different parts of our lives together in

323
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.140
a story and talk about how we became the

324
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.419
person we are and, and, and where we're going

325
00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:46.659
and how all the different events that we happened

326
00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:49.419
sort of fit in to this ongoing narrative that

327
00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:50.450
we tell about ourselves.

328
00:16:52.049 --> 00:16:54.700
And another uh thing that you tackle in the

329
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.450
book, what happens to us psychologically when we encounter

330
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.809
things that do not fit our expectations?

331
00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:06.339
Yeah, so this is something that that I've done

332
00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.270
quite a bit of research on myself and, and

333
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.989
yeah, we're, we're understanding how it is that that

334
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:15.510
people go, uh, uh, about their, their lives trying

335
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.790
to make sense, trying to fit everything together, but

336
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.150
sometimes life just doesn't make sense, and, and, and

337
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.969
how do we, uh, respond to this? And, uh,

338
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.689
and, and we propose that uh people have something

339
00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:30.239
of a, we call it a a sense-making system

340
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.010
where that, that we are, are, are motivated for

341
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.229
things to, to make sense, for things to have

342
00:17:35.229 --> 00:17:38.699
meaning, and that when we encounter something that, that

343
00:17:38.699 --> 00:17:41.869
doesn't make sense, that, that doesn't have meaning, uh,

344
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.890
we, we respond in a way to try to

345
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.005
regain a sense. So I mean, we, we, we

346
00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:48.525
really have a need for things to feel that

347
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.555
they make sense. And, and we rely on a,

348
00:17:50.564 --> 00:17:53.875
a number of different strategies in order to, uh,

349
00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:56.484
uh, to for things to make sense again. So

350
00:17:56.484 --> 00:17:59.724
it's, this is a homeostatic system, uh, much like

351
00:17:59.724 --> 00:18:02.314
a thermostat that you have, and that it's triggered

352
00:18:02.525 --> 00:18:05.635
when we encounter things that, that don't make sense.

353
00:18:06.099 --> 00:18:08.079
And what we have found in our research is

354
00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:10.949
that there seem to be 3 basic kinds of

355
00:18:10.949 --> 00:18:14.229
responses that people have, uh, when, when things don't

356
00:18:14.229 --> 00:18:18.030
make sense. Uh, ONE kind of response is something

357
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.229
that, uh, was originally studied and proposed by a

358
00:18:21.229 --> 00:18:24.430
Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, and he was studying

359
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.750
how kids make sense in their lives and they

360
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.420
encounter things that are new to them and and

361
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.589
don't make sense. And he argued that one kind

362
00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:35.109
of response, um, uh, he called, uh, assimilation. Uh,

363
00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:38.189
I prefer the term faking meaning where, uh, what

364
00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:40.680
happens is we encounter something that that doesn't make

365
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.560
sense, and, and our first default reaction is to

366
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.800
sort of assume, no, no, it makes sense. It

367
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.000
fits with, with the existing meaning framework. I have

368
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.560
this this sort of schema uh around me of

369
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.979
how I explain these kinds of, of events. And

370
00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:58.819
I think a a a nice experimental example of

371
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.180
of how we do this faking meaning, uh, is

372
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.219
from an old study by, uh, Jerome Brunner, who

373
00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:08.660
wanted to see how people respond when, uh, their,

374
00:19:08.729 --> 00:19:13.729
their expectations are violated. Studied a very simple expectation,

375
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.930
um, playing cards, and you know, a deck of

376
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.209
playing cards has has regular patterns. It has, you

377
00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:23.290
know, there's 4 suits, there's 2 colors, there's there's

378
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.660
13 different cards uh within a suit. And, and

379
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.930
what Jerome Bruner did, is he carefully painted over

380
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.050
the, uh, um, these cards, and he changed the,

381
00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.180
the red colors to black and the black colors

382
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.489
to red. So there's like red clubs and black

383
00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:41.219
diamonds. And what he would do is he would

384
00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:43.300
show people a card, one of these doctor cards

385
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.579
and say, what card is this? And what he

386
00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:49.339
found is that people saw the card the way

387
00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:51.699
that they expected to see it. So they, they

388
00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:53.819
see a uh a 6 of diamonds, a black

389
00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:57.099
6 of diamonds. And they say, yeah, that's uh,

390
00:19:57.219 --> 00:19:59.010
that's a 6 of diamonds, and they, they don't

391
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.859
notice anything, uh, unusual about it, that they, it

392
00:20:02.859 --> 00:20:05.369
looks like a red 6 of diamonds to them

393
00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:08.699
at first. But, um, the, the thing about this

394
00:20:08.699 --> 00:20:11.099
faking meaning that we do is it's, it's rare.

395
00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:15.079
COMPLETE. And instead, uh, what he also found was

396
00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:17.439
that people started to get anxious over the course

397
00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:19.709
of, of the study and then they, they would,

398
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.550
um, he called these disruptions that people would experience.

399
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.079
Some of them were reported, uh, in their study,

400
00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:27.349
they report people getting really quite upset and like

401
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:29.569
I, I, I, I don't know what that is

402
00:20:29.569 --> 00:20:31.609
anymore, and, and they would get really quite, quite

403
00:20:31.609 --> 00:20:34.689
tense. And, um, so I think that this idea

404
00:20:34.689 --> 00:20:37.300
here that we see things that we expect, that

405
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.050
often that's our first reaction is, is, is that

406
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.130
we see what we expect to see, and this

407
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.010
is this kind of faking me that goes on.

408
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.640
Another response to uh uh when our expectations are

409
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.000
violated what what PSA has studied, he called uh

410
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.560
accommodation, um, and I, I prefer the term um

411
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.359
making meaning, and that's when we sort of have

412
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:03.119
the recognition that oh. This is different from my

413
00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:07.359
uh my uh current understanding of things and uh

414
00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:10.599
I need to adjust my meaning framework. I need

415
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:13.800
to adjust my understanding of it to to um

416
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.420
accommodate this, this, this sort of new finding. Um,

417
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:21.969
AND this is something that, um, uh, um, Thomas

418
00:21:21.969 --> 00:21:24.849
Kuhn, I think importantly talked about this too. Whenever

419
00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:29.099
uh science goes through, uh, uh, a progressive paradigm

420
00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:32.459
change, when, when we adjust our understanding of science,

421
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.300
when we have some new findings that just don't

422
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.969
fit into the old theories, we, we have to

423
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.530
change our theories or our our meaning frameworks, uh,

424
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.219
about them, and, and, uh, and this is how

425
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:48.160
we create new meaning. But the, the challenge with

426
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.420
creating new meaning is that this is can be

427
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.339
extremely difficult to do, that we are so committed

428
00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:57.640
to our The meaning frameworks that we are familiar

429
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.489
with that we live our life with that it's

430
00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:03.540
very hard to realize that that our current meaning

431
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.890
frameworks are inadequate and that we need to to

432
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.170
change them. And so this is something then that

433
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.689
changing our meaning frameworks requires a great deal of

434
00:22:12.689 --> 00:22:15.930
cognitive effort and can take a great deal of

435
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.810
time. And so a third response that we found

436
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.119
in our own studies is that, uh, when people,

437
00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:27.400
uh, uh, face something that doesn't make sense, um,

438
00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:30.680
and it's, you know, it's too difficult, too cognitively,

439
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.849
uh, challenging to come to understand it. Uh, INSTEAD,

440
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.130
what people will do in this moment, in this

441
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.199
moment when they're sort of having this sense that

442
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.069
this doesn't make sense to me, they instead commit

443
00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:47.859
themselves to Other meaning framework that they embrace that

444
00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:51.819
another way that they tend to understand the world

445
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:56.750
that is completely unrelated to the expectation violation that

446
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.150
they they've just experienced, but they increase their commitment

447
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.430
to another belief that they have so they can

448
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.069
feel again that, oh things make sense again and

449
00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:09.189
they can get rid of this bothersome feeling that

450
00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:11.810
they have that, uh, That things are things are

451
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.050
nonsensical. So what we find in our studies, for

452
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.849
instance, when, when people encounter something that doesn't make

453
00:23:17.849 --> 00:23:20.969
sense, they become an exaggerated version of themselves in

454
00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:25.849
other unrelated domains so that liberal people will become

455
00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:29.930
more liberal, conservative people will become more conservative, that

456
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.729
people increase their commitment to these unrelated belief belief

457
00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:36.369
systems that they have, and by doing so they

458
00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:39.579
can Get the feeling that oh things make sense

459
00:23:39.579 --> 00:23:41.459
again and and sort of get rid of this

460
00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:45.060
bothersome anxiety. This doesn't solve the problem that they

461
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.969
just encountered, but it puts them in a state

462
00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:49.369
where they can function again and are better prepared

463
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.219
to understand this problem and and other problems that

464
00:23:52.219 --> 00:23:53.260
they face in their lives.

465
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.680
So earlier when you were talking about uh or

466
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.520
you gave some examples of things that provide meaning

467
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.719
to our lives, you mentioned social relationships, but what

468
00:24:05.719 --> 00:24:09.719
are the kinds of social relationships that we need

469
00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:12.000
to find our lives more meaningful?

470
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.880
Yeah, so, so our social relationships are, are important,

471
00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:20.280
uh, part of feeling that that life is meaningful,

472
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.489
and, um, and not just any social relationship will

473
00:24:24.489 --> 00:24:29.319
do. So, um. So one line of research has

474
00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:32.479
found that when we uh talk with strangers, we

475
00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:36.520
often feel happier, um, and, uh, I, I think

476
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.040
that's really interesting research and, and, and, and an

477
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.729
important finding, but um. I don't think talking with

478
00:24:42.729 --> 00:24:45.089
strangers actually makes your life feel that much more

479
00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:47.930
meaningful and just to sort of kind of highlight

480
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.209
a contrast between happiness and sense of life is

481
00:24:51.209 --> 00:24:55.329
meaningful, that, uh, these, these, these correlate quite highly,

482
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:59.270
but they only overlap about. And um and sort

483
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.750
of what uh brings this sort of positive feelings

484
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.270
is what, what happiness is, but, but uh a

485
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.790
sense of meaning though again is this, the sense

486
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.900
that that that one feels that their life is

487
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.869
is connected and they feel a sense of purpose

488
00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:13.339
and feel a sense of mattering. And so talking

489
00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:15.089
with strangers might make you happy, but I don't

490
00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:17.619
think that makes you feel that, that, uh, that

491
00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:19.300
these are the kind of connections that that provide

492
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.810
the basis of a, of a meaningful life. Rather,

493
00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:26.180
it's our closest connections that, um, that, uh, the

494
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.280
studies that, uh, find that people who Um, have

495
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.959
more of of relationships that they view as very

496
00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:35.839
close, report that their life is more meaningful. And

497
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:38.880
in particular, one kind of close relationship seems to

498
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.319
especially matter, and that's uh relationships when they're taking

499
00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:46.500
on a caretaker role. Um, SUCH as, you know,

500
00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:49.339
uh, taking care of the elderly or taking care

501
00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.449
of a pet, or, or especially taking care of,

502
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.239
uh, children, um, and so having children. And, and

503
00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:59.479
yeah, family relationships in general too, which, which are

504
00:25:59.479 --> 00:26:02.699
relationships, close relationships that we have uh often, you

505
00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:04.939
know, over the whole course of our lifetime, at

506
00:26:04.939 --> 00:26:07.790
least some of these relationships, and, and that these

507
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.199
provide us with this, uh, not only with a

508
00:26:10.199 --> 00:26:13.760
sense of, uh, close connection with others, um, but

509
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.599
also with, with a key sense of uh identity.

510
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.939
Um, SO I think these are many kinds of

511
00:26:19.939 --> 00:26:23.260
relationships help make life feel more meaningful, but I

512
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.260
think it's, uh, especially, um, these family relationships and,

513
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.939
and ones that we take on, uh, a caretaker

514
00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:33.319
role. And I would just like to emphasize because

515
00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:35.449
uh in a way that this might sound rather

516
00:26:35.449 --> 00:26:38.329
uh disappointing for some people who don't feel that

517
00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:42.239
they um Maybe have close family relationships or or

518
00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:44.709
have relationships where they're taking on a a caretaker

519
00:26:44.709 --> 00:26:46.949
role. But there's one thing I think that's quite

520
00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:51.510
encouraging about um research on meaning and that um

521
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.949
meaning seems to be fungible, uh fungible like money

522
00:26:54.949 --> 00:26:57.670
is fungible, meaning that we can pay for the

523
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.349
meaning of our life from from different accounts. And

524
00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:03.469
so even if one is not deriving much meaning

525
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:07.459
from one particular domain. Just from one's, uh, interpersonal

526
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:11.550
relationships that, uh, you can still derive meaning from

527
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.180
another domain that can make up for that. So

528
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.989
we can sort of make up for, uh, uh,

529
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.069
uh, a lack of meaning in our, in our

530
00:27:19.069 --> 00:27:21.630
close relationships, but by having a, uh, a more

531
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.030
inspiring career, that the meaning that we get from

532
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.530
that can sort of make up for, uh, the,

533
00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:28.140
the kind of lack of meaning that we might

534
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.550
have, uh, from our interpersonal relationships.

535
00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:37.040
What about religion or religiosity? At a certain point

536
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.189
in the book you talk about uh the feeling

537
00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:45.199
connected to something that transcends oneself. So for someone

538
00:27:45.199 --> 00:27:48.400
to have that in their life, do they need

539
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.959
to be religious necessarily?

540
00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:55.880
Yeah, that's a great question. And, um, well, so

541
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.479
this is one thing that uh the the literature

542
00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:02.680
very consistently finds is that people who report that

543
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.239
they are religious tend to report that they're, they

544
00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:09.119
find their life to be more meaningful, and especially

545
00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:11.959
one aspect of a feeling of meaning, uh, is

546
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:14.599
the sense that their life matters, and the people

547
00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:17.550
who are more religious are more likely to say

548
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.619
that their that their life matters. And And um

549
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.260
this research, I think, you know, in a way

550
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:29.300
is is uh perhaps uh somewhat concerning because, uh,

551
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.660
around the world, uh, in many industrialized societies, there's

552
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.250
been a shift away from religion and that that

553
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.500
that people are are are becoming um more secular

554
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.420
and and like working in the in the academy,

555
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.550
it's it's it's a very sort of uh uh

556
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.969
a secular um environment, um. But we've been uh

557
00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:51.770
conducting some research and we find that actually a

558
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.250
lot of these kinds of uh spiritual connections that

559
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.250
people have and the kind that bring their life

560
00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:02.369
meaning aren't exclusive to uh religions, um, and that,

561
00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:05.650
uh, uh, many people find these same kinds of

562
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.689
connections uh through uh uh their more personalized uh

563
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.819
uh spiritual beliefs. So the uh one of the

564
00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:18.900
fastest growing categories of of beliefs uh around the

565
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.099
world and, and especially in in industrialized societies right

566
00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:24.780
now is a category it's called a spiritual but

567
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.020
not religious, uh, and so, uh, these people who

568
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.900
they, they don't subscribe to any formal, uh, formalized

569
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.780
sort of religious group, uh, don't follow any specific

570
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.040
religious doctrine. But they have more of a uh

571
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.209
sort of do it yourself kind of a buffet

572
00:29:42.209 --> 00:29:45.050
approach to uh to ideas about the the the

573
00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.890
hereafter. And so, for instance, they might, uh, you

574
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:54.069
know, uh, engage in some Zen meditation practices, uh,

575
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.069
alongside alongside some yogic traditions or maybe they're into

576
00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:02.719
crystals or or or horoscopes or or or, you

577
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:06.079
know, um uh uh tarot cards or or or

578
00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:08.510
something like that, they sort of have cobbled together

579
00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:11.839
their own sort of unique set of of spiritual

580
00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:15.390
beliefs. And in our own research, we we've compared

581
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.670
uh religious people to spiritual but not religious people

582
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:24.189
and to non-believers, uh, regarding, um, what we've looked

583
00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:26.530
at is their, their level of meaning in life

584
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.030
and, uh, their level of spiritual beliefs, and their

585
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.030
level of uh social connection. And, uh, and what

586
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.390
we find is like other research that religious people

587
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.780
are doing really well. That's what this research was

588
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.020
religious people report that their lives are are are

589
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.829
are very meaningful. But the spiritual but not religious

590
00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:47.420
report that their lives are almost as meaningful as

591
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.500
the religious people and and considerably more than those

592
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.310
who are are non-believers. And looking at our data

593
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.750
more more carefully and understand well why are spiritual

594
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.030
but not religious people feeling that their lives are

595
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.619
so meaningful, and we find that it's actually their

596
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:07.410
their mystical beliefs. That are correlating with their feelings

597
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.530
that that life is meaningful. Beliefs such as a

598
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.849
uh a a belief in karma, uh or a

599
00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:15.719
belief that uh that they feel connected to the

600
00:31:15.729 --> 00:31:18.530
the universe in some way, or even beliefs in

601
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.969
like superstitions, or even beliefs in something called the

602
00:31:21.969 --> 00:31:23.969
law of attraction, the idea that, you know, if

603
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:25.849
you if you really believe something that you can

604
00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:30.130
make it happen. And, and that these individual beliefs

605
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.459
are, are what are associated with, with uh greater

606
00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:36.109
feelings of, of meaning in life. And, and we've

607
00:31:36.109 --> 00:31:38.619
seen this in, in, in several different cultures around

608
00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:41.180
the world that these kinds of spiritual beliefs are

609
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.060
associated with their uh uh feelings of meaning in

610
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.939
life. The other category of uh predictors of a

611
00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:51.900
meaning in life that we found there is people's

612
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.680
degree of social connections and Uh, religious people tend

613
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.640
to feel more socially connected than do the other

614
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.040
groups, and we find that it's the feelings of

615
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.150
social connection that distinguish religious people from the spiritual

616
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.040
but not religious. So the, the, the religious people

617
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.119
seem to get two boosts here. They have these

618
00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:14.040
mystical beliefs that make them feel connected to something

619
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.760
bigger than themselves, and then they also have uh

620
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.359
greater social connections, uh, perhaps others in in their

621
00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:23.770
religion. And those things seem to predict uh feelings

622
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.369
of a of a of a meaningful life. And,

623
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.959
and sort of one other way that we've uh

624
00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:31.770
found and found this, and I, I should say

625
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.130
I found this all quite surprising myself that I'm

626
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:38.530
quite a secular um person. Um, MYSELF, and so

627
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.959
was, was not really looking out to, to find

628
00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:43.439
that, you know, these mystical beliefs are so valuable,

629
00:32:43.449 --> 00:32:45.930
but this is what we've been finding. We also

630
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.290
studied scientists and uh we had a big sample

631
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.130
of, of, of people employed in scientific fields and

632
00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.280
um and we we measured their attitudes towards science

633
00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.890
and cause science shares something like religion in terms

634
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.089
of it provides a worldview for making sense of

635
00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:05.530
what's happening around the world and And we found

636
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.050
that that uh we found sort of three different

637
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:11.449
categories of of scientific beliefs, um, that sort of

638
00:33:11.449 --> 00:33:15.680
clustered together. Um, ONE of these is, uh, called

639
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.560
scientific optimism, a sense that, you know, through science

640
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.869
things will get better, that we can solve problems

641
00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:25.719
through through science. Uh, ANOTHER, uh, cluster of beliefs,

642
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.680
um, we called, um, scientism that, uh, the belief

643
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.199
that science is sort of like the only route

644
00:33:32.359 --> 00:33:35.439
to to knowledge, it's, it's the only valid way

645
00:33:35.439 --> 00:33:38.489
of understanding things. And a and a third belief

646
00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:41.569
system we called scientific reductionism, which is sort of

647
00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:44.890
the idea that everything can be explained fundamentally in

648
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.569
terms of basic scientific principles that ultimately everything is

649
00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:50.290
just a bunch of particles uh um that that

650
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.680
are just combined in in in different ways. And,

651
00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:55.449
and what we found with that is that the

652
00:33:55.449 --> 00:33:59.689
more that someone embraces the scientific reductionist perspectives and

653
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.930
the the scientistic perspectives, actually they score lower in

654
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.890
a sense of that life is meaningful, especially with

655
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.370
the sense that their life matters. Um, SCIENTIFIC optimism

656
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.409
was uh slightly positively related to to more meaning

657
00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.510
in life, but just the idea that We can

658
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.458
explain everything as as part of a materialistic universe

659
00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:24.330
that this seems to be associated with lower uh

660
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.270
Feelings of of meaning in life. So I, I

661
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.228
think this research has convinced me at least, that

662
00:34:30.228 --> 00:34:34.270
there's something important about believing that there's more than

663
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.228
just what's here, what we're encountering in the here

664
00:34:37.228 --> 00:34:41.070
and now, that there's more to to uh to

665
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.790
life, to the universe than than just this material

666
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.668
basis of it. And now that seems to be

667
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:48.739
an especially valuable kind of perspective to take that

668
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.870
that people who have that perspective report that their

669
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.870
life is more meaningful.

670
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:57.829
In what ways does our being aware of our

671
00:34:57.829 --> 00:35:01.708
own mortality, our knowing that we will die when

672
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:07.229
they affect us uh existentially and psychologically and uh

673
00:35:07.229 --> 00:35:09.188
how do people deal with that?

674
00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:13.290
Yeah, so this is one of the big existential

675
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.050
challenges that, that, that we face, you know, that

676
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.409
uh we're leading this, this life-riching experience that we're

677
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:23.030
we're telling this, this life narrative. And that we

678
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.030
are aware that someday it's all gonna come to

679
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.850
an end, that someday we reach the last page

680
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.110
of of our of our life story. And, and

681
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.750
this creates a a a great deal of existential

682
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.949
anxiety that that that we have a drive to

683
00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:41.030
want to persist in things. And, and like, like

684
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.669
all species, you know, we are trying to survive,

685
00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:45.979
that we're trying to avoid things that are threatening.

686
00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:48.754
We, we, we are uh. Trying to approach things

687
00:35:48.754 --> 00:35:50.554
that, that, that are, that are nourishing, that are

688
00:35:50.554 --> 00:35:53.834
rewarding. Um, SO we're trying to survive, but here

689
00:35:53.834 --> 00:35:57.514
we have this awareness, um, that, uh, that someday

690
00:35:57.514 --> 00:36:00.264
we're gonna fail at this. Inevitably, we're gonna fail,

691
00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:02.274
and, and that this creates a, a great deal

692
00:36:02.274 --> 00:36:06.274
of anxiety about this. And so, uh, this question

693
00:36:06.274 --> 00:36:08.895
has been explored a lot in, uh, a research

694
00:36:08.895 --> 00:36:12.770
tradition called terror management theory. Uh, WHICH is explored

695
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.479
just how, how people respond to this, this existential

696
00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:19.389
terror that comes with the awareness that that our

697
00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:23.290
life someday, uh, is, is going to end. And,

698
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.550
and what this theory has proposed and has demonstrated

699
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:32.350
in, uh, more than 1000 studies, um, Is that

700
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.550
uh when people are reminded of the fact that

701
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.010
they're going to die. We all know this, but

702
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.790
we try to keep this thought out of, out

703
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.669
of awareness here that we generally are, are, are

704
00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:46.639
thinking about our lives in terms of, of, um,

705
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.030
you know, all, all of, uh, All of our

706
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.270
relationships, all of our ambitions, all that that that

707
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.750
we are trying to do, that's what we tend

708
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.870
to focus on. And the fact that someday we're

709
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.870
gonna fail at all these, all these things are

710
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.580
gonna come to an end is is really bothersome.

711
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.590
And so what this theory, Terry Madison theory proposes

712
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.139
is that that people want to Feel that they

713
00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:09.540
are immortal in some way that we that we

714
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.290
have this strong drive to think that that the,

715
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.179
um, that, that in some way that that that

716
00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:19.500
our that our lives will continue to exist. And

717
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.540
it proposes that we, we do so in one

718
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.860
of two ways. One, we aspire for something that

719
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.330
they call symbolic immortality. And, and the uh the

720
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:33.419
way that we can achieve this is that, um,

721
00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:37.179
uh, that. We, we recognize that that we are

722
00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:40.020
part of a culture, um, and, and that our

723
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.780
cultures, uh, are somewhat more immortal than than we

724
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.899
are, at least, and that, that our cultures have

725
00:37:45.899 --> 00:37:47.979
often been around for a long time and we

726
00:37:47.979 --> 00:37:50.659
expect that they're gonna continue to exist, uh, in

727
00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:53.729
the, in the future. And so we can come

728
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:57.100
to feel a little more symbolically immortal if we

729
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.979
can view ourselves as a, as a key player

730
00:38:00.979 --> 00:38:03.659
in the in this meaningful cultural drama that that

731
00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:07.399
we, uh, exist within. And so that people can

732
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.100
respond to these thoughts of death by thinking of

733
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.929
their culture as being sort of, uh, uh, um,

734
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.229
better, more enduring, more stable, and that they are

735
00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:21.074
someone who's living up. To their cultural ideals. So

736
00:38:21.074 --> 00:38:23.314
the kinds of reactions that they get in, in

737
00:38:23.314 --> 00:38:25.475
studies where they remind people of the fact that

738
00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:27.375
they're going to die is they find that after

739
00:38:27.375 --> 00:38:29.754
that, people will become a little more patriotic. I

740
00:38:29.754 --> 00:38:33.274
think that my culture is really good, um, that

741
00:38:33.274 --> 00:38:37.104
they, uh, will become, uh, they, they want to,

742
00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:39.945
uh, defend the status quo more, they want to

743
00:38:40.034 --> 00:38:42.675
punish people who break rules more that, that as

744
00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:44.155
a way of sort of protecting the, the sort

745
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.995
of cultural system of, of how we're supposed to

746
00:38:45.995 --> 00:38:50.929
be. Um, AND they come to view their culture

747
00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:54.100
as better than other people's cultures, that, that we're

748
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.810
the chosen people, um, and, and not others. The,

749
00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.340
the existence of other people's worldviews kind of challenges

750
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.419
the idea that that that that our culture is

751
00:39:02.419 --> 00:39:04.780
special, that that that that uh we we're the

752
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.939
chosen people. And so there have been many hundreds

753
00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:11.209
of uh of studies that have demonstrated this. The

754
00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:14.270
theory is, is somewhat controversial and, and, uh, there

755
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.139
have been questions about how replicable these studies are.

756
00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:20.459
We, we have recently published a paper where we

757
00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:24.379
reviewed the entire literature, uh, that we're able to

758
00:39:24.379 --> 00:39:29.580
uh um quantify, um, uh, in this case. Investigated

759
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.169
one particular question, um, which was over 800 studies,

760
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.300
and we find that overall across all these studies

761
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.459
that there is, uh, pretty good, not perfect, but

762
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.620
pretty good psychometric evidence that that this effect seems

763
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.850
to be real and and uh and and stable.

764
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.969
Um, SO that's one way that people respond is

765
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:53.389
trying to become symbolically immortal, but really, Symbolic immortality

766
00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:56.550
has its limits, uh, um, really what people desire

767
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.189
to feel that they are immortal, that they will

768
00:39:59.189 --> 00:40:02.790
continue to exist. And so another way that that

769
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.070
people respond to thoughts about death is that we

770
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.270
Most people uh have some kind of uh religious

771
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.719
belief. Um, THERE'S religions all around all around the

772
00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:15.389
world. It's, it's, it's a, it's a universal feature

773
00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:19.709
of our uh society. All cultures have religions, and,

774
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.669
and they, uh, uh, almost all of them, uh,

775
00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:25.399
uh, and with the exceptions are just a little

776
00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:27.870
unclear, but almost all of them promised some kind

777
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.469
of continued existence after our death. Um, THAT either

778
00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:34.919
you're gonna be reincarnated or or you're going to

779
00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:37.989
um go hopefully to heaven or but maybe to

780
00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:40.629
hell, that somehow that that you will continue to

781
00:40:40.629 --> 00:40:44.979
exist, uh, um, past, uh, uh, um, or, uh,

782
00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:48.010
after you die. And um and research finds that,

783
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.840
yeah, when you remind people of their death, they're

784
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.250
more likely to have these beliefs and there's the

785
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.120
saying, you know, there there's no atheists and foxholes,

786
00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.219
and yet after people have these encounters that that

787
00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:03.409
where they're reminded facing this threat that they could

788
00:41:03.409 --> 00:41:06.129
almost die, they are common reactions for people to

789
00:41:06.129 --> 00:41:09.530
become more religious then and embrace more this idea

790
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.090
that no, no, somehow we're going to continue to

791
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.129
exist. Some part of me is going to continue

792
00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:15.719
to exist in the future.

793
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.379
So you do lots of work in cultural psychology.

794
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.739
So I would like to ask you now, when

795
00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:25.500
it comes to the kinds of things that people

796
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.969
uh give meaning to or that find meaningful, do

797
00:41:29.969 --> 00:41:32.500
they vary a lot cross culturally?

798
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.679
Yeah, well, I think there's some ways that we

799
00:41:36.679 --> 00:41:41.399
can see uh differences in uh um uh things

800
00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:43.239
that provide a sense of meaning in life, but

801
00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:45.879
in some ways there's also uh a lot of

802
00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:50.020
similarities. Um, SO one thing that where you can

803
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.239
see, uh, quite clear differences in, in, uh, a

804
00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:55.340
sense of meaning in life is that people who

805
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.860
live in more collectivistic cultures on average tend to

806
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.379
report that their lives are more meaningful than people

807
00:42:01.379 --> 00:42:05.840
who live in more individualistic cultures. Um, AND, uh,

808
00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.820
I think this kind of makes sense when we

809
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.949
think of the, uh, the idea that connections underlying,

810
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.489
uh, sense of a meaningful life, and that, uh,

811
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:18.699
people living in collectivistic societies really are connected to

812
00:42:18.699 --> 00:42:21.340
at least these collectives more to they belong to

813
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.909
these, uh, enduring interpersonal relationships which are sort of,

814
00:42:24.969 --> 00:42:29.020
uh, uh, that are prioritized and, and, and that

815
00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.979
they are, are, are guiding their lives. So they

816
00:42:30.979 --> 00:42:34.840
belong in a more fundamental sense. Then I think

817
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.520
to people in individualistic societies who are sort of

818
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.270
choosing, uh, the, the, the relationships that they form,

819
00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:44.949
they are choosing what to do, but prioritizing their

820
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:48.639
their own individual perspective. And, and that I think

821
00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:51.439
makes it, uh, a little, uh, makes one a

822
00:42:51.439 --> 00:42:54.629
little more vulnerable here to, to having the sense

823
00:42:54.629 --> 00:42:58.120
that, that, that one's life is, is, is meaningful

824
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.729
because it's all up to me and, but up

825
00:43:01.729 --> 00:43:04.370
to me. I'm, I'm vulnerable. I, I make mistakes.

826
00:43:04.459 --> 00:43:06.889
I, uh, I might not be doing things right,

827
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:09.449
um, and I'm maybe not gonna be as well

828
00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.899
connected as someone from a more collectivistic culture. So

829
00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:15.129
that's one way that we can see a difference,

830
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.060
uh, across societies. Another way, which I, uh, find

831
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.300
especially curious, is that studies find that people who

832
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.219
live in poorer countries actually report having more meaning

833
00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:31.219
in life than people who live in wealthy societies.

834
00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:35.199
And, um, And, and this, I think especially curious

835
00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.750
because you get the opposite pattern when you look

836
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.080
at happiness in, in general, uh, people living in

837
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.110
wealthier societies are having more of their basic needs

838
00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.120
met and and they're having more positive experiences because

839
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.879
of that and tend to report on average that

840
00:43:49.879 --> 00:43:52.159
their lives are happier. But when it comes to

841
00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:55.370
the sense that how meaningful is life, uh, it's,

842
00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:58.840
yeah, curiously in, in poorer societies that people report

843
00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.665
more meaning. And I I think this sort of

844
00:44:00.665 --> 00:44:05.104
highlights the key role of, of our struggles in

845
00:44:05.104 --> 00:44:08.435
making life meaningful too. It's, uh, it's, I think

846
00:44:08.435 --> 00:44:10.064
one thing that gives our life, uh, a sense

847
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:12.665
of purpose, that, that there are things that I

848
00:44:12.665 --> 00:44:14.814
need to do that I, uh, that I need

849
00:44:14.814 --> 00:44:17.465
to work on that, that I'm focused on as,

850
00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:20.935
as for survival, perhaps. But it, but it, it

851
00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:23.104
makes my life meaningful that that I know why

852
00:44:23.104 --> 00:44:25.175
I'm doing things. I, I, I, I know what

853
00:44:25.175 --> 00:44:27.639
I, what I need to do. And in more

854
00:44:27.639 --> 00:44:32.050
affluent societies that often like our basic needs are

855
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.719
are are largely taken care of and so it

856
00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:37.780
can become sometimes a little more challenging to find,

857
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.000
well, well, why am I doing things? What is

858
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.800
it that I need to do? And it might

859
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.590
not be that obvious to someone who's who's living

860
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.679
a a a a rather comfortable, comfortable life. Um,

861
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.320
SO that's, I think another key difference in um

862
00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.179
the ways that, um, Uh, uh, societies differ in

863
00:44:57.179 --> 00:45:00.020
their level of, uh, sense of meaning. On the

864
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.489
other hand though, uh, research finds, I think, quite

865
00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:07.100
curiously that it's really the same kinds of predictors

866
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.340
of, uh, of a meaningful life across society. So

867
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:15.419
across societies, people's feelings of interpersonal relationships, close interpersonal

868
00:45:15.419 --> 00:45:19.459
relationships predict a more meaningful. Life, uh, across societies,

869
00:45:19.689 --> 00:45:22.659
it's people's kinds of, uh, uh, spiritual beliefs that

870
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.340
that predict, uh, uh, a more meaningful life. It's,

871
00:45:26.379 --> 00:45:30.179
it's across societies that, um, uh, that, that people's

872
00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:33.580
attachments to their work predict, uh, a, a more

873
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:38.110
meaningful life. Um. Same kinds of personality traits that

874
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.820
are associated with meaningful life, uh, seem to exist

875
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.550
uh across societies. Um, WE have a recent paper

876
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.550
where we're exploring the different kinds of purpose that

877
00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:51.870
that that people report as guiding their lives and

878
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.949
We found ultimately that there's about 16 different kinds

879
00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:58.360
of purpose that people regularly endorse as guiding their,

880
00:45:58.389 --> 00:46:01.669
their lives, and, and we found across 4 very

881
00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:04.629
different societies that is really the same kinds of

882
00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:08.899
purposes that that were uh especially associated with, uh,

883
00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:13.110
with, um, pursuing a meaningful life that there actually

884
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.219
wasn't that much difference across societies, that the same,

885
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:21.481
uh, purposes, especially with things regarding. Um, uh, uh,

886
00:46:21.572 --> 00:46:24.642
TRYING to feel that one's life matters, uh, um,

887
00:46:24.652 --> 00:46:27.852
doing things for others, feeling committed to, uh, religious

888
00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:30.491
beliefs, these all correlated with, with, uh, uh, a

889
00:46:30.491 --> 00:46:33.342
more meaningful life, and some other kinds of purposes,

890
00:46:33.412 --> 00:46:35.991
such as working to achieve status or or working

891
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:39.092
to achieve money, um, we're not so associated with

892
00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:41.652
meaningful life. So on the one hand, we can

893
00:46:41.652 --> 00:46:44.662
see some striking differences in the overall level of

894
00:46:44.662 --> 00:46:47.434
meaningful lives across societies. But many of the same

895
00:46:47.434 --> 00:46:50.513
basic predictors of meaningful life are quite similar across

896
00:46:50.513 --> 00:46:52.493
societies. And and I think the similarities sort of

897
00:46:52.493 --> 00:46:57.634
highlights, um, how much of the fact that maybe

898
00:46:57.634 --> 00:47:00.043
this, this need for meaning that we have is,

899
00:47:00.104 --> 00:47:04.093
is somewhat of an adaptation that we, we thrive

900
00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:06.634
when we feel that our lives are meaningful. It's

901
00:47:06.634 --> 00:47:10.033
associated with all of these good outcomes. Feeling that

902
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:12.063
your life is more meaningful is associated with better

903
00:47:12.063 --> 00:47:15.645
mental health. Associated with with with better physical health.

904
00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:19.615
Uh, IT'S, it's, uh, less associated with, you know,

905
00:47:19.815 --> 00:47:24.375
with, with, with suicidal feelings. Um, AND so that

906
00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:27.416
this seems that when people have a sense of

907
00:47:27.416 --> 00:47:29.335
meaning in their life, they seem to be faring

908
00:47:29.335 --> 00:47:32.256
better they're they're doing better in many ways. And

909
00:47:32.256 --> 00:47:34.615
so I, I, I wonder if we have evolved

910
00:47:34.615 --> 00:47:36.996
this as an adaptation that it's important to feel

911
00:47:36.996 --> 00:47:39.055
that life is meaningful because if we don't, we

912
00:47:39.055 --> 00:47:40.055
tend to be struggling.

913
00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:46.550
So what can we learn from existential psychology that

914
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.350
we can apply to our lives in the 21st

915
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:53.830
century that could help us build meaning in our

916
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:56.780
lives? I mean, are there particular strategies we can

917
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.580
resort to?

918
00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:00.909
Yeah, I, I, I think there are. I think,

919
00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:04.179
I think this has a lot of uh practical

920
00:48:04.179 --> 00:48:07.750
applications, and I think kind of explain this best

921
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.830
in sort of two different ways, uh, and what

922
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.239
this is what research has pointed to on, on

923
00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:16.590
the, the one sort of set of strategies I

924
00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.229
think we can learn from is that uh research

925
00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:21.919
points to some ways that uh we can get

926
00:48:21.919 --> 00:48:24.969
a temporary boost in meaning by by by some

927
00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:28.159
activities. And that's a curious thing about feelings of

928
00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:30.709
meaning in life is that they fluctuate. It's not

929
00:48:30.709 --> 00:48:34.439
that someone feels consistently, my life is meaningful, and

930
00:48:34.439 --> 00:48:36.560
they just keep going at this as an even

931
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.030
keel. No, our our feelings of meaning in life,

932
00:48:40.229 --> 00:48:43.290
uh, they fluctuate that they're higher at some points

933
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.479
and lower at some points, but there are some

934
00:48:45.479 --> 00:48:47.639
things that can, we can do that can make

935
00:48:47.639 --> 00:48:51.439
our lives uh uh feel more meaningful. And and

936
00:48:51.439 --> 00:48:54.979
so what research points to, for instance, is um

937
00:48:54.979 --> 00:48:58.520
nostalgic reflections tend to provide a a a temporary

938
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.250
boost in life. When we look back at our

939
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.739
life and we look back at, at, at, you

940
00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:06.709
know, these past chapters of our life story, um,

941
00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.760
it These help us to understand better about who

942
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.129
we are and, and, and the, the journey that

943
00:49:12.139 --> 00:49:15.659
that we've been on. And so, uh, studies find

944
00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:19.580
that, uh, when people reflect back nostalgically on their

945
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.020
life, they, uh, after that, they report that their

946
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:26.580
life feels more meaningful. Um. And especially not all

947
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.179
kinds of memories are equally nostalgic, but the kinds

948
00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:32.459
that are especially nostalgic are our social memories of

949
00:49:32.459 --> 00:49:34.379
the past, how we were connected with others, things

950
00:49:34.379 --> 00:49:36.379
that we were doing uh in in our past

951
00:49:36.379 --> 00:49:39.139
with others, and also sort of some kind of

952
00:49:39.139 --> 00:49:41.139
key events in our lives, you know, like when

953
00:49:41.139 --> 00:49:44.405
we. We, we graduated and got married or, or,

954
00:49:44.455 --> 00:49:46.885
or, you know, you threw away that last pack

955
00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:50.004
of cigarettes that, um, you know, that these kinds

956
00:49:50.004 --> 00:49:52.844
of moments here, uh, we tend to find especially

957
00:49:52.844 --> 00:49:56.445
nostalgic. So one strategy then is when you feel

958
00:49:56.445 --> 00:49:59.250
that life isn't so meaningful. You know, maybe uh

959
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.810
flip through an old uh photo album, maybe play

960
00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.169
some songs from the soundtrack of your youth, and,

961
00:50:05.209 --> 00:50:08.280
and that you'll, you, you'll be reminded about the

962
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.330
the life story that you you've told this far

963
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.199
and, and the journey that that you've been on.

964
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.969
So that's one thing that provides a temporary boost,

965
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.840
um. Uh, ANOTHER line of research from the tradition

966
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.919
of, uh, self-affirmation theory finds that you can feel

967
00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:27.739
a little more existentially grounded if you reflect upon,

968
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.870
uh, the values that are especially important to you.

969
00:50:31.199 --> 00:50:34.090
Um, uh, WHAT do you really care about? And,

970
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.840
and in these studies, what people are asking, they're

971
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.360
asked to write a paragraph about what really matters

972
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.760
to you, what, what are the values that that

973
00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:44.169
that you hold uh most strongly. And what this

974
00:50:44.169 --> 00:50:46.129
research finds is that after people have done this,

975
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.850
that they have this, this temporary boost where their

976
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.850
life feels more meaningful, that they feel more resilient

977
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.120
and and are better able to to to handle

978
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.239
the the the the challenges with life. So it

979
00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.129
it it provides us this nice uh uh temporary

980
00:51:00.129 --> 00:51:04.239
boost to meaning. Also, I think another sort of

981
00:51:04.239 --> 00:51:07.080
set of strategies to to make uh life feel

982
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.800
more meaningful is that one can engage in some

983
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.360
sort of something that, uh, creates a sense of

984
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.639
self-transcendence such that you feel that you are connected

985
00:51:16.639 --> 00:51:19.479
to something beyond yourself. And so this can be

986
00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:22.030
engaging in any kind of uh religious or or

987
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.360
or spiritual ritual. Um, IT can also um be

988
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.284
listed through something like a mindfulness. Meditation makes them

989
00:51:29.284 --> 00:51:32.375
sort of feel more connected to things. And also,

990
00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:35.205
quite simply, uh, research finds that, uh, going out

991
00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:38.415
in nature, uh, and, and sort of feeling connected

992
00:51:38.415 --> 00:51:41.784
to, to the natural world provides this, this temporary

993
00:51:41.784 --> 00:51:46.175
boost, uh, which increases our, our sense of well-being.

994
00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:48.104
So these are some things that we can do

995
00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:51.385
that provide a, uh, uh, a, a temporary boost.

996
00:51:51.504 --> 00:51:53.945
Um, I don't think they're gonna, you know, change

997
00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:56.800
your life forever, but, but. They're useful for those

998
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.189
times when you're you're feeling a little alienated, feeling

999
00:51:59.189 --> 00:52:02.530
a little disconnected from things. And on the other

1000
00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.330
hand, uh, what are the kind of more enduring

1001
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.770
things that that we can do, uh, uh, to

1002
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.929
provide a sense of meaning? Well, I think we

1003
00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:14.340
can understand. The the best strategies here and considering

1004
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.780
what are the the the key foundations of a

1005
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.780
meaningful life, and, and I think it's these domains

1006
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.699
of connections that that are uh especially important. So

1007
00:52:24.699 --> 00:52:29.570
our, our interpersonal relationships, so, uh, working towards building

1008
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.939
um these interpersonal relationships, spending more time with, with

1009
00:52:33.939 --> 00:52:38.280
our loved ones, uh, engaging activities, uh, with them,

1010
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.070
um. Uh, WE can feel more meaningful if we

1011
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.419
get more involved with our communities, uh, uh, doing

1012
00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:48.580
things for our communities, especially if it's an activity

1013
00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.100
that's aligned with, with your values. So, so say

1014
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.979
if you're, you're volunteering for a particular cause that's

1015
00:52:53.979 --> 00:52:56.659
important to you, say you care about improving the

1016
00:52:56.659 --> 00:53:00.110
environment, or care about some political cause and and

1017
00:53:00.129 --> 00:53:03.139
and sort of volunteering for those where you belong

1018
00:53:03.139 --> 00:53:05.580
to a community and doing something that that is

1019
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.354
something of great value to you. That I think

1020
00:53:08.354 --> 00:53:11.705
will lead to um a more meaningful lives and

1021
00:53:11.705 --> 00:53:15.324
um uh through our work, uh, if, if you

1022
00:53:15.324 --> 00:53:19.435
have work that you find uh uh especially meaningful

1023
00:53:19.435 --> 00:53:21.635
and rewarding, then engaging your time in that work

1024
00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:23.875
will make you uh feel that that life is

1025
00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:27.764
more meaningful and that, um, or, or any kind

1026
00:53:27.764 --> 00:53:30.435
of uh developing any kinds of these sort of

1027
00:53:30.435 --> 00:53:34.915
spiritual, uh, uh, connections, any, and, and here's where

1028
00:53:34.915 --> 00:53:37.360
I think, you know, It's it's great if, if

1029
00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.780
you belong to a religion, uh, I say uh,

1030
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.790
stick with that, and if, if you don't, if

1031
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.830
you're more secular person, I think, I think it's

1032
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:47.229
useful to just think of how, what kinds of

1033
00:53:47.229 --> 00:53:50.590
spirit traditions might you be open to. You're not

1034
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:51.989
going to be open to all of them, but

1035
00:53:51.989 --> 00:53:54.500
maybe there's some that that feel that, oh, that

1036
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.429
that's something that I might be able to incorporate

1037
00:53:56.429 --> 00:54:01.070
in my life. I think, uh, um, you likely

1038
00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:04.149
do stand to benefit by incorporating those. At least

1039
00:54:04.149 --> 00:54:07.629
this evidence I should emphasize is correlational evidence, um,

1040
00:54:07.639 --> 00:54:10.040
so that people who have these beliefs tend to

1041
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.510
feel their life is more meaningful, um, uh, uh,

1042
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.820
but I, I think it it it follows in

1043
00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.955
that. To the extent that you can develop these

1044
00:54:17.955 --> 00:54:20.955
sense of connections, your life might also um be

1045
00:54:20.955 --> 00:54:24.915
more meaningful. And finding uh things that give you

1046
00:54:24.915 --> 00:54:27.594
a sense of purpose to reflect upon what kinds

1047
00:54:27.594 --> 00:54:30.995
of things, uh, do you feel uh a sense

1048
00:54:30.995 --> 00:54:33.034
of purpose in your life, and to spend more

1049
00:54:33.034 --> 00:54:37.439
time doing those, um. Uh, ANOTHER key thing that's

1050
00:54:37.439 --> 00:54:40.169
been found to be associated with, uh, a meaningful

1051
00:54:40.169 --> 00:54:45.479
life is, uh, living a psychologically rich life, that

1052
00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:49.399
having a set of diverse, challenging experiences are things

1053
00:54:49.399 --> 00:54:53.040
that make life more meaningful. So I think this

1054
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.360
is this is important because, uh, lots of things

1055
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.080
make life more pleasant, um, so you might find

1056
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.310
it very content just to, um, Uh, you know,

1057
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.639
to sit, play some nice music, make jigsaw puzzles

1058
00:55:05.639 --> 00:55:08.030
all day. Um, THAT, that might make you feel

1059
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:11.189
quite pleasant, but that's probably not gonna make your

1060
00:55:11.189 --> 00:55:13.979
life feel quite as meaningful because it's not so

1061
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.189
psychologically rich. It's not so varied and challenging. And

1062
00:55:19.189 --> 00:55:21.590
so, yeah, what research finds is that People who

1063
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.469
lead more psychologically rich like put themselves in more

1064
00:55:24.469 --> 00:55:28.270
novel situations, more challenging situations, being open to new

1065
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:32.000
things, trying out, you know, new things, trying different

1066
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.360
restaurants, traveling the world, that these things make life

1067
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.129
feel more rich, and that makes life more meaningful.

1068
00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:43.090
And last, um, To, uh, think about the, the

1069
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.719
life narrative that that you have. And this is

1070
00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:50.090
the thing about stories that that we're not bound

1071
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.649
to any particular stories that that uh that we

1072
00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:55.929
have a story about what has happened in our

1073
00:55:55.929 --> 00:55:59.689
in our lives, but um there are different ways

1074
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.850
that we can narrate our lives, and some seem

1075
00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:06.219
to provide more meaning than others and um. You

1076
00:56:06.219 --> 00:56:08.820
know, a set, you've had a set set of

1077
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.540
experiences that have happened to you over the course

1078
00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.899
of your life. But how you tell your life

1079
00:56:13.899 --> 00:56:16.520
story, the, the, the, the way you connect those

1080
00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.979
past episodes and the kinds of episodes that you

1081
00:56:18.979 --> 00:56:21.500
reflect on is something that you have some control

1082
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.030
over. And one kind of life story that seems

1083
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.110
to be especially associated with feelings of um more

1084
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:29.500
meaning in life, uh, is a life story that

1085
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.739
that's, um, that Joseph Campbell's, uh, who's a mythologist,

1086
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:36.110
he identified some of his common to many myths

1087
00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:38.070
around the world, and he called it a hero's

1088
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.360
journey. And this is a feature of many of

1089
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.030
the best stories in the world. Um, AND, and,

1090
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.080
uh, it's, it's, it's sort of the basis of

1091
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.840
stories such as in Star Wars, or in Harry

1092
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.639
Potter or or Hunger Games or or Lord of

1093
00:56:51.639 --> 00:56:55.120
the Rings. And, and the features of this hero's

1094
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.439
journey story is the idea that, that, uh, we're

1095
00:56:58.439 --> 00:57:01.340
on a quest. That, that we, we face some

1096
00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:04.729
challenges along the way that we rely on some

1097
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.620
allies in our life to help us to surmount

1098
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.919
those challenges and that through the process, we, we

1099
00:57:10.919 --> 00:57:14.419
are transformed, that, that we grow and and and

1100
00:57:14.419 --> 00:57:17.820
change and, and can ultimately come to surmount some

1101
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.590
of these big challenges. And It might not feel

1102
00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:24.120
that your life has been a a a hero's

1103
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.149
journey, but, um, researchers found that if you reflect

1104
00:57:27.149 --> 00:57:29.520
on these sort of key elements of a hero's

1105
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.260
journey, like, what are the big challenges that you

1106
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.800
faced in your life? Who are the key allies

1107
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.719
that that you've uh relied on here? How have

1108
00:57:37.719 --> 00:57:41.000
you changed and and and grown? What kinds of

1109
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.679
things have you surmounted? And uh research has found

1110
00:57:44.679 --> 00:57:47.199
that when people focus on these elements and and

1111
00:57:47.239 --> 00:57:51.679
and try to just uh tell a narrative about

1112
00:57:51.679 --> 00:57:54.600
their life of how they've gone through this hero's

1113
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.370
journey, how they have, um, Relied on allies and

1114
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.909
facing these challenges, uh, and changed and and overcome

1115
00:58:01.909 --> 00:58:04.209
some of these challenges that they report feeling that

1116
00:58:04.209 --> 00:58:06.399
their life is more meaningful, that this seems to

1117
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:09.889
provide the basis for a more meaningful life. So

1118
00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:12.320
these are some, I think, sort of a practical,

1119
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:16.000
uh, um, challenges, I mean, uh, strategies that, that,

1120
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:19.810
uh I think uhential psychology um can offer for

1121
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:21.969
us to help us to lead more meaningful lives.

1122
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.719
Great, and I think those are great strategies to

1123
00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:29.159
end our interview on. So the book is again

1124
00:58:29.159 --> 00:58:32.879
start making sense how existential psychology can help us

1125
00:58:32.879 --> 00:58:36.199
build meaningful lives in absurd times. I'm leaving a

1126
00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:38.409
link to it in the description of the interview.

1127
00:58:38.639 --> 00:58:41.790
And Doctor Heine, just before we go apart from

1128
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:43.959
the book, would you like to tell people where

1129
00:58:43.959 --> 00:58:46.439
they can find you and your work on the

1130
00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:46.750
internet?

1131
00:58:47.989 --> 00:58:51.360
Sure, so, uh, well, I'm at the University of

1132
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:55.629
British Columbia. Um, uh, IF you Google me, uh,

1133
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.360
Steven Heine, you will find two people. One is

1134
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.219
a, uh, professor who studies Japanese religions from Florida,

1135
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.320
and myself who I've done a lot of research

1136
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.229
in, in Japanese culture, but who studies psychology, um,

1137
00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.635
and, uh. I have a few. I, this is

1138
00:59:11.635 --> 00:59:13.354
my 3rd book. I also have a book on

1139
00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:16.274
cultural psychology, and I have a book on how

1140
00:59:16.274 --> 00:59:20.514
people understand, uh, genetic determinism, and, and this book

1141
00:59:20.514 --> 00:59:24.054
on, uh, uh, start making sense. Um, SO I,

1142
00:59:24.074 --> 00:59:25.915
I'd say look at the internet and you can

1143
00:59:25.915 --> 00:59:27.475
find my web page at the University of British

1144
00:59:27.475 --> 00:59:28.155

1145
00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.570
