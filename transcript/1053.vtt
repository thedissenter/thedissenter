WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.099
Yeah, uh, I, I, I mean, today, uh, we,

2
00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:07.869
we have basically a sort of specific topic to

3
00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:11.350
talk about because both me and you, uh, me

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.350
first, and then you, we, uh, read or played

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.459
whatever you want to call it, Taos and Fata

6
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:22.709
Morgan and I was completely blown away. You're going

7
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:26.209
to tell me about your own experience, but Uh,

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.420
I, I mean, just to begin with, what are

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.520
your, I mean, what are your first thoughts on

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.909
it?

11
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.799
My first thoughts are I'm so happy that something

12
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.919
like this exists and that it reached a wide

13
00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:43.080
audience because, you know, current day conventional wisdom tells

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.750
us that everyone is interested in everything that's short.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.270
We have short, you know, young people have short

16
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.000
attention spans, men don't like to read, you know,

17
00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.549
all of these sort of, um, But modern day.

18
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.599
Tropes, for lack of a better word, that have

19
00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.529
that, you know, we hear all the time now

20
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.449
that we're in the age of social media and

21
00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.279
I have, I've I, I can't say that I've

22
00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:11.930
completely bought into them because I think long-form podcasts

23
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.489
and shows like this demonstrate that there are actually

24
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.569
lots of people who want to hear this kind

25
00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.800
of stuff and who want to have these deeper

26
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.120
conversations, these longer searching conversations, you know, the kind

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.650
that, that we have when we're 19 and we're

28
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.879
sitting in our, you know, apartments and And talking

29
00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.910
to friends and trying to make sense of the

30
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.980
world and our place in it, you know, and,

31
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.709
and we, that's a, that's a thrilling thing to

32
00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.290
continue to do throughout life, you know, and I

33
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.400
I was, first of all, I was blown away

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.959
by the story. I absolutely loved it. I, I,

35
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.800
it's so up my alley. It's kind of, it's,

36
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.720
it, you know, in, in some ways, it's very

37
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.440
similar to the kinds of things I like to

38
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.470
write and the kinds of things that inhabit my

39
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.910
own sort of fantasies anyway. So I, I was

40
00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:03.870
definitely predisposed to like it. Um, BUT I loved

41
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.010
the how Complex it was. I mean, it, it

42
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.130
was hard to follow, and yet it was so

43
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.009
engaging, and it never made me want to give

44
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.330
up and, and let go. And I was also

45
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.929
just amazed looking through, cause, you know, I watched

46
00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.610
it through, through, um, I don't have a gaming

47
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.350
computer. I don't have any of that stuff. I'm

48
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.009
very old school, you know. So I watched it

49
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.330
through YouTube, um, the way you, you know, you

50
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
recommended. And it was, it was a little difficult

51
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.539
for me at first because, you know, the whole

52
00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:37.919
YouTube style is that whoever's, you know, channel it

53
00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.119
is, is talking while they're taking you through the

54
00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.800
house of Fata Marana. And at first I thought,

55
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.080
oh my God, I don't think I'm gonna be

56
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.679
able to stand this. I can't, this guy will

57
00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.559
not shut up. I understand why he does it

58
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.160
this way. I understand that this is the way

59
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.720
it's supposed to be. But the story was so

60
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.160
good that I, after a while, I just tuned.

61
00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:56.964
That out. You know what I mean? And I

62
00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:58.485
don't even know if I was tuning it out

63
00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.085
as much as I just, maybe it just sort

64
00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.764
of all came together and I was, um, I

65
00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:06.445
was drawn into the actual story. And that in

66
00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:09.485
and of itself, given the format and my like

67
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:13.684
hostility to that format, is saying a lot about

68
00:03:13.684 --> 00:03:16.115
the story. And, you know, and then I start,

69
00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:20.309
um, YouTube channels that were focused on House of

70
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.130
Fata Morgan and consistently it was like the greatest

71
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.089
story ever told. Oh my God, I can't believe

72
00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.970
how much I love this. And I was also

73
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.009
heartened that most of these channels were men. Yeah.

74
00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.580
I've been told don't care about stories. Which I've

75
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.160
never believed, I've never believed, that's not been my

76
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.000
experience, but that's, you know, the conventional wisdom, which

77
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.039
I don't think it's wise. You know, it's just

78
00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.399
conventional, right? And I, I, so I was, I

79
00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:57.570
was just blown away by it. I Yeah It

80
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.169
never served me what I expected, and yet at

81
00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.050
the end, it gave me everything I wanted.

82
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.809
Yeah. And, and we're certainly, we certainly have to

83
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.970
talk about that last scene because it's just the

84
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.289
best thing ever. But, but, but yeah, before we

85
00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.959
get into that, you know, something that I really,

86
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.690
really loved about that story was that it starts

87
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.730
one way and you really don't know where you

88
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.130
are. You have no idea at all where it's

89
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.079
going. But then, Uh, as you progress, what comes

90
00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:37.480
later makes what comes before even better, right? Did,

91
00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:39.309
did you also have that feeling?

92
00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:42.200
Uh, ABSOLUTELY, and it, it puts it all into

93
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.859
perspective and even when um You know, you, you,

94
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.649
I mean, I, I, I don't think that, I

95
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.529
was gonna say when your attention starts to lag,

96
00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:53.619
but mine really didn't. It's just that when you're

97
00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:55.410
maybe not sure where this is headed, let's put

98
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.769
it that way. And you're, you know, when, when

99
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:00.049
I was confused and I thought, well, wait a

100
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:03.519
minute, I'm, I'm not understanding what's happening here. Um,

101
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.079
EVENTUALLY, Everything will be illuminated, you know, and, and

102
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.299
it's, it starts to make sense and And on

103
00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.230
top of that, when it does start to make

104
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.380
sense, it makes beautiful sense, you know, and it's,

105
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.619
and you, you feel simultaneously so impressed by the

106
00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:29.559
storyteller and so clever yourself for having, you know.

107
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.660
STUCK with it and got into it. And I

108
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.170
think that that is a really great relationship between

109
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.160
a story and a and a And a reader,

110
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.549
a storyteller and a story absorber, I guess, you

111
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:46.779
know, um. And you can pull that off, you

112
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.660
know what I mean? Few stories can make you

113
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.299
feel that way. That's, that's a, that is a

114
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.809
a huge magic trick.

115
00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.049
Yeah, no, because there are great stories that are

116
00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:58.609
like, you start the story and you go through

117
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:01.600
it and it's all great from beginning to end.

118
00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:06.170
But this one, it's like, Uh, everything is great,

119
00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:10.220
but as you progress, what came before gets even

120
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.059
greater.

121
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.140
So. Yeah, I know, and

122
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.140
that's, that's really hard to pull off, really, really

123
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.420
hard. That's very, very hard to pull off. Um,

124
00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:21.619
AND you can see it in, in so many

125
00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.339
series that you might read or trilogies where they

126
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.820
start out so strong and, you know, you can't

127
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.200
wait to see how the author is going to

128
00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:33.660
end it and then the author ends it and

129
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.589
you think, Really? That's what I've been waiting for.

130
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.720
And you, you almost kind of want to rewrite

131
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.399
your own ending or you just want to go

132
00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:47.670
back and enjoy the first. You know, installments or

133
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.459
whatever it is, you know, the first couple of

134
00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.010
books and pretend like the last book didn't happen.

135
00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:55.760
You know what I mean? I mean, we've talked

136
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.510
about how Game of Thrones disappointed us probably 2

137
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.829
or 3 times now on these podcasts, but that

138
00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.600
was, you know, that's, that's such a great example

139
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.269
of, of a story that's so great, um, that

140
00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.579
just at least that, you know, the television version

141
00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:14.880
obviously, but the television version became such a, a,

142
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.779
a disappointment. It felt like a bait and switch,

143
00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:19.549
you know what I mean? THAT they served us

144
00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:22.709
one thing and then they, you know, it started

145
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:26.390
off with lobster thermidor or whatever, and then they

146
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.589
switched it to, um, you know, boxed mac and

147
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:30.779
cheese or something.

148
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.940
Yeah. No, I, I mean, of the house of

149
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.779
Fata Morgan, I have just two small criticisms. I

150
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:39.820
mean, I still give it the 10 out of

151
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.779
10, of course. But anyway, uh, the, uh, two

152
00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:47.660
small criticisms, the first one, I, I mean, the

153
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.700
beginning of it, the first door, uh, before the

154
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.500
first big twist. Yeah, it seems a bit misleading.

155
00:07:56.619 --> 00:07:59.739
It seems one kind of story that you're going

156
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:04.260
to experience there. And then it completely shifts and,

157
00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:06.500
and it can be a little bit at the

158
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.299
beginning you're seeing the story between Mel and Ellie

159
00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:12.515
and the white. GIRL. And, uh, and it seems

160
00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:15.644
a little bit childish and you're like, what the

161
00:08:15.644 --> 00:08:17.464
heck is this? What the story is going to

162
00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:20.035
be like? I mean, is this a story for

163
00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:23.804
children or, and then, and then it shifts completely,

164
00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:28.114
but up till that point, uh, it's misleading.

165
00:08:28.804 --> 00:08:31.244
It is misleading. And you know what's, what, what

166
00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:35.008
I think. WAS in the author's head and obviously

167
00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:37.888
this is just speculation, right? But I think what

168
00:08:37.888 --> 00:08:42.008
the author was trying to do was establish with

169
00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:45.578
the audience or the reader, however, one is absorb,

170
00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:48.908
you know, is taking in the story, um, was

171
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:54.200
Establish a baseline naivete, childlike naivete, and then take

172
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.590
them through that loss of innocence. So I, I,

173
00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:00.909
I suspect, at least that that was very much

174
00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:03.979
on purpose. But at the same time, I felt

175
00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:05.349
the same way you did. I felt like it

176
00:09:05.349 --> 00:09:08.309
was a complete bait and switch, you know, that,

177
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.659
you know, that. I, I was And I was

178
00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:15.299
enjoying the story that was being laid out. I

179
00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:16.500
was there it was a little, you know, like

180
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.580
you said, it, it seemed a little childish, but

181
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.250
that's OK because I think that some um I,

182
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.599
I think that, you know, like I love the

183
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:26.260
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, you know what

184
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.340
I mean? And that some sort of childish cartoony

185
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.280
sort of things can be really wonderful. So I

186
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.690
was absolutely open to it, but then it took

187
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.289
me in a completely different direction.

188
00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:40.210
Yeah. And then the other one, the other criticism

189
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.330
is door number 2, I mean, the story of

190
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.419
the bestia, Yuki Mas and Pauline and, and those

191
00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:52.619
people. I think it's dragged on a little bit

192
00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:55.919
too long. Not, not, not extremely long, but, uh,

193
00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.270
a little bit too long at a certain. Point,

194
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.830
I was already like, oh, come on, this is

195
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.909
already a bit, a bit too much. Yeah, and

196
00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.770
that's actually a common criticism that some people have

197
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.909
because from door number 3, or at least door

198
00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:13.869
number 4 onward, most people say, oh, no, this

199
00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:16.710
is definitely a 10 out of 10, and 11

200
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.190
out of 10, whatever. But Uh, that, that door,

201
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.549
I mean, particularly when the white-haired girl arrives at

202
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:27.000
the mansion and their story, I mean, perhaps it's

203
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.719
dragged a little bit too long there. I don't

204
00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:29.950
know.

205
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.979
Yeah, I think, I, I think you're right, and

206
00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:36.669
it was funny cause when that, um, when that

207
00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:40.150
door, you know, opened for lack of a better

208
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.429
word, right? I thought, oh, I see where this

209
00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:46.590
is going. They're now going for Beauty and the

210
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.869
Beast sort of story and perhaps each story is

211
00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:53.109
going to take on a new mythology that is

212
00:10:53.109 --> 00:10:57.250
kind of in our consciousness. But again, that's not

213
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.380
really what they did. I mean, yes, of course,

214
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.919
there were, there was nothing. There was no entirely

215
00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:06.239
new ground that was broken, right? These are, it's

216
00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:09.599
such a mythological story, and, and these stories have

217
00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:13.510
been, you know, told for millennia. But it was

218
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.650
not that way. Only door number 2 kind of

219
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.159
had that going on. And then it, it again

220
00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:26.090
took a completely different direction, but without, um, Kind

221
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.119
of destroying your emotional connection to the characters in

222
00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:33.530
the world. And that's another really incredible magic trick

223
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.849
to pull off as a storyteller. You know, and

224
00:11:36.849 --> 00:11:43.010
I, I was so impressed with and Um, And

225
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.250
want to learn from, you know, because that's you

226
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.330
hope to inspire the kind of emotions that Haafana

227
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:57.580
Morgana. Inspires and um You know, and the people

228
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.229
who read your stories or watch your stories depending

229
00:12:01.229 --> 00:12:02.219
on what they're the,

230
00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:07.520
by the way, when it comes to the twists

231
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.609
that we get across the different doors, was there

232
00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:14.719
any one of them that you sort of saw

233
00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:19.619
coming, or? Because there was one that I, I,

234
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.190
I saw coming. I, I got it right, but

235
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.059
it was just

236
00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:25.679
the one I'm trying to remember, um, because I,

237
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.150
I, I, I watched it actually, you know, when

238
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.669
you and I talked about it first and then

239
00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:32.190
I, I refreshed myself because I, I want to

240
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.489
remember. Because I couldn't remember and I'm looking over

241
00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:38.559
my notes from ages ago. Um.

242
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.109
I mean, door number 1 was the twist, door

243
00:12:45.109 --> 00:12:49.219
number 1 was the twist with the, the siblings.

244
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.559
Door number 2 was the twist that Yuki Masa

245
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:56.960
basically, basically killed Pauline, which appeared as another best

246
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.200
year. Uh, AND, and that the best year was

247
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.549
Yuki Maso, of course. Door number 3 was basically

248
00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:08.719
the twist that Maria was plotting against the white-haired

249
00:13:08.719 --> 00:13:09.200
girl and

250
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.239
the right, yeah, um. That I guess that that

251
00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:18.640
didn't surprise me particularly. I was sort of expecting

252
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.059
a door number 3.

253
00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:24.440
Yeah, yeah, that didn't me. I, I expected that.

254
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.820
I thought that was a common trope. What I

255
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.119
didn't expect was that Michelle or Michel, I don't

256
00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:30.380
know how it's,

257
00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:34.640
it's it's Michel because it's a French name. So

258
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:34.760
right,

259
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.679
that's right, that's kind of what I thought, but

260
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:39.000
I, I always pronounce it the Czech the way

261
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.200
a Czech would, which is Michel was wrong, but

262
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.320
um. I did not expect Him to not have

263
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.809
a penis, that's for sure. That was a wild

264
00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:51.840
twist for me, that they would come up with

265
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.929
that, you know, as a, as a romantic twist

266
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.239
and actually make it work because usually that's, that's

267
00:13:58.239 --> 00:14:03.659
such a weirdly like Embarrassing, obviously desexualizing, you know,

268
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.700
I mean, literally, but yet they still made the

269
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.900
romance work despite that, I thought it was pretty

270
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.510
incredible.

271
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.419
Yeah. By the way, uh, you, did you know

272
00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:17.760
that the story, I mean, the author, Keika Hanada

273
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.030
started writing that story in 2009. And so inserted

274
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.820
that bit, I mean, with an intersex person in

275
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.729
the story and made it really meaningful. I mean,

276
00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:31.520
what do you think about that? Because he basically

277
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.119
He was using something that in the current political

278
00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:41.119
and cultural environment would be very controversial and they

279
00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:44.960
basically like, I don't know, was 15 years ahead

280
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.500
of his time or

281
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.359
whatever. You know, I, I took it, usually, I

282
00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:52.559
feel like that's, um, something like that is inserted.

283
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.080
INORGANICALLY and for political reasons, and you can feel

284
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.559
that, and I don't like to feel that. Like,

285
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.320
I, I will take anything in a story. Um,

286
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:05.580
WHATEVER slant it has, as long as it feels

287
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.159
organic to the story, and I, I, you know,

288
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.380
first, this was such a, a, a A a

289
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:20.710
symbolic story in. In every way. So when, uh,

290
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.729
in using that that didn't bother me at all.

291
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.309
You know, I thought it was really interesting, and

292
00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:26.909
I thought he actually did a, a very good

293
00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:30.989
job at making it a, a believable part of

294
00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:36.080
the story and, and making the character extremely empathetic.

295
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:42.130
Um And dealing with very real pain and emotions

296
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.049
that would come with something like that with that

297
00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:46.690
kind of condition too instead of making it just

298
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.049
a political trope that that is about 1 inch

299
00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.330
deep rather than the mile deep that it needs

300
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.309
to be. Does that make sense?

301
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.840
Yeah, sure,

302
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.609
sure, yeah, I know I'm and I thought in

303
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.159
in his use of it, I thought it was

304
00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:08.049
a really, really interesting device. Instead of an insertion.

305
00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:10.690
Do you know what I mean? That, that feels

306
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.590
conscious, like, oh, here we have a non-binary character,

307
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.599
which there's nothing wrong with having a non-binary character.

308
00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:18.049
It's like, but please don't make it feel like

309
00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:21.059
you're trying to, trying to have a non-binary character.

310
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.169
Make it, make it happen, you know? Give us

311
00:16:24.169 --> 00:16:29.010
real emotions and real relationships, and real struggles, and

312
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.369
real triumphs with this character and not just, um,

313
00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:37.169
Yeah. And it's not, it's not political at all.

314
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.609
Or at least it doesn't feel political at all.

315
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.440
I, I, I mean, there, there's just that small

316
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.450
thing which for, for the purposes of the story,

317
00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:49.969
it's also great where since he's placing like an

318
00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:53.409
intersex character in the Middle Ages, there's lots of

319
00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:56.530
social persecution. And uh, in the end, he ends

320
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.809
up, uh, Uh, murdered, executed because of that and

321
00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:04.569
these, uh, and is treated like a demon, a

322
00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.030
demon's child, a witch, something like that. So, the,

323
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.050
the, if there's anything that is slightly political about

324
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.239
it, it would be that, but it makes perfect

325
00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:17.689
sense in the context of the story. So

326
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:19.890
I, that's exactly what I thought. I thought that

327
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:25.560
it was. Mm Brilliant, you know, I thought it

328
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.989
was really, really well done.

329
00:17:28.479 --> 00:17:30.979
Oh my God, but, but you know something that,

330
00:17:31.338 --> 00:17:36.298
uh, when you went through the story of the

331
00:17:36.298 --> 00:17:41.430
maid. And basically, Gisele going through those hundreds of

332
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.500
years, those centuries waiting for Michelle to come back.

333
00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.540
I mean, didn't you feel, or sort of feel

334
00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:52.829
the, the same pain that she felt and, and

335
00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:55.109
the boredom and all of them. I think that,

336
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.819
that bit was really well made because, of course,

337
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.385
you're not. Not the character, it's herself. You're, you're

338
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:06.114
not yourself going through hundreds of years waiting for

339
00:18:06.114 --> 00:18:09.954
your loved one to appear again, to, uh, get

340
00:18:09.954 --> 00:18:15.074
reconstructed or whatever. But, uh, you, you feel a

341
00:18:15.074 --> 00:18:16.824
little bit determined,

342
00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:25.369
right? Absolutely. And that's a That was So, I,

343
00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:27.640
I mean, that was just so beautifully done, and

344
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.449
I don't know. It the the prose is actually

345
00:18:32.449 --> 00:18:35.050
very simple in this, and that's what's so incredible

346
00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.650
about it, you know, it's not. Overly written, it's

347
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.770
not. Feeling floral, you know, the way sometimes stories

348
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.729
like this, these sort of epic stories can be

349
00:18:45.729 --> 00:18:48.329
either overwritten the way, you know, with just too

350
00:18:48.329 --> 00:18:51.449
much detail, for instance, that you can get that

351
00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:54.589
in epic fantasy where the, it's just, you know,

352
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.170
drawn too heavily. It's, it's every little detail is,

353
00:18:58.229 --> 00:19:02.430
is, is, um, I filled in, which can be

354
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.569
really off-putting because it doesn't allow you to sort

355
00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:07.270
of bring your own imagination into it, or it

356
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.670
can just be too floral and, and that can

357
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.109
be off-putting because you can almost like smell the

358
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:17.660
perfume coming off the the words. But um but

359
00:19:17.869 --> 00:19:23.150
the, the author was really able to strike. That

360
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.199
That balance of, of just being really descriptive in

361
00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:31.349
his language, but simple enough that you feel so

362
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.400
drawn in. It's, and, and you're so right. All

363
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.160
those years of waiting, you feel like you are

364
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.319
waiting with the character and you're in pain with

365
00:19:41.319 --> 00:19:43.680
the character. And you, you know, you can actually

366
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.760
feel, feel it physically in your body hurting, you

367
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.589
know, or, and, or you can feel that sense

368
00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:50.959
of longing that you feel yourself when you're going

369
00:19:50.959 --> 00:19:53.750
through something. That is difficult and you're waiting, you

370
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.869
know, you're in, you know, what Doctor Seuss calls

371
00:19:55.869 --> 00:20:01.760
the waiting place, right? Um, And I thought that

372
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.329
was just, I thought it was incredible and it,

373
00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:05.560
you know, I don't want to jump to the

374
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.239
end, but it's it's it's all of that waiting

375
00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:12.920
that. That he was able to take you through.

376
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.969
And also, I mean, I thought he, he took

377
00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:19.050
you through pain in a very, you know, obviously

378
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.050
in a very graphic way, but also in a

379
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.439
very Real way and you were, you found yourself

380
00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:28.239
as a, as a reader for lack of a

381
00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:30.969
better word, um, you found yourself as as a

382
00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:36.719
as a reader. Experiencing the unimaginable and yet somehow

383
00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:41.609
able to shoulder it. Yeah. And that's what I

384
00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:44.489
thought was so incredible. And I think that that's

385
00:20:44.489 --> 00:20:49.329
really what resonates. I suspect what resonates. With so

386
00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:52.199
many people and watching this and what resonates with

387
00:20:52.329 --> 00:20:59.150
with male readers, you know, because that Um, There

388
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.750
was a kind of an equal amount of, of

389
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.709
pain and strife with the, with the male and

390
00:21:03.709 --> 00:21:05.989
the female characters. It wasn't just like one woman

391
00:21:05.989 --> 00:21:08.069
pining for something and you, and, but you don't

392
00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:09.790
really know what the guy is feeling, you know,

393
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.270
cause there's so much now written from, even if

394
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.290
it's, if the, if the main character is a

395
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.630
guy, it's written for women because 80% of the

396
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.839
reassure women. So it's very much from a woman's

397
00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.270
point of view. And yet I felt like this,

398
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.670
this really brought everybody in and, and showed that

399
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.880
sort of the The human pain that, that we

400
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.569
feel and what I also loved, loved, loved about

401
00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:38.609
it was um That even the antagonists and the

402
00:21:38.609 --> 00:21:43.160
characters who do really terrible things, they're not excussed,

403
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.400
and it's not even like, oh, but here's why

404
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.650
they did those terrible things, so it's OK, but

405
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.329
it's just, here's their story. Here's why they did

406
00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:55.810
those terrible things. You know, with Um, so there

407
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.930
was judgment for their actions, but not judgment for

408
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.229
them as human beings and their experience, which Again,

409
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.150
I thought was was just brilliant because it makes,

410
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.719
it doesn't make them cartoon characters, for instance, because

411
00:22:09.949 --> 00:22:14.300
cartoon villains are boring as hell and you don't,

412
00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:21.160
you don't just wanna. YOU know. Except maybe in

413
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.959
a slasher movie or something and like Halloween, you

414
00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:27.479
know, you don't just want this purely evil uh

415
00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:30.390
character that has nothing else going on, you know,

416
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.359
other than, well, this is an evil character, you

417
00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:38.359
know, um. And I, I, I thought the author

418
00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:45.719
did just a brilliant, uh, job of Showing us.

419
00:22:47.349 --> 00:22:48.819
How we become villains.

420
00:22:50.229 --> 00:22:52.670
Yeah. And uh, and when it comes to the

421
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.829
antagonists, I guess that also toward the end of

422
00:22:55.829 --> 00:23:00.069
the final door when Michelle sort of goes back

423
00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:05.150
in time to try to get their backstory and

424
00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.469
show it to Morgan for them, for her, yeah,

425
00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:13.329
and, yeah, yeah, when, when they did that. I

426
00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:16.609
mean, I guess that the message there and even

427
00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:19.449
perhaps Yuki Masa is the most brutal of all

428
00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:23.400
of them, and Jacopo is also very vicious. But,

429
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:26.609
uh, yeah, but, but I guess that the message

430
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:30.050
there was that for all of them, even with

431
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.979
all the bad things they did, they were never

432
00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.729
completely unredeemable.

433
00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:40.750
Right. No, no, and um I think that a

434
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.989
lot of modern stories have ignored the redemption arc.

435
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.170
Of a character, um. Because there has been, at

436
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.640
least in the last, I don't know, maybe. Last

437
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:03.439
couple of decades, I think that they're um There

438
00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:06.910
has been just a, a lack of grace towards

439
00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:10.050
Our villains, you know what I mean? But that,

440
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.810
that I think has also, there's been a lack

441
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.560
of grace in our culture, you know, with, with,

442
00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:18.650
once social media became so big and with people

443
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.689
digging up, you know, what somebody said on social

444
00:24:20.689 --> 00:24:22.849
media 10 years ago, for heaven's sake, or when

445
00:24:22.849 --> 00:24:24.770
they were when they were a kid and trying

446
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.849
to use that to, to destroy their future. You

447
00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:29.290
know what I mean? There's been a real lack

448
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.760
of grace and it was so refreshing to, um,

449
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:39.010
get absorb absorbed in a story that, um, That

450
00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.290
was abundant with race, and yet was also abundant

451
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.300
with horror. You know, and with, with tragedy and

452
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.109
beauty and villainy, you know.

453
00:24:51.459 --> 00:24:55.180
Yeah. And, and another thing, you know, something that

454
00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.579
the story reminded me of was, uh, the Dante's

455
00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:06.040
Divine Comedy. Because, you know, there's the doors, and

456
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.569
in each door, if you look closely, you have

457
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.859
one or several different kinds of scenes. And then,

458
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:16.209
yeah, and then I guess that you can also

459
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:19.609
interpret, interpret it as if you look at the

460
00:25:19.609 --> 00:25:24.369
story of Michelle and Gisele particularly, is, it's like

461
00:25:24.369 --> 00:25:29.900
you start in hell and then Uh, as Michelle

462
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.540
walks up the stairs in the, in the uh

463
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.650
in the watchtower, uh, to, uh, learn the story

464
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.939
of Morgan, uh, it's sort of like purgatory. And

465
00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:46.130
then there's also the version of Purgatory for Giselle,

466
00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:49.130
and she has to wait hundreds of years for

467
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.329
Michelle to come back. And then toward the end,

468
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.890
it's like, Arriving in paradise or something like that.

469
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.650
So, and then, and then it's like, and then

470
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.969
it's like door number 1. At least this is

471
00:26:01.969 --> 00:26:04.400
the way I understood it. Door number 1, it's,

472
00:26:04.449 --> 00:26:07.589
uh, the main scene there, I guess, is cowardice,

473
00:26:07.729 --> 00:26:11.310
and then door number 2 is wrath. Door number

474
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:16.020
3, it's like pride and greed. Uh, AND then,

475
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.739
and then, uh, and, and then, of course, it,

476
00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:23.300
it's not that door number 4567, as it deals

477
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.459
with another particular kind of scene specifically, but I

478
00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:32.420
guess that maybe more again, uh, also as, uh,

479
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.839
her particular scene is, I, I'm not sure if

480
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.989
There's a specific word for it, but it's basically

481
00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:42.680
the sin of not being able to forgive who

482
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.920
wronged you, something like that. I'm not sure if

483
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.329
there's a word for that.

484
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.959
Yeah, I feel like there is a word, and

485
00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:51.920
I can't think of the specific word too because

486
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.540
she was so wronged, you know, it's not. It

487
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.219
it was so unequivocal what happened to her.

488
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.869
Oh my God, she, she has the most brutal

489
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:02.599
backstory, my God.

490
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:07.930
Oh my God, you know, and And then she

491
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.920
gets her arm chopped off on top of it

492
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.599
and is chained, you know, in in a prison,

493
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:20.969
and it's her story is so Unbearably tragic. Yeah.

494
00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:27.319
Um, THAT It's hard to imagine. It's actually a

495
00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:30.439
testament to the goodness of her soul that she

496
00:27:30.439 --> 00:27:33.680
split into two, that her personality split into two,

497
00:27:33.689 --> 00:27:37.430
and she became the white-haired girl, you know? And,

498
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.089
and that was, you know, the embodiment of the

499
00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:42.479
goodness that was left in her. And then, you

500
00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:46.829
know, the, the, the witch, the Morganic character was

501
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.410
that. You know, incredibly hurt part of her who

502
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.739
could not let go, and became a force of

503
00:27:56.739 --> 00:28:00.250
destruction instead of a force of grace and good,

504
00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:04.300
the way the white-haired girl, you know, was, was

505
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:12.310
that. And, um, Oh. God, that's just so incredible,

506
00:28:12.439 --> 00:28:13.109
you know.

507
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.630
But, but can you imagine someone in real life

508
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.589
going through what Morganda went through? I mean, like.

509
00:28:27.109 --> 00:28:28.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

510
00:28:28.109 --> 00:28:28.699
go ahead, go ahead.

511
00:28:28.989 --> 00:28:31.709
I thought what Giselle went through was bad. Yeah,

512
00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:34.489
you know what I mean, I thought, oh my

513
00:28:34.489 --> 00:28:36.689
God, I can't believe she, you know, she survived

514
00:28:36.689 --> 00:28:40.520
that, and then what Michelle went through was so

515
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:48.709
horrible and, and, and cruel and Uh, and then,

516
00:28:49.099 --> 00:28:51.530
you know, you, you get to the antagonist story.

517
00:28:52.849 --> 00:29:01.040
Yeah. And you're given this incredibly Horrific, human, and

518
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.260
strangely hopeful. Story for this person. You know, there

519
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.819
was something so hopeful again, with the redemption arc.

520
00:29:09.939 --> 00:29:11.969
I mean, one of the reasons why redemption arcs

521
00:29:11.969 --> 00:29:18.339
are so beautiful is because they're hopeful. And we

522
00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:24.069
always want to believe that we can Reach someone.

523
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.339
Who seems that, you know, after who has been

524
00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:33.670
consumed by their demons. Yeah. And that we can

525
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.810
somehow cast out those demons, you know.

526
00:29:36.849 --> 00:29:40.560
Yeah. And also toward the end, when Morgan, uh,

527
00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:48.130
sort of freeze, uh, nail or malls, sorry, Mel

528
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.520
Yuki Mas and Jacopo from the mansion. Uh, AND

529
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.849
she doesn't actually completely forgive them. It's a very

530
00:29:56.849 --> 00:30:00.170
realistic way of dealing with it because, uh, I

531
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.170
mean, of course, it would be ideal if she

532
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.410
had just completely, for, for, uh, she had just

533
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.530
completely forgive them, but, uh, It, it, uh, but

534
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.420
it sounds more realistic that way. I mean, because

535
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.810
she had been so, so hurt by them that,

536
00:30:19.969 --> 00:30:22.579
uh, I mean, she was already doing something good.

537
00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:28.290
She was basically Uh, again, not forgiving them, but

538
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:32.359
sort of finally being able to move on beyond

539
00:30:32.689 --> 00:30:37.290
torturing them or torturing them forever and taking delight

540
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:41.010
in that. But, uh, it's, it sounded, I, I

541
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.170
don't know, it sounded very realistic to, to when

542
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.119
things that way.

543
00:30:45.569 --> 00:30:47.449
I totally agree. I felt like she got to

544
00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:49.689
a place where she could forgive but not forget.

545
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.989
You know what I mean? Forgive. I mean maybe

546
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:56.670
forgive is even too strong, but where she wasn't,

547
00:30:57.229 --> 00:30:59.630
she was done punishing, like you said. She was

548
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.750
done hating, she was letting go of that. She's

549
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.270
letting go of them too, which I think if

550
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.550
there had been more of a, a, a forgiveness

551
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.829
narrative in the, in the, like the, you know,

552
00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.630
the prodigal son kind of way where you welcome

553
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.630
this person back into your life and you kill

554
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.349
the fatted calf. But that's That was not that

555
00:31:22.349 --> 00:31:25.310
story, and I'm glad it wasn't that story too.

556
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.510
I think that it, it needed to be exactly

557
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.229
what it was.

558
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:32.109
But you know, something that I think is one

559
00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:37.819
of the biggest themes across the entire story is.

560
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:45.060
Uh, THE importance of honest communication because I mean.

561
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:48.530
If you look across the several different stories and

562
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.869
it's perhaps even more dramatic in the door, uh,

563
00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.839
I mean, the complete miscommunication or even lack of

564
00:31:56.839 --> 00:32:01.209
communication between the white-haired girl and the Jacopo, and

565
00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:04.969
that's what ruins their relationship. It's not even Maria.

566
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.630
Maria, it's just contributing a little bit to that,

567
00:32:10.089 --> 00:32:14.224
uh, but, uh, and then, uh. To contrast that

568
00:32:14.224 --> 00:32:20.984
with when finally, Giselle and Michelle reunite after that

569
00:32:20.984 --> 00:32:27.185
dramatic night where Michelle, uh, almost, uh, stabs her

570
00:32:27.185 --> 00:32:30.064
with a knife, and she runs away, and then

571
00:32:30.064 --> 00:32:34.224
she comes back and they, and they basically lay

572
00:32:34.224 --> 00:32:38.185
out everything about their, about their lives, what happened

573
00:32:38.185 --> 00:32:41.219
to them. I mean, apart from the, Uh, the

574
00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:45.060
back, uh, some of the story of Michelle, which

575
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.420
is saved for later and the fact that he's

576
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.660
intersects and stuff like that. But yeah, most of

577
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.180
what's important, they lay out, and then, I mean,

578
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:58.180
it works for them, but for the others, it

579
00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.369
doesn't work and it's because they, they are unable

580
00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:07.890
to honestly communicate to other people what they are,

581
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.000
how they feel, and stuff like that. Right.

582
00:33:12.189 --> 00:33:13.550
Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:17.180
So for, for me, at least in part, this

584
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.260
is basically a tragedy of miscommunication or lack of

585
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.339
communication, if you want to put it that way.

586
00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:27.959
Yeah, I mean what the, what all the doors

587
00:33:27.959 --> 00:33:30.400
did, you know, the different doors, the different chapters,

588
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:37.219
however, There was I mean, yeah, I think you're

589
00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:38.819
right. I think that that's kind of the big

590
00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:43.089
takeaway in terms of like interpersonal relationships is communication,

591
00:33:43.219 --> 00:33:46.540
but I, I feel like in the best sort

592
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.380
of style of an epic story of a mythology

593
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.530
is that it, it took you through human foibles.

594
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.790
Um, AND the best and the worst, and, and

595
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.560
helped us kind of work through our own. Emotions

596
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.150
and our own um mistakes. Yeah. In in this

597
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:13.159
highly dramaticized form, right? Where, where the mistakes that

598
00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:17.179
these characters made had such dire consequences, you know,

599
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.739
I mean, in our own lives, usually the mistakes

600
00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.330
we make are consequences are not quite so dire.

601
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.780
You know, they're, they're, they're less so, but, but

602
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.510
they're definitely Related to or you know, reflected in

603
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.188
this somehow that they're, they're smaller versions of that

604
00:34:35.188 --> 00:34:37.830
perhaps, but it kind of helps take you through

605
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:46.020
that and also helps you understand. Um, How How

606
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:52.750
a mistake, how Lying to yourself and others, miscommunication,

607
00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:55.629
you know, whether it's on purpose or on accident,

608
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.560
um, what a force of destruction it is and

609
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.280
how it can completely take you down.

610
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.939
Yeah. By, by the way, when it comes to

611
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:12.679
The, the, the first three doors and because there's

612
00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:17.840
that element there of to what extent the tragedy

613
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.870
was brought up by Morgan because they were drawn

614
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.679
to the mansion and the mansion was under her

615
00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:32.439
control to completely ruin their stories, their, their stories

616
00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:36.570
in their, in their new life, let's say. Um,

617
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.090
I mean, to what extent do you think that,

618
00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:48.689
uh, tragedy was caused by Morgan or caused by

619
00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:52.919
the behavior of the, the characters anyway, and it

620
00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:56.100
would have happened anyway, because the, there, there's that

621
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.260
lingering question, right? I mean, would it have happened

622
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:05.189
the same way if Morgan didn't manipulate? Their story

623
00:36:05.189 --> 00:36:09.409
and what happened in the, in the men uh

624
00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:11.909
uh if she didn't do that, would it have

625
00:36:11.909 --> 00:36:14.939
happened and and and for me and for me

626
00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.149
it seems that it would so I,

627
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.850
I. What I thought was interesting about it, um,

628
00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:24.840
yeah, I mean, I think ultimately I agree with

629
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.000
you, because would it have happened exactly the same

630
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.850
way if Morgana hadn't been manipulating the, the situation?

631
00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:33.550
No, it wouldn't have happened exactly the same way.

632
00:36:33.719 --> 00:36:37.040
But the fact was, was that the, the, what

633
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:43.580
she was Her manipulations, um, brought out what was

634
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:49.219
already there in those characters. Yeah. And, uh, it

635
00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:52.179
might have been something else that came out, or

636
00:36:52.939 --> 00:36:55.659
even if it was, you know, the same sort

637
00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:59.510
of instinct at the same sort of Powerfully negative

638
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.770
uh force that, that kind of came out to

639
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.120
play. It, it might have changed the circumstances some,

640
00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:07.530
but I think they would have been no less

641
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.090
tragic. Yeah, yeah. You know, what had to be

642
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.290
learned. That was the lesson that had to be

643
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:19.070
learned. And You know, I, one of the things

644
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.389
that, um, there's a, I'm gonna mess up this,

645
00:37:22.469 --> 00:37:27.080
this. Quote, OK, so I'm just understand that I'm

646
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:34.209
paraphrasing pretty egregiously, but there's um Of an author

647
00:37:34.209 --> 00:37:37.850
named John O'Donoghue. Um, I mean, he's no longer

648
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.810
alive. He was an Irish priest and he was

649
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.729
just, I mean, my God, I mean, he's just

650
00:37:42.729 --> 00:37:45.969
a beautiful writer and he, he wrote it basically

651
00:37:45.969 --> 00:37:49.439
an entire book on beauty, on meditations on beauty,

652
00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:55.399
and one of the, one of his, um, Well,

653
00:37:55.469 --> 00:37:57.530
one of the things that that he writes about

654
00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:01.969
is how There's a, he feels like there's a

655
00:38:01.969 --> 00:38:06.929
misunderstanding of beauty as being, um, naive. And he

656
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.169
really does not like naivete that, oh, she's an

657
00:38:10.169 --> 00:38:13.719
innocent beauty. And he's like, innocent beauty is useless

658
00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:16.129
because this person has never been tested, or not

659
00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:18.370
this person, that beauty has never been tested, you

660
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.570
know, and naivete is untested. So anybody can be

661
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.989
naive and be good when they're naive. Yeah. You

662
00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:31.260
know, but it's, it's once we have lost our

663
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.590
innocence and we continue to be good, that is

664
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.879
the test, you know, and he talks about, um,

665
00:38:39.189 --> 00:38:41.219
true beauty, and he's also talking about physical beauty,

666
00:38:41.229 --> 00:38:43.860
and he, when he, when he's discussing this, this,

667
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:47.229
you know, um, so it's, it's, he's talking about

668
00:38:47.229 --> 00:38:49.939
beauty and, and, and not just like inner beauty,

669
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.639
you know what I mean? And, and, and talking

670
00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:57.820
about how, um, Beauty is the ultimate source of

671
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.340
empathy, and that's why we must appreciate it, and

672
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.129
it is not simple, and it is not innocent,

673
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.060
and it is not naive. Yeah. And, um, and

674
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.929
I thought that that was demonstrated really well and,

675
00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:17.729
you know, in, in Fata Morgan, because there was

676
00:39:17.729 --> 00:39:20.909
no, that, you know, any innocent beauty was just

677
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.860
destroyed after the first door, right? And again, that

678
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.340
takes me back to like what I thought the

679
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.715
authors and. TENSION was with that first door of

680
00:39:29.715 --> 00:39:32.344
creating oh do do do do, here we are

681
00:39:32.344 --> 00:39:36.034
wandering through the field and there are butterflies and

682
00:39:36.034 --> 00:39:39.284
the birds singing, and it's a sunny day. There's

683
00:39:39.284 --> 00:39:41.715
not a cloud in the sky and none of

684
00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:44.314
us have pimples because we're kids and we look

685
00:39:44.314 --> 00:39:47.514
great, you know what I mean? And then, and

686
00:39:47.514 --> 00:39:54.100
then the whole world comes crashing down. And, and

687
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.330
these people sort of have to rebuild themselves into

688
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.340
paradise and, and to earn their way back to

689
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.570
paradise again, except that once they earn their way

690
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.419
back to paradise in that glorious ending, it's no

691
00:40:07.419 --> 00:40:11.459
longer that naive innocent beauty. It is the true

692
00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:14.219
beauty that, that, that John O'Donoghue was talking about.

693
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.810
Yeah, because the, uh, like the, the story, I

694
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:22.530
mean, the, uh, the ending is, uh, like they

695
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:26.600
lived happily ever after kind of ending. But in

696
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.439
that particular case, it's, uh, very well pulled off

697
00:40:30.439 --> 00:40:33.600
and they lived happily ever after kind of ending,

698
00:40:33.649 --> 00:40:34.469
right? It's not,

699
00:40:35.929 --> 00:40:38.479
because nothing stupid, it's gonna take them down now,

700
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.379
you know. Yeah, yes.

701
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.959
So it, it, it makes perfect sense. It's not

702
00:40:47.959 --> 00:40:50.760
one of those happily ever after endings that it's

703
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.919
just silly. It's just, oh yeah, this was, this

704
00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:56.879
was kind of boring. No, it's not only that

705
00:40:56.879 --> 00:41:00.020
it makes perfect sense, but you want that ending.

706
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.300
If, if that ending wasn't there, the, uh, I

707
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.540
mean, the, the story would have been just, I

708
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.469
don't know, pure torture.

709
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.919
I know, you're you're absolutely right. It would have

710
00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:14.229
felt like it was for nothing. You know, it

711
00:41:14.229 --> 00:41:18.340
would have felt like an intellectual trick, like, oh,

712
00:41:18.429 --> 00:41:19.830
well, because this is really how it would have

713
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.379
ended up and I, you know, I, I hate

714
00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:22.750
that. It's like come on, you're telling me a

715
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.189
story. I mean the whole point of a fairy

716
00:41:25.189 --> 00:41:29.300
tale, for instance, it's isn't. And they lived happily

717
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.050
ever after. It's, they lived happily ever after, despite

718
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.899
all the shit that happened to them, right? Or

719
00:41:35.899 --> 00:41:37.500
because of all the stuff that happened to them,

720
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.540
because, you know, the prince had to fight through

721
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.260
beasts and thorns, in order to, you know, kiss

722
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.300
Sleeping Beauty or whatever, and, and through, you know,

723
00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:50.530
this, this horrible witch. Um, AND it's because, um,

724
00:41:50.659 --> 00:41:53.500
you know, Snow White had to overcome death, you

725
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.370
know, after eating the poison apple and the, the,

726
00:41:56.379 --> 00:41:59.189
the The prince had to to be the catalyst

727
00:41:59.189 --> 00:42:00.949
for that, you know what I mean, that that

728
00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:04.179
they actually could live happily ever after, because otherwise,

729
00:42:04.429 --> 00:42:06.909
well, how boring for one thing, but otherwise why

730
00:42:06.909 --> 00:42:09.520
would they live happily ever after? They're totally untested.

731
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.610
Why would we care if they live happily ever

732
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.659
after, just because they're, you know, he's a prince

733
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:19.790
and she's pretty. Yeah. You know?

734
00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:22.689
Yeah. And I mean, the kinds of things that

735
00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:25.530
Michelle and Gisele had to go through in the

736
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.050
story to get to that ending. I, I, I

737
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:34.050
mean, you can't, uh, demand more from anyone when

738
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:37.090
it comes to proving their love. I mean, it's

739
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:38.929
it's more and more than proof.

740
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.040
It is, and it's also, you know, it also

741
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:50.159
tells you how, or shows you how That's sort

742
00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:55.629
of uh happily ever after. It's because of gratitude.

743
00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.020
Because you're so grateful to finally be there. And

744
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.719
without gratitude, you don't appreciate what you've got in

745
00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:07.320
your life. You know, you don't appreciate the person

746
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.840
in your life, your circumstances, whatever it is, even

747
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.550
when you're going through difficult times, and gratitude is

748
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.179
wisdom. Yeah. You know, we're not born grateful for

749
00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:23.060
the most part. We earn, we earn that, you

750
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.489
know.

751
00:43:23.879 --> 00:43:27.669
Yeah. You, you know one particular scene that I

752
00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:32.389
love from the story, uh, because it, uh, establishes

753
00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:38.189
a perfect contrast between Michelle and Morgan, because, I

754
00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:41.550
mean, you can establish parallels between their stories because

755
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.550
Michelle is basically the one who is able to

756
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.125
forgive everyone who wronged him. But Morgan. He's the

757
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.486
one who's not, or at least needs a little

758
00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.486
bit of a push, a little bit of help

759
00:43:52.486 --> 00:43:59.045
there. But this, the scene where Michelle asks Gisele

760
00:43:59.365 --> 00:44:03.645
if she wants Antony, his father, to be, to

761
00:44:03.645 --> 00:44:08.156
be cursed because of the, of the sexual assault.

762
00:44:08.365 --> 00:44:11.476
And she, and she says, no, but I mean,

763
00:44:11.612 --> 00:44:14.761
He was, if she had said yes, he would

764
00:44:14.761 --> 00:44:18.511
have asked Morgan to curse him, and he, he,

765
00:44:18.541 --> 00:44:21.382
he would have gone with it. But it was,

766
00:44:21.781 --> 00:44:24.422
but the only reason why he would have done

767
00:44:24.422 --> 00:44:28.062
it with it was because of love. It was

768
00:44:28.062 --> 00:44:32.142
not because he wanted vengeance for himself. He wanted

769
00:44:32.142 --> 00:44:35.572
vengeance for her, for Giselle,

770
00:44:35.781 --> 00:44:40.629
right? Yes, and it was incredibly powerful that she

771
00:44:40.629 --> 00:44:43.830
said no to, you know, that it was, it

772
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:51.929
was. That was a very honorable. Resolution, I thought,

773
00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:56.020
you know, on both ends, right, because he needed.

774
00:44:56.919 --> 00:45:01.040
To say that that he would. Get vengeance on

775
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.360
her behalf. You know what I mean? He needed

776
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.600
to say, I'm willing to do this. I'm willing

777
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.479
to protect you this way. I'm willing to guard

778
00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:11.840
your, your dignity and help try to help heal

779
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.560
your soul this way, even if this is, you

780
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.260
know, Even if it will sully my own soul,

781
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.899
I'm willing to do this for you and um.

782
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:27.870
And she said no. Yeah.

783
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:33.050
But, but look, when it comes to. Perhaps the

784
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:37.689
most frustrating part of the entire story. I mean,

785
00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.330
I mean, for me, it has to be uh

786
00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.129
the story between Jacopo and the white-haired girl it's

787
00:45:46.129 --> 00:45:50.850
so incredibly frustrating how they, how they felt the

788
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.030
same for each other. And how, I mean, if

789
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:59.229
she just went out of the, uh, cottage house

790
00:45:59.229 --> 00:46:02.790
or something, or if he went there and talked

791
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:08.229
with her or vice versa, they were sold everything.

792
00:46:08.304 --> 00:46:10.975
They would have solved everything. I mean, it, it

793
00:46:10.975 --> 00:46:14.614
was just like, oh my God, come on. Either

794
00:46:14.614 --> 00:46:17.334
of you just go and talk with the other

795
00:46:17.334 --> 00:46:22.014
person, stop writing letters and stuff and stop depending

796
00:46:22.014 --> 00:46:24.324
on Maria to get you the letter.

797
00:46:24.854 --> 00:46:28.094
Yeah, exactly. It's like, really, has it never occurred

798
00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:30.455
to you that, that, that maybe this is that

799
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:35.149
you're being messed with? Yeah, you know. Yeah. Are

800
00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:38.870
you so involved in your story and the way

801
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:40.709
you think it should turn out that you're not

802
00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:44.129
really thinking? What's going on around you, you're not

803
00:46:44.129 --> 00:46:46.310
thinking three dimensionally, you know, that was part of

804
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.500
what was so frustrating about it, and that was,

805
00:46:48.729 --> 00:46:53.399
and, and maybe that was also um Part of

806
00:46:53.399 --> 00:46:57.040
what Did not make them so innocent in that.

807
00:46:57.919 --> 00:47:05.820
Yeah. You know that that they Oh enjoyed their

808
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.739
um, their punishment a little too much in order

809
00:47:10.229 --> 00:47:13.629
to kind of set themselves free and be happy

810
00:47:13.629 --> 00:47:15.159
when, you know, all they had to do was

811
00:47:15.159 --> 00:47:16.790
go to the other person, but there was something

812
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.830
that they were getting out of. He was getting

813
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:24.820
something. Out of punishing her and believing the worst.

814
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:28.100
And she was getting something out of being punished.

815
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:33.919
For, you know, quote, no reason, right? Um, BUT

816
00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:41.860
Uh, That was, yeah, that was. That was really

817
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.409
good.

818
00:47:42.939 --> 00:47:44.969
Yeah, but, but, and at the same time, it

819
00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:49.100
made lots of sense because of his, of Jacopo's

820
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.860
backstory because he was part of the mafia and

821
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.379
he, and he was brought up in that sort

822
00:47:55.379 --> 00:48:02.219
of, uh, machismo kind of environment and where it

823
00:48:02.219 --> 00:48:06.250
would have been, uh, I, I don't know, extremely

824
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.570
shameful for him to be betrayed by his wife

825
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.709
or something like that.

826
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.399
So, I, I mean. So, yeah, yeah.

827
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:18.080
I mean, so you, you basically, it's very frustrating,

828
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.590
but at the same time, you understand where it

829
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:21.320
comes from.

830
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.729
For sure, you know, it's kind of like what

831
00:48:23.729 --> 00:48:28.330
like Othello, right? You're, you're watching Othello, you know,

832
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:32.520
destroy his, his relationship with his wife and, and,

833
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:37.129
and. Because he can't, you know, he's, he just

834
00:48:37.129 --> 00:48:40.679
can't not believe what Igago is saying, you know.

835
00:48:41.169 --> 00:48:43.260
And he ends up killing her as a result,

836
00:48:43.419 --> 00:48:44.969
you know, and all he had to do was

837
00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:47.169
go and ask her or believe her or, or

838
00:48:47.169 --> 00:48:50.280
look around Iago. You know, I felt like that

839
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.580
it was very Shakespearean, that, that story.

840
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.820
Or, or even read them letters because the things

841
00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.060
she

842
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.949
wrote there. Yeah. The thing she wrote there,

843
00:49:00.959 --> 00:49:03.540
it was things that happened between them. I mean,

844
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.580
it wouldn't make sense for her to have experience.

845
00:49:06.995 --> 00:49:10.754
THE exact same things, the exact same episodes with

846
00:49:10.754 --> 00:49:11.665
another person.

847
00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:14.955
No, no. It, it was, it was funny because

848
00:49:14.955 --> 00:49:17.205
that was, it was so frustrating, you know, you're,

849
00:49:17.514 --> 00:49:20.034
it's like the, it's, it's like watching, uh, you

850
00:49:20.034 --> 00:49:23.524
know, a horror movie and, and, and, uh, you're

851
00:49:23.524 --> 00:49:26.034
watching, you know, someone who's about to get killed

852
00:49:26.034 --> 00:49:27.475
go into the dark room and you're like, why

853
00:49:27.475 --> 00:49:29.235
are you going in the dark room? Why are

854
00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:32.084
you going in the dark room? You know?

855
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:37.110
Yeah, yeah. But, but, but it, it's, it's realistic,

856
00:49:37.189 --> 00:49:39.790
you know. We, we get frustrated with it, but

857
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.429
it's very, very realistic. I bet that. Well, that's

858
00:49:43.429 --> 00:49:43.580
it,

859
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.510
because we get frustrated with it because we see

860
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.189
ourselves in all of this. And that's what was,

861
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.310
uh, you know, also so great about it, because

862
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.709
it, it connects you to your own foibles, you

863
00:49:52.709 --> 00:49:54.469
know, and also to your own triumphs.

864
00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:59.979
Yeah. By, by the way, earlier I mentioned the

865
00:49:59.979 --> 00:50:03.260
Divine Comedy, but I, I mean, the entire story

866
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.330
has lots and lots of religious elements to it.

867
00:50:06.459 --> 00:50:10.290
No, I mean, the entire, the entire Morgan story,

868
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.040
and then Michelle being the name of the archangel

869
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.290
Michael, and the, and the, the way he basically,

870
00:50:18.659 --> 00:50:22.909
uh, in the last door. Uh, I, I don't

871
00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:25.790
know what word to use here, but because it

872
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.699
was not really redeeming her, but, but he went

873
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:34.459
to Morgan and basically gave her a last moment

874
00:50:34.459 --> 00:50:37.620
of Oh my God, what should I call it?

875
00:50:37.729 --> 00:50:41.020
When, when she, when he holds her in, in

876
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.260
his arms and she's about to die, I mean,

877
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.770
what would you call that? What does he do?

878
00:50:46.969 --> 00:50:49.179
Solace isn't the right word and it neither is

879
00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:53.840
like forgiveness. It's sort of like, um. Yeah absolution

880
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.959
isn't even the right word. But it is, but

881
00:50:58.959 --> 00:51:00.209
there is a real, you're right, I think that

882
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:02.800
it's very religious, maybe it is absolution in a

883
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.379
way that it it's, it's, it's a level of

884
00:51:08.379 --> 00:51:13.629
understanding from a spiritual perspective that that. Allows a

885
00:51:13.629 --> 00:51:17.429
person to go into the dark night, right? That

886
00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:21.090
allows them to go and not fear and, and

887
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.070
to know that they will be understood.

888
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:30.389
Right. And uh and it's basically relieving even though

889
00:51:30.389 --> 00:51:34.250
it's very brief relieving your pain and help her

890
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:41.800
rest in peace, in a way, yeah. Because, because

891
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.199
it's like you went through all of that, but

892
00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:47.469
now I'm an angel. I've been sent by God,

893
00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.600
and I'm here to, and I'm here to lead

894
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.260
you to heaven, to paradise or something like that.

895
00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.629
Yeah, you, you've suffered enough, so. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

896
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.300
So, uh, so I, I have to, I have

897
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:10.750
to ask you then, uh. I is this. The

898
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:14.860
best story ever written or or not.

899
00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:20.030
It is really freaking good because not only is

900
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:24.709
it Like genuinely like good from a from a

901
00:52:24.709 --> 00:52:29.120
like any perspective, a literary perspective, but it's so

902
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.639
damn entertaining. Yeah, you know, and what it what

903
00:52:33.639 --> 00:52:38.120
it it manages to do what Most like even

904
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.399
really good literary novels. Don't pull off, you know,

905
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:49.889
because they're, because it's wildly entertaining. It shows that

906
00:52:49.889 --> 00:52:53.610
you can be wildly entertaining and engage your, your

907
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:58.330
audience, you know, your reader in fully as you

908
00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:02.080
were as engaged as you would be watching Maverick

909
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.719
or whatever or some other kind of incredible story,

910
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.649
you know, on, on a, that, that's larger than

911
00:53:08.649 --> 00:53:11.889
life and, and that, you know, most critics would

912
00:53:11.889 --> 00:53:14.530
look their, they're looked down on, you know, it

913
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.530
is as every bit as exciting and engaging as

914
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:21.929
that, and yet it's so. Good, and it's so.

915
00:53:22.889 --> 00:53:27.959
Deep, you know, and, and spiritual, and, and, you

916
00:53:27.959 --> 00:53:34.250
know, it it's, it's so big. Yeah. Sorry, I

917
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.239
just want to turn off my phone because I

918
00:53:36.239 --> 00:53:39.090
can't stand when they when it rings when I'm

919
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.629
talking. Um, AND I forgot to turn it off,

920
00:53:42.669 --> 00:53:46.979
but that's it. And that, that alone could possibly

921
00:53:46.979 --> 00:53:48.689
make it like at least the greatest story that's

922
00:53:48.689 --> 00:53:52.139
been written in a really, really long time because

923
00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:59.179
it, it manages to be, um, both. So entertaining,

924
00:53:59.419 --> 00:54:04.560
so adventurous. You know, I mean, What an adventure,

925
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:09.020
you know, and yet it's, it's really, really good.

926
00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:13.370
It's so well written. It's so well thought through.

927
00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:17.620
It's so complex. And yet it, it, it, it,

928
00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.179
it's simple. You know what I mean? I mean,

929
00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:23.060
it's just talking about very simple emotions that we

930
00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.020
all have, you know, it's not, um, you don't

931
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.739
have to twist yourself into pretzels to, to understand

932
00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:31.340
what's happening and what's, what they're going through, you

933
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.020
know, in their hearts and in their souls, you

934
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.419
know, and, and how, and their thought process, you

935
00:54:35.419 --> 00:54:37.500
know, it's just, God, I thought it was so

936
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.120
good. I just thought it was so good. I,

937
00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.229
I can't praise it enough. Yeah I've I've been

938
00:54:43.229 --> 00:54:45.340
telling people about it. A lot.

939
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:50.270
And and and the how, how do, yeah, how

940
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.070
do people react when you tell them that it's

941
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.790
a visual novel because it's not that common yet

942
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:00.389
for people to read those types of things,

943
00:55:00.469 --> 00:55:04.600
right? They're very intrigued and it has really kind

944
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.459
of lit a fire in me to want to

945
00:55:06.459 --> 00:55:09.270
get into the visual novel space for my own

946
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:14.290
work. Yeah, because it's You know, I thought when

947
00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:18.370
I after I started watching it through, you know,

948
00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:22.689
the YouTube, um, Channel that you, you recommended. And

949
00:55:22.689 --> 00:55:23.889
I was like, God, I wish I could just

950
00:55:23.889 --> 00:55:26.330
get rid of this narrator guy, you know, who's

951
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.530
talking, taking us through. And so I, you know,

952
00:55:29.639 --> 00:55:32.139
I, I went to Amazon and you can get

953
00:55:32.139 --> 00:55:34.409
the House of Fata Morgana in book form. You

954
00:55:34.409 --> 00:55:36.530
know, you can get it on Kindle. And I'm

955
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.050
sure that that it probably has some imagery with

956
00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:43.389
it. I'm, I, I'm, that's unclear, but It just,

957
00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:46.260
it wasn't the same, you know, I feel like

958
00:55:47.229 --> 00:55:53.379
the reason why Um, it can be You know,

959
00:55:53.389 --> 00:55:58.679
the narrative is so complex. You know, it's, it's

960
00:55:58.679 --> 00:56:01.879
not like serpentine, it's kaleidoscopic, you know, I mean,

961
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.040
it is crazy and um one of the reasons

962
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.479
why you can follow it pretty easily is because

963
00:56:08.479 --> 00:56:12.120
it's also so visual. And that gives you so

964
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.909
much more um to work with as, as an

965
00:56:15.909 --> 00:56:18.149
author, you know, you can, you can really go

966
00:56:18.149 --> 00:56:22.290
that much farther and you can, you can. Make

967
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:26.010
a story a lot more difficult without frustrating the

968
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:29.949
audience, and so it it that was, that was

969
00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:33.459
really, really exciting for me. I, I loved the

970
00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:35.419
visual aspect of it. Now I'm trying to, you

971
00:56:35.419 --> 00:56:37.610
know, that's one of the things that I've been

972
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.469
Promoting when I talk to people about this story.

973
00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:43.570
I'm like, no, no, no, it's gotta be, you

974
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.760
know, it's gotta be seen as well as read.

975
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.729
And I love that they have you read it

976
00:56:47.729 --> 00:56:49.919
too. It's not, you know, the words are there.

977
00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:52.489
You see it's meant to be read. It's not

978
00:56:52.489 --> 00:56:54.929
a movie. You know what I mean? It is

979
00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:56.929
meant to be read, but it's also meant to

980
00:56:56.929 --> 00:57:00.659
be seen. And it's, you know, more complicated than

981
00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:03.550
than a comic book though, you know, which is.

982
00:57:06.639 --> 00:57:09.610
Yeah. Which has just a different vibe to it

983
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.040
entirely, you know.

984
00:57:11.649 --> 00:57:14.800
No, it's, it's really a unique medium, really.

985
00:57:15.409 --> 00:57:18.290
It's, it's, it's really, really unique.

986
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.629
And and what about, what about the soundtrack? I

987
00:57:23.629 --> 00:57:25.280
also love the soundtrack.

988
00:57:25.719 --> 00:57:27.830
I love that, yeah, and I feel like it

989
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.629
was interrupted a lot because again I had a

990
00:57:29.629 --> 00:57:33.070
narrator, so I couldn't really absorb it and it

991
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.159
it it really made me want to get a

992
00:57:35.159 --> 00:57:37.110
gaming computer just in order to be able to

993
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.699
watch visual novels, because the, yeah, I mean the

994
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:46.590
it it. It was such a an incredible combination

995
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.879
and a and a fresh combination. Obviously movies put

996
00:57:49.879 --> 00:57:55.689
together music and visual and and dialogue, but um

997
00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:00.030
But the added dimension is the is the prose,

998
00:58:00.389 --> 00:58:02.820
you know, that you can also appreciate the written

999
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:07.520
word while you're watching this. And really appreciate it,

1000
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.879
you know, you don't get, uh, you don't get,

1001
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.360
you don't start thinking about other things when you're

1002
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.020
reading, you know what I mean? You're, you're fully

1003
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:20.229
engaged. And um damn, I wish, I really wish

1004
00:58:20.479 --> 00:58:26.810
that Movie theaters. Would present visual novels as well

1005
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:29.879
as films. I wish there was a place where

1006
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.929
you could um where you could watch this on

1007
00:58:32.929 --> 00:58:36.780
a large screen. Yeah, you know, I mean, obviously

1008
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.780
it's very long, you know, so that, that it

1009
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.540
presents some problems, but maybe, you know, you could

1010
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:47.860
buy. You know, tickets for, you know, all eight

1011
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.179
doors or whatever it is, and then you go

1012
00:58:50.179 --> 00:58:52.370
when you can and you go watch your door,

1013
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.290
you know, and there are ways to do it.

1014
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:57.179
And I just think that that would be so

1015
00:58:57.179 --> 00:59:01.419
incredible. And what a way to bring in new

1016
00:59:01.419 --> 00:59:04.419
people too, and, and to, to just do something

1017
00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:08.399
different and, and explore the, you know, visual storytelling

1018
00:59:08.399 --> 00:59:10.899
that way. Yeah, I, I,

1019
00:59:10.979 --> 00:59:13.139
I think they should, I think they should make

1020
00:59:13.139 --> 00:59:15.620
it into a series. I mean, I think it

1021
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:19.409
would be mass massively popular. I think it would

1022
00:59:19.409 --> 00:59:22.850
be so, so successful. I mean, a story like

1023
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.100
this, uh. It it can't go wrong.

1024
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:29.570
It's, I don't, I agree. Well, it can go

1025
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.449
wrong in the wrong hands. It can definitely go

1026
00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:36.010
wrong because you're you're gonna, yeah, you're gonna have

1027
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.570
someone doing a lot of stupid shit and you

1028
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:40.649
know you are. You know you're gonna have some,

1029
00:59:40.969 --> 00:59:44.760
you know, some member of the the creative committee,

1030
00:59:44.929 --> 00:59:47.489
right, going, yeah, you know, I don't know. I

1031
00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:49.689
think Michelle needs a dick. You know what I

1032
00:59:49.689 --> 00:59:52.659
mean? Yes. You know you're gonna have someone in

1033
00:59:52.659 --> 00:59:56.219
there saying that, right? Or, uh, I don't think,

1034
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.850
I don't think Morgana needs to be quite that

1035
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.939
ugly after she's destroyed. And, you know, she, and

1036
01:00:01.939 --> 01:00:03.739
maybe we ought to keep her hot. You know,

1037
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.860
it's just, you just know you're gonna have somebody

1038
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.540
saying something stupid. So it can go wrong, but

1039
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.620
hopefully, in the right hands of someone who is

1040
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.699
a real fan, you know, and, and appreciates the

1041
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:21.389
story. And, um, They would find a way and

1042
01:00:21.389 --> 01:00:24.610
do justice. To it, you know,

1043
01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:27.080
this is the kind of story that they could

1044
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.919
even, it wouldn't need to be like, uh, cartoons

1045
01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:34.510
or anime. It could have been, it could have,

1046
01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:36.310
it could be with actors.

1047
01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:39.040
So yeah, absolutely. I mean, it could be a

1048
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.770
movie, you know, um. I, I, if maybe there,

1049
01:00:44.889 --> 01:00:46.610
there could be a way to, to have some

1050
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.489
sort of, you know, narrator that's able to bring

1051
01:00:50.489 --> 01:00:53.520
some of the, uh, you know, the language into

1052
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:57.169
that beyond just dialogue, you know what I mean?

1053
01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.330
So that, you know, one could get absorbed in

1054
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:02.489
that story and that, in that way too, because

1055
01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:04.209
I think that that really was one of the,

1056
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.810
one of the great parts of it. I really

1057
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.050
did enjoy how it was written. You know, I

1058
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:12.449
enjoyed the actual prose and not just, um, The

1059
01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:14.570
story itself and the music and the visuals, but

1060
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.449
it was just, it all came together, you know

1061
01:01:17.449 --> 01:01:19.530
what I mean, which is so rare. Every part

1062
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:22.629
of it came together to make it. Um, TO

1063
01:01:22.629 --> 01:01:25.100
make it just beautiful and perfect.

1064
01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:30.739
So, and, and as a writer, was there something

1065
01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:33.610
you learned from it that you think you're going

1066
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:36.469
to apply in your own, your own work now?

1067
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.419
Yeah, I mean, I, I, I wanna go into

1068
01:01:42.419 --> 01:01:46.060
the visual novel realm. I don't know how exactly

1069
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.669
I'm going to get there, but I'm going to

1070
01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:50.100
get there. I mean, I'm already kind of partway

1071
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.780
there. I don't think I told you this because

1072
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.530
we haven't had a chance to discuss it, but

1073
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:57.300
um I have a, a friend and business partner,

1074
01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:00.870
and we've started, um, a publishing house called Speakeasy

1075
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.699
Editions, and it's not just publishing, it's also art

1076
01:02:03.699 --> 01:02:07.510
and merchandise, you know, we're, it's, it's story world

1077
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:11.070
and, and series-based stories, you know, it's not just

1078
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:14.790
like individual novels that come out. It's, it's worlds

1079
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:19.139
and that are, you know, sometimes directly and sometimes

1080
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:24.479
indirectly connected to, um, The sort of art and,

1081
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.239
and print and photography collection that we have on,

1082
01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:32.080
on the, you know, on our, on our Store

1083
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.929
and publishing house, you know, and, and then we're

1084
01:02:33.929 --> 01:02:37.209
also gonna have, have, you know, merchandise that sort

1085
01:02:37.209 --> 01:02:39.889
of brings you into those aesthetics and so we

1086
01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:45.100
wanna, you know, we're, we're Kind of in that

1087
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.379
realm already, although obviously that's not that's not a

1088
01:02:48.379 --> 01:02:50.870
visual novel, but I, I really wanna go into

1089
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:55.179
the visual novel space. At some point, sooner than

1090
01:02:55.179 --> 01:02:58.879
later. I just think it's phenomenal. And it, like

1091
01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:01.870
I said, it, I'd like to tell complicated stories,

1092
01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:04.600
you know, not complicated like convoluted, but I like

1093
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.800
to tell stories that have, have some layers to

1094
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.250
them, and that is just So much more, you

1095
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.530
know, you can work with dual timelines so much

1096
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.929
easier when you're dealing with a visual novel and

1097
01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.050
without losing people who are like, Wait a minute,

1098
01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:19.449
what time are we in? You know what I

1099
01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:21.969
mean? I understand that, you know, cause a lot

1100
01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:25.360
of really smart readers have a hard time with,

1101
01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:28.709
say, like dual timelines. You know, it, it's just

1102
01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:33.590
hard for them to follow. And um When you

1103
01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:38.449
are When you're approaching that story visually, it's, it

1104
01:03:38.449 --> 01:03:41.709
just becomes a lot easier, you know, you can,

1105
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.120
you can really take them on that journey and

1106
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:49.879
get them, um, Get them, you know, over those

1107
01:03:49.879 --> 01:03:53.639
sort of miscommunications that, that, that, you know, things

1108
01:03:53.639 --> 01:03:55.679
that they might have missed that signaled, no, no,

1109
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.239
no, we're now in 1843 or whatever it is,

1110
01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.530
we're no longer, you know, in the present day.

1111
01:04:02.419 --> 01:04:06.669
Um, AND, I mean, God, with, with Fata Morgan,

1112
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:11.100
talk about jumping timelines and, and you go from,

1113
01:04:11.149 --> 01:04:14.620
you know, you go back to the Middle Ages,

1114
01:04:14.629 --> 01:04:17.620
and then, you know, you fast forward. And so

1115
01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.429
that takes you all over the place. And yeah,

1116
01:04:20.659 --> 01:04:23.689
there are times when you're a little bit confused,

1117
01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:27.389
but it's never unsatisfying because, A, you're being brought

1118
01:04:27.389 --> 01:04:31.030
in visually. And you're, you're hearing music and all

1119
01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:32.989
of this, so you're sticking with it, and then

1120
01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:35.350
suddenly you have the revelation of where you are

1121
01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:37.620
and what has just the story that has just

1122
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.060
been. Been presented to you, you know? Yeah. How

1123
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.270
about you, do you have a hard time now

1124
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.899
going back to regular novels after getting so absorbed

1125
01:04:45.899 --> 01:04:47.540
in visual novels, or is it, no, no, no,

1126
01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.090
I can go I can go back and forth

1127
01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:49.810
easily.

1128
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:53.439
Uh, NO, I can go back and forth because

1129
01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:58.500
I haven't gotten really seriously into the, into visual

1130
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.709
novels. I mean, Diaz and Fata Morganda, to be

1131
01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:04.429
honest, it's the only visual novel I've read up

1132
01:05:04.429 --> 01:05:08.010
till now, so. It's, it's not been that hard

1133
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.449
for me. And I also, anyway, you read the

1134
01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:15.850
comics, uh, I, I mean, I, I read the

1135
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.879
manga, uh Japanese manga and stuff like that. So

1136
01:05:19.169 --> 01:05:22.209
it has some elements of it. No, no, of

1137
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:26.090
course not. It kind of reminds me of the

1138
01:05:26.129 --> 01:05:29.479
the Mr. Octopus, the, the octopus Teacher story. I

1139
01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:31.889
mean, it didn't remind me of that wasn't, but

1140
01:05:31.889 --> 01:05:34.169
I mean in terms of its complexity, you know

1141
01:05:34.169 --> 01:05:38.040
what I mean? And the drama, you know, and

1142
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.350
the sort of mythological. Proportion of it, you know

1143
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.350
what I mean? It was just, they're both such

1144
01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:48.909
big stories, and I was thinking that that octopus

1145
01:05:48.909 --> 01:05:50.870
Teacher story would make a great visual novel.

1146
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.290
Yeah, probably,

1147
01:05:53.459 --> 01:05:54.699
probably would be brilliant.

1148
01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:58.929
I mean, I, I don't know what uh what's

1149
01:05:58.929 --> 01:06:03.770
with the, with Japanese people, but Japanese people in

1150
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:07.689
terms of creating stories, it's almost like the Russians.

1151
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:08.370
I, I, I

1152
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.169
don't know I was gonna say I feel like

1153
01:06:10.169 --> 01:06:12.739
that they have. Taken over the, the mantle, you

1154
01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:15.500
know, the mantle has been passed to Japanese storytellers

1155
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.060
from, from, um, you know, the great Russian novelists

1156
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.979
to now, you know, the great Japanese storytellers. I

1157
01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:24.739
think you're right. I think currently, the Japanese are

1158
01:06:24.739 --> 01:06:28.449
the best storytellers in the world. Yeah. Hands down.

1159
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.120
I mean, it's not even close.

1160
01:06:30.729 --> 01:06:31.439
I agree.

1161
01:06:31.929 --> 01:06:34.209
It's, it's really what the Russians were until 5

1162
01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:37.570
minutes ago. Yeah. You know.

1163
01:06:37.909 --> 01:06:43.560
Mhm. So, I mean, do you have any final

1164
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.229
thoughts on the houses in Fata Morgan, something that

1165
01:06:47.639 --> 01:06:50.520
we might not have touched on, or?

1166
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:54.379
Mm, I don't think so. I think we're pretty

1167
01:06:54.379 --> 01:06:56.020
thorough. Do you have anything else that you wanna

1168
01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:00.169
add that You know, I mean, the only thing

1169
01:07:00.169 --> 01:07:01.780
that I would say is, I mean that it's

1170
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:09.550
so. It's such a satisfying experience for the reader

1171
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:14.739
slash viewer, but I can't even, it would be

1172
01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:22.120
such a satisfying experience as a storyteller. To You

1173
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.439
