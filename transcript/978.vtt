00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.820
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.470
joined by Doctor Sophie Scott Brown. She is a

4
00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.069
research fellow at the University of San Andrews and

5
00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.069
Future Fellow at Remark Institute in New York. She

6
00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.559
is also founder of the Everyday Democracy Project with

7
00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:22.750
Open Society Foundation. And today we're talking about the

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.370
history of European political thought, left wing politics in

9
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:31.040
Europe, anarchism, the enlightenment and liberalism, some other related

10
00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.330
topics. So, Sophie, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.770
huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.729
It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

13
00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:42.169
So, uh let us start then with European political

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.040
thought. So you yourself, how far back do you

15
00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.020
go when studying the history of European political thought?

16
00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:55.080
Or when would you say perhaps it starts or

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.799
what are the parts you're most interested in?

18
00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:02.200
Sure. Well, this is a really interesting question, obviously

19
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.910
because I, I stand with a foot in two

20
00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:08.129
camps. So I'm an intellectual historian, but I'm also

21
00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.400
a political philosopher. So, um and I know I'm

22
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.250
sure we're gonna talk later a bit more about

23
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.720
the conversation that happens between philosophy, politics and history

24
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.660
um in terms of my sort of historical work

25
00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.540
now, obviously, I was taught in the, you know,

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.230
at university in the, the sort of standard way.

27
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.970
And generally speaking, you can't get very far in

28
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.860
political philosophy without really um Ancient Greece. You know,

29
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.480
you, you can't, you can't really escape Plato and

30
00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:40.180
Aristotle, but the kind of key founding text that

31
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.540
gave us so many of the very um familiar

32
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.120
normative ideas that we have about what politics is,

33
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.470
how it should be done, who should be doing

34
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.309
it all that sort of thing. So obviously, you

35
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.709
could um if you wanted to do sort of

36
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.389
European political thought, you could be very, very traditional

37
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.699
and conventional and you could start there. Um And

38
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.639
that obviously gives you the foundations for a lot

39
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.760
of ideas that get sort of altered and reiterated

40
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:11.490
and regenerated over over the generations um in terms

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.630
of my own practice. However, I mean, I identified

42
00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.660
predominantly as a modern historian and modern is one

43
00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:21.380
of these another wonderfully elastic words. So, although I

44
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.539
tend to focus on 20th century stuff, obviously, I

45
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.889
sort of um follow the threads of that back

46
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.470
into the 18th or the the sort of enlightenment

47
00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.270
period and possibly slightly beyond to the things like

48
00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.229
the scientific revolution in the kind of late sort

49
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.800
of 17th century type thing, you can do that.

50
00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.289
And the reason that you would do that is

51
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.220
because actually a lot of modernity is a very

52
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.880
different set of political and economic conditions which obviously

53
00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.750
was very, very, very um different from, from what

54
00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.669
they were talking about and having to comprehend in

55
00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.179
antiquity and also in the middle and medieval, uh

56
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.759
middle ages, medieval periods. So you've got this wonderful

57
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.020
mishmash of questions that have been asked over and

58
00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.300
over again. Um For as long as people have

59
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.720
been getting together, talking about how to organize things.

60
00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.589
Um Then you've got a very specific set of

61
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.309
conditions which we now know are the kind of

62
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.220
architecture for what we call modernism, particularly in terms

63
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.020
of economics and politics. So they follow through too.

64
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.550
And then I suppose as a historian, you're busy

65
00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.949
weaving all these threads together, seeing how this set

66
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.850
of conditions affect this kind of question. So when

67
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.660
you do the 20th century, you can't do it

68
00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.190
in a vacuum. Although um you know, you have

69
00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.369
to bring some of that memory back with it,

70
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.250
not necessarily because it is what happened, but it's

71
00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.059
actually more important what people believe about the past

72
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.750
and how that motivates them to make the decisions

73
00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:57.940
they do in the present. However, having said all

74
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.380
that, I'm now going to sort of flip it

75
00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.589
slightly cos the philosopher, philosopher in me always looks

76
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.360
at history with a little bit of skepticism um

77
00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.639
and says, well, actually, yes, it's very useful. What,

78
00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.559
what does history do for us? It gives us

79
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.839
context, it gives us a sort of genesis, it

80
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.740
gives us a story to, to feed into, to

81
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.408
orientate ourselves with. But actually history can, can do

82
00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.668
a lot, can do a lot more for us

83
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:24.209
too. As I said, the normal account of politic,

84
00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:27.178
the history of political thought starts in ancient Greece.

85
00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.229
And when you do that, you automatically are talking

86
00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:32.658
about how to be a leader, how to have

87
00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.070
governments, um, how to have authority. Um, WHY authority

88
00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:39.769
is necessary because it protects us from our worst

89
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.299
instincts about ourselves or why authority is good because

90
00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:45.279
it helps us be our best selves. Those are

91
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.429
the two stories that come out of ancient times

92
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.420
really and travel forward. Now, if you're an anarchist,

93
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.549
that's not very helpful. Um If you're an anarchist

94
00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:58.980
looking for accounts of how in history, we can

95
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.899
show that actually authority isn't always necessary when it

96
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.049
comes to organizing ourselves and splitting up our resources

97
00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.100
and making decisions about that. So you might start

98
00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:13.144
elsewhere in history. You might as um Peter Kropotkin

99
00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.674
did the uh the Russian scientist, he actually went

100
00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:19.274
back to prehistory. Um How did very, very early

101
00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.864
forms of human organization work themselves out? And his

102
00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:27.279
argument was that it's not just about competition and

103
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.779
authority, therefore being necessary to moderate competition, we can

104
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.239
trace a history of human beings being co-operative and

105
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.690
that co-operation being what has helped them the most

106
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.040
to develop and flourish um as a species. Um

107
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.059
There's been some updates to this. So in the

108
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.779
mid uh 20th century, anthropologists got very excited about

109
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.859
tribes finding indigenous peoples who equally had no hierarchical

110
00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.459
structures within their cultures. They did have quite um

111
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.809
repressive, shall we say customs or religions? But nevertheless,

112
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.339
they did not have anything that you could equate

113
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.130
to government. More recently, David Graber and David Wenger

114
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.079
have also gone back into prehistory and found examples

115
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.279
of um groups or uh tribal groups that again

116
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.329
didn't need government. So this is another perennial thing.

117
00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.079
Perhaps we shouldn't be looking at ancient Greece. Perhaps

118
00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.369
we should be looking much further and much more

119
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.700
um broadly. But the final thing I'd say is

120
00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.600
just, you know, going back, putting my historian's hat

121
00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:39.540
back on at any moment in time, you, it

122
00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:42.619
depends where you want to train your historian's eye.

123
00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:44.910
Now, if you want to do politics, it feels

124
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.630
natural that you would look to governments, to kings,

125
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.529
to leaders, to emperors, to presidents, to queens, whatever.

126
00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:53.910
But you could, if you were imaginative and inventive

127
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.640
enough, look elsewhere because even if people aren't calling

128
00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:01.190
themselves politicians and don't, aren't calling what they're doing

129
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.559
politics. If they're making decisions about how to live

130
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.649
together and how to split up resources, then they

131
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.350
are effectively being political one way or another, how

132
00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:15.359
they're managing a series or collection of vested interests,

133
00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.630
this could be in a purely trivial way in

134
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.109
a sort of in a village, in a family.

135
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.029
So if you're the kind of historian that doesn't

136
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.450
mind being a bit imaginative and a bit creative,

137
00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.260
you can find politics in any space in any

138
00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:31.529
time, um in any country at any point. So,

139
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.369
so to answer to, to come back to your,

140
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.809
to your question, where do you start? Where do

141
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.410
you want to?

142
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.559
OK. So there's a lot there, but I will

143
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.350
perhaps put a pin on the bit that you

144
00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:48.250
mentioned with the the that is more related to

145
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.790
anthropology. I mean, Peter Kropotkin and then anthropology and

146
00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:55.269
then you also mentioned David Graber and others. So

147
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.470
uh I will put a pin on that because

148
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.380
later when we talk about the enlightenment and Steven

149
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.600
Pinker take on it and stuff like that, I,

150
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.779
I think that will make for a good segue

151
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.730
into that. Uh But before we get into left

152
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.510
wing and right wing politics, let me just ask

153
00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:15.700
you one more broad question about what you mentioned

154
00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:18.769
there. So do you think that with the advent

155
00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:23.640
of, of modernism, uh the questions we are interested

156
00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:28.500
in asking in political science and political philosophy, it

157
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.679
changed or are they the same? But we have

158
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.869
to answer them in a new set of circumstance?

159
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.847
That's a really good question. Um I think in

160
00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:43.929
some ways, uh So the question being is, so

161
00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:49.539
how much does that change of situation affect the

162
00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:51.400
way we think about politics in some ways very

163
00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:55.190
profoundly? Because if you're talking about inner antiquity. You're

164
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.500
talking about cultures that, you know, the degree to

165
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.619
which you can assure and be assured of con

166
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.159
of the continuation of life is obviously much more

167
00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:10.280
reduced than in modernity. Modernity is sort of defined

168
00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:12.630
by the extent and it's a horrible phrase, but

169
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.520
the extent to which there's been a conquest of

170
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.030
nature so that our lives are much less um

171
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:23.070
unpredictable, they're much more secure, we can be sure

172
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.650
that we'll, you know, we'll make it through the

173
00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:27.690
winter that we can respond to illnesses and what

174
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.119
have you. Um The further back you go, there's

175
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.719
a precarity, there's a worry, there's a fear. Things

176
00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:38.539
like scarcity are on people's minds constantly that changes

177
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:41.719
the kind of arguments you can have about politics,

178
00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:44.260
not entirely cos as, as um you know, as

179
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.250
we've been discussing. Um It doesn't mean that uh

180
00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:51.429
just because life's a bit more precarious, you're going

181
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.760
to have to talk about authority and cooperations only

182
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.750
something like you get with the luxury of not

183
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.070
worrying. No, no. As crop Kin was arguing, cooper

184
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.200
operation was a much more sensible strategy for managing

185
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:12.070
scarcity and precarity. Um So it's not necessarily that

186
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.030
you discount one set of questions in favor of

187
00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:21.070
another, but certainly modernity does change things dramatically in

188
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.549
terms of how we relate to one another. So

189
00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:26.409
the kind of questions that Plato and Aristotle were

190
00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.940
thinking about, we carry them with us because we

191
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.320
used to because all of those sort of, if

192
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.429
you think about all the great thinkers of, um,

193
00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:37.625
um all the great theorists, people like Karl Marx

194
00:10:37.635 --> 00:10:40.705
or, you know, Nietzsche or, or Hobbs or, you

195
00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.984
know, all of them would have, would have studied

196
00:10:43.994 --> 00:10:46.585
the ancients. And so in some ways, they are

197
00:10:46.594 --> 00:10:50.724
always organizing their thoughts around those ancient questions. Even

198
00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.955
if sometimes that means they're not necessarily paying full

199
00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:59.119
attention to the modern facts. I think what I

200
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.489
would sort of, um what I would really think

201
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.530
is striking at this particular moment is the extent

202
00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:09.659
to which that process is really working against us

203
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.950
right now. And actually the kind of questions we're

204
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.250
asking, we're so used to a particular set of

205
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.169
questions and a particular way of asking that we

206
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:23.090
have ignored for too long, some facts about what

207
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.809
our modern sit situation, our late modern situation. Um

208
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.169
REALLY is, for example, this is the great year

209
00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.789
of elections, right? Britain's just had one. It was

210
00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:36.030
the most thrilling non-event I think I've ever witnessed.

211
00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:39.299
Um France bit more exciting, but still we are

212
00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.239
actually, we're seeing some really interesting results. We're seeing

213
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.729
people get quite excited about politics, like in France

214
00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:50.690
right now, very excited, a very dramatic result and

215
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.090
yet not a result because ultimately, people are saying,

216
00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:57.299
right, well, it's almost a defensive move. We need

217
00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.219
to keep the worst at bay, but we're not

218
00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:02.030
confident that any form of government is really gonna

219
00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:04.429
get us to where we want to be right

220
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.400
now. Um Right now, um we are facing problems

221
00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:11.770
that the standard ways, the standard tools we have

222
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.520
for dealing with things don't work anymore. No single

223
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.640
national government is gonna be able to respond and

224
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.919
react to the kind of modern problems we've got

225
00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:24.440
and by Melbourne problems I'm talking about or what

226
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.679
happens when you have global pandemics. What you know,

227
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.719
how do you join up? How do you coordinate,

228
00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:32.090
how do you, how do you respond to those

229
00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:36.434
effectively emergency? Right. That's something else that you cannot

230
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.155
just centralize in a national government. It doesn't make

231
00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:41.034
sense. It's not how it's going to work and

232
00:12:41.044 --> 00:12:42.275
it's not how it's going to work in the

233
00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:46.494
future. So yeah, your questions bang on right now.

234
00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:49.765
We're too busy asking old questions and we're not

235
00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:53.094
really paying enough attention to present realities.

236
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.099
So, but now because I want to ask you

237
00:12:57.109 --> 00:13:01.440
about left wing politics, what are the actual origins

238
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.880
of the terms left wing and right wing?

239
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.429
Sure. I actually didn't, didn't know until you mentioned

240
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.419
that this was an area you were looking at

241
00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:12.520
and I'm still a bit hazy, but it seems

242
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.450
to have actually been a fairly incidental kind of

243
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.080
usage that originated from the French Assembly during the

244
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.940
kind of revolution. So the the right was sitting

245
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.179
nearer, you know, the the were those that supported

246
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.700
the older regime or the older establishment? And the

247
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.900
left were the ones that wanted, you know, a

248
00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:32.960
bit more radical change a bit quicker and we,

249
00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:35.900
we were sort of more allied to the revolutionary

250
00:13:35.909 --> 00:13:38.960
cause. Um And that seems to have been just

251
00:13:38.969 --> 00:13:41.840
a sort of, kind of a sort of accidental

252
00:13:41.849 --> 00:13:44.030
thing that caught on like these things do sort

253
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:46.859
of went viral if, if you could go viral

254
00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:51.150
in the 18th century. Uh What's interesting to me

255
00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:53.909
now is just again and it touches back to

256
00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:56.859
your, to your previous question. These terms are so

257
00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:00.460
ubiquitous, they are really quite strong in our minds

258
00:14:00.469 --> 00:14:03.739
and they carry very strong moral loadings as well.

259
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.729
So it could be that, you know, a lot

260
00:14:05.739 --> 00:14:08.169
of us will think automatically. Oh, left are the

261
00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:11.250
goodies, right? Are the baddies equally. We might think,

262
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.500
you know, if we're, we're more inclined towards the

263
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.489
right, the left are irresponsible, we the right are

264
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.349
responsible, but there's strong sort of again, like a

265
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.849
real moral infusion in those ideas and yet how

266
00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:27.859
helpful are they in some ways, what the anarchists

267
00:14:27.869 --> 00:14:31.929
have always done is kind of is respond to

268
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.820
those terms because we have to because they're there

269
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.549
and they're very useful ways to help us organize

270
00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.479
our thoughts. But I have actually said, well, you

271
00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:45.159
know what quite often, the anarchists have the same

272
00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:47.909
kind of problems with people on the left and

273
00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.650
on the, as they do with people on the

274
00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:52.169
right. So one of the major criticisms against a

275
00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:54.599
figure like Marx, for example, was that he was

276
00:14:54.609 --> 00:14:58.590
very authoritarian, dressed up as a libertarian, but secretly

277
00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:02.039
very authoritarian. So, in some ways left and right,

278
00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.390
it, it came into, it came into use kind

279
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.159
of accidentally it stuck around. Um, WE'RE so used

280
00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:12.219
to organizing our political world by it. But is

281
00:15:12.229 --> 00:15:15.549
it actually, um, very useful, is it helping us

282
00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:17.890
right now, or actually, are there other ways to

283
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.090
look at the political landscape like who wants more

284
00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.919
control and who wants to lose or give away

285
00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.409
more control? Hm.

286
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.830
And do you think it's helping us or not

287
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.039
left and right. I don't think it helps anymore.

288
00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:35.260
I think there might have been a moment where

289
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.450
it was useful, but I think right now what's

290
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.489
really interesting is actually looking underneath those two terms,

291
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.409
like I said, um, so I tend to be

292
00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:48.210
associated with, with the left and that's, and I'm

293
00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:50.570
sure we'll, we'll come to that in more detail

294
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.479
later. But I mean, for me, it's sort of,

295
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.349
um, I think right now it puts us in

296
00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:02.659
an unhelpfully polarized tribal position. I'm on this team,

297
00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:05.679
you're on that team. Um, IT'S not really helping

298
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.909
us discuss the common problems that we have to

299
00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:12.700
face and it's not really allowing for there being

300
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.950
quite significant lines of difference between people who might

301
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.700
all, uh, all agree, for example, on a more

302
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.710
socially driven approach as opposed to people who have

303
00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:26.830
a different approach. And a different point of view.

304
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.929
There are fine, there are very, they're not fine

305
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.030
lines, they're actually strong lines of difference between people

306
00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:36.400
who we would put on either camp. And if

307
00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:39.700
we don't recognize them, we reduce the amount of

308
00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:43.320
tools and resources we have to problem solve because

309
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.429
we just lump people together. And right now we

310
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.229
need as many different ideas as we can get.

311
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.710
Mhm. And also, I don't know if you agree

312
00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:54.679
with this point, but it seems to me that

313
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.609
there's enough evidence to say at least in the

314
00:16:57.619 --> 00:17:00.200
US, but probably in other places that if you

315
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.280
ask just common people on the street, whether they

316
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:06.579
identify as Democrats or Republicans, in the case of

317
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.969
the US, they tend to agree more or less

318
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.598
with the same social policies just asking common people

319
00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:16.670
on the street. It's just that when we get

320
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.550
into social media and sometimes even mainstream media more

321
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.000
generally and when we get into more intellectual debates,

322
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.199
sometimes things get a little bit more polarized or

323
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.589
apparently more polarized because it seems that common people

324
00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:36.920
just want more or less the same things, better

325
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.959
health, better education, better salaries, stuff like that.

326
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:43.770
These are social things. I mean, people actually, I

327
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.900
mean, I think the political divides, I think you

328
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.589
make an excellent point there, the political divides mean

329
00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:50.920
something to the politicians because they're the ones playing

330
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.560
the game. But for most people actually, we are

331
00:17:53.569 --> 00:17:56.540
now getting to a point where, um, we don't

332
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.729
have the luxury of, of, you know, it's not

333
00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:01.449
like football, we're not picking our favorite side and,

334
00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:04.329
you know, debating, you know, the, the, the various

335
00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:06.479
strategies, I'll just get that in as the Euros

336
00:18:06.489 --> 00:18:10.630
are on. Um, BUT, uh, right now people have

337
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.099
just, you know, real serious issues just living. Um,

338
00:18:15.109 --> 00:18:17.050
HOW are we gonna live? How are we gonna

339
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.280
deal with the effects of the climate emergency? How

340
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.290
are we gonna deal with much more mobile shifting

341
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.689
populations? How are we gonna deal with cost of

342
00:18:24.699 --> 00:18:27.310
living? And you know, quite frankly, they don't, they

343
00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:29.729
don't care what those people are doing and more

344
00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:32.969
to the point, you know, because we've reached a

345
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.969
stage with our political systems bearing in mind the

346
00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:40.400
extent to which they are all still just reiterating

347
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.069
very old models, models that were kind of formalized

348
00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:46.819
and organized in the sort of 19th century and

349
00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:49.369
are now proving pretty inadequate to dealing with the

350
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.849
kind of problems people are caring about. Um There's

351
00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:56.449
actually very little between them other than maybe style

352
00:18:56.459 --> 00:18:59.959
of presentation. So in Britain, for example, until about

353
00:18:59.969 --> 00:19:03.540
the early 19th century, so throughout the 18th century,

354
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.660
you basically had the whig party, that was it

355
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.430
the wigs, just the whigs and the only division

356
00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.650
was that you had some wigs in power and

357
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.780
they were the court wigs and you had some

358
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.550
wigs out of power and they were the country

359
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.420
wigs and the job of the country wigs was

360
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.630
to keep the court ones honest as it were.

361
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.560
Um, AND, and, but basically they were all pretty

362
00:19:27.569 --> 00:19:31.430
much on message, believed the same sort of things

363
00:19:31.439 --> 00:19:35.089
with tiny kind of nuances between them. We've actually

364
00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:37.589
gone far more back to that kind of system

365
00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.939
right now. The, the, um, you know, um, that's

366
00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:44.050
possibly more relative, more, um, to the point in

367
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.869
Britain, I do think you're getting in order to

368
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.849
get difference and this is maybe a more pertinent

369
00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:53.060
point for Europe in order to get real difference

370
00:19:53.069 --> 00:19:55.880
from the center ground, which seems to have gobbled

371
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.185
up so much. You are having to really get

372
00:19:59.194 --> 00:20:03.724
massive polarization to the point of ludicrousness between the

373
00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:06.775
two parties. The reason we're seeing a hung situation

374
00:20:06.785 --> 00:20:10.464
in France is because, um, it is actually not

375
00:20:10.474 --> 00:20:13.214
realistic that either the far right or the far

376
00:20:13.224 --> 00:20:16.905
left could run a government because government by definition

377
00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:18.494
is that centrist ground.

378
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.060
So let me pick on something that you just

379
00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:26.489
mentioned earlier. You said, uh, I mean, I'm not

380
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.050
sure if you yourself would identify as a leftist

381
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.530
but you said that people usually place you on

382
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.989
the left. So what does that mean for you?

383
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.839
Exactly. And how would you characterize perhaps the left

384
00:20:42.849 --> 00:20:47.795
wing, uh, today or? I, I mean, the, how

385
00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:51.045
would you, what are the, the aspects of the

386
00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:53.974
left that you identify with yourself?

387
00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:56.954
Sure. Um, I don't think, I mean, I do

388
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.535
still use the term and I would probably position

389
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:01.984
myself definitely more that way. Although that ends up

390
00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:05.775
getting into trouble quite a lot actually. So people,

391
00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:08.035
um, people assume that, you know, I'm a, I'm

392
00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:11.280
a good, fully paid up leftist person so I

393
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.969
get endless invitations to socialist this or, you know,

394
00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:17.959
kind of this collective, that collective. And I've got

395
00:21:17.969 --> 00:21:20.449
a horrible, I have to confess to you, you

396
00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.439
know, exclusive here. I'm not very clubbable as the

397
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.760
phrase goes. So I'm, I'm, I'm generally a bit

398
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.479
bit wary when people say, would you like to

399
00:21:28.489 --> 00:21:32.579
join our collective? I'm like, hm, I'm, I'm, I'll

400
00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:37.530
let, I'll, I'll think about that. Um, BUT, uh,

401
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.339
but nevertheless, it is an important term for me

402
00:21:40.349 --> 00:21:42.800
and I think it's because, I mean, quite often

403
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.890
it, it's, it comes down more and I think

404
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.589
this might, um, segue into, to anarchism. Uh, CO

405
00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:53.660
anarchism is just such a kind of radical rethinking

406
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.959
just in terms of, of how you organize and

407
00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:59.180
describe and discuss politics. It's been really helpful. That's

408
00:21:59.189 --> 00:22:00.479
how I got into it in the first place.

409
00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:03.619
It allowed me to express things that I wasn't

410
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.579
finding the language for anywhere else. And that was

411
00:22:06.589 --> 00:22:10.609
really helpful. Um, FOR me, the reason I suppose

412
00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:13.459
I would still identify with the left is because

413
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.010
I do like, if I'm my primary drive or

414
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.109
commitment is to liberty and I do think that

415
00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:23.709
we, um, get a better quality of liberty and

416
00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:28.109
more security of a better security for our liberty

417
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.829
if we can start from a basis of more

418
00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:35.660
or less sort of, not necessarily complete, you know,

419
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.579
equality but from a decent level playing field where

420
00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:45.010
you don't get, um, excessive extremes. Um, SO I

421
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.300
suppose, to me it's like if you were just

422
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.109
to go off and pursue liberty on that in

423
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:53.640
that, in that sort of free market sense of

424
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.699
each for their own and good luck to you,

425
00:22:56.189 --> 00:23:00.099
which isn't, you know, entirely without merit as a,

426
00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:03.290
as a, as a, you know, political philosophical idea.

427
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.780
But if you do that, it's always going to

428
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.989
be a, a fairly crap kind of freedom to,

429
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.660
to put it bluntly because if you're in a

430
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.790
competitive um situation, you'll always have one eye over

431
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.380
your shoulder to see who's coming for you and

432
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.719
you will entirely define your freedom according to a

433
00:23:21.729 --> 00:23:26.420
set of status symbols or acquisitions that, you know,

434
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.979
really are not designed to maximize anybody's freedom, they're

435
00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:33.770
maximized. Uh They're designed to ensure that a few

436
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.540
people have a lot of ability to do a

437
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.810
lot of things and a lot of people have

438
00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:41.689
very little ability to do very much. So, I

439
00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:46.000
suppose that's my reason for favoring um, the social

440
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.650
side. Plus I just think actually it's so much

441
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.910
more creative and fun and more interesting honestly to

442
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.310
have more people um standing sort of eye to

443
00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:58.709
eye, shoulder to shoulder, no kind of artificial divisions

444
00:23:58.719 --> 00:24:02.069
or barriers between them and actually challenging ourselves to

445
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:04.140
see what it is to live with people without

446
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.869
kind of having to resort to um sort of

447
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.280
imaginary barriers for why we shouldn't take someone more

448
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.849
seriously or as seriously as we take ourselves. So

449
00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:17.310
I just think it would lead to a more

450
00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:19.310
interesting life frankly.

451
00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:24.050
So, let's talk now then about anarchism because I

452
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.819
think that probably there are many common misconceptions that

453
00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:32.579
people have about anarchism and many times they equate

454
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:39.339
anarchism to chaos basically, right? So um w what

455
00:24:39.349 --> 00:24:42.739
would you say are the main tenets of anarchism?

456
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.260
And since you mentioned liberty there, uh do you

457
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.660
think that liberty is also part of it? And

458
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.319
if so how does it manifest specifically in anarchism?

459
00:24:53.609 --> 00:24:58.569
So, um again, great question, anarchism itself. It's quite

460
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:01.949
simple. The word is, I mean, first words don't

461
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:04.119
have to be last words, but generally speaking, it's

462
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.089
quite useful just to go back to, well, what

463
00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.290
does that word actually mean? What, what, what is

464
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.790
this word? Because anarchist, you, you won't be surprised

465
00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:14.560
to hear are very anarchic. So each of them

466
00:25:14.569 --> 00:25:16.630
will be there an anarchist in their very own

467
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.810
special way. What on earth can bring anyone together

468
00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:23.829
around a collective term? Well, this notion anarchism, which

469
00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:28.910
is basically absence of permanent authority. Now, that's, that's

470
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.339
it, that's kind of all it all it starts

471
00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:34.479
by. Um THAT'S all it's committing you to me.

472
00:25:34.719 --> 00:25:38.189
OK. OK. That's actually enough. That's quite a massive

473
00:25:38.199 --> 00:25:40.910
philosophy in and of itself. All right, cos it,

474
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.300
it opens up so many other questions. So you

475
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.390
mentioned liberty in some ways, I think it this

476
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.469
that position in and of itself just that rejection

477
00:25:50.479 --> 00:25:54.069
of any sort of permanent authority. And I deliberately

478
00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:57.579
use the word permanent because um there are plenty

479
00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:00.510
of forms of anarchism which might accept temporary forms

480
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.060
of leadership, just nothing that becomes institutionalized or permanent.

481
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:10.020
Um Others, others are, are far more puritanical about

482
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.829
that. But let's, let's just keep flexible for now.

483
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.489
Um If you're not gonna have any sort of

484
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.349
permanent authority, then that kind of automatically puts you

485
00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:22.290
in a position of strong non-interference, which we would

486
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.469
all be familiar from those of us who study

487
00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:27.689
kind of normative political theory, that's the negative definition

488
00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:31.530
of liberty. Um So the idea that, you know,

489
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.780
what we're looking for is uh a position that

490
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:40.199
maximizes individual freedoms. Um And that's the kind of

491
00:26:40.209 --> 00:26:42.459
fun thing about anarchism for me. So I think

492
00:26:42.469 --> 00:26:45.699
liberty, I think so we've got lack of permanent

493
00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:49.959
authority. So therefore, um this question of a strong

494
00:26:49.969 --> 00:26:54.130
or a maximum amount of in of liberty, um

495
00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:57.859
let's say individual liberty is present. So from that,

496
00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:00.400
that's it, that's, that's all that you're kind of,

497
00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:02.390
you know, that's all you have to sign up

498
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.010
for in order to, to, to be an anarchist.

499
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.589
If you like now, where it gets really fun

500
00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.949
is the fact, um, really fun but really complicated

501
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.369
is that after that the kind of positive program,

502
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.209
what kind, what are you gonna do with your

503
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:18.089
liberty? You know, what, what does it look like?

504
00:27:18.099 --> 00:27:19.449
How does it feel to you? Do you even

505
00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:21.900
want to decide that at all? Um, DO you,

506
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.579
do you have, you know, do you have ideas

507
00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:26.849
about how everyone can get this liberty or do

508
00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:28.579
you think that's not really up to you to

509
00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:31.319
solve? You only need to fight for, you know,

510
00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:33.599
you fight for one individual's liberty and that's enough,

511
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.069
the positive program. Like, what are you gonna do

512
00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:41.219
with it? That is really massively open to interpretation.

513
00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:43.939
One of the things anarchism is criticized for, but

514
00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:45.689
I think you, you can equally see it as

515
00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:49.030
a great strength. So it's simultaneously both is the

516
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.189
fact that it does splinter off into so many

517
00:27:51.199 --> 00:27:53.469
different subcategories. I mean, you only had to go

518
00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:56.390
on Wikipedia for 10 minutes. Um And there's, there's

519
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.699
a narcos socialist, there's narco feminists, there's narco ecologists

520
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.349
and then that, that's just layer one. That's just

521
00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:07.060
your uh da da da second order anarchism, right?

522
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.089
You can have 3rd, 4th, 5th because you can

523
00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:13.349
have, well, I'm an a narco feminist radical socialist,

524
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:15.739
but only on Wednesday because on Thursday, I'm with

525
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.449
the individualists and you know, you can do that.

526
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.339
It's, it's um you can have so much fun

527
00:28:21.349 --> 00:28:23.270
trying to work out what kind of an anarchist

528
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.979
you are today that you actually never get around

529
00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:29.319
to doing anything, which is the criticism. Um But

530
00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:32.599
nevertheless, I think on a very baseline, you as

531
00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:35.699
an anarchist would always stand up and resist the

532
00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:40.199
idea of any of the further encroachment of any

533
00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:43.060
form of permanent authority on your life. So that's

534
00:28:43.069 --> 00:28:45.390
what would bring us all together at a rally.

535
00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:47.859
Not much else just that.

536
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.459
OK. But with that in mind, let me ask

537
00:28:51.469 --> 00:28:56.030
you, then do you think that anarchism allows for

538
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.859
any form at all of hierarchy? Even if it's

539
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:04.939
just, let's say a fluid or informal hierarchy, if

540
00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:10.020
it's not someone uh on the top imposing necessarily

541
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.849
things on other people or even restricting their liberty

542
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:17.650
in any particular way. But just let's say to

543
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.189
orient society, to organize society, something like that.

544
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.479
I'll talk for the kind of anarchism I defend

545
00:29:25.489 --> 00:29:28.910
because I know that plenty of um these sort

546
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.270
of people who identify with anarchist ideas would answer

547
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.640
this, this quite differently. I mean, just to give

548
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.829
you AAA flavor of it, I mean, there would

549
00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:40.430
be some that would say, no, you can actually

550
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.660
um approach society in a way where you'd never

551
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.410
have to have any sort of leadership. I mean,

552
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.150
the anarcho, the, the, the sort of very, very

553
00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:54.640
um purist uh an Arco Communist position, for example,

554
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.489
would say you could structurally design society in a

555
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.790
way that nobody would ever assume positions of, of,

556
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.390
of leadership or authority. Now, my response to that

557
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.880
because I'm not an narco communist, um as we

558
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.939
mentioned, not so fond of joining things. Um But

559
00:30:14.949 --> 00:30:16.900
uh s so my response is that will be

560
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.579
ok, but someone has still had to take the

561
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:23.810
authority um to decide what that, you know, completely

562
00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:27.420
egalitarian design looks like someone's then got to impose

563
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.910
it. And even if in the long run, we'd

564
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.640
all love it and it would be perfect and

565
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.314
we'd all be so much happier. We might not

566
00:30:34.324 --> 00:30:36.435
in the short term. And that's always a, a

567
00:30:36.444 --> 00:30:39.535
means and an ends question that is important in

568
00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:42.555
anarchism. Like, can you ever force people to be

569
00:30:42.564 --> 00:30:46.175
free? I think the, the, the, the answer, the

570
00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:48.885
anarchist answer for me is no, you can't. Um

571
00:30:48.895 --> 00:30:53.525
So, so yes, uh you can have forms of

572
00:30:53.535 --> 00:30:56.824
anarchism which would completely sort of reject any form

573
00:30:56.834 --> 00:31:02.189
of um authority, leadership, et cetera. I think actually

574
00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:05.939
there's n it's not incompatible with anarchy to say

575
00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:08.689
that there are some, sometimes, actually there are people

576
00:31:08.699 --> 00:31:12.119
who are just, um because I would also rather

577
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.689
work with people than structures or systems. My anarchism's

578
00:31:15.699 --> 00:31:18.890
about taking people seriously and if there's a moment

579
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.319
where there are people who certain groups of people,

580
00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:25.170
certain individuals who are clearly much better suited to,

581
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.300
to lead on something, maybe they know more about

582
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.699
it, maybe they're more confident, um Maybe it's familiar

583
00:31:30.709 --> 00:31:34.079
to them, whatever the reason my problem would be

584
00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:38.930
if that then became permanent and institutionalized. That to

585
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.219
me is a problem because that would mean that

586
00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:43.030
at some point you will have issues that those

587
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.030
people are not the best suited to deal with

588
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.430
and yet they would deal with it at the

589
00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:50.520
expense of others who were more confident, more, more

590
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.349
knowledgeable, et cetera. So I think my version of

591
00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:58.390
anarchism says, um anarchism is, you know, that the

592
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.689
absence of permanent authority should mean that you're able

593
00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:06.469
to negotiate and invent or create the right response

594
00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:09.869
to the situation you find yourself in and not

595
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.310
just gonna continually have to defer to a structure

596
00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.000
or to a form of leadership that isn't going

597
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.420
away regardless of whether it's right for right now

598
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.550
or not. So, yeah, that, that, that does lead

599
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.939
me into some tricky ones. I mean, for example,

600
00:32:24.949 --> 00:32:27.060
with the green issue right now, a lot of

601
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:30.180
people feel that the only way we would get

602
00:32:30.189 --> 00:32:33.099
quick enough along the road to solve our problems.

603
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.729
So do the things that we, we are being

604
00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:39.119
advised we need to do to keep at 1.5

605
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.739
or, or not exceed that too, too excessively that

606
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.790
many people feel. Right. Well, we're just going to

607
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.239
need a kind of green green dictatorship for a

608
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.709
while that we're just gonna have to force these

609
00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:54.949
um measures on people. I'd say no, no, that's

610
00:32:54.959 --> 00:32:57.430
not, that's not what I'm talking about. I do

611
00:32:57.439 --> 00:33:01.239
understand why people would feel that, you know, you,

612
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.939
you need to have more force at some time

613
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.910
time than others. What I would say is right

614
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.150
now, we do need to be giving far more

615
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.189
prominence and far more platforms to the, to people

616
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:16.790
who really understand what's going, what's going on, environmentally,

617
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.949
ecologically, how that intersects with our lives, our, you

618
00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:23.229
know, the, um the economy, the, our general way

619
00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:27.339
of living society. So it might be that those

620
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:30.430
people shouldn't, you know, shouldn't always be in the

621
00:33:30.439 --> 00:33:33.109
spotlight forever and ever more, but they need to

622
00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:33.869
be right now.

623
00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:37.420
Mhm. No. Uh, YOU know, one of the reasons

624
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.790
why I asked you that question, I think you

625
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.250
would be open to this kind of evidence, let's

626
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.869
say, because I've talked with many anthropologists on the

627
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.770
show and sometimes about these particular questions. Uh, IS

628
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.729
that, for example, even in more traditional societies like

629
00:33:55.739 --> 00:33:59.339
hunter gatherers, for example, and the more egalitarian ones,

630
00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:02.569
it seems that even if you don't want to

631
00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:07.022
call them necessarily, there's, there's always a few figures

632
00:34:07.032 --> 00:34:10.072
there are, there are that have at least more

633
00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:13.502
authority than most of the other people there. I

634
00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:17.772
mean, in egalitarian societies, of course, they are egalitarian

635
00:34:17.782 --> 00:34:21.272
in terms of resource distribution, let's say. And also

636
00:34:21.362 --> 00:34:24.242
in terms of everyone there being able to have

637
00:34:24.252 --> 00:34:27.672
a voice and participating in decision making. But still

638
00:34:27.683 --> 00:34:31.772
there are always a few figures there. Like, I

639
00:34:31.782 --> 00:34:35.496
don't know, perhaps the best hunter, the, the shaman

640
00:34:35.505 --> 00:34:39.485
and people like that, who in particular areas have

641
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:43.355
more authority and they also sometimes even participate in

642
00:34:43.364 --> 00:34:46.614
conflict resolution. Like for example, if there's a conflict

643
00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:49.926
between two people, they step in to try to

644
00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:52.614
solve it, they say, OK, so stop it. Let's

645
00:34:52.625 --> 00:34:55.735
talk, let's try to, to solve this according to

646
00:34:55.746 --> 00:34:58.456
our norms here and stuff like that. So, uh,

647
00:34:58.466 --> 00:35:00.595
I mean, what I'm trying to say with this

648
00:35:00.605 --> 00:35:04.850
is that, uh I, I'm, I'm not completely close

649
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:10.260
to the possibility of we having a society with

650
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.179
no authority and lo no leadership at all. But

651
00:35:14.189 --> 00:35:19.379
it's just that even in those more egalitarian traditional

652
00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:23.449
societies, it's II, I don't think that there's anyone

653
00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:26.965
out, any of those is out there where you

654
00:35:26.975 --> 00:35:31.245
can't find any sort of authority or leadership at

655
00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:31.465
all.

656
00:35:31.475 --> 00:35:33.965
I think you're right. And there are two ideas

657
00:35:33.975 --> 00:35:35.544
of what you've just said has sort of, um

658
00:35:35.554 --> 00:35:38.485
um reminded me of or, or spark or sparked

659
00:35:38.495 --> 00:35:42.205
to me. Uh I think firstly, what's, what, what

660
00:35:42.215 --> 00:35:45.104
I'm really interested in is, is that authority which

661
00:35:45.114 --> 00:35:47.925
is so responsive to the moment. I think a

662
00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:50.760
lot of my problem. And I think again, this

663
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.590
goes back to our, our issue with antiquity and

664
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.250
why philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, they seemed to

665
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.209
always want to. Well, not, not Aristotle actually. Well,

666
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:02.340
he's, he's a different, oh, bracket Aristotle. But now

667
00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.429
Plato, certainly there's a timelessness about Plato wanting to

668
00:36:06.439 --> 00:36:10.550
transcend the moment, the, the kind of messy, right,

669
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.030
what's happening right now in the present, always looking

670
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.149
outward, you know, to this sort of um universal,

671
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:21.129
timeless perfection and, and, you know, that's the instinct

672
00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:23.959
to strive towards it actually, what, what you're describing

673
00:36:23.969 --> 00:36:26.959
about with the kind of, um, sort of uh

674
00:36:26.979 --> 00:36:31.340
egalitarian type tribes or even non egalitarian, whether they

675
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.639
would see themselves that way. Who knows? Um, BUT

676
00:36:34.649 --> 00:36:38.780
it's that complete attention to the present and people

677
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.659
being able to command a certain amount of, you

678
00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:43.679
might call it authority. You might just call it

679
00:36:43.689 --> 00:36:48.479
sort of compelling presence or perhaps certain people resonate

680
00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:51.110
more at different times than others because they are

681
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.050
so responsive to the moment. And I think we've

682
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.199
been so busy trying to pursue and, and maybe

683
00:36:57.209 --> 00:37:00.449
a lot and political science, uh does this an

684
00:37:00.459 --> 00:37:02.260
awful lot, you know, in terms of trying to

685
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.820
kind of, if we get this perfect theory of

686
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.080
how power works and how to do it, we

687
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.330
can almost uncouple ourselves from context from time and

688
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.169
place. And I feel that whenever you try and

689
00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:16.770
make power or authority permanent, what you're basically trying

690
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.949
to do is outrun the world outrun time inspector

691
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.639
and you can't. Um And that, that's what makes

692
00:37:24.649 --> 00:37:27.610
it toxic. That's what makes it, um, um a

693
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.929
problem. So actually there's no problem at all for

694
00:37:30.939 --> 00:37:34.149
me having sort of people who emerge and they

695
00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:37.229
say things that click, they might not. It's not

696
00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:40.290
necessarily about, they have the answers to our questions,

697
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.290
but they give us tools that allow us to

698
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.189
do things that get us closer to, to feeling

699
00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:49.379
more comfortable, safer. Um, YOU know, and, and that

700
00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:51.050
can be a really, that can be a wonderful

701
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.959
thing if, if they are truly sincerely, you know,

702
00:37:54.969 --> 00:37:58.520
sort of true experts and true, have true understanding

703
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.139
or, or have true compassion, maybe that's the correct

704
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.629
word. But it can also, you know, because we're

705
00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:09.280
so desperate because we are so desperate for those

706
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.120
voices who are actually listening to our problems and

707
00:38:12.129 --> 00:38:17.639
responding back to them that actually we're finding people

708
00:38:17.649 --> 00:38:20.879
who have not got the full compassion, the full

709
00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:24.040
understanding, but who are going through the motions of

710
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:28.719
responding to people, people's wishes. And that's, well, basically,

711
00:38:28.729 --> 00:38:30.860
I'm, I'm, I'm talking about the rise of right

712
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.280
wing populism here. Um It's very easy for those

713
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.120
and get me back to our left and right

714
00:38:36.129 --> 00:38:40.139
um here. But it's very easy for those on

715
00:38:40.149 --> 00:38:42.340
the broader left, shall we say to, to be

716
00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:45.830
horrified, are mystified by the rise of right wing

717
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.120
poli uh politics across Europe um across the world

718
00:38:50.409 --> 00:38:51.919
and say, how is this happening? How is this

719
00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:55.770
happening? Does this mean that apart from this small

720
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.159
relative minority of intellectual elites, that actually everyone's just

721
00:39:00.169 --> 00:39:03.379
a sort of closet fascist waiting to break out?

722
00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:06.570
No, it doesn't. It means that what those people

723
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.445
on the right, whether it's totally cynical and strategic

724
00:39:10.455 --> 00:39:12.935
or whether actually it comes from some kind of

725
00:39:12.945 --> 00:39:17.514
genuine attempt to identify with, with human, very human

726
00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:21.495
fears and insecurities, what they're doing is they're saying

727
00:39:21.514 --> 00:39:27.469
your politics isn't listening. We're listening, we're listening and,

728
00:39:27.479 --> 00:39:29.959
and we're gonna respond to what you're frightened about.

729
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.699
They're not gonna do it in an open minded,

730
00:39:32.709 --> 00:39:37.479
compassionate, you know, um, way particularly they're gonna do

731
00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:40.530
it for their own gain. But nevertheless, it's something

732
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.500
they're doing that that maybe the other side, the

733
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:48.409
other big um political players are not um doing

734
00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.760
but, but returning to your, to your, to the

735
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.419
issue about um so that just sort of maybe

736
00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:57.389
addresses that kind of lingering danger of demagoguery, which

737
00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:00.360
is always available when you're talking about any kind

738
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.729
of sort of spontaneous or charismatic approaches to leadership.

739
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.639
Nevertheless, so um leaders who speak to the moment

740
00:40:08.649 --> 00:40:12.800
I think are important and useful um provided that

741
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.000
what they say to that moment is genuinely gonna

742
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.080
get us closer to where we want to be

743
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.550
rather than, rather than seem to do that. But

744
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.949
actually take us further away. The other thing is

745
00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:27.989
um just rethinking what we mean by leadership anyway,

746
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.979
sometimes leadership is what you're saying. When you mentioned

747
00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:35.780
people who do mediation or who facilitate conversations, that's

748
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.110
actually a really interesting variety of leadership. It's much

749
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.290
more interesting, ironically, um much more sort of in

750
00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:44.324
enthusiasm for it in the private sector and in

751
00:40:44.334 --> 00:40:47.885
business um where OK, you get used to having

752
00:40:47.895 --> 00:40:49.895
the big sort of dragons and what have you

753
00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:52.004
who go out there and clinch the deal. But

754
00:40:52.014 --> 00:40:56.145
actually what most corporations rely on is the sort

755
00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:59.514
of as much co, sort of collective or group

756
00:40:59.524 --> 00:41:03.114
intelligence as possible and that person who can tap

757
00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:05.939
into that and unlock it and unleash it becomes

758
00:41:05.949 --> 00:41:08.889
the more valuable leader than the one simply barking

759
00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:12.870
instructions. So, different types of leadership and leadership that's

760
00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:14.780
responsive to time and place.

761
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.610
Yeah, I, I mean, what I was trying to

762
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.620
highlight with that is that uh usually in conflict

763
00:41:21.629 --> 00:41:27.000
resolution, for example, people have to respect the person

764
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.899
who steps in and if they respect him or

765
00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:33.659
her, it's because he knows more, he has more

766
00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:36.459
status, something like that or otherwise. I mean, it's

767
00:41:36.469 --> 00:41:40.254
just an exact equal. And so I don't know

768
00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.344
if it works. But the other thing I would

769
00:41:42.354 --> 00:41:44.584
like to mention as well is that, for example,

770
00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:49.774
in those kinds of egalitarian traditional societies, even if

771
00:41:49.784 --> 00:41:53.784
there's a best hunter, for example, he might catch

772
00:41:53.794 --> 00:41:56.334
the big animal, but then he comes back to

773
00:41:56.344 --> 00:41:59.064
the tribe and the s to share it, to

774
00:41:59.074 --> 00:42:01.764
share the meat with the other people, at least

775
00:42:01.774 --> 00:42:05.969
to some extent. And also another thing that I,

776
00:42:05.979 --> 00:42:08.560
I'm not sure at all if it would work

777
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:13.429
in bigger scale societies. But I if the people

778
00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:16.500
who are considered the authorities or the leaders uh

779
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.780
start or become bullies, for example, and start mi

780
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.639
mistreating other people, then uh they basically get put

781
00:42:25.649 --> 00:42:29.885
down and sometimes in extreme ways, like if they,

782
00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:32.975
if things get really messy, they might even get

783
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:36.485
killed. So, I mean, that's perhaps another way of

784
00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:37.895
more wrestling

785
00:42:38.495 --> 00:42:40.985
part of anarchism. You, you get to kill the

786
00:42:40.995 --> 00:42:43.905
bad leaders. Um But no, it's interesting you say

787
00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:45.304
that and you sort of make the, and it's

788
00:42:45.314 --> 00:42:48.745
an important distinction there. You know, again, anarchists had

789
00:42:48.754 --> 00:42:51.405
this habit of looking back to these prehistorical times

790
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.669
or digging up this tribe that used to live

791
00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:55.699
by love alone and all that sort of thing.

792
00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:58.469
And we were like, well, that's nice. However, we

793
00:42:58.479 --> 00:43:02.270
live in an incredibly um economically and politically complex

794
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.909
society. I actually think one interesting way to look

795
00:43:04.919 --> 00:43:07.889
at that is that again, we've, we've talked about

796
00:43:07.899 --> 00:43:10.810
how things change, evolution, history of things and the

797
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.689
kind of late modern moment that we're at, at

798
00:43:12.699 --> 00:43:14.550
the moment there would have been a point 19th

799
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.245
century, early 20th, early to about the mid 20th

800
00:43:17.254 --> 00:43:21.544
century where the state kind of modern organization economically,

801
00:43:21.554 --> 00:43:24.665
politically, socially was such that you're quite right. You

802
00:43:24.675 --> 00:43:27.114
know, the, the very notion that you'd head back

803
00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:30.054
to the village and or whatever was, was patently

804
00:43:30.064 --> 00:43:32.395
ridiculous. And the only sort of use it served

805
00:43:32.405 --> 00:43:35.155
was to show that once and in some situations,

806
00:43:35.165 --> 00:43:37.794
it is quite possible that you would have um

807
00:43:37.804 --> 00:43:41.439
social orders driven by Cooper operation. Actually. Now we've

808
00:43:41.449 --> 00:43:43.760
almost come back full circle. We are uh you

809
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.610
know, things have become so big and so globalized

810
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.850
and so unwieldy, unwieldy that it could actually be

811
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.429
the one moment where a kind of neo or

812
00:43:53.439 --> 00:43:57.530
remixed or redux if you will, um sort of

813
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.719
version of those kind of societies becomes much more

814
00:44:00.729 --> 00:44:04.969
plausible because actually the idea that these central control

815
00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:08.445
spaces like the nations they are for down, they,

816
00:44:08.455 --> 00:44:11.804
they're not granular enough, these problems that we're facing

817
00:44:11.814 --> 00:44:15.754
are universal, but they're also incredibly localized. So suddenly,

818
00:44:15.764 --> 00:44:17.705
I think we're back at a point and it's

819
00:44:17.715 --> 00:44:21.084
interesting, the first thing that the new Labour government

820
00:44:21.094 --> 00:44:24.504
have done on taking power in Britain is say

821
00:44:24.514 --> 00:44:27.564
we need to talk far more about devolution. This

822
00:44:27.574 --> 00:44:29.885
idea that actually you could go back to more

823
00:44:29.895 --> 00:44:33.004
Federated models where actually people are living and doing

824
00:44:33.014 --> 00:44:36.510
things on quite small scale, you know, but, but

825
00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.409
always part of wider networks and all that sort

826
00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:42.270
of thing, maybe we're actually at a point where

827
00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.100
a new or revised version of that is more

828
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.590
plausible than it would have been 100 years ago.

829
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.399
Mhm. So I would like to ask you now

830
00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:54.120
and perhaps this will also make a segue into

831
00:44:54.129 --> 00:44:56.739
the last topic I want to address here today.

832
00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.379
Having to do with the enlightenment and liberalism. How

833
00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:03.580
uh because you sort of have a foot in

834
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.229
each of these camps, how do you look at

835
00:45:06.239 --> 00:45:09.639
the relationship between history and politics?

836
00:45:09.649 --> 00:45:13.820
Oh, that's that's a very good question. Um I

837
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.189
would try not to, to, to uh ramble too

838
00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:22.294
much. Um So obviously, II, I mean, I ob

839
00:45:22.304 --> 00:45:24.975
obviously I'm going to say that there's a very

840
00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:28.104
strong reciprocal relation there. In fact, there are many,

841
00:45:28.114 --> 00:45:32.504
many kinds of um relationship. I think history is

842
00:45:32.514 --> 00:45:36.074
incredibly important to my thinking through politics and always

843
00:45:36.084 --> 00:45:38.639
has been um for some of the reasons that

844
00:45:38.649 --> 00:45:41.719
we've, we've touched upon. Um FOR me, it was

845
00:45:41.729 --> 00:45:44.209
impossible to think of his uh politics in quite

846
00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:47.560
the vacuum, in quite the entirely theorized or philosophical

847
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.110
way. It always felt it always felt slightly wrong.

848
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.590
Um Frankly, it like, um that it was just

849
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.780
missing too much information. So I think, why, why

850
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.780
history became so important to me? And I kept

851
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.209
going back to it because I kept trying to

852
00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:05.979
escape. Um As I was sort of studying and

853
00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:08.790
what have you II, I sort of first, my

854
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.439
first instinct was philosophy. Um And then I thought

855
00:46:12.449 --> 00:46:14.939
of, OK, well, that's, that's kind of missing some

856
00:46:14.949 --> 00:46:16.840
of the power play there. So I better, I

857
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.020
better shift towards politics. I did a stint in

858
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:23.080
the Anthropology Corridor. Honestly, in my, in my undergraduate

859
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.500
degree, I worked my way up and down the

860
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.919
humanities corridor before I finally chose a degree. But

861
00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:30.949
I kept coming back to history because in some

862
00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:33.120
ways, history allowed me to do all of those

863
00:46:33.129 --> 00:46:36.000
things. It allowed me to look at how people

864
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:39.719
negotiate the interplay of their vested interests, which is

865
00:46:39.729 --> 00:46:42.709
how I define politics. It allowed me to look

866
00:46:42.719 --> 00:46:45.360
at how people conceptualize the world and how they

867
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.500
then choose to take actions on the basis of

868
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:52.689
that philosophy, how people sort of live together, whether

869
00:46:52.699 --> 00:46:55.719
or not they're intending or planning it. That's um

870
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.129
that's anthropology, history. Let me do all that, but

871
00:46:59.139 --> 00:47:01.449
it allowed me to do something extra which was

872
00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:05.620
situate this all in context. Now again, it's sort

873
00:47:05.629 --> 00:47:08.100
of interesting the historicism debates and this is a

874
00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:11.570
big feature of European philosophy like Hegel Marx people

875
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.090
like that, that actually, you know, kind of once

876
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.709
we get the knack of how history is unfolding,

877
00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.899
you know, then we can align our lives to

878
00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:21.712
that and that actually will all be there the

879
00:47:21.722 --> 00:47:24.302
better off for, for going in the right direction

880
00:47:24.312 --> 00:47:28.042
as it were that kind of history, politics, relationships

881
00:47:28.052 --> 00:47:30.173
never made any sense to me. I am one

882
00:47:30.183 --> 00:47:33.262
of the one thing after another school of thought,

883
00:47:33.272 --> 00:47:37.262
lots of little connections, no inevitability about it. And

884
00:47:37.272 --> 00:47:40.343
context has always been really important to me because

885
00:47:40.353 --> 00:47:42.742
it actually shows how even when we think things

886
00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:47.516
look very continuous. Um THE the devils in the

887
00:47:47.525 --> 00:47:50.125
details, actually, the small shifts that we have to

888
00:47:50.135 --> 00:47:52.516
make in order to accommodate the problems that we're

889
00:47:52.525 --> 00:47:55.246
encountering in the here and now make all the

890
00:47:55.256 --> 00:47:58.845
difference. And therefore, it seems so odd to me

891
00:47:58.855 --> 00:48:01.476
to just study the history like so many history

892
00:48:01.486 --> 00:48:05.226
to this day. Uh Political philosophy textbooks will plod

893
00:48:05.236 --> 00:48:09.196
you through this history of ideas, um, completely denuded

894
00:48:09.206 --> 00:48:12.629
of the sort of rich kind of comings and

895
00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:15.229
goings and toing and froing that were, were shaping

896
00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:17.270
all these thinkers and, and their thoughts and, and

897
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.290
when you put those back in, um again, we've

898
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.770
discussed how some terminology like left and right gets

899
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.889
a little bit loose, a bit bit slippery when

900
00:48:25.899 --> 00:48:29.669
you're really up close to it. And that's possibly

901
00:48:29.679 --> 00:48:31.709
most of the joy for me. So, I mean,

902
00:48:31.719 --> 00:48:34.510
I draw the very self serving conclusion that if

903
00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.360
you study history and politics in conjunction, you can

904
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:40.750
only be an anarchist because it shows that any

905
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.030
taking too hard or firm a position on anything.

906
00:48:44.219 --> 00:48:48.250
Um And not recognizing the sort of very many

907
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.449
different possibilities that might have come about the different

908
00:48:51.459 --> 00:48:54.909
kind of scenarios that we could equally have easily

909
00:48:54.919 --> 00:48:58.899
found ourselves living in the what ifs the maybes,

910
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.050
you know, all that's really rich and really exciting.

911
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.870
Um It goes very much against a culture that's

912
00:49:04.879 --> 00:49:08.469
constantly looking for certainty and solidity. Um And that's

913
00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:10.840
something I think, you know, we need to, we

914
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.280
need to maybe address about ourselves. Why does our

915
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:17.370
craving for certainty actually leave us facing a more

916
00:49:17.379 --> 00:49:20.929
catastrophic uncertainty than if we just embrace the fact,

917
00:49:20.939 --> 00:49:23.780
we cannot know and control everything all of the

918
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.229
time. Looking at it the other way though, of

919
00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:30.830
course, um History is always a political intervention of,

920
00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.350
you know, what, whatever you try and claim about

921
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.270
it, whatever um aspirations you have for objectivity as

922
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.929
a historian. Um And to me, that's absolutely fine

923
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:44.340
and just as exciting to do provided you just

924
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.590
acknowledge that frankly. Now, um in the sphere of

925
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.899
politics, history has been used shamelessly left and right

926
00:49:50.909 --> 00:49:53.830
continually, I've gotta say the right seem to be

927
00:49:53.919 --> 00:49:55.840
do it better in terms of they're able to

928
00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:59.620
produce very compelling mythical histories, like histories of this

929
00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:02.060
is who we are as a people. We are,

930
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.300
we are, we, they are them, you know, that

931
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.280
they're sort of a very handy technique. The left's

932
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:10.500
always been to its sort of, um, to its

933
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.429
credit but also to its disservice. It's always been

934
00:50:13.439 --> 00:50:16.120
a little bit maybe more discerning about who the

935
00:50:16.129 --> 00:50:19.520
THEMS and USS are. It's never quite managed to

936
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:23.189
pro provide the same equally compelling myth of the

937
00:50:23.199 --> 00:50:26.850
people. Although it, we've seen interesting examples like, um

938
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.800
in Stalinist, Russia or Stalinist Soviet Union, I should

939
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.600
say where you do see similar type attempts to

940
00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:37.300
manufacture these or the invention of a tr tradition,

941
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.969
the invention of our, our sort of people and,

942
00:50:40.979 --> 00:50:45.679
and their identity. Um I think when you sort

943
00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:48.489
of put yourself through that professional training to, I

944
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.300
mean, all that really means when you are a

945
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:53.649
sort of professional historian as, as I am, what

946
00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:56.909
that really means is that you, you sort of

947
00:50:56.919 --> 00:51:00.229
cultivate your skepticism as it were. That's essentially when

948
00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:02.219
you do it sort of when that's what you

949
00:51:02.229 --> 00:51:05.439
are training yourself to do. So, actually I had

950
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.959
a professor quite early on in my career. Tell

951
00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:10.590
me, well, you'll know when you're a, a real

952
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.439
historian when no matter what the issue is, you

953
00:51:13.449 --> 00:51:17.610
come down very firmly on the fence every time.

954
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.889
Um, BUT even that is a political intervention because

955
00:51:21.899 --> 00:51:25.360
what that's asking us to do is wait and

956
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.840
diffuse for a moment. And actually that is still

957
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.830
a political stance. It's a political move to make.

958
00:51:31.879 --> 00:51:35.000
Um And again, it's sort of maybe heading back

959
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.540
to what you were saying about that sort of

960
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:40.189
leadership that mediates as well as advances. It's saying,

961
00:51:40.199 --> 00:51:43.350
wait, let's look around us, let's take a moment,

962
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.280
you know, to, to kind of see the lay

963
00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:48.550
of the land and not make too many quick

964
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.020
decisions that are too um too limited in terms

965
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.189
of their understanding.

966
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.899
Mhm. Ok. So for the last topic, then let

967
00:51:58.909 --> 00:52:03.729
me ask you, what is your take on Steven

968
00:52:03.739 --> 00:52:09.689
Pinker s take on the enlightenment, liberalism and his

969
00:52:09.699 --> 00:52:13.925
narrative of progressivism. And perhaps uh at some point,

970
00:52:13.935 --> 00:52:17.804
we might insert here or go back to what

971
00:52:17.814 --> 00:52:20.854
I put the pin on earlier. That was, that

972
00:52:20.864 --> 00:52:23.685
had to do with Kropotkin and Graber and the

973
00:52:23.695 --> 00:52:27.995
anthropologists. But uh gi give us perhaps a first

974
00:52:28.004 --> 00:52:28.915
answer to that.

975
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.449
Sure. Well, um I don't know if you know,

976
00:52:32.459 --> 00:52:35.100
know this, but actually the pleasure of um media.

977
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:40.060
I I chaired mediated an interview refereed. I'm not

978
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:43.489
sure what you call it with. Um Steven Steven

979
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.250
Pinker um not long ago and he was uh

980
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.679
facing anniversary from political science who was, who was

981
00:52:48.689 --> 00:52:51.979
um as you might expect, uh challenging him on

982
00:52:51.989 --> 00:52:56.040
his, his claim that uh actually, since from the

983
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.399
en the Enlightenment project was a good project and

984
00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:01.679
actually far from sort of collapsing, deflating, falling on

985
00:53:01.689 --> 00:53:04.820
its backside, we have continued to advance progress is

986
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.260
not just a myth, it's something we can unti

987
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.040
firely say about ourselves. And I was in the

988
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.840
position of chair. So I had to keep my

989
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:15.449
um mouth zipped whilst he was saying what I

990
00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:19.560
consider to be quite provocative um things. But um

991
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:23.149
yeah, so on the reflection, uh so Steven Pinker,

992
00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.929
I think actually, there's a lot to admire about

993
00:53:25.939 --> 00:53:29.580
his argument mostly because I just love anyone who's

994
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:34.429
antino meum enough to, to kind of upset what's

995
00:53:34.439 --> 00:53:37.479
become a kind of popular tourism, right? We uh

996
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.820
Stephen was working during the sort of a period

997
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.389
of time of eighties nineties into the two thousands.

998
00:53:43.399 --> 00:53:45.760
You know, that was the sort of early part

999
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.510
of his career when um you know, that, that

1000
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.649
it was the most fashionable thing to do in

1001
00:53:51.659 --> 00:53:55.149
the academy was laugh and dismiss and s you

1002
00:53:55.159 --> 00:53:58.739
know, sneer at the progress myth and how those

1003
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.429
poor deluded Victorians have bought this ridiculous thing. And,

1004
00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:06.159
and obviously this completely ignored slavery, completely ignored racial

1005
00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:09.899
inequality, completely ignored sexual inequality and sexuality inequality. And

1006
00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:12.550
basically you were, it was progressive for a teeny,

1007
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.379
tiny handful of white middle class. Um Protestant, well,

1008
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.590
in the anglo sense, men, um and I think

1009
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.280
it was quite refreshing for him to go. Well,

1010
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.540
hang on a minute. No, wait, it's very easy

1011
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:33.800
to bash modernity and modern life and um very

1012
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:37.040
kind of seductive to look back because it wasn't

1013
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.679
just the left that were doing it, the right

1014
00:54:38.689 --> 00:54:40.840
were, of course. So we had the kind of

1015
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.219
nostalgia industry ramped up in the 19 eighties. And

1016
00:54:44.229 --> 00:54:46.310
don't you remember when it was all lovely? And

1017
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.399
the Squire was at his gate and the peasants

1018
00:54:48.409 --> 00:54:50.050
were in the garden and it was all very

1019
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.600
jolly never happened. But, you know, wasn't it lovely

1020
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:58.350
when it did? Um So there's a boldness in

1021
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.310
that argument and it's also, it's asking us to,

1022
00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.530
to actually kind of all right. It might not

1023
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.919
feel great now. But what, what do facts tell

1024
00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:07.760
us how, how do we, how do we kind

1025
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.870
of, how might we arrange this? And I think

1026
00:55:09.879 --> 00:55:14.030
he does make some, some valuable and valid points.

1027
00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:20.620
Um His, his sort of idea that uh we,

1028
00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:22.649
we so by progress, I think we ought to

1029
00:55:22.659 --> 00:55:25.870
qualify. He's talking as much about kind of intellectual,

1030
00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:28.949
moral progress, not just the fact that we can

1031
00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:32.350
cook things faster or, you know, we can propel

1032
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.909
ourselves across, you know, distance fast, these are forms

1033
00:55:35.919 --> 00:55:39.629
of progress, but they're not really, they don't change

1034
00:55:39.639 --> 00:55:43.620
much. Um, IT, it takes a handful of activities

1035
00:55:43.629 --> 00:55:46.120
that humans like doing and just does them bigger

1036
00:55:46.129 --> 00:55:49.989
faster and more, which is not unhelpful, but it's

1037
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.040
not, I suppose if you want progress in terms

1038
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:57.899
of genuine, um, change, irreversible change towards having more

1039
00:55:57.909 --> 00:56:01.300
options, more possibilities, more ideas about who we are,

1040
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:03.989
how we could live, et cetera. So that's the

1041
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.919
kind of progress that he's got, you know, partly

1042
00:56:06.929 --> 00:56:11.050
in mind, I think. Um AND you know, I

1043
00:56:11.169 --> 00:56:13.439
think one of the key points he makes is

1044
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.300
it is true that we generally live in less

1045
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:21.679
violent cultures. It may not feel like it. And

1046
00:56:21.689 --> 00:56:24.500
I think certainly during the interview that I did

1047
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.969
with him, he was willing to concede. Well, you

1048
00:56:26.979 --> 00:56:29.689
know, OK, I, I do think progress had been

1049
00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:33.909
made was being made. Um But I think we

1050
00:56:33.919 --> 00:56:36.879
might have to sort of re-evaluate that now, not

1051
00:56:36.889 --> 00:56:40.320
necessarily abandon it, but re-evaluate that because, you know,

1052
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.909
maybe one of the criticisms you could make of

1053
00:56:42.919 --> 00:56:45.889
his idea was, well, what exactly do you mean

1054
00:56:45.899 --> 00:56:50.709
when you say there's less violence, maybe actually, OK,

1055
00:56:50.719 --> 00:56:52.870
we're not in the middle ages where the the

1056
00:56:52.879 --> 00:56:58.020
torture torture was routine execution, public executions were normal.

1057
00:56:58.129 --> 00:57:02.729
Um Domestic violence was standard practice even amongst so

1058
00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:04.919
called, you know, kind of lib in so called

1059
00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:08.820
liberal households, um Children, animals, whoever they were totally

1060
00:57:09.145 --> 00:57:12.024
expendable and we don't have that. Now, we do

1061
00:57:12.034 --> 00:57:14.344
spend a lot more time in certain places in

1062
00:57:14.354 --> 00:57:18.645
certain places, sort of talking about it, disputing it,

1063
00:57:18.655 --> 00:57:21.495
you know, questioning it, challenging it. We do do

1064
00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:24.084
that more, doesn't mean we've eradicated it but that

1065
00:57:24.094 --> 00:57:28.254
sort of general casual acceptance that life's violent and

1066
00:57:28.264 --> 00:57:30.455
you're going to get exposed to violence at some

1067
00:57:30.465 --> 00:57:34.659
point. Um, I think he's right to say there

1068
00:57:34.669 --> 00:57:36.600
has been a shift on that, but on the

1069
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:40.500
other hand, maybe violence just has this wonderful ability

1070
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:43.429
to keep changing shape, doesn't it? So, isn't it

1071
00:57:43.439 --> 00:57:46.120
a form of violence when we just let, you

1072
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:50.020
know, continue with behaviors that will inevitably result in,

1073
00:57:50.179 --> 00:57:53.090
in a worsening climate emergency? I mean, this is

1074
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.209
the basis of so many of the lawsuits that

1075
00:57:55.219 --> 00:57:58.209
we're seeing young people saying, well, it's an act

1076
00:57:58.219 --> 00:58:02.090
of, you know, anticipatory violence. So we might be

1077
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.169
far more controlled in our be on the surface

1078
00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:08.120
again in some places. I mean, I don't think

1079
00:58:08.129 --> 00:58:11.449
if I went into Gaza today and said, guess

1080
00:58:11.459 --> 00:58:14.100
what, everyone, there's much less violence than there ever

1081
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.320
was before. I'm not sure too many people will

1082
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.209
be coming with me on that one. It's similar,

1083
00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:23.330
I could say similar going into, uh, you know,

1084
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.840
other places have experienced horrendous conflict recently. Syria Ukraine,

1085
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:32.030
obviously Myanmar right now, you know, that's a sort

1086
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.199
of live battleground that we're not hearing sufficient about

1087
00:58:36.209 --> 00:58:38.639
really, um, you know, by

1088
00:58:38.649 --> 00:58:41.510
the way, on that point on violence, let me

1089
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.129
just have because a couple of years ago I

1090
00:58:44.139 --> 00:58:48.280
have on the show Philippe Du with a historian

1091
00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.419
from Australia. And he wrote a book titled The

1092
00:58:51.429 --> 00:58:55.149
Darker Angels of Our Nature. That was a response

1093
00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:58.989
to Steven Pinker take on violence. And he, he

1094
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.550
has very good points on that book. Uh Of

1095
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.909
course, I can reproduce all of them here. But

1096
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.120
if you are like that, we still have slavery

1097
00:59:09.129 --> 00:59:11.770
and there's an argument to be made that not

1098
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.260
in terms of percentage, but in terms of raw

1099
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:19.320
numbers, perhaps we have more people enslaved nowadays than

1100
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:24.030
we have when, even when slavery was legal. And

1101
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:28.060
then he also points to how the internet facilitates

1102
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:32.139
certain types of violence, like for example, sex trafficking.

1103
00:59:32.229 --> 00:59:34.899
So, I mean, those are just two examples but

1104
00:59:35.229 --> 00:59:40.689
uh I guess that Steven Pinker doesn't uh I,

1105
00:59:40.699 --> 00:59:44.939
I mean, doesn't consider that uh th those examples

1106
00:59:44.949 --> 00:59:48.909
and others enough or doesn't take them seriously enough.

1107
00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:49.649
I'm not sure.

1108
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.030
I think, I mean, ii I do, I think

1109
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.600
that it's a serious flaw in the argument if

1110
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:56.659
you're going to claim an overall, which he is

1111
00:59:56.669 --> 01:00:01.139
an overall quantitative reduction proportionally speaking, um in the

1112
01:00:01.149 --> 01:00:04.229
amount of violence. Um So the, the, the raw

1113
01:00:04.239 --> 01:00:06.810
numbers thing I think he would contest by saying,

1114
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.030
well, you've got to look at it proportionally. Um

1115
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.810
I also think that, you know, his argument would

1116
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.949
be, well, yes, but the very fact we're sitting

1117
01:00:13.959 --> 01:00:15.820
here condemning the fact that I think the figure

1118
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:19.870
is around about 45 million people still in what

1119
01:00:19.879 --> 01:00:22.770
you would consider a state of slavery today. Many

1120
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.719
of them women and Children through, as you mentioned,

1121
01:00:25.729 --> 01:00:30.250
the sex trafficking and what have you. Um Again,

1122
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.020
I think he'd say, well, that was going on

1123
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.030
in the past too, but we, we were much

1124
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.989
less concerned. No one was concerned. It wasn't a

1125
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.629
problem. You weren't having a moral conversation about slavery,

1126
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.229
you know, 500 years ago, like you are now

1127
01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:45.610
now as a historian, I'm not, I'm just, I'm

1128
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.939
not that, that, to me feels too linear. I

1129
01:00:47.949 --> 01:00:51.189
think that we have this wonderful sense that we,

1130
01:00:51.199 --> 01:00:53.810
it's, it's, to me it's a fall, it's a,

1131
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.780
a fallen ascent narrative. So we fell from Eden

1132
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.649
and then we've been gradually clawing our way um

1133
01:00:59.659 --> 01:01:01.459
back up and it's a very standard way of

1134
01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:05.520
narrating history. I think again, it's this wonderful ability

1135
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.080
we have to say, oh, well, like, like the

1136
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.840
argument um that no one was an individual until

1137
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:15.989
modernity. Um And then, and then, and then we

1138
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.320
all became individuals and we had states of mind

1139
01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.300
and feelings and all that sort of thing. It's

1140
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.800
not true. I mean, people who lived in very

1141
01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:25.760
close tribal, you know, kind of communities that doesn't

1142
01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.739
mean they had absolutely no sense of being, you

1143
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:30.979
know, or, or knowing when they'd been hurt or

1144
01:01:30.989 --> 01:01:33.020
when they'd been betrayed or when they'd been lied

1145
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:36.429
to, even if they didn't necessarily consider themselves a

1146
01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:39.489
self and do lots of self therapy or self

1147
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.429
care or whatever. So, I think it's really dangerous

1148
01:01:43.439 --> 01:01:46.219
to, to, to do anything along the lines of

1149
01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:48.370
saying, you know, talking about what people were or

1150
01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:49.709
weren't aware of.

1151
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.389
And, but by the way, on that point as

1152
01:01:52.399 --> 01:01:57.389
well, because particularly in enlightenment. Now, the subtitle I

1153
01:01:57.399 --> 01:02:02.219
think is something like reason, science progress, I mean,

1154
01:02:02.399 --> 01:02:05.229
the, the, the idea that, uh, uh, I'm not

1155
01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:09.090
sure if he's exactly making that argument. But the,

1156
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.489
I, but it sounds like as if reason and

1157
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.449
science appeared in the enlightenment and before that, there

1158
01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:22.379
was basically no reason and basically, no science said

1159
01:02:22.389 --> 01:02:25.290
that's completely untrue because I mean, in terms of

1160
01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.429
the science, at the very, very least you have

1161
01:02:28.439 --> 01:02:32.239
to, uh, admit that in the, uh, in the

1162
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.781
Muslim world during the European dark ages or middle

1163
01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:39.971
ages, at the very least you have brought to

1164
01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:43.271
science there and they were doing something similar to

1165
01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:46.312
science. And I mean, and the reason part, the

1166
01:02:46.322 --> 01:02:49.572
reason part for me is just if he is

1167
01:02:49.582 --> 01:02:53.072
making that argument, it's, it's just silly.

1168
01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:57.412
No, I, you're completely right. Um, I suppose what

1169
01:02:57.422 --> 01:02:59.652
he's doing and it brings us right back actually

1170
01:02:59.662 --> 01:03:03.021
very neatly to our kind of opening conversations and

1171
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:04.733
again, this notion of war, what do we mean

1172
01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:08.924
by, by anarchism and, and you know, kind of

1173
01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:11.243
the, the sort of uh where do you start

1174
01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:13.253
in history? Questions? So it all sort of comes

1175
01:03:13.263 --> 01:03:15.783
together in a, in a beautiful symphony. I think

1176
01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:18.724
what he's saying really is that um what the

1177
01:03:18.733 --> 01:03:21.543
enlightenment does, I mean, is actually it's a formalization,

1178
01:03:21.553 --> 01:03:24.614
it's an organization process. So suddenly off the back

1179
01:03:24.624 --> 01:03:27.414
of that, you can sort of trace things like,

1180
01:03:27.424 --> 01:03:29.553
well, where do we find the roots of the

1181
01:03:29.563 --> 01:03:32.434
Universal Declaration of Human Rights? So I suppose if

1182
01:03:32.444 --> 01:03:36.545
you're looking at ways where certain ideas, certain practices,

1183
01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:41.706
certain values, intellectual, moral, et cetera, got formalized into

1184
01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:43.605
sort of what we would now call kind of

1185
01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:46.956
any sort of globalized legislation. In so far as

1186
01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:50.335
that is ever effective, we have seen very dram

1187
01:03:50.345 --> 01:03:53.375
dramatically the limits of things like the International Criminal

1188
01:03:53.385 --> 01:03:56.855
Court to deal with problems like Ukraine with problems,

1189
01:03:56.865 --> 01:04:00.375
like what's happening in Gaza right now. Um However,

1190
01:04:00.385 --> 01:04:03.340
you know, I suppose what he's saying is I

1191
01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:08.300
would say hi, his, his progress narrative has behind

1192
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:13.209
it, a thinking of, of global legislative practice now,

1193
01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:15.780
which may be that he says, well, there could

1194
01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:19.290
have been people doing brilliant things, but that didn't

1195
01:04:19.379 --> 01:04:22.040
turn into a rule book for the human race.

1196
01:04:22.739 --> 01:04:26.479
And I'd say, well, OK, II, I would accept

1197
01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:31.689
that differentiation. I'd still question um I think that

1198
01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:34.629
in terms of, you know, that argument that I,

1199
01:04:34.639 --> 01:04:37.810
I, I'd still, I'd still question how universal that

1200
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.909
rulebook is. How effective it is. Um, BUT you

1201
01:04:41.919 --> 01:04:45.199
can't deny that it does exist and it came

1202
01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:48.540
into existence at a time when, um, that sort

1203
01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:52.540
of our globalized nature of our life was becoming

1204
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:56.020
more, more formalized from that point on again, not

1205
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.620
to say that people weren't traveling, weren't encountering each

1206
01:04:58.629 --> 01:05:01.760
other, weren't doing interesting things. Um, BUT I don't

1207
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:04.610
think that's clear. I mean, I'm sort of interpreting

1208
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.949
possibly too heavily. Who knows? Um, And I think

1209
01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:10.760
you're right. I think that we have suffered from

1210
01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:15.780
a serious lack of being more curious about the

1211
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:21.360
histories that lie outside of the history capital, h

1212
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.850
sort of thing. Um And so I think there's

1213
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.439
a salutary lesson for all uh political scientists out

1214
01:05:27.449 --> 01:05:30.679
there, go back to the past but look laterally.

1215
01:05:31.379 --> 01:05:33.560
Uh I, I mean, at the very least I

1216
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:37.530
think people uh there's a strong argument to be

1217
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.669
made that perhaps the sort of way presents history

1218
01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:44.229
in these books in the Better Angels of Our

1219
01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:48.560
Nature and Enlightenment now is very Euro centuries. II.

1220
01:05:48.629 --> 01:05:51.580
I think that's a good argument to be made.

1221
01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:54.790
But uh but then let me just run perhaps

1222
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.379
two or three criticisms that I have uh about

1223
01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:01.810
his work through, through you to see what do

1224
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.510
you think about them. So, I, I mean, uh

1225
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.550
f first of all, uh I respect him a

1226
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.129
lot as a cognitive scientist, as a psychologist, as

1227
01:06:12.139 --> 01:06:16.590
a linguist. But nowadays, after spending years talking with

1228
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.959
political scientists, historians and anthropologists trying to address each

1229
01:06:21.969 --> 01:06:24.360
of the points that he makes across his books,

1230
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:27.280
which are a ton of them because he covers

1231
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.909
a lot, a lot of ground. And so it's

1232
01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:32.189
very, very hard to evaluate all of what he

1233
01:06:32.199 --> 01:06:35.899
says there. But, uh I, I don't think III

1234
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:39.659
I no longer take his, let's say, takes on

1235
01:06:39.669 --> 01:06:45.300
political science and economics and anthropology seriously at all.

1236
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:49.419
So, but, but, but another uh the three points

1237
01:06:49.429 --> 01:06:52.050
I was going to make are the first one

1238
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:56.830
I think that he is very dismissive of people

1239
01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.790
who were actually part of the enlightenment. But just

1240
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.149
because they have ideas that he doesn't like, he

1241
01:07:05.159 --> 01:07:09.500
says they were not really part of the enlightenment,

1242
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:12.820
like for example, Nietzsche, oh he was a romantic

1243
01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:16.040
and then I rationalist. So he was not really

1244
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:20.870
part of the enlightenment. Uh Mars all because the

1245
01:07:20.879 --> 01:07:25.409
enlightenment has to be capitalist. He was a communist

1246
01:07:25.419 --> 01:07:29.939
or a socialist or socialism and communism, not part

1247
01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:34.429
of the enlightenment. And then perhaps people, other people

1248
01:07:34.439 --> 01:07:37.909
with other kinds of political thoughts, other political thinkers

1249
01:07:37.919 --> 01:07:42.370
that would be perhaps more or less in favor

1250
01:07:42.379 --> 01:07:46.209
of progressive is more conservative or something like that.

1251
01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:50.139
Or maybe he would put them aside as well,

1252
01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:53.699
but at the very least Nietzsche Marx and some

1253
01:07:53.709 --> 01:07:57.370
other people like that. He is extremely critical of

1254
01:07:57.379 --> 01:08:01.310
them in their books. And uh iii, I guess

1255
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.979
that if you would ask him directly, you would

1256
01:08:03.989 --> 01:08:10.110
say that they were not real enlightened people or

1257
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.439
something like that. Uh And, and then, I mean,

1258
01:08:14.449 --> 01:08:18.339
the another point is uh uh oh my God,

1259
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.589
I lost by Rena for now. But uh II,

1260
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.370
I mean, perhaps respond to that when and then

1261
01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:23.750
I will

1262
01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:26.649
respond to that whilst um you, you to work

1263
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.957
on the, the other points. So I think you're

1264
01:08:29.969 --> 01:08:32.908
absolutely right. Again, um, we talked about this earlier

1265
01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:35.548
or my, my sort of sense that history is

1266
01:08:35.559 --> 01:08:38.127
always a political intervention. I do think there's a

1267
01:08:38.139 --> 01:08:40.278
strong element of that in what Stephen Pink is

1268
01:08:40.288 --> 01:08:41.729
trying to do. I think he's almost, it's more

1269
01:08:41.738 --> 01:08:44.099
of ac a rescue job for a particular version

1270
01:08:44.108 --> 01:08:45.729
of the enlightenment that led to a kind of

1271
01:08:45.738 --> 01:08:47.868
liberal world order which he sees as the most

1272
01:08:47.877 --> 01:08:51.615
sort of sensible, um as liberals tend to do

1273
01:08:51.734 --> 01:08:54.375
in their liberal way. Um The, the, it's the

1274
01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:57.294
most sensible, it's most reasonable. It's the least bad

1275
01:08:57.305 --> 01:08:59.104
of all, all, all the options if you must

1276
01:08:59.115 --> 01:09:01.995
have. Um, LEADERSHIP cos it's amazing how many liberals

1277
01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:04.685
will grudgingly, sort of, you know, kind of shuffle

1278
01:09:04.694 --> 01:09:07.334
their feet. Look and say, well, yeah, yeah, law

1279
01:09:07.345 --> 01:09:10.294
government. It sucks. But it's, it's, it's necessary and

1280
01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:13.899
it's sensible. So I think you're completely right. The

1281
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.580
enlightenment, actually, we tend to reduce it down to

1282
01:09:17.589 --> 01:09:19.729
this. You know, here are all the bits that

1283
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.580
we most recognize, um, and are most useful for

1284
01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:25.990
us right now and of course, it wasn't, I

1285
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.140
mean, it just wasn't like that. I mean, if

1286
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:30.169
you want to say anything about the enlightenment at

1287
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.049
all, was that a large outpouring of, of ideas

1288
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.745
about how things worked, how the world worked? Nietzsche?

1289
01:09:36.915 --> 01:09:39.854
I mean, like the, um the relationship, the romanticism

1290
01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:44.234
is really interesting. It's always positioned again as opposed

1291
01:09:44.245 --> 01:09:46.174
to the enlightenment. I would say it was fully

1292
01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:48.805
a part of it because a romantic romantic thinkers

1293
01:09:48.814 --> 01:09:52.234
no less than the rationalists had a theory about

1294
01:09:52.245 --> 01:09:54.725
how the world worked. And on the basis of

1295
01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:57.975
that theory, how you could then operate within it.

1296
01:09:57.984 --> 01:10:00.541
Now, their theory was there isn't, you know, a

1297
01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:03.432
one big truth. We can note we're always inventing

1298
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:05.852
that truth. Someone like Nietzsche says, fine. Well, if

1299
01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:08.591
we're gonna invent that truth, let's really invent that

1300
01:10:08.602 --> 01:10:11.352
truth. That's not dilly dally, let's not wring our

1301
01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:15.111
hands. Let's not be apologetic. Let's invent the world

1302
01:10:15.122 --> 01:10:18.421
then. And in some ways Nietzsche does not lead

1303
01:10:18.432 --> 01:10:21.051
in a straight line to fascism, he was simply

1304
01:10:21.062 --> 01:10:26.330
making a kind of um philosophical argument. Well, if

1305
01:10:26.339 --> 01:10:29.049
the world is so much to an extent, a

1306
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.250
projection of our imagination that we convince or compel

1307
01:10:32.259 --> 01:10:35.490
people into believing, then what would that look like

1308
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.790
if we actually acted like that? It's a thought

1309
01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:38.229
experiment.

1310
01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:41.870
Yeah. O OK. So the two other points that

1311
01:10:41.879 --> 01:10:44.649
just came to my mind is the first one

1312
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:50.950
I think that it doesn't take seriously enough critiques

1313
01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:54.149
of capitalism. So II, I think that the, this

1314
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.180
misses to easily it takes from socialists, takes from

1315
01:10:59.189 --> 01:11:03.810
communists and I mean, whatever, III I, OK, I

1316
01:11:03.819 --> 01:11:07.450
wouldn't say whatever, but many or many, many, many,

1317
01:11:07.459 --> 01:11:10.540
many of the criticisms that people would have to

1318
01:11:10.549 --> 01:11:15.720
make about capitalism and about things like even uh

1319
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:20.009
uh uh economic inequality and its effects. I don't

1320
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.970
think that it takes it seriously enough and then,

1321
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.109
and perhaps partly related to that point. And also

1322
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.890
something that you mentioned briefly earlier. Uh I mean,

1323
01:11:30.899 --> 01:11:33.350
at a certain point, it gets a bit weird

1324
01:11:33.359 --> 01:11:36.950
to me when people say that. OK, so we

1325
01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.120
have this problem, we have violence, for example, in

1326
01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:44.120
that particular kind of way. And then most of

1327
01:11:44.129 --> 01:11:47.259
the time his response is OK, we have that,

1328
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:50.029
but in the past, we have more and it

1329
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.799
seems that he's always making that kind of argument

1330
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.120
that at a certain point, I I'm no longer

1331
01:11:56.129 --> 01:12:01.669
sure if he's just saying that or if he's

1332
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.700
just outright this missing uh the point that people

1333
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:09.520
are making because if that's something that still exists,

1334
01:12:09.529 --> 01:12:12.439
it's still a problem. But sometimes I'm no longer

1335
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:16.500
sure if he even considers it really a problem

1336
01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:20.430
just because we have a apparently lower levels of

1337
01:12:20.439 --> 01:12:23.390
it now than we did in the past. So,

1338
01:12:24.259 --> 01:12:27.819
um so the first point is that he doesn't

1339
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:32.819
take seriously the uh critiques of, of capitalism. I

1340
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:35.839
mean, I think my answer to both would be,

1341
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:39.479
I find reading Stephen's work. Um Unlike you, I'm

1342
01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:42.270
like I said, II, I enjoy many aspects of

1343
01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:45.040
the boldness of the, of the argument. Full stop.

1344
01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:49.549
I'm glad it exists if you will. Um However,

1345
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.229
and obviously, full respect for his scientific work and

1346
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.589
also always in the spirit of um history being

1347
01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.810
a political intervention of some kind or another. I

1348
01:12:59.819 --> 01:13:02.890
find um reading Steven's work a kind of wonderful

1349
01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:07.009
mixture of idealism and really hardcore realism and maybe

1350
01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.200
that's partly what's at play here. So, um I

1351
01:13:10.209 --> 01:13:13.899
think there's this quite idealistic view that a lot

1352
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:17.200
of those sentiments in the enlightenment and the, this

1353
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:21.160
notion that she would make decisions based on rationality

1354
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:24.689
that she would organize affairs a occur according to

1355
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.770
um free planning informed by, you know, a factual

1356
01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:31.509
understanding of the situation at hand. All these are

1357
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.750
sort of uh uh are not unreasonable things to

1358
01:13:34.759 --> 01:13:38.680
sort of, um to, to believe or to want

1359
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:40.399
or to want to see. And I think a

1360
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:44.509
lot of it, sort of philosophy's motivation is worrying

1361
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.129
perhaps more than he'd like to, um more than

1362
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.910
he'd like to admit that that some of those

1363
01:13:49.919 --> 01:13:53.430
things just as values, not necessarily as realities, but

1364
01:13:53.439 --> 01:13:56.509
some of those things as values are under threat.

1365
01:13:57.290 --> 01:14:00.569
I think there's a real realist in Stephen too,

1366
01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.160
in the sense that he says, well, I'm not

1367
01:14:02.169 --> 01:14:05.509
gonna talk to you about communism or anything like

1368
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.430
that. I, I think capital, we have to deal

1369
01:14:07.439 --> 01:14:10.589
with capitalism because that's what we, we've got and

1370
01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.979
actually capitalism sort of well managed, sort of polite

1371
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.810
capitalism, the kind of Adam Smith style capitalism, which

1372
01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:20.229
never actually existed because it's never the sort of

1373
01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.430
Adam Smith account of capitalism or, you know, sort

1374
01:14:23.439 --> 01:14:25.680
of free market, I should say, or free trade,

1375
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.410
uh, never takes into account the fact that you're

1376
01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:30.870
never starting from a position of free trade. You

1377
01:14:30.879 --> 01:14:33.910
always are starting from a position of your second

1378
01:14:33.919 --> 01:14:36.859
point, you know, massively powerful vested interest. So we

1379
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:39.399
gonna skew that competition. So we're never gonna get

1380
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:41.200
to the situation where we are genuinely in a

1381
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:45.140
free competition. That's, that's an, that's an actual historical

1382
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:48.180
time and place right here right now problem that

1383
01:14:48.419 --> 01:14:54.455
um, no amount of enlighten theorizing has really dealt

1384
01:14:54.464 --> 01:14:56.685
with that, you know, and, and I suppose what

1385
01:14:56.694 --> 01:14:58.774
you're saying is actually, there's a wonderful sense of,

1386
01:14:58.785 --> 01:15:00.845
we can all be very excited about the promise

1387
01:15:00.854 --> 01:15:02.725
of the enlightenment. But what it never really did

1388
01:15:02.734 --> 01:15:05.904
was confront the fact of power, which isn't, doesn't,

1389
01:15:05.915 --> 01:15:09.805
isn't always, doesn't always yield to reason or um

1390
01:15:09.814 --> 01:15:13.584
rationality by definition. But it's nevertheless a fact and

1391
01:15:13.595 --> 01:15:15.564
it's nevertheless an active fact, you don't need to

1392
01:15:15.575 --> 01:15:18.754
be a wild intellectual to see what power unchecked

1393
01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:24.229
does. Um And intellectuals can sometimes actually be so,

1394
01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:28.689
um enamored of, of these sort of clever ways

1395
01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.279
around problems that they realize that actually, you know,

1396
01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:33.120
sometimes you do have to give an answer to

1397
01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:36.189
the brute force question, namely power is not gonna

1398
01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.839
go away because you show it all how unreasonable

1399
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:42.040
it is. Turkeys don't vote for Christmas, right? No

1400
01:15:42.049 --> 01:15:46.439
matter how well you make the case. Um So

1401
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:48.529
I think there's an element of that which ma

1402
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:51.850
which does I agree with you severely undermine um

1403
01:15:51.859 --> 01:15:54.930
the overall project that we've come this way just

1404
01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:59.740
by sheer sort of small steps, gradualism, reasonable advance.

1405
01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:02.129
And the gradualism I think is the other aspect

1406
01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.669
which is why you don't get satisfying answers to

1407
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.740
your question of. But inequality still exists if it's

1408
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:11.240
not, if we can prove that it's not rational

1409
01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:12.720
to do this for the human race and we

1410
01:16:12.729 --> 01:16:16.100
can prove it's perfectly reasonable to rearrange resources so

1411
01:16:16.109 --> 01:16:18.970
that it's no longer necessary. Why do we still

1412
01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:21.259
have it? And then Steven's saying, ah, yes, but

1413
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:24.439
we have much proportionally less of it, even if

1414
01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:26.589
in raw numbers, we actually have more.

1415
01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:30.319
And it's not just that we still have it,

1416
01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:33.799
but even more that it tends to be very

1417
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:38.399
dismissive of the social, political and other kinds of

1418
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:44.089
effects that economic inequality has in across different so

1419
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.270
society, I mean, at a certain point in enlightenment

1420
01:16:47.279 --> 01:16:51.270
now, it seems that it just uh brings up

1421
01:16:51.279 --> 01:16:56.020
studies about how apparently if people perceive, even if

1422
01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.930
it's a very, very, very high levels of economic

1423
01:16:58.939 --> 01:17:03.990
inequality as fair, it doesn't matter. And I, I

1424
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.620
mean, for me that doesn't make any sense because

1425
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:12.270
economic inequality has social and political effects regardless of

1426
01:17:12.279 --> 01:17:15.629
people, uh looking at it as being more or

1427
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.899
less fair. So,

1428
01:17:17.459 --> 01:17:19.410
um, no, it's a good point. And again, I

1429
01:17:19.419 --> 01:17:21.740
think it's this sort of, actually there's a very

1430
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:25.759
humanistic element in his, in his thinking, in the

1431
01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:30.759
sense that um if the empirical person, if you

1432
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.220
will, the person you ask says, oh no, I,

1433
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:37.259
I don't feel things are unfair. Um, AND even

1434
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:40.200
though you're looking at the stats and comparing them

1435
01:17:40.209 --> 01:17:42.859
with what they could be going, are you sure?

1436
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:47.140
Um, YOU know, that, that's, uh, I think, I

1437
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:51.240
think I would give credibility to taking that person

1438
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.759
and their feeling seriously, but not exclusively. So you're

1439
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.950
right to say that people and how they feel

1440
01:17:56.959 --> 01:17:59.060
about situations, if they don't feel that they're living

1441
01:17:59.069 --> 01:18:01.549
a horrible life, then frankly, thank God, you know,

1442
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.819
sort of that, that's, that's a mercy because we,

1443
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:06.120
I don't want anyone to, you know, you don't

1444
01:18:06.129 --> 01:18:08.100
want anyone to sort of be sitting there feeling

1445
01:18:08.109 --> 01:18:09.529
like that. But at the same time, you know,

1446
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.160
there's, there's a line between that and having your

1447
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:15.680
head in the sand over, over things. So it's

1448
01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:18.870
that sort of push pull between trying to respect

1449
01:18:18.879 --> 01:18:21.660
how people feel and where they're at and then

1450
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:24.629
that sort of very gently trying to kind of

1451
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:28.120
change things and, and, and again, remember it's always

1452
01:18:28.129 --> 01:18:30.089
a kind of act of authority for anyone to

1453
01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.640
say, well, you might feel that way, but I

1454
01:18:31.649 --> 01:18:34.410
can assure you it's not like that the best,

1455
01:18:34.419 --> 01:18:36.350
you know. And I think again, that's what someone

1456
01:18:36.359 --> 01:18:38.700
like Stephen Pink will be trying to avoid that.

1457
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:40.470
If you're gonna change things, you need to bring

1458
01:18:40.479 --> 01:18:44.359
people with you, even if that slows down your

1459
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:47.640
journey. So I think he tends to avoid, not

1460
01:18:47.649 --> 01:18:51.240
necessarily because their reasoning is incorrect, but in terms

1461
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:53.770
of whether it's, um, I mean, he's a sort

1462
01:18:53.779 --> 01:18:56.250
of a brilliant psychologist. So there'd be a degree

1463
01:18:56.259 --> 01:18:59.620
to which he's like, well, how do people change

1464
01:18:59.629 --> 01:19:03.089
their minds about things? How do you make people

1465
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.240
want things even when they don't realize they want

1466
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.459
them, if you point to those people who are

1467
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:11.950
talking about extreme differences, which would be massive upheaval,

1468
01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:16.180
um People tend to not buy into that as

1469
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:18.919
much as if you say. Well, let's start small.

1470
01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:21.020
What kind of, all right, you're generally happy. But

1471
01:19:21.029 --> 01:19:23.620
is there anything you've noticed in your life which,

1472
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:26.939
which is upsetting you or ranking you but start

1473
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:30.419
from there? And that's your departure point? Um WHICH

1474
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:33.214
does, doesn't actually mean. And again, this is maybe

1475
01:19:33.225 --> 01:19:36.285
why those history books he does are generally for

1476
01:19:36.294 --> 01:19:39.334
large popular public audiences. They're not the kind of

1477
01:19:39.345 --> 01:19:42.665
technical books or technical monographs or articles that he

1478
01:19:42.674 --> 01:19:44.895
would produce as a scientist. So there's always a

1479
01:19:44.904 --> 01:19:47.654
degree of which he's saying there's a case to

1480
01:19:47.665 --> 01:19:51.850
be made that the enlightenment didn't fail and you

1481
01:19:51.859 --> 01:19:54.740
know, that we, um, we should still buy into

1482
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:58.810
its values and that, in the process of making

1483
01:19:58.819 --> 01:20:00.890
that argument, I think what he's also trying to

1484
01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:03.500
do is say, well, let's save those values because

1485
01:20:03.509 --> 01:20:05.750
actually they're under threat right now. And in order

1486
01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:09.439
to do that, I'm gonna tell you 90% of

1487
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.629
what you think you already know. And then just

1488
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.379
a AAA small enough twist to, to, to, to

1489
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:17.450
make you kind of come with me on this.

1490
01:20:17.819 --> 01:20:20.439
That would be, that would be totally my, my

1491
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:23.120
guess. But I did used to teach rhetoric. Um

1492
01:20:23.129 --> 01:20:25.810
So possibly I'm just putting a rhetorical spin on

1493
01:20:25.819 --> 01:20:28.279
this which doesn't exist, who knows? So,

1494
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.990
so I, I was looking at the um do

1495
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.540
you, we just a couple more minutes to reply

1496
01:20:33.549 --> 01:20:36.029
to the last point I made, which I can

1497
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.430
repeat if you want or? OK. So uh the

1498
01:20:40.439 --> 01:20:43.049
last point was, was basically me saying that I

1499
01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:47.069
think is I'm not sure at a certain point

1500
01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.310
if he takes seriously the fact that certain kinds

1501
01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:55.709
of issues like violence of different kinds still exist

1502
01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.069
because he's always going back to the argument that,

1503
01:21:00.129 --> 01:21:04.879
oh but uh but before the, the, the levels

1504
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:08.120
were higher in, in, in ancient time, the levels

1505
01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:11.779
were higher because uh and something that he keeps

1506
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:15.220
repeating is that uh it, it seems to him

1507
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:18.560
that the progressives do not like pro but I

1508
01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:22.500
don't think that just because someone is pointing out

1509
01:21:22.509 --> 01:21:26.140
a problem that we still have regardless of it

1510
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:31.160
being, uh, at lower or higher levels than before

1511
01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:36.069
that they are dismissing a progressivism or they don't

1512
01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.160
like progressivism. Well, they just want to be negative.

1513
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:42.669
They just pointing out a problem, a problem that

1514
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.930
still exists. And sometimes, I don't know, it seems

1515
01:21:45.939 --> 01:21:50.910
to me that he's too dismissive of, uh, people

1516
01:21:50.919 --> 01:21:55.459
pointing out those problems because it seems that, uh

1517
01:21:55.479 --> 01:21:58.899
it takes it as being an attack to the

1518
01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:01.870
kind of argument he presents in his book. So.

1519
01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:05.689
Well, I think the thing with progressives is that,

1520
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.080
um, I mean, I think actually I'd agree with

1521
01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:10.600
them to a point and then disagree at a

1522
01:22:10.609 --> 01:22:13.330
point. If you're a progressive, your job by definition

1523
01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:15.729
is to be that awkward person who wants to

1524
01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.470
move things forward and that's genuinely your, your job

1525
01:22:19.479 --> 01:22:20.859
and you wouldn't be doing it right if you

1526
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:22.850
just went. Oh, yes, pat on our backs. We've

1527
01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:25.890
all done excellently jolly good feet up everyone. Right.

1528
01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.930
So there is an extent to which this is

1529
01:22:27.939 --> 01:22:30.720
kind of a necessary friction to have. And actually

1530
01:22:30.729 --> 01:22:33.399
he's doing, he's almost doing the progressive course of

1531
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.540
favor by pushing back at it a bit because

1532
01:22:35.549 --> 01:22:37.390
if you, if you want, if you want to

1533
01:22:37.399 --> 01:22:40.299
kind of propel things forward and um you know,

1534
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:42.540
sort of, you, you, you know, that, that you

1535
01:22:42.549 --> 01:22:45.069
sort of, you're, you're kind of saying things aren't

1536
01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.830
good enough as they are. So, you know, it

1537
01:22:46.839 --> 01:22:49.310
is, it is a sort of creative friction, I

1538
01:22:49.319 --> 01:22:51.870
think to, to kind of, to kind of have

1539
01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:54.890
that argument. Um I, again, I think this comes

1540
01:22:54.899 --> 01:22:58.359
back to his notion of gradualism and, and again,

1541
01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:00.180
I, I would say it's sort of like the

1542
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:02.209
progress is almost, you have a license to almost

1543
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.600
go too far. You, you do, by definition, you

1544
01:23:04.609 --> 01:23:06.549
need to be a little bit utopian in your

1545
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.359
aspirations. Like this isn't good enough, we can do

1546
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:11.939
better. We should. And that's a driving force. It

1547
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:14.580
drives people forward and then you can have a

1548
01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.310
sort of second flank of people saying, oh, well,

1549
01:23:17.319 --> 01:23:19.669
you know, let's be, let's calm down, let's not

1550
01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.209
go too, too fast, all that sort of thing.

1551
01:23:22.339 --> 01:23:25.370
Um And I suppose the change that you're wanting

1552
01:23:25.379 --> 01:23:28.330
to happen lands in between, you know, so the

1553
01:23:28.339 --> 01:23:30.830
progressives are almost pushing further, you know, it's the

1554
01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:34.930
lever, the leverage theory of persuasion, right? If I

1555
01:23:34.939 --> 01:23:37.930
have a really crazy goal, a really out there

1556
01:23:37.939 --> 01:23:39.990
goal, I need to use a lot more force

1557
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.479
to get a tiny bit of movement. Um Because

1558
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:47.870
I suppose the the implication there may be Steven

1559
01:23:47.879 --> 01:23:53.029
suspects as William James did that. Um SORT of

1560
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.209
social psychology if you like uh William James used

1561
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.680
to call it the ancient Mass and that the

1562
01:23:58.689 --> 01:24:00.609
best you can hope for as a progressive is

1563
01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:03.379
you stain the ancient mass just a drop, just

1564
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:06.830
a drop and like a drop, it gradually infuses

1565
01:24:06.839 --> 01:24:11.035
very gradually until you can slightly change the chemistry

1566
01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:13.935
of that ancient mass. And I wonder if a

1567
01:24:13.944 --> 01:24:16.754
similar idea is at play here. So I don't

1568
01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:19.274
think it's a good enough argument really to say,

1569
01:24:19.475 --> 01:24:23.615
oh, but it's, but there's proportionally less, it's not

1570
01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:27.160
a great argument. It's a true one. Um, BUT

1571
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:31.459
it's maybe not, it's maybe allowing other people to

1572
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:35.189
be aspirational and taking the position of someone who's

1573
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.439
being quote unquote, a realist with the hope that

1574
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:43.189
that conversation between our wildest dreams of our best

1575
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.560
versions of ourselves and what we've got at the

1576
01:24:46.569 --> 01:24:50.700
moment, something in between those two poles or axes

1577
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:55.879
um may be the direction we can shift ourselves

1578
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:58.200
gradually towards.

1579
01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:01.370
Yeah. Ju just to give a quick example of

1580
01:25:01.379 --> 01:25:04.350
something I heard from him that illustrates what I

1581
01:25:04.359 --> 01:25:07.939
was trying to convey earlier. I mean, I watched

1582
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.390
a video of him uh in the Q and

1583
01:25:10.399 --> 01:25:13.810
A and uh you, I'm not sure what the

1584
01:25:13.819 --> 01:25:16.339
question was exactly. But at a certain point, he

1585
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:21.422
said something like, oh, people who are part of

1586
01:25:21.433 --> 01:25:26.252
progressive movements, even if they become obsolete, they have

1587
01:25:26.263 --> 01:25:30.303
to invent new problems to stay relevant. And they

1588
01:25:30.312 --> 01:25:33.982
gave the example of f and they gave the

1589
01:25:33.993 --> 01:25:39.172
example of feminism in the most developed countries. And

1590
01:25:39.183 --> 01:25:43.562
I was like, really if feminist is obsolete by

1591
01:25:43.573 --> 01:25:46.386
now, uh It, it seems a bit silly to

1592
01:25:46.395 --> 01:25:46.846
me.

1593
01:25:47.516 --> 01:25:50.846
Yeah. Again, it's, it's a confronting position, um, for

1594
01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:53.746
him to, for him to take, but it's almost,

1595
01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:57.235
um, again, it's almost, I, I'm not sure I'll

1596
01:25:57.246 --> 01:26:01.625
say that was deliberate provo provocation. Um, IT, it

1597
01:26:01.636 --> 01:26:04.395
might be nice to think that it was. Um,

1598
01:26:04.405 --> 01:26:07.636
BUT I, yeah, I think there's a sense to

1599
01:26:07.645 --> 01:26:12.899
which, what David Pinker rep. Uh, David, sorry, Steven

1600
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:17.040
Pinker represents is an attempt to say, um, you

1601
01:26:17.049 --> 01:26:18.870
know, it's an attempt to kind of, it's kind

1602
01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:23.160
of a conservative position that's not, that's not traditionally

1603
01:26:23.169 --> 01:26:25.350
conservative. It's almost a t an attempt to kind

1604
01:26:25.359 --> 01:26:29.729
of reclaim conservatism towards something that actually progressives still

1605
01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.100
aren't gonna agree with, but they could work with

1606
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:35.060
far better. So instead of a fictional, the people

1607
01:26:35.069 --> 01:26:39.740
and the organic community, he's saying, look through reason

1608
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:43.649
and time and being gradual and patience, you know,

1609
01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.370
we've done a darn good job. Thank you. And

1610
01:26:46.379 --> 01:26:49.220
it is our job. People like you and me

1611
01:26:49.229 --> 01:26:54.399
to say it's not enough for us. Yeah.

1612
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.770
So let's perhaps uh end on that point because

1613
01:26:58.779 --> 01:27:02.339
we're already going over, over time here. So, uh

1614
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:05.149
Sophie just before we go, would you like to

1615
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.830
tell people where they can find you and your

1616
01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:09.149
work on the internet?

1617
01:27:09.919 --> 01:27:12.850
Oh, well, I mean, so I have uh several

1618
01:27:12.859 --> 01:27:16.759
books um which are available through a number of

1619
01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:19.390
book retailers. In fact, my, my first book is

1620
01:27:19.399 --> 01:27:22.379
open access with the Australian National University Press that

1621
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:25.839
is all about um the history of history and

1622
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:28.819
different ways you can use history as a political

1623
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:31.680
tool. And that's the histories of Rafael Samuel, portrait

1624
01:27:31.689 --> 01:27:33.970
of a people's historian. Um I have a book

1625
01:27:33.979 --> 01:27:36.450
on the art of everyday anarchy. Um And you

1626
01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:39.689
can find that through various bookshops or ideally through

1627
01:27:39.779 --> 01:27:43.290
uh libraries, particularly college libraries. My next book is

1628
01:27:43.299 --> 01:27:46.729
coming out with Oxford University Press, probably beginning of

1629
01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:49.419
next year and that's looking at activist politics during

1630
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:51.600
the Cold War. Um And then I have a

1631
01:27:51.609 --> 01:27:54.529
book about a new philosophy of liberty that will

1632
01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.180
be forthcoming in early 2025. Um You can also

1633
01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:01.700
find some videos of me talking about anarchism, various

1634
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:04.810
kinds forms, varieties. Um And they can all be

1635
01:28:04.819 --> 01:28:07.350
found via the Institute of Art and Ideas um

1636
01:28:07.359 --> 01:28:09.740
channel or um found on youtube.

1637
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.169
Great. So I will be leaving some links to

1638
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:15.990
that in the description and Sophie. Thank you very

1639
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.390
much again for the conversation. It was very informative

1640
01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:21.959
