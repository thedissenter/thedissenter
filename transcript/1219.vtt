00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.860
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.779
today I'm joined by Doctor Sami Timimi. He's a

4
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:13.300
consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. He's also an experienced

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.260
psychotherapist, and today we're going to talk about his

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.780
latest book, Searching for Normal A New Approach to

7
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.620
Understanding Mental Health. So Doctor Tamimi, welcome to the

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.479
show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.790
Thank you so much for inviting me. I look

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.469
forward to our conversation.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.799
Yeah, likewise. So, uh, tell us first, uh, what

12
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:40.240
would you say is the main argument of your

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.040
book before we get into specifics

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.319
here? I am arguing that the way we imagine

15
00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.209
mental health to be is a set of mythologies

16
00:00:55.209 --> 00:01:02.220
that have spread around that mental distress and behavioral

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.900
difference is due to something internal to our brains

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.000
and bodies. Um, AND the, the way we understand

19
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.900
and the framework we make to understanding what we

20
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.040
mean by mental health has very powerful effects on

21
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:27.790
the people who get these labels. So that's my

22
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.610
first um argument uh is uh and in effect

23
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.849
what we're calling mental health because it's subjectively defined.

24
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.440
There is a. Way of thinking about mental health,

25
00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.639
which means that we literally don't know what we're

26
00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.680
talking about when it comes to mental health, but

27
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.910
we act in the press, in academic papers, as

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.220
if we do. So I'm questioning some of these

29
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.900
foundational assumptions, and I'm questioning the effects of these

30
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.019
foundational assumptions. So I go on to argue that

31
00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:09.508
what we call psychiatric diagnoses are not diagnoses, but

32
00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:15.110
they're better understood as commercial brands. In that they

33
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.320
have become commodities that are sold to people. And

34
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.639
uh so they've become a source of profit rather

35
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.399
than a source of understanding what's happening in a

36
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:34.449
person. And I then speculate about why this has

37
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.190
grown so quickly in the last number of years.

38
00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.619
So, in the second half, or rather the, the

39
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.919
last third of the book, I'm looking at the

40
00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.559
potential political, economic drivers of what, of the creation

41
00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.740
of what I call a mental health industrial complex.

42
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.919
And a mental health industrial complex that has merged

43
00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.520
with a strand in politics, which we often refer

44
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.369
to as identity politics. And I point out the

45
00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:13.009
fact that this may reflect a decline in the

46
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.419
Western psychiatric uh sorry, in the Western capitalist empire.

47
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.589
So that there are socioeconomic routes to this spread

48
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.190
of a mental health industrial complex, which has two

49
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.949
sides to it. One, we've got a population that

50
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:36.389
are increasingly pessimistic, that feel society is broken. And

51
00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.830
that don't believe that politicians have any um way

52
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.270
of addressing those declines. So it's a price, a

53
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.369
crisis of economy, but also a crisis of legitimacy.

54
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.380
And this, so this results in a large degree

55
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.179
of alienation, insecurity, and general distress in the population.

56
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.009
And this then becomes a new source of profit.

57
00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:07.759
So rather than this turning into opportunities for social

58
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.960
solidarity. And the types of structural changes that may

59
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.639
make a difference. Instead, these are being encouraged to

60
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.910
be internalized as problems within a person and for

61
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.119
them to seek their solution and to seek a

62
00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:29.100
sense of liberation, if you like, through labels and

63
00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:33.980
various products associated with these psychiatric labels.

64
00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:38.850
OK, so lots of things to unpack there and

65
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.500
of course we're going to make connections as you

66
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.059
mentioned there with politics, economics, I think anthropology as

67
00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.799
well, but uh let's start with your critique of

68
00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:55.700
uh of how psychiatry and clinical psychology approach mental

69
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.320
health today. So first of all, when are experiences

70
00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:03.640
symptoms?

71
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:11.829
That's a really good question because um What uh

72
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.470
what has happened in our mental health ideology is.

73
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:22.399
That what we have as individuals, as people trying

74
00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.679
to make sense of our world is we have

75
00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.480
experiences, we have behaviors, and we're always trying to

76
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.000
make sense of these. One thing that we have

77
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.320
in common with each other is that we're essentially

78
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.420
meaning making creatures. We, we want to understand, we

79
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.869
want to understand the world. Around us for um

80
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.450
not just our physical needs, but also our um

81
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.480
sense of. What we, where we fit in, what's

82
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.929
going on around us, kind of these more existential.

83
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.109
Uh, MENTAL needs. So we try to make sense

84
00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:09.250
of our, our circumstances and particularly when we're suffering

85
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.170
or when we're distressed, when things don't feel right

86
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.470
in our, in our worlds, that's when we're really

87
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.609
trying to find ways to make sense of things.

88
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.739
Yeah. When we call these experiences of distress or

89
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.480
feelings of not fitting in or feelings that things

90
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.640
are not going right, when we start calling these

91
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:37.279
symptoms. We've provided a framework for that making sense

92
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.869
efforts. But that framework has consequences. So one thing

93
00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.190
I try to point out is that in our

94
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.910
attempts to make sense of things, the framework we

95
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.579
choose to make sense of what's happening. Has a

96
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:58.220
huge impact on us and how we feel and

97
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.899
how we um decide to um tackle those experiences

98
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.649
that we're having. So when we start calling experiences

99
00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:15.380
symptoms. We are into a framework where we're thinking

100
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.399
that these uh cos what are symptoms in medical

101
00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.390
terms, symptoms are generally referred to things that are,

102
00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:26.760
we're experiencing that are due to some sort of

103
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.519
medical problem. In other words, there's something wrong with

104
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:36.390
you. Um, AND in that medical framework, what we

105
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.619
do with symptoms is we try to manage them,

106
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.350
get rid of them, hopefully, or reduce them. That

107
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.390
becomes the aim of an intervention in medical terms.

108
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.019
So if you have a cough, you go to

109
00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:52.309
your doctor, you're hoping that the doctor will, you

110
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:55.390
know, examine you, find out, um, maybe run some

111
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.350
tests because you want to find out the cause

112
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.350
of that cough because that will affect the treatment.

113
00:08:01.109 --> 00:08:03.029
And in the treatment, you're trying to get rid

114
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:05.269
of the cough, you're trying to understand what, what's

115
00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:07.250
going on with the cough so that you can

116
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.540
treat that, that as a symptom, so a cough

117
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.190
becomes a symptom, so that's what we do. In

118
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.070
general medicine, when we start calling experiences of distress,

119
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:24.279
of anxiety, of um, Impulsivity or whatever it is,

120
00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:29.769
when we start calling these general subjective experiences symptoms,

121
00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:34.229
we've put it into a certain framework. Now, um

122
00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:41.409
There are situations where these experiences can be symptoms.

123
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.700
So there are certain conditions in medicine, for example,

124
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.750
hypothyroidism slows your metabolism up and you're much more

125
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.679
likely to feel um to have a low mood.

126
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.030
In that case, low mood could be a symptom.

127
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.219
Yes. But we've put a whole range of experiences

128
00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:07.440
into this bucket full of what we're calling symptoms.

129
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.700
And a whole range of human experiences where there

130
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.260
isn't a pathology that you can, you know, in

131
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.020
the brains or the body of the person that

132
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.090
you can identify. Um, AND when we start doing

133
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:28.280
that, we're, uh, potentially turning. Other ways of understanding

134
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.349
these experiences. We're turning um lots of experiences into

135
00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:39.179
something that is a bit like meaningless torture. So

136
00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.780
if you're very distressed and you start to think

137
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.140
that this is the caused by some sort of

138
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.979
medical problem in your brain. And you have no

139
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.599
other way of making sense of it or actually

140
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.929
being able to. Um, HAVE a sense of agency,

141
00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:02.010
in, in other words, a sense that you can

142
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.890
be part of trying to understand that, deal with

143
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.159
that. With the help of other people or you

144
00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:13.159
know, making sense of things that have happened in

145
00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:17.599
your life, then it becomes meaningless torture, rather than

146
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:20.919
something that you can get other meanings from. And

147
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:24.960
also it uh it has the potential to deprive

148
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.559
you of um so you, you in, in some

149
00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:33.159
ways you start passing on that distress for a

150
00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:37.380
professional to deal with. You're, you're selling your emotional

151
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.849
life to a professional, uh and so it. It

152
00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:47.030
can and often does set up a pathway towards

153
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:52.130
a part of yourself. That you now feel is

154
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.570
something that shouldn't be there, something that you need

155
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.840
to manage, something that you need to suppress. And

156
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.140
if whatever intervention you get doesn't do that. You

157
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.159
start to feel that this bit is more and

158
00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:10.099
more powerful and the one thing that, the other

159
00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:13.340
thing that can make it even more powerful is

160
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.619
that if you go to a professional, um maybe

161
00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:21.590
they prescribe medication, whatever. And it does improve things,

162
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.729
but it keeps coming back. That uh that can

163
00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:28.809
convince you even more that there is this part

164
00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:31.049
of you that you are sicker than you thought

165
00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:33.929
you were, that there is uh this is a

166
00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:37.059
bigger problem in your life. And I see this

167
00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:41.340
quite often nowadays, um, you then start collecting more

168
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:47.520
labels, more medications, more interventions, both psychological or pharmacological

169
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.900
or other types of interventions. Meanwhile, you're strengthening this

170
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.979
idea, uh, each step along the way, when things

171
00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:57.530
don't improve or things improve and come back again,

172
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.059
you're strengthening this idea that there's a part of

173
00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:05.190
you that's more and more powerful. So the framework

174
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.909
we choose to make sense of our experiences has

175
00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:13.549
incredibly powerful effects on our experiences. This is why

176
00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:15.630
I say that in, in my line of work

177
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:20.000
as a psychiatrist. We're not dealing with emotions, we're

178
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.900
dealing with what I call meta-emotions. We're dealing with

179
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.700
what framework are we going to choose to make

180
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.559
sense of someone's experiences, because the framework we choose.

181
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.679
It's going to have very powerful effects. And so

182
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.809
getting back to your original questions, when do we

183
00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:44.250
know if something and experiences symptoms. When it comes

184
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.039
to mental health, we don't. This is why I

185
00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:53.650
say we have models. With consequences. The idea that

186
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.250
we're going to get to a truth is not

187
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.049
part of the sorts of areas of work that

188
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.090
professionals like myself are involved in. We are, we,

189
00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:09.739
we cannot find a truth. What we are offering

190
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.159
is different ways of making sense of experiences, and

191
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.359
we always need to be aware in the back

192
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:18.820
of our minds. That the models that we're choosing,

193
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.469
that we're creating with the people we work with,

194
00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:24.409
they have consequences, so choose carefully.

195
00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:28.820
So let me ask you now because then I

196
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.340
want to ask you about uh your approach and

197
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.260
what you think about mental illness, but how do

198
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.280
we arrive at an understanding of normal? I mean,

199
00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:44.780
how do we determine what's normal and what do

200
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.900
we mean by that?

201
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.989
We can't. Um, I, I know that's the title

202
00:13:50.989 --> 00:13:54.390
of my book, Searching for Normal. It is, it

203
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.330
is the, the key word is searching. Mhm. In

204
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.070
other words, um, at the end of the book,

205
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:08.469
I, I, I, um, quote this saying that up

206
00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:11.630
close no one is normal. This is, this is

207
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.929
part of, part of what I'm trying to help

208
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:22.289
people understand. That how we understand normal is very

209
00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:27.400
culturally and socially determined. It relates to what model

210
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.820
of human nature do we hold. Where does that

211
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.020
come from? Um, WHAT model of self do we

212
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.659
hold? Where does that come from? These are all

213
00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:45.580
things that are, if you like, socially constructed. They

214
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.700
relate to what's going on in our society, which

215
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:57.390
relates to various things, historical, economic, um, political, uh,

216
00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:01.599
it can relate also to religious ideas. So we

217
00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:04.559
construct an idea, and so what I'm trying to

218
00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:07.479
suggest in the book is the way we're constructing

219
00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:14.799
our idea of normal. In recent years, and this

220
00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:20.059
reflects a deterioration in the state of our economy

221
00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:22.840
and in the state of uh and in the

222
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.580
amount of distress and also the amount of alienation

223
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.479
and lack of meaning that people have in their

224
00:15:29.479 --> 00:15:36.619
lives cos um. We have developed a what I

225
00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:42.169
refer to as a hyper-individualistic model of human beings.

226
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.780
So, our, our concept of what we imagine to

227
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.539
be normal is, has got narrower and narrower and

228
00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:55.609
narrower. Which is why in the book, I, um,

229
00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:58.539
in clinical practice, which I explain in the book,

230
00:15:58.619 --> 00:16:01.960
I prefer not to use the concept of normal,

231
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.469
I prefer to use the concept of ordinary. And

232
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:13.179
or understandable. Um, uh. And I and I, I

233
00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:17.729
put. I assume the people who walk in the

234
00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:23.309
door in my clinical practice. They will, their experiences

235
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:26.830
will fit into what I consider to be ordinary

236
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.369
and or understandable until proven otherwise. That's my starting

237
00:16:31.369 --> 00:16:35.859
point assumption about um So for example, one way

238
00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:39.799
of thinking about that is that as human beings.

239
00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:44.159
We're built, when bad things happen to us, we

240
00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:47.489
feel bad. So you take that as a starting

241
00:16:47.489 --> 00:16:50.229
point. Now you might not necessarily understand how that

242
00:16:50.229 --> 00:16:54.049
all links together, but you start with people feeling

243
00:16:54.049 --> 00:16:59.080
bad. Most likely uh way of helping people understand

244
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.180
that. Is because bad things have happened and most

245
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.900
of my clinics, and I suspect most mental health

246
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.500
professionals' clinics tend to have more people who've had

247
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.910
bad things happen in their life. Um, Um, ANOTHER

248
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.780
way of, uh, of understanding thinking in that way,

249
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.780
that, um, type of model is, um. When bad

250
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:32.930
things happened in your childhood. Is that has another

251
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.079
sort of impact on you. Because as you're growing

252
00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:40.229
up, you don't have a sense of um that

253
00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:43.560
is your normal, that is your ordinary, whatever's happening

254
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.479
to you. So you might not think of it

255
00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:48.680
in, in those ways. But it might have done

256
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.949
things like um and again I see this quite

257
00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:57.800
often, um is that it makes trusting adults, trusting

258
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.239
people around you, much harder. So a lot of

259
00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:04.479
the people who walk in. To my clinic doors

260
00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:07.800
have real problems with trust. They wanna be close

261
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.339
to people, they get close to people, they, they

262
00:18:11.439 --> 00:18:13.959
um don't have trust that this is going to

263
00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:18.589
work out. So there are uh the, the model

264
00:18:18.589 --> 00:18:23.500
that we choose. Again, has really important consequences on

265
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.869
how we understand and how we work then therapeutically.

266
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.209
So again, just coming back to your original question.

267
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.689
Normal is a construct. And there are a lot

268
00:18:35.689 --> 00:18:40.250
of things that um contribute to that construct and

269
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.849
how uh and a lot of it relates to

270
00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:48.859
how we conceptualize. What human nature is, and that

271
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.599
conceptualization of human nature is there isn't a natural

272
00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.079
state that this is human nature and this is

273
00:18:56.079 --> 00:19:01.199
not. That conceptualization of human nature is very dependent

274
00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:05.880
on your culture, on your society, and um on

275
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.910
the economic system. And um that's how we construct

276
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.050
our idea of normal, so the, so I'm also

277
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.579
questioning. How we think about what we consider to

278
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:19.140
be normal.

279
00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:24.949
So you said that when a patient walks into

280
00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:30.530
your clinic, uh, you assume that whatever they're going

281
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:36.910
to uh manifest is uh ordinary or. Understandable. I

282
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.189
mean, when is it that you consider it to

283
00:19:40.189 --> 00:19:45.569
not be ordinary or understandable, and would you use

284
00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:51.189
a label like mental illness uh to attach to

285
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:51.550
that?

286
00:19:53.339 --> 00:20:01.650
I, so I've been In um psychiatry since 1989.

287
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.189
I've been a consultant child and adolescents. I started

288
00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:07.180
in child, my first job in child and adolescent

289
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.300
psychiatry was 1992. And I've been a consultant since

290
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.790
1997, so I have many decades of experience. I've

291
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:22.869
been inpatient, outpatient. Worked with learning difficulties, etc. Um,

292
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:29.310
AND, uh, I have to say that even in

293
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.810
the, so I've seen the full range of severity

294
00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:37.719
of presentations and even in the most severe presentations,

295
00:20:37.989 --> 00:20:42.750
I haven't, I very rarely come across people who

296
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.329
I don't think can fit into that category. I,

297
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.420
I, I do, um, I do think it is

298
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.010
important to screen for physical conditions because there are

299
00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.599
times when certain experiences can be, um, at least

300
00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:05.449
in part a manifestation or related to physical, um,

301
00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:09.329
conditions, and I have picked up. Certain physical conditions

302
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:12.719
in uh some people um uh over the years,

303
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.949
so that's one area where you can say, OK,

304
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.849
this is likely to have been a contributor. Very

305
00:21:19.849 --> 00:21:22.410
rarely the full story either, but it's likely to

306
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:29.079
have been a contributor. Um, The one condition or

307
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:35.599
presentation that is um makes it much harder to

308
00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:40.359
stick in that area is when people are uh

309
00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:44.300
what we refer to as thought disordered. So when

310
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.819
it becomes really hard to have any conversation that

311
00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:54.709
at least in some way makes sense. Um, uh.

312
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.329
And, and there are, there are degrees, but they

313
00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:03.270
tend to be a lot more difficult to um

314
00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:08.400
manage without going down the pathway of, for example,

315
00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.770
using some sort of medication for a period of

316
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.219
time. Um, AND there's a lot of reasons why

317
00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:18.420
people might end up in, in such a confused

318
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.170
state that they're no longer able to make sense.

319
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.300
Their, their connection with the world has, has, um,

320
00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:30.500
really been disrupted. But even a lot of people

321
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.140
who present with uh what phenomenologically we refer to

322
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:42.300
as psychotic experiences, like um hearing auditory hallucinations, what

323
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.780
we call, so you're, you're, you perceive that you're

324
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.579
hearing voices externally, but there is no voices externally,

325
00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:56.500
so it's a. A perceptual um problem. Or people

326
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.160
who have delusions. Or what we consider to be

327
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:07.280
delusions, they often have a, a um. They often

328
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.349
have a, a meaning behind them. So, um, er,

329
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.500
even people who are presenting like that. You can

330
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.500
still, uh, quite often, and I've, I've worked successfully

331
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.219
with people who present in that way without needing

332
00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:27.540
to use medication or just using medication for very

333
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.060
short periods. And when we do use medication, my

334
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.069
uh my um approach to it is to um

335
00:23:37.569 --> 00:23:42.479
understand that med medication is never the treatment. It

336
00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:45.920
is an adjunct, so it might create a window

337
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.459
of opportunity, it might allow the person to become,

338
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.239
cos they're often very highly aroused to become less

339
00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:59.199
aroused, and that might make a possibility to um

340
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.660
discuss certain things or look at work on certain

341
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.670
things. Um, And uh I've found over the years

342
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.829
this is the best way of managing risk. Is

343
00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:17.510
having a therapeutic alliance, is taking people seriously, is

344
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.469
not just looking at the, in psychiatry, you're meant

345
00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:23.069
to look at the form and the content is

346
00:24:23.069 --> 00:24:26.099
not as important. Well, I think they both are,

347
00:24:26.469 --> 00:24:31.109
you know, people's content, their delusions often ref reflect

348
00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:38.119
something. Um, But you do from time to time

349
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.300
have to take a step back and say. This

350
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.729
situation is too risky to manage in the community.

351
00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:52.949
Um, But over the years I've observed that the

352
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.680
people that I've been seeing. I, I, for, for

353
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.329
a while I managed an inpatient unit. For about

354
00:25:01.329 --> 00:25:07.869
5 years, um. And um we developed a process

355
00:25:07.869 --> 00:25:12.750
where we would um go and before we agreed

356
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.560
to admission of person, we had an emergency admission

357
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.270
line, but there were lots of referrals made for

358
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.739
arranged admissions and we had a process where we

359
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.709
had a team that would go out, a couple

360
00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:26.869
of people, 2 or 3 people would go out

361
00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:29.349
and interview the family and then I would see

362
00:25:29.349 --> 00:25:35.540
them and they would, uh, and. We tried to

363
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.930
do our best to help people not come in,

364
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.550
and we followed them up, so we were doing

365
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.729
a lot of this. And during my time as

366
00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:48.530
a consultant psychiatrist, the, um, at some point, the

367
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.729
head of the trust, because the way that we

368
00:25:51.729 --> 00:25:55.209
work in the UK we're now divided into what's

369
00:25:55.209 --> 00:25:59.199
called mental health trusts. So each county tends to

370
00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:02.430
have a mental health trust. And they're almost set

371
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.489
up as a bit like um a, a private

372
00:26:06.489 --> 00:26:08.900
business in that the Mental Health Trust has a

373
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.250
budget, it gets allocated a budget for certain things

374
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.010
that it provides. And at one point the. The

375
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.650
chief executive of our trust came to visit me

376
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.489
and said. Um, HOW come you have so few

377
00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:28.969
patients? You know, if you carry on like this,

378
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.010
we're going to have to close this down. Is

379
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.939
this what you want? So anyway, eventually I, I

380
00:26:33.939 --> 00:26:38.349
was moved on from there. And um the unit

381
00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:41.670
just started being full again. So we had 12

382
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.630
beds and at times we were down to 3

383
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.790
or 4 patients, so we did a really good

384
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:51.780
job in not needing to um. Uh, HAVE patients

385
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.859
in, and that has carried on in my outpatient

386
00:26:54.859 --> 00:26:58.180
work. There's very few times where I end up.

387
00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:04.119
Um, NEEDING or wanting to refer somebody in for

388
00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:07.119
inpatient treatment, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't.

389
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:12.660
There are times where, um, that becomes, uh, necessary.

390
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.329
But even when it does become necessary, um. It's

391
00:27:18.329 --> 00:27:21.010
important from my point of view, not to see

392
00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:25.609
that as a confirmation. It's just that it's a

393
00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:28.770
particular time, so I've seen so many people who've

394
00:27:29.089 --> 00:27:32.930
been in and out of um inpatient units, and

395
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:38.430
I've kept the idea alive that, OK, maybe not

396
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.729
yet, but at some point things are gonna make

397
00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:44.569
sense to you, the penny is gonna drop. I

398
00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:46.410
don't know how it will come, I don't know

399
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.050
when it will come, I don't know what the

400
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.410
thing that will, but my experience is that at

401
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.589
some point something will start to make sense. And

402
00:27:55.589 --> 00:27:59.250
all the things we've been talking about. Will start

403
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.000
to make sense. And you'll start to recover. So

404
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.930
I've seen people who've been really disabled, functioning, hardly

405
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.239
functioning at all. Who've made incredible recoveries after several

406
00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:15.099
years of in and out, um, and you just

407
00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:16.859
don't know when that will happen, but it is

408
00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:21.199
important to keep that hope alive. So, um, there,

409
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.989
my clinical experience kind of matches this idea that.

410
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.849
The framework you choose. Don't lose sight of it,

411
00:28:30.979 --> 00:28:36.569
even when people are really um functionally impaired. Maybe

412
00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:40.699
needing the safety of an inpatient unit. It's, it's

413
00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:45.050
never the final word. It's not a confirmation that

414
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.420
there's something broken in their brain. I see very

415
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.069
few people where I could say that's the case.

416
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.339
Uh, I would like to ask you, what is

417
00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:59.099
your opinion on the fact that people nowadays or

418
00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:05.660
many more people are receiving mental disorder diagnosis. I

419
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:11.219
mean, because, uh, many people say that, uh, the

420
00:29:11.219 --> 00:29:16.900
reason why, for example, today people get more ADHD,

421
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.979
autism, depression, anxiety diagnosis is that Uh, we now

422
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:27.300
have a better understanding of what those conditions are

423
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.660
because, for example, in the past, uh, some of

424
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.300
the behaviors that resulted from that might have been

425
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:39.089
considered just, uh, moral failings or people being, I

426
00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:42.609
don't know, possessed by demons or something like that.

427
00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:46.140
Uh, AND, and now we have better, and they

428
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.599
say that we have better diagnostic. Tools, better diagnostic

429
00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:56.359
procedures, better diagnostic criteria, and we have studied those

430
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.239
conditions more and have a and have a better

431
00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:03.140
understanding of what they are and how they work.

432
00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:06.160
Um, WHAT is your opinion about that? Do you

433
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.959
think they're right or do you think that there

434
00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:13.800
are perhaps some issues with how those conditions are

435
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.739
diagnosed?

436
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.410
No, they're not right, um, and yes there are

437
00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:26.530
major, major issues. Let's take one example. Um, So

438
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.650
there has been a massive increase in the numbers

439
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.689
of people getting uh attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD

440
00:30:34.689 --> 00:30:37.969
diagnoses. There's been a massive increase in the number

441
00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:44.760
of people getting autism diagnoses. Um, So if I

442
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.359
just deal with those examples, and the other thing

443
00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:51.479
in child and adolescent mental health is um a

444
00:30:51.479 --> 00:30:54.619
massive increase in the number of people getting depression

445
00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:57.859
diagnoses in childhood, which they didn't used to get.

446
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.449
So what's happening is what I call a mutation

447
00:31:02.449 --> 00:31:10.160
of constructs. So, um, take something like, um, ADHD.

448
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.979
When I first started practicing. And back in 1992,

449
00:31:16.069 --> 00:31:19.969
there was that that wasn't even a concept. In

450
00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:24.640
the UK Um, there was a concept of hyperkinetic

451
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.510
disorder which focused on activity levels, you know, uh,

452
00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:32.739
how, how active children were. It was considered extremely

453
00:31:32.739 --> 00:31:36.339
rare. It was considered that if you had learning

454
00:31:36.339 --> 00:31:40.959
difficulties, that would automatically exclude you. Um, BECAUSE that

455
00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:47.640
was considered to be sufficient explanation. And um it

456
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.189
was, uh, therefore something that was not really. Part

457
00:31:53.189 --> 00:31:56.510
of the way of thinking and part of the

458
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.069
things that we looked for when we saw children

459
00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:01.390
and young people. By the way, I kind of

460
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.770
consider myself a traditional child and adolescent psychiatrist because

461
00:32:06.069 --> 00:32:11.469
in that first um posting. Uh, THE department I

462
00:32:11.469 --> 00:32:15.140
worked in was mainly systemic in the way it

463
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.310
thought, so always thought about what's going on around

464
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.829
the child and also developmental. Always thought about the

465
00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:25.869
idea that children change, in fact we change throughout

466
00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:28.109
our lives, and those are two principles that are

467
00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:32.150
very important to me. The idea, think about the

468
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.160
context and keep in mind that change is the

469
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:42.439
one constant. Anyway, so, um, hyperkinetic disorder. I, I

470
00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:46.079
didn't see anybody with that diagnosis in my first

471
00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:50.709
few years, it just wasn't a thing. Then in

472
00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:54.930
um in, I think it was 1995 or 1996,

473
00:32:54.989 --> 00:32:57.869
I was at a placement, uh, so I was

474
00:32:57.869 --> 00:33:01.189
being uh a trainee in child psychiatry by that

475
00:33:01.189 --> 00:33:04.310
point and the consultant who was um my supervisor

476
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.910
wanted to do some research on ADHD. It was

477
00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:13.060
just coming in as a concept. And he asked

478
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.280
me if I would like to join him. One

479
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.319
of the reasons we were in a part of

480
00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:21.660
East London, which had a large ethnic minority community,

481
00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:25.079
and the children from this ethnic minority community, there

482
00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:29.839
were large numbers of them being expelled from schools

483
00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:33.670
due to behavior problems. So this consultant thought, well,

484
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.459
I wonder if this concept of ADHD might be

485
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:41.020
useful here, might explain this. So anyway, I agreed

486
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.380
to do the research. I was, uh, uh, you

487
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.420
know, I was in my early days of um

488
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.180
becoming quite keen on the academic side. So I

489
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.079
went away to do a literature review and um

490
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.900
my experience of doing the literature review really enlightened

491
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:04.180
me to all sorts of problems with the. Um,

492
00:34:04.189 --> 00:34:11.188
SCIENTIFIC basis of this concept of ADHD. And it

493
00:34:11.188 --> 00:34:13.560
really took me on a path to then start

494
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.870
questioning all sorts of other concepts. The advantage of

495
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.770
studying ADHD at that time is that it was

496
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.969
a new concept. So, I was, uh, rather than

497
00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.728
a concept that you'd inherited and, you know, didn't

498
00:34:25.728 --> 00:34:28.159
really have the time to go and look at

499
00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.478
where does it come from, what, what's the arguments.

500
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.770
Here was a new concept, at least to the

501
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.530
UK. And so looking through the literature, I had

502
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:41.719
this, um, there, there's a saying in um In

503
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.678
Britain. That something is a will of the wisp.

504
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.399
What this means is that a will of the

505
00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:53.679
wisp is a type of fog, a type of

506
00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.729
mist. Where you see something in the mist, you

507
00:34:57.729 --> 00:34:59.849
think you see something, but every time you go

508
00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:03.049
there, it seems to disappear, and then you see

509
00:35:03.049 --> 00:35:05.718
it again, and it just keeps disappearing, a bit

510
00:35:05.718 --> 00:35:08.860
like a mirage. But it's a kind of a

511
00:35:08.929 --> 00:35:13.070
um. So, uh, so I had this sense, I

512
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.659
tried to, I was trying to, what is ADHD?

513
00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:19.989
Where is it? How, how do I know? um,

514
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.870
AND I had this will of the wisp feeling

515
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.070
as I was doing this literature review because it

516
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.110
seemed to me ADHD was being proposed as a

517
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:36.469
concept. And it was accepted in these um literature

518
00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:41.899
as a concept that was already valid. And I

519
00:35:41.899 --> 00:35:45.780
kept thinking, hang on a minute. You're telling me

520
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.659
all these facts about prevalence, about presentation. And are

521
00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:53.820
you telling me that these are just descriptions of

522
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.969
behavior? Is that all it is? And of course

523
00:35:56.969 --> 00:36:00.050
that was, was all it is, a descriptions of

524
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:04.889
behavior. So I knew from the start, the empirical

525
00:36:04.889 --> 00:36:09.300
basis had never been established. There was, uh, it

526
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.479
was, it's what I call upside down science. You

527
00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:17.300
start with assuming something is real. And, um, and,

528
00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:20.530
and they were already calling it a neurodevelopmental problem.

529
00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:23.229
Well, where, where is your evidence that it's neuro?

530
00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:27.739
Where is your evidence anyway? So, um, that experience

531
00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:31.870
was, was very um. Uh, IT taught me a

532
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.669
lot. And it taught me that, you know, you

533
00:36:34.669 --> 00:36:37.199
need to go back and question the basics. Don't

534
00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:42.199
assume something has been shown factually to be correct

535
00:36:42.629 --> 00:36:46.600
until you find the evidence. Don't do this upside

536
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.570
down science. Um, SO what I've seen from there,

537
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.439
once I've understood this, that a concept like ADHD

538
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:59.500
is simply a description of certain behaviors, calling them

539
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:05.169
symptoms is a conceptual jump. Calling it neurodevelopmental is

540
00:37:05.169 --> 00:37:08.570
a conceptual jump, calling it genetic is a conceptual

541
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:13.250
jump. And it gets even worse because what happened,

542
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.969
I've been engaged in this literature, I've been engaged

543
00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:21.250
in articles debating these things with other people, and

544
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:26.260
what tends to happen. Is You're asking critics of

545
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.239
the concept to prove their criticisms. But actually the

546
00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:35.719
critics of the concepts, that's upside down science. COS

547
00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:39.159
in science you should always assume your hypothesis isn't

548
00:37:39.159 --> 00:37:42.520
true until you can show that it's true. You

549
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.040
shouldn't assume it's true until somebody else can show

550
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.000
that it's not true. That's not how science works.

551
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.100
Um, ALL a critic like myself needs to show

552
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:57.679
is that you haven't demonstrated genetics, you haven't demonstrated

553
00:37:57.679 --> 00:38:02.639
any neuro, uh, um, basis, neurological or chemical imbalance

554
00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:10.090
basis. That is um definable, characteristic, um, so you

555
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.100
haven't shown me why these behaviors are symptoms. That's

556
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.699
all I need to do is, is need to.

557
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.010
Explain the lack of evidence. So what's happened is

558
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.729
that this construct starts as a construct, as an

559
00:38:25.729 --> 00:38:28.810
idea, and it just keeps, and because it's subjective,

560
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:34.590
because it's behaviors, it just keeps expanding. Um, SO,

561
00:38:34.899 --> 00:38:38.790
ADHD comes into the UK. Originally it was thought

562
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:43.310
to have a prevalence of maybe about 0.5% of

563
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:49.719
children. Over the years, it's expanded and expanded. 5%

564
00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:54.709
to 10% is now the generally accepted. Originally it

565
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:58.290
was still thought of as developmental, which meant that

566
00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.870
most children are expected to grow out of it.

567
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:06.090
When you start adding in different ideas, you then

568
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.689
start expanding it further. So when you focus, for

569
00:39:09.689 --> 00:39:17.050
example, on lack of attention. That makes it easier

570
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.449
to expand it into an idea of adult ADHD.

571
00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:25.919
And then you change the, you, you start arguing

572
00:39:25.919 --> 00:39:28.719
that when it's in adults, it presents differently to

573
00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:32.540
when it's in children. So you start introducing new

574
00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:36.830
things, behaviors that you now call symptoms. So it'd

575
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:42.149
be things like poor time management or um uh

576
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:47.729
being disorganized. Then it um so then it expands

577
00:39:47.729 --> 00:39:53.510
to becoming a lifelong condition, not just developmental. And

578
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.860
then you change the construct again, so the concept

579
00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.830
of masking comes in. And the idea of masking

580
00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.889
is you do have the symptoms, but you don't

581
00:40:02.889 --> 00:40:05.389
show them because you're very good at hiding them.

582
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:10.010
And that it's women who do this, mainly. But

583
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.810
when you get home, all of these things come

584
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:18.320
out in a very disorganized life and um. So

585
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.360
when you introduce the concept of masking, to say

586
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.000
actually the reason why women don't get this diagnosis

587
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
is because they're good at masking, you've expanded it

588
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
again. At no point has there been any scientific

589
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.320
discovery. At no point has anybody shown what the

590
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:43.060
so-called biological difference or um. Lack or chemical imbalance,

591
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.560
at no point has anybody shown this. So this

592
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.739
is why I call it a mutation of constructs.

593
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.219
But it has a very powerful effect on how

594
00:40:52.219 --> 00:40:55.679
you then interpret what's happening in your life. And

595
00:40:55.679 --> 00:41:01.520
as it's expanded, We've got into the situation where

596
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:09.239
people now identify with their so-called disorder. Um, I

597
00:41:09.239 --> 00:41:15.560
wrote about er er somebody called Matilda Bosley. Who

598
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.659
is a journalist in Melbourne, who talked about how

599
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.219
TikTok helped her discover that she had ADHD. Because

600
00:41:26.229 --> 00:41:30.520
the algorithm kept sending videos to her of people

601
00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:33.739
with ADHD because of the types of interests she

602
00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:37.780
had. So she goes and gets a diagnosis. You

603
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.340
know, pays, pays for somebody to do an assessment

604
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.860
and things have got very expensive to do that,

605
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.169
gets the diagnosis. And it leads to her reinterpreting

606
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:52.070
a whole lot of things in her life. Um,

607
00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:56.419
SO she talks about, for example, I, the reason

608
00:41:56.419 --> 00:41:59.340
why my flat was untidy, I used to think

609
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.189
it was because I was lazy. Now I realize

610
00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:08.070
it's because I lack dopamine. So she's taken on

611
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.209
this idea that there's something in her brain that

612
00:42:12.209 --> 00:42:15.090
meant certain bits of her life are not the

613
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:20.010
way she had hoped or she imagined. Um Uh,

614
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:25.639
AND this is where we found concepts that were

615
00:42:25.639 --> 00:42:31.340
originally rare. Um, MEANT to be for children who

616
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.879
will often grow out of it. Um, HAVE spread

617
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.860
to parts of the population who are otherwise very

618
00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:44.919
successful. So, um, more and more of people who

619
00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:48.500
are, uh, who've been, had successful careers, who are

620
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.300
in the public eye, who are, um, actors or

621
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:57.270
journalists or musicians. ARE now coming out and saying

622
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.610
that they have this condition like ADHD or autism.

623
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.350
Uh, SO we've seen this, so we've seen this

624
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.610
expansion, and it's a mutation of constructs. There's, there's

625
00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:14.110
no, no one has actually found or been able

626
00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.129
to demonstrate that the people who get these diagnoses

627
00:43:17.129 --> 00:43:21.770
have something specifically wrong or different, uh, about them

628
00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:25.330
in their biology. Childhood depression is a good example

629
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.469
of expansion the other way around. When I was

630
00:43:28.469 --> 00:43:32.389
training, childhood depression was felt to be something that

631
00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:35.729
children. Young people don't get because they're not psychologically

632
00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:41.070
mature enough, cognitively. And also it was felt that

633
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.389
if you do present in a similar way to

634
00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:48.570
adults. Then uh that's usually the result of severe

635
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.590
trauma. That sometimes you do get that and it

636
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.189
was not amenable to medication, for example. The childhood

637
00:43:56.189 --> 00:43:59.389
depression is an example of a successful import from

638
00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:03.070
adult psychiatry. Again, you have to change the um

639
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.229
way, the idea that it in children it presents

640
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:09.729
differently, but it's the same condition. So in children,

641
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.489
the idea became that it might present as irritation,

642
00:44:13.669 --> 00:44:18.550
frustration, arguments, um, the sorts of things that a

643
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.439
lot of adolescents do. Um, AND that it was

644
00:44:22.439 --> 00:44:25.459
amenable to the same sort of treatments, so it

645
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.719
introduced the idea of using so-called antidepressants, which is

646
00:44:29.719 --> 00:44:34.439
a marketing term, uh, in children. So, these expansions

647
00:44:34.439 --> 00:44:38.919
have happened. And there are changes in constructs, they

648
00:44:38.919 --> 00:44:43.120
are changes in belief system. They are not associated

649
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.699
with a better understanding. They are associated with a

650
00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:49.199
fictional understanding. Mm,

651
00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:52.919
uh, OK, so, uh, let me just be, uh,

652
00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:55.919
a little bit provocative here, if I may, pro

653
00:44:55.929 --> 00:44:58.699
provocative to you, both to you and to the

654
00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:04.760
people who approach psychiatry in a more, um, let's

655
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.810
say. The mainstream way, uh, do you think that

656
00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:14.459
these labels and people identifying with these labels like

657
00:45:14.459 --> 00:45:20.270
depression, anxiety, ADHD, and so on, um, uh, I

658
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.580
mean, uh, as you mentioned that case where a

659
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:28.669
person reinterpreted her life, do you think that if

660
00:45:28.669 --> 00:45:33.010
people, uh, use those labels to reinterpret their life

661
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.870
and create a new. NARRATIVE to make sense of

662
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.709
their life, it can be helpful to them in

663
00:45:40.709 --> 00:45:41.149
some way.

664
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:47.489
I think it's a dangerous and cruel trap that

665
00:45:47.489 --> 00:45:53.479
you might find yourself unintentionally walking into. Um, ONE

666
00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:58.290
way to think about it is that um, If

667
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:04.489
you take social context out of the picture. And

668
00:46:04.879 --> 00:46:09.310
turn it into something that is internal to you.

669
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.429
You're not creating a better understanding of the world

670
00:46:14.929 --> 00:46:20.250
and uh your experiences, you're creating a fictional one.

671
00:46:21.689 --> 00:46:26.689
And that fictional one might lead you in unintended

672
00:46:26.689 --> 00:46:31.879
directions. And because these then act a bit like

673
00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:34.729
a commodity, this is why I call psychiatric diagnoses

674
00:46:34.729 --> 00:46:39.540
are better understood as brands. These brands have expanded

675
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.580
and expanded because they have lots of products that

676
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.020
are sold alongside them. And the way commodities work

677
00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:51.610
is they offer you, if you consume this. In

678
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.389
some ways, your life is going to be better.

679
00:46:55.679 --> 00:47:00.639
But commodities also come with a sense that you

680
00:47:00.639 --> 00:47:04.189
need to keep consuming them. For life to be

681
00:47:04.189 --> 00:47:08.870
better because most commodities have a limited lifespan. After

682
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.270
a while. It's not quite enough, and it's, it's

683
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:19.360
a type of um. Uh, MEANING making experience that

684
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.239
really lacks, if you like, um. How to uh

685
00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:29.060
a a a more existentially rich or spiritual component.

686
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:33.070
It's a very narrow and thin way of making

687
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.270
sense of your life. So if, if you're now

688
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.110
thinking that there's something in you that means you're

689
00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:42.669
not able to function in certain ways as society

690
00:47:42.669 --> 00:47:46.790
expects, and that's because of some hard wiring, chemical

691
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.159
imbalance, some type of problem inside. You're going to

692
00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:52.909
be vulnerable to a process which I've seen, and

693
00:47:52.909 --> 00:47:55.469
it's been quite distressing that I've seen this now

694
00:47:55.469 --> 00:47:58.780
happening in young people. So I've seen what tends

695
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.979
to happen is. You think, oh, that really helps.

696
00:48:03.219 --> 00:48:06.750
Now I understand myself better. 1 year down the

697
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:10.820
line, 2 years down the line, whatever. Hm. That

698
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.159
doesn't quite fit anymore for all of the things

699
00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:19.120
that I'm experiencing, maybe I'll have another problem. Um,

700
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.919
SO you go and get another diagnosis. Maybe you

701
00:48:22.919 --> 00:48:26.899
start on some medication. Most of the medications are

702
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.120
what I call enhanced placebos. They do something to

703
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.139
you. And you interpret that something as, oh, they're,

704
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.899
they're helping me. But after a while, your brain

705
00:48:38.899 --> 00:48:41.979
gets tolerant to them and you also start to

706
00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:44.459
think this is not quite doing what I hoped

707
00:48:44.459 --> 00:48:46.939
it would do in the long run, so you

708
00:48:46.939 --> 00:48:50.399
get another medication or another diagnosis. So I've seen.

709
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:56.239
You know, 1617 year olds. Who've um come to

710
00:48:56.239 --> 00:48:59.429
the clinic and they've been seen elsewhere, and they've

711
00:48:59.919 --> 00:49:03.350
got a diagnosis of ADHD and then a diagnosis

712
00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:06.969
of autism. And then a diagnosis of anxiety, and

713
00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:11.010
then a diagnosis of PTSD. They've had various uh

714
00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:17.739
therapies, they're on several different medications. Um, AND you

715
00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:21.860
see this process happening with adults. Uh, SO, it's

716
00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.179
kind of be careful what you wish for. You

717
00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:29.580
enter this world. Um, AND you're entering into a

718
00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:35.689
space where that process might take over before you've

719
00:49:35.689 --> 00:49:40.429
realized how far it's, it's, um, sent you. Now

720
00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:42.750
there might be, there are groups of people who

721
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.750
can, who can avoid that and still find some

722
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:52.919
value. Um, But I do think it's very, uh,

723
00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:55.820
it's not good for us as a society, let

724
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.139
alone good for us as individuals, and all the

725
00:49:58.139 --> 00:50:01.540
evidence is that mentally we're becoming more and more

726
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.899
unwell as societies, even as we consume more mental

727
00:50:05.899 --> 00:50:09.939
health labels, more mental health products, uh, which is

728
00:50:09.939 --> 00:50:12.620
not something you'd see in other branches of medicine,

729
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:15.300
you know, outcomes are getting worse even as we

730
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.409
consume more. That's, that's not, not a good. Um

731
00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:23.560
So, I think, you know, this idea of shifting

732
00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:28.000
our attention away from other systems of meaning making

733
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.020
that might help more with social solidarity, that might

734
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.580
help more link your your experience of suffering to

735
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.899
things that have happened to you rather than the

736
00:50:37.899 --> 00:50:41.110
idea that there's something wrong or broken. And I

737
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:44.330
guess I'm particularly worried about the impact that has

738
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.229
on young people. We've never had a generation as

739
00:50:47.229 --> 00:50:51.689
pathologized as the current generation, at least in, in

740
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:57.330
the UK. And of course, you're very suggestible in

741
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:01.120
those ages to. You know, taking on these ideas.

742
00:51:01.409 --> 00:51:04.229
So if you're growing up with an idea that

743
00:51:04.489 --> 00:51:08.409
there's something about you, whether you've decided it's part

744
00:51:08.409 --> 00:51:11.239
of your identity or something you're trying to control,

745
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.169
but there's something about you that means that you're

746
00:51:14.169 --> 00:51:19.810
unfit. In being able to function in the social

747
00:51:20.899 --> 00:51:24.280
Situation as it is in ours. So you might

748
00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.659
be, and I again I've seen this, you might

749
00:51:27.659 --> 00:51:31.340
be unnecessarily disabling yourself before you've even had the

750
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.860
chance to. Grow up and find somewhere in your

751
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.379
life where you can function.

752
00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:43.979
So let me ask you now about the influence

753
00:51:43.979 --> 00:51:48.159
and the role that you think the economic systems

754
00:51:48.159 --> 00:51:50.959
we live in, uh, in the book you talk

755
00:51:50.959 --> 00:51:55.959
about neoliberal capitalist societies, uh, the influence that they

756
00:51:55.959 --> 00:52:00.560
might have on people's lives and people's distress. I

757
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.080
mean, in what ways does economics and perhaps the

758
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.719
job market as it is and. Issues related to

759
00:52:10.719 --> 00:52:15.120
poverty and lack of opportunity, what kind of impact

760
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.280
can that have on people's lives and why is

761
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.000
it, and why does it matter?

762
00:52:23.669 --> 00:52:27.790
So one of the things that I felt was

763
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:33.030
important to try and explore. And of course this,

764
00:52:33.689 --> 00:52:40.050
this bit is more um speculative, it's more trying

765
00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:44.669
to understand a process uh and a process which

766
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.530
by its very nature is going to be multifaceted

767
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:52.070
and, and, and complicated. But I have to try

768
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.969
and answer this question. How is it that we've

769
00:52:55.969 --> 00:53:01.629
developed a system. That is expanding and expanding, and

770
00:53:01.629 --> 00:53:06.850
more and more people consuming these various products related

771
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.449
to what I call the mental health industrial complex.

772
00:53:10.679 --> 00:53:12.800
And yet we have plenty of evidence that what

773
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.040
we're doing at the moment is not only not

774
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.399
working, it's associated with our societies becoming mentally sicker.

775
00:53:21.879 --> 00:53:25.110
How, how can we be involved in a process

776
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.370
like that? So, um, in an, in an attempt

777
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:34.080
to shed light on that, one of the, uh,

778
00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:36.530
uh, one of the things that I came to

779
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.250
the conclusion of is that there is a dual

780
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:45.129
characteristic to this. One is that distress is eminently

781
00:53:45.129 --> 00:53:50.669
exploitable. And it's eminently exploitable depending on what model

782
00:53:50.669 --> 00:53:55.459
of human nature is dominant. And the second one

783
00:53:55.459 --> 00:54:00.020
is that we are living in societies. Uh, THAT

784
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:05.899
are in decline. And society's in decline economically, but

785
00:54:05.899 --> 00:54:12.669
also in terms of politically. Tend to have a

786
00:54:12.669 --> 00:54:18.280
greater degree of distress, alienation, insecurity, and I go

787
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.959
through some of the statistics that bear that out.

788
00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:27.040
And the thing that connects both of them. Is

789
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:32.260
the model of human nature that is dominant. So

790
00:54:32.479 --> 00:54:36.840
I um er our model of human nature is

791
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.479
not plucked out of thin air, there isn't a

792
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:43.060
model of human nature that is the definitive model

793
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.679
that we're all trying to live up to. Our

794
00:54:46.679 --> 00:54:52.070
model of human nature emerges from the dominant narratives

795
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:56.659
and the way they're constructed in our societies. So

796
00:54:56.659 --> 00:55:00.100
in the type of capitalist societies that we live

797
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:09.050
in. The model of the economy is. Centers around

798
00:55:09.659 --> 00:55:18.649
competition. And um putting your interests of your company

799
00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:24.699
first above broader social interests. So it's not surprising

800
00:55:24.699 --> 00:55:26.870
that this is the model of human nature that

801
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.850
is dominant. So I call it the compare and

802
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:37.370
compete society. Where um we're, we're pushed more and

803
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:41.969
more into a hyper-individualistic model of human nature. So

804
00:55:41.969 --> 00:55:46.570
our concept of the self is um the self

805
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:51.689
as an individual, a lot in more collectivist orientated

806
00:55:51.689 --> 00:55:55.610
cultures, the self cannot exist without other selves. Self

807
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:59.580
is always in relation to other selves. And in

808
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.739
that compare and compete, there is a sense that

809
00:56:02.739 --> 00:56:06.110
we're always performing. In order to get value for

810
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:10.300
ourselves, we have to perform in some way. And

811
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.770
it starts young, starts through the schooling system. And

812
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.810
even when schools are doing their best not to

813
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:20.530
create a performative culture, that is the culture that

814
00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:23.550
you're living in. That's the messages you're gonna get

815
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.370
from all sorts of, you're in competition with each

816
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:35.199
other. And you're always in a performance. Um, And

817
00:56:35.199 --> 00:56:38.179
then you grow up into a society in which

818
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:43.830
inequality is becoming more and more visible. So, um,

819
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.179
the gap between the richest. Who are assumed to

820
00:56:48.179 --> 00:56:51.469
be the best performing in this kind of neo-Darwinian

821
00:56:51.469 --> 00:56:55.379
model of human nature, um, and the poorest, and

822
00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:59.750
if you have this hyper-individualistic performance-based model of human

823
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:05.169
nature. Then if you're not succeeding by the measures

824
00:57:05.169 --> 00:57:08.449
that have become popular in your society, and a

825
00:57:08.449 --> 00:57:11.879
lot of the measures that have become popular relate

826
00:57:11.879 --> 00:57:17.709
to how financially and job wise successful you are.

827
00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.570
Other things don't have as much value, anywhere near

828
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:24.590
as much value. So if you're not performing in,

829
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.080
in considered in this kind of winner and loser

830
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.810
system. It's quite painful. It's quite painful to feel

831
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.909
that you're somehow not good enough, so that feeling

832
00:57:35.909 --> 00:57:39.570
of not good enough, of feeling shame, of not

833
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:42.810
being able to fit in, of imagining other people

834
00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:49.159
are doing well. That kind of insecurity. Becomes very

835
00:57:49.159 --> 00:57:54.360
prevalent. And this is the insecurities in which psychiatric

836
00:57:54.360 --> 00:58:00.919
products offer a kind of pseudo solution. And nobody,

837
00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.919
even the most successful people, nobody is free of

838
00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:08.159
this, because if you become really successful, you're sort

839
00:58:08.159 --> 00:58:12.159
of looking behind you as to who, who, who's

840
00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:14.479
coming along and how can I keep performing at

841
00:58:14.479 --> 00:58:17.080
this level. There's a, there's a pressure to keep

842
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.060
performing. And um So, this is the type of

843
00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.399
model of human nature, um, and when the uh

844
00:58:28.399 --> 00:58:31.689
the society starts struggling economically, and we've had at

845
00:58:31.689 --> 00:58:36.360
least two decades now of very visible economic struggle.

846
00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:42.330
Um, IT accentuates these differences, because there's going to

847
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.590
be more people who are not able to, um,

848
00:58:45.959 --> 00:58:52.889
earn enough, uh, so rents become high. Um, Job

849
00:58:52.889 --> 00:58:58.649
security um disappears, you're always at risk of losing

850
00:58:58.649 --> 00:59:02.770
your job, so you become under financial pressure, you're

851
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:06.409
um under all sorts of real world pressures as

852
00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:08.939
well as this kind of existential thing that I'm

853
00:59:08.939 --> 00:59:14.750
not good enough going on around you. And then,

854
00:59:14.919 --> 00:59:17.000
as this has gone on and on and on.

855
00:59:17.709 --> 00:59:21.790
And our politicians can't solve this, and they can't

856
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:25.229
solve this because They're not the people in charge.

857
00:59:25.709 --> 00:59:28.879
Our politicians are the theater in the middle. The

858
00:59:28.879 --> 00:59:31.830
people in our charge are, are the, the, the

859
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:35.729
super rich layer. Uh WHAT many people refer to

860
00:59:35.729 --> 00:59:40.540
as the oligarchs, these massive corporations, they own the

861
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.459
media, they own the big companies, uh, they can

862
00:59:44.459 --> 00:59:48.659
destroy competition whenever they want. And those people have

863
00:59:48.659 --> 00:59:52.530
been making lots of money. Number of billionaires has

864
00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.129
increased, the amount of money they have, so they're

865
00:59:55.129 --> 00:59:57.919
increasing at the same time as homelessness is increasing,

866
00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:01.290
you know, that's, that's a kind of exaggeration of

867
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:06.780
our inequality. So this is a structural issue, and

868
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:10.149
so when you lose hope in your politicians doing

869
01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:13.429
anything, this is the crisis of legitimacy that's spread

870
01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:20.830
across Western countries. Um, PEOPLE become quite pessimistic, quite

871
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:25.870
negative, don't feel hope for the future. So again,

872
01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.750
these are the sorts of things that spread that

873
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:34.709
sense of alienation, dissatisfaction, not being good enough, performance

874
01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:39.090
failure, all of those sorts of feelings. And because

875
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.610
it's a market-based economy. This has turned out to

876
01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:45.070
be a tremendous opportunity to make profit.

877
01:00:47.129 --> 01:00:51.120
OK, so let me ask you then one last

878
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.229
question. Um, HOW do you look at the future

879
01:00:54.229 --> 01:00:58.929
of psychiatry and um do you have any hope

880
01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:03.250
about it and what do you think should change

881
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:09.030
in how psychiatry approaches the topics we've been talking

882
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:12.110
about? I mean, to perhaps try to evolve into

883
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:17.389
uh. I guess we could say a proper science

884
01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:22.969
or a proper scientific endeavor and really help people

885
01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:25.550
dealing with their problems.

886
01:01:27.139 --> 01:01:35.580
Um, ALL healthcare. Involves a psychosocial dimension as well

887
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.979
as the technical dimension. One way to explain that

888
01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:44.820
is that if you eat an apple. There's many

889
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.260
things you can say scientifically about the apple in

890
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.260
terms of how to grow it and how to

891
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.459
improve the yield and all sorts of things that

892
01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:54.620
are very useful to farmers and people who are

893
01:01:54.899 --> 01:01:57.629
sellers and, and to the purchasers and so on.

894
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.649
But none of that is as scientific knowledge is

895
01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:02.250
going to tell me what it's like to eat

896
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:07.239
the apple. Some type of knowledge is not in

897
01:02:07.239 --> 01:02:12.439
that type of framework, in, in an empirical framework.

898
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.260
And to my mind, this is, uh, so, and,

899
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.830
and that is something that's true across healthcare. Uh,

900
01:02:21.929 --> 01:02:25.649
SO, particularly if you have long-term conditions, uh, if

901
01:02:25.649 --> 01:02:29.449
you have, uh, the, the sorts of conditions that

902
01:02:29.449 --> 01:02:34.479
present to family doctors, um, They all have a

903
01:02:34.479 --> 01:02:39.379
kind of psychosocial component. Um, THERE are certain bits

904
01:02:39.379 --> 01:02:43.909
of medicine where the technical component is really key,

905
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.860
and the psychosocial component may be a bit less

906
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.219
so. So for example, if you're going for a

907
01:02:49.219 --> 01:02:53.340
hip operation. I'm not as concerned about the uh

908
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:57.060
bedside manner of the of the surgeon. I'm much

909
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.739
more concerned that the surgeon has good skills and

910
01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:04.340
is using high quality materials for my hip replacement.

911
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:10.699
Um, BUT after that, the psychosocial component becomes very

912
01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:15.449
important in terms of rehabilitation, uh, exercise, uh, what

913
01:03:15.449 --> 01:03:18.570
sort of support do I have in that? What

914
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.330
sort of place am I living in, what my,

915
01:03:20.489 --> 01:03:24.100
what are my resources, um, who, who's around to

916
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.760
help me, etc. So, And in mental health, we

917
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.909
really sit at that psychosocial component side of things.

918
01:03:34.239 --> 01:03:38.399
The knowledge of the experiential knowledge that comes like

919
01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.810
eating an apple, that type of knowledge that's very

920
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:47.639
personalized. Um, SO we operate in that kind of

921
01:03:47.639 --> 01:03:53.489
um. What I think of as the contextual relational

922
01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:59.629
aspects of healthcare. And in a proper thoroughgoing psychiatry,

923
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.270
that is the expertise that we could bring to

924
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:07.790
the rest of medicine. Unfortunately, psychiatry got caught up

925
01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:11.429
with um what's happened a lot in the last

926
01:04:12.489 --> 01:04:15.370
century is we caught up with the idea that

927
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.850
we're making technical progress and we're going to have

928
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:23.149
technical fixes for all of life's problems. And so

929
01:04:23.149 --> 01:04:26.639
it started to promote the idea that it's just

930
01:04:26.639 --> 01:04:30.300
like any other branch of medicine, we have diagnoses

931
01:04:30.439 --> 01:04:34.000
and we have specific treatments for specific diagnoses, even

932
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.540
though the evidence has refused to back that up.

933
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.129
And so that's leading to this crisis of confidence

934
01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:45.530
in the paradigm in psychiatry, and, and it is

935
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:49.360
because we're adopting the wrong paradigm. Uh, THE rest

936
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.639
of medicine struggles with medicalization issues and all sorts

937
01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:57.679
of other issues that psychiatry could help with. Um,

938
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
BUT while we pretend that we're just like any

939
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.570
other branch of medicine. We're going to continue to

940
01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:10.770
struggle in um being able to demonstrate that we

941
01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:16.379
are. So, the future of psychiatry really can only

942
01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:20.459
come about once we are honest with ourselves and

943
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:24.699
dispense with the paradigm that we currently operate in.

944
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:29.510
And that would mean dispensing with the idea of

945
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:36.290
individual treatments, particularly pharmacological treatments, being the main approach,

946
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.389
and it would dispense with the idea that what

947
01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:43.820
we have are diagnoses, we don't have diagnoses. Um,

948
01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.899
AND, um, uh, there are models out there that

949
01:05:48.899 --> 01:05:51.919
have shown that you can do that. And these

950
01:05:51.919 --> 01:05:57.250
models can be very successful. For example, the model

951
01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:01.350
that developed out of a movement called democratic Psychiatry

952
01:06:01.449 --> 01:06:07.580
in Italy. Which is a very communicate community-based, working

953
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:13.209
with other agencies. And it takes a problem-based approach

954
01:06:13.209 --> 01:06:19.600
rather than a diagnostic approach. Works on building community.

955
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.520
So a lot of people who use the services

956
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.959
are also involved in social enterprises, so they run

957
01:06:27.959 --> 01:06:33.189
bed and breakfasts, hotels, they run bicycle repair workshops,

958
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.090
they Um, so they have various things, uh, and

959
01:06:37.639 --> 01:06:41.149
they work closely with the housing department to make

960
01:06:41.149 --> 01:06:44.489
sure people have, um, adequate housing and so on.

961
01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:48.790
Another example is the open dialogue movement in, um,

962
01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:55.540
in Finland. Who have been showing great outcomes with

963
01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.949
even with. Uh, PEOPLE presenting with psychotic phenomena, and

964
01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:04.020
again they use the approach that what people are

965
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.290
presenting with is human experiences that are meaningful rather

966
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.090
than meaningless torture, as, uh, you know, as the

967
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:16.320
model that we, uh, dominantly have. So there are

968
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.939
models out there. What they have in common tends

969
01:07:19.939 --> 01:07:22.939
to be that they view things in, in a

970
01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:27.659
contextual and relational manner, and that it's uh human

971
01:07:27.659 --> 01:07:31.459
experiences that you're dealing with, not diagnostic, these, uh

972
01:07:31.459 --> 01:07:35.179
these fake diagnostic products. Now, how long it might

973
01:07:35.179 --> 01:07:38.010
take for that to become more widespread for these

974
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:41.070
um islands of practice that you, you can find

975
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:45.889
here and there. That I don't know, because there's

976
01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:50.149
a lot of money being made by peddling these

977
01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.729
ideas that what we deal with our diagnoses and

978
01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:55.330
that if you get a diagnosis, there's all sorts

979
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.810
of these other products that you can consume that

980
01:07:57.810 --> 01:08:01.530
will make your life better, so. Um, WHILE there's

981
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.209
a lot of money to be made, maybe it's

982
01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:07.709
gonna be difficult, but you can't keep a false

983
01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:11.810
narrative going forever. So at some point it will

984
01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:16.970
change. Predicting that point is going to be difficult.

985
01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:23.799
Um, NOBODY predicted. That the Soviet Union would disintegrate

986
01:08:24.049 --> 01:08:26.740
when it didn't. Nobody predicted that. Well, actually there

987
01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.580
was, there was 11 person who predicted it back

988
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.029
in the 70s. Um, uh, Emmanuel Todd, who wrote

989
01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:36.729
about it, and he's recently also written a book

990
01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:39.589
about the, um, what he calls the defeat of

991
01:08:39.589 --> 01:08:42.750
the West. He, he thinks the, the Western Empire.

992
01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:45.310
So it might be that the Western Empire has

993
01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:51.250
to sort of disintegrate before these money-making models. Uh,

994
01:08:51.259 --> 01:08:54.419
ALSO, uh, come, come to pass, but at some

995
01:08:54.419 --> 01:08:59.629
point it will. That's, that's. A firm prediction, it

996
01:08:59.629 --> 01:09:01.390
might be in my lifetime, it might not be

997
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:04.270
in my lifetime, I don't know, but you can't

998
01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.750
keep a paradigm that doesn't work going forever.

999
01:09:09.809 --> 01:09:13.758
Good. So, um, the book is again Searching for

1000
01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:17.877
Normal A New Approach to Understanding Mental Health. I

1001
01:09:17.877 --> 01:09:19.479
will be leaving a link to it in the

1002
01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.278
description of the interview. And Doctor Tiimi, just before

1003
01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:26.318
we go, uh, would you like to tell people

1004
01:09:26.318 --> 01:09:29.358
if there are any places on the internet where

1005
01:09:29.358 --> 01:09:31.337
they can find you and your work?

1006
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:40.020
Yeah, I have a website, um, Sammy Tamimi.co.uk, um.

1007
01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:47.450
I've, I've been encouraged by my um. Publishers to

1008
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:51.049
make myself visible on social media. I'm, I don't

1009
01:09:51.049 --> 01:09:54.169
like social media, I'm not good at it, but

1010
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:58.009
I do post on X and um sometimes on

1011
01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:02.479
Instagram, occasionally on TikTok, but I don't know what

1012
01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:06.390
I'm doing really, but yeah, um, those are the

1013
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:09.299
main places to find me. There is a um

1014
01:10:09.419 --> 01:10:13.479
Portuguese um translation of the book coming out. I

1015
01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:15.450
don't know, it's meant to come out, I think,

1016
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.919
by the end of the year, but I haven't

1017
01:10:17.919 --> 01:10:20.640
heard if it has or uh whether it's on

1018
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.560
its way. But there should be a Portuguese uh

1019
01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.799
