00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.390
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.280
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.569
today I'm joined by Doctor Mandy Estola. She's assistant

4
00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.199
professor of philosophy at the Delft University of Technology.

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.629
Her research focuses on character. And today we're going

6
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.069
to talk about character, virtues and vices, the sense

7
00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:26.379
of humor, group characters, and Mendevillian virtues and vices.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.469
So, Doctor Estolo, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:30.709
huge pleasure to have you

10
00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:33.110
on. Thank you. It's very nice to be on

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.709
the show, and these are my favorite topics, so

12
00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm always happy to talk about them.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.909
Great. So let's start with this question then. What

14
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.470
is character? I mean, particularly in the context of

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.349
philosophy, what does character mean?

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.860
Yeah, what is character? That's a really good starting

17
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.450
question, um. I would say that nowadays when we

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.009
talk about character, at least when I talk about

19
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.800
character, I roughly just mean personality and especially your

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.680
moral personality, and I tend to think of character

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.849
as Consisting out of character traits, so you are

22
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:19.250
actually a bundle of character traits, and character traits

23
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.959
are these long term and stable dispositions to act

24
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.680
or behave in a certain way or to think

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.900
in a certain way. Um, LIKE, for example, when

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.860
a person is compassionate, then they have this reemerging

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.209
desire to help others or for example, a re-emerging

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.699
sort of feeling of compassion for others, and they

29
00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.500
tend to respond to the pain of others with

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.139
a certain emotional response and that emotion motivates a

31
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.739
certain kind of action and yeah, this, this bundle

32
00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.940
of traits that you have makes up your character.

33
00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.800
And um there's also what I really like about

34
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.260
the word character is that there's also another meaning

35
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.800
to it. So when we say that somebody is

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.230
a character. We mean that they're kind of weird,

37
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.559
right? So they're a weirdo. Um, THEY deviate from

38
00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.630
the norm in some way, and musicians talk about

39
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.720
distortion giving a sound character. So there's a sense

40
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.360
in which when something becomes a bit weird or

41
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.679
a bit distorted or a bit, you know, not

42
00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.080
quite as it should be, we tend to call

43
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.240
it character as well, and the word character actually

44
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.740
comes from from an old Greek word. Which means

45
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.539
like an engraved mark, kind of like an engraving

46
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.860
in stone, and um it's it's a bit like

47
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.610
your soul is a is a slab of stone

48
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.320
and something has been engraved into that stone, and

49
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.339
that is, is your character.

50
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.399
So, and how, how do you, do we evaluate

51
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.029
character? I mean, how do we determine whether uh

52
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.880
a particular character is good or bad?

53
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.399
Yeah. Yeah, I think that we, we all kind

54
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.199
of know the answer to that. At least if

55
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.160
you ask a random person what kind of people

56
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880
do you really, can you really not stand? Usually

57
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.669
people have a pretty well worked out moral theory

58
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.479
in response to that, you know, to the question

59
00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.199
what kinds of people are good and what kinds

60
00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.259
of people are bad. And I think a very

61
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.020
attractive answer and an attractive philosophical answer to how

62
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.500
do we evaluate character is the idea that a

63
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.470
good person lives well with others. So a good

64
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.589
person is often also admirable. So a good person

65
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.429
is someone that we admire and the opposite of

66
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.070
that, a bad person is someone that we don't

67
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.630
admire, someone that we wish not to be like.

68
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.740
And when we get to know a person, we

69
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.300
discover what their character traits are because we see

70
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.059
them perform certain actions over and over again and

71
00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.449
often we respond to certain character traits with a

72
00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.860
negative withdrawing emotion. So when someone's, for example, very

73
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.259
full of themselves, we might respond to that with

74
00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.889
a sense of annoyance or a sense of, oh,

75
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.190
there's something not right about this person. Um, OR

76
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.630
when somebody maybe has very good intentions but just

77
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.600
has no idea how to read the room, we

78
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.190
kind of cringe at them, right? That's another sort

79
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.350
of withdrawing emotion that we have. And also when

80
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.339
somebody says one thing and then does another, then

81
00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:36.309
we get a, we get a kind of a

82
00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.109
suspicion about that person. We are less likely to

83
00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:42.149
want to go near them and get closer to

84
00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.609
them. Um, UNLESS we're fascinated by that kind of

85
00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:49.369
thing, of course, which also happens a lot because

86
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:53.130
vices and virtues are very complex, right? But these

87
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.890
emotions that we have in response to the traits

88
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.329
of others when we perceive them, they are kind

89
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.250
of signals, you know, they can be like warning

90
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.399
signals to us for whether that person is good.

91
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.790
For our community or for our flourishing, right? So

92
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.869
the idea that a good person lives well with

93
00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.500
others, that's something that I think we respond to

94
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.829
when we have a negative emotional response to someone's

95
00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:22.869
character, um, but very important, I think that another

96
00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:25.915
thing that we also respond to. When we look

97
00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:29.554
at the character of others, is whether some behavior

98
00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:31.954
from a person is a, is an incident, whether

99
00:05:31.954 --> 00:05:35.035
it's a fluke, whether it only happens once, or

100
00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.415
whether it's really a stable part of their character.

101
00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:40.714
So when we're, when we see someone behave in

102
00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:45.179
a way that we react negatively to, then We

103
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:48.299
often also try to judge whether that how deep

104
00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:51.390
that trait goes. So if someone's a bit full

105
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.980
of themselves, maybe they might also just be drunk.

106
00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.579
It might be a single incident. They might have

107
00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.820
just had a really bad day and they might

108
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.709
need to kind of boost their ego a little

109
00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:03.970
bit, which is why they're acting like that. But

110
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.690
if they do it again and again and again

111
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.250
and every time you see them, then we start

112
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.529
to think, OK, this, this might actually be a

113
00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.049
very deep part of this person's character and the

114
00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.410
deeper the bad traits, the more negatively we judge

115
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.420
it and the same. Of course goes for good

116
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.179
traits. So the deeper a good trait, whether someone

117
00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:27.980
being compassionate or benevolent or fair minded, whether that's

118
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.619
just a fluke, if that's just a fluke, then

119
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.019
we don't respond to it as positively as we

120
00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.059
do when it's a stable part of their character.

121
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.989
Mhm.

122
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.769
I

123
00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:38.140
mean,

124
00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:43.510
do good and bad character traits correspond respectively to

125
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.670
virtues and vices.

126
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.279
Yes, yeah, absolutely. I, I think so. So. In

127
00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.279
general, good character traits are those traits that lead

128
00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:00.959
us towards better flourishing, so living well together with

129
00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.519
others over the course of our lives, and bad

130
00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:06.589
traits are vices which kind of do the opposite.

131
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.380
But I should say here that there is some

132
00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.640
There is some debate here and I think a

133
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.200
very difficult question in this exact field of which

134
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.040
bad traits are vices and which good traits are

135
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.899
virtues is the question that We need to decide

136
00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:28.149
what we do as a theorists with traits that

137
00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:31.230
are a result of a mental illness. So for

138
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.700
example, we see self-reflectiveness and temperance as good character

139
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.540
traits, um, because a self-reflective person is likely to

140
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.260
realize when they are overreacting to something and correct

141
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.589
themselves, for example, um, and a temperate person is

142
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:48.829
less likely to kind of indulge in their answer

143
00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:52.799
in their anger, sorry, um, through insults and, um,

144
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.660
you know. Revenge at the cost of their relationships.

145
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.500
Um, BUT in some cases, the reason why somebody

146
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.470
is lacking temperance or lacking self-reflection is it can

147
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.059
be a result of mental illness, right? So Um,

148
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.709
if somebody has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder,

149
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.839
these symptoms can manifest in ways that resemble vicious

150
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:19.480
behavior, and this is a really difficult question in

151
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.559
virtue ethics. What do we do with this? Do

152
00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:24.519
we call this a vice as well? Some people

153
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:26.440
like to put traits like that in a different

154
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.535
category, so Call it a personalist trait and to

155
00:08:29.535 --> 00:08:32.775
try to kind of separate the person from the

156
00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:36.455
psychological condition that they have, whereas other people think

157
00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:39.695
that every single person should be responsible for everything

158
00:08:39.695 --> 00:08:41.325
that they are and the ones that have a

159
00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:45.215
mental illness just have a larger kind of cross

160
00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:48.395
to bear. Um, BUT I, yeah, I'm not sure

161
00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.284
where I am on this debate, but I, yeah,

162
00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:52.094
I just wanted to mention that it that it

163
00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:54.974
is very difficult sometimes to talk about virtues and

164
00:08:54.974 --> 00:08:55.375
vices.

165
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.820
Right, but talking about virtues and vices, there is

166
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.380
virtue ethics and also virtue epistemology. Could you tell

167
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.580
us about each of them? I mean, what is

168
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.580
virtue ethics and what is virtue epistemology?

169
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.770
Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, yeah, so, um. The

170
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.549
reason why I love character so much, um, is

171
00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:25.119
that as a As an ethicist, um, and also

172
00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:30.109
as a human being, um, I'm interested in the

173
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:32.789
good life and how to lead a good life.

174
00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:35.229
What does it mean to do the right thing

175
00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:36.549
and what does it mean to do the wrong

176
00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:42.229
thing? Um, AND as an epistemologist, epistemologist, a study

177
00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:45.940
of knowledge, and also as a human being, I'm

178
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.619
interested in how to separate truth from falsity and,

179
00:09:50.229 --> 00:09:52.140
you know, understanding how we get to know things

180
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.549
and I've always had the sense that the for

181
00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:00.859
me the best answer, the best way to approach

182
00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:04.150
both of those questions is by looking at the

183
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.789
character of the person doing the acting or the

184
00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:10.619
knowing. Um SO I don't think that there is

185
00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:15.570
any Universal kind of principle or ideal that is

186
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.090
going to tell us which actions are bad and

187
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.729
which actions are good or what is truth and

188
00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:25.409
what is falsity, what is knowledge and what, what

189
00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:28.299
is, you know, the whatever the opposite of knowledge

190
00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.729
is, right, stupidity. I don't think that there's any

191
00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:34.580
principle or framework that's going to tell us that.

192
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:37.530
um SO the best thing that we can do.

193
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.349
IS to focus on thinking about what is the

194
00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.099
kind of, what sorts of character traits, what sorts

195
00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:47.429
of dispositions can we develop in ourselves so that

196
00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:51.059
we are more likely to do the right thing

197
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.669
or more likely to, you know, get the right

198
00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:56.710
answer to a question or think about something in

199
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.109
a, in an epistemically virtuous way. Um, SO that's

200
00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:05.059
a little bit what Virtue, ethics, and virtue epistemology

201
00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:08.179
are for me they're ways at understanding the good

202
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:11.380
life and understanding knowledge by looking at what kind

203
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.260
of character traits, improve our contact with reality, and

204
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.299
yield knowledge, and what kinds of character traits improve

205
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:19.500
our contact with the good.

206
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.150
So could you give us an examples of good

207
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.789
and bad traits uh that we can point to

208
00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:31.469
in ethics and also good and bad traits in

209
00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:33.390
the context of epistemology.

210
00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:39.650
Yeah, sure. Yeah, so maybe let's start with ethics,

211
00:11:39.789 --> 00:11:44.260
um. But before I say anything, I should say

212
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:50.260
that the separation between epistemic and moral virtues, I

213
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.840
always think of it as a very artificial separation.

214
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:56.140
So I think as a human being there are

215
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.929
certain traits that are going to make you excellent

216
00:11:58.929 --> 00:12:00.739
and certain traits that are going to make you

217
00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:04.330
less excellent. And some of those have more to

218
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.609
do with how we come to know facts about

219
00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:10.010
the world and others have more to do with

220
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.409
how we lead our moral lives. So we make

221
00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:16.450
a kind of an artificial sort of separation between

222
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.289
the moral and the epistemic virtues, but really they

223
00:12:19.289 --> 00:12:21.890
are all kind of the same thing or kind

224
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.210
of very similar, I think. Um, SO if we

225
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.030
start with the moral ethical virtues, um. A nice

226
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.469
one is, I think, courage. So people are good,

227
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.099
there's one way of being good is being courageous.

228
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.979
And courage is a trait that um involves a

229
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:49.150
kind of reasserting motive to Go against something that

230
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.099
you fear, because you know that it is noble,

231
00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:54.510
right? So, courage is a way of kind of

232
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.070
eating your fear, eating your own fear and deriving

233
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.469
power out of it. And In the Aristotelian model

234
00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.309
of the virtues, the virtue is always in the

235
00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:09.229
middle, and at the two opposite extremes there are

236
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:14.380
two vices. So Aristotle talks about courage as being

237
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:19.469
in the middle between cowardice and foolhardiness. So somebody

238
00:13:19.469 --> 00:13:23.479
who has an excess of fear, or maybe um

239
00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:26.530
Acts in accordance with their fear a little too

240
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.739
much or has a deficiency of, you know, the

241
00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:32.820
noble sense that makes you act against your fear,

242
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.739
they're going to be cowardly, whereas a person who

243
00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:39.830
is likely to sort of who has a has

244
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.270
a deficiency of fear is often going to be

245
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.840
foolhardy. Um, AND in the middle is courage. Um,

246
00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:50.849
SO that's just one example of a, of a

247
00:13:50.849 --> 00:13:54.010
moral virtue. Of course, there is also something like

248
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:59.900
epistemic courage, um, so for example, We might say

249
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:06.570
of a Of a scientist, um. Who maybe goes

250
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.520
against who has a who's developing a theory that

251
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.520
goes against the current norms or even goes against

252
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.840
their previous work, we might, we might speak of

253
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.239
that as intellectual courage or even tackling a question

254
00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:24.159
that is very difficult to tackle or very confrontational

255
00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:27.320
to tackle, we might also call that intellectual courage.

256
00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:33.729
But maybe a Another very, another nice example of

257
00:14:33.729 --> 00:14:40.809
a more epistemic virtue is open-mindedness, and I tend

258
00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:44.989
to think of open-mindedness as the ability to be

259
00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:47.450
receptive to new ideas and to respond to new

260
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.169
ideas, and that also kind of in my view

261
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:55.169
has like an Aristotelian middle between two extremes kind

262
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:59.799
of structure, um. Because open-mindedness could be seen as

263
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:04.599
being in the middle between intellectual servility, so the

264
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:07.559
fact that you just believe whatever people tell you

265
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.739
basically, without questioning it. And on the other hand,

266
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.780
closed-mindedness. So when you're not receptive to new ideas

267
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.099
at all. Um, SO then you see that moral

268
00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:20.140
and epistemic virtues have a very, or often have

269
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.020
a very similar structure.

270
00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:28.369
But then if virtues stand between two extremes, or

271
00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:31.840
at least some of them stand between two extremes,

272
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.969
are both extremes vices.

273
00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:38.890
Yeah, yeah, so in the traditionally in the, in

274
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.919
the Aristotelian model, it is, they are actually always

275
00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:45.809
considered vices and by the way, it doesn't have

276
00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:50.849
to be two extremes. There can be multiple extremes

277
00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:54.960
and one kind of virtue in the middle. Aristotle,

278
00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.690
I think, I think Aristotle said that there is

279
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.640
really only one way to be good. Um, BUT

280
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.400
badness is diverse, so there's many different ways to

281
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.119
be bad, but being good, if you think of

282
00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:10.559
like really good people, they're always kind of the

283
00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:14.270
same person because the virtues also support each other.

284
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.429
So the idea is that you have sort of

285
00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:18.359
goodness in the middle and then you have all

286
00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:24.190
these deviations of goodness on the sides which are

287
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.309
all different ways of being bad, yeah. Right.

288
00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:32.270
So let me ask you specifically about uh the

289
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.849
sense of humor. Is it a moral virtue even

290
00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:38.729
if it's dark and twisted?

291
00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:42.520
Yeah, yeah, so I, I find sense of humor

292
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.039
a really interesting virtue for, for many reasons, um.

293
00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:50.849
I think that humor, so what I said earlier

294
00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:55.119
about moral virtues and epistemic virtues, the division between

295
00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:57.530
them being a bit artificial, I think that a

296
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.210
sense of humor is an, is an example where

297
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.539
you see how artificial that division is because when

298
00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:05.170
you have a sense of humor, it's, it's a

299
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.999
very cognitive, very in. INTELLECTUAL, uh, type of virtue

300
00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:12.259
that requires a lot of, uh, intelligence actually. So

301
00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:15.348
in a sense, it's, it's very much epistemic. Um,

302
00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:17.578
IT can also help you to discover new truths

303
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.378
about the world. So in that sense, it's also

304
00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:25.569
epistemic, but it's also very clearly moral, um. So

305
00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:30.560
I think Aristotle talks about sense, doesn't talk about

306
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.760
sense of humor, but talks about wit, and by

307
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.599
wit, I've always understood him to mean something like

308
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:40.550
a kind of social easiness. It's almost like it

309
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.689
it it wit is the thing that makes you

310
00:17:42.689 --> 00:17:45.599
pleasant to be around. Um, OF course you're And

311
00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:49.040
if you're compassionate and courageous and all of these

312
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.640
other things, but you know, sometimes moral saints can

313
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.380
be very sort of boring and intimidating and not

314
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.760
very nice to be around, right? So wit is

315
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.079
the thing that softens you to other people and

316
00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:05.219
makes you approachable. And if we take the definition

317
00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:07.040
of virtue to be that which helps you to

318
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.109
live well with others, then obviously something like wit

319
00:18:10.109 --> 00:18:11.760
is going to help you to live well with

320
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.599
others. Um, SO there's that aspect to it, um.

321
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:17.359
But I've, so I've, I've written about a sense

322
00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:19.969
of humor with colleagues and We were kind of

323
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:23.810
also exploring the idea that a sense of humor

324
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.170
might be even a higher order virtue, an executive

325
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.939
virtue, as it's called, because it sort of helps

326
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.770
other virtues that you have. It controls the other

327
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.250
virtues in your character. Um, SO, for example, humor

328
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.780
can actually make you more courageous. So if we

329
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.170
think about courage as being um the medium between

330
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.680
cowardice and foolhardiness. It could be that you're suffering

331
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.199
from an excess of fear, and that excess of

332
00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:57.920
fear is making you cowardly. If you manage to

333
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.430
make a joke about the object of your fear.

334
00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:04.020
Then this might help you to be more courageous.

335
00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:07.020
And so in the in the article that I

336
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.229
wrote together with a colleague we used as an

337
00:19:10.229 --> 00:19:13.540
example a collection of stamps that came out in

338
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.430
Ukraine just after the war started, which was kind

339
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.349
of a sort of a mocking, mocking the enemy

340
00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:21.989
was the object of the stamps, and there you

341
00:19:21.989 --> 00:19:24.709
see the idea that if you ridicule something that

342
00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:26.579
is an that is an object of fear or

343
00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:30.160
anxiety, then it becomes easier to kind of affirm.

344
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.069
Um, THE noble thing that you're going against your

345
00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:38.089
fear for. So that's just one example. I think

346
00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:41.170
humor helps many other virtues as well. It can

347
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.530
help us be more hopeful, but it can also

348
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.449
help us avoid things like toxic positivity. It can

349
00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:50.849
also help us to check others. So when somebody's

350
00:19:50.849 --> 00:19:54.979
acting out of line instead of sort of Condemning

351
00:19:54.979 --> 00:19:56.780
them very strictly, we might just make a joke,

352
00:19:56.819 --> 00:19:59.609
and it's a much nicer way of them to

353
00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:02.310
let somebody know that they're behaving out of line

354
00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:04.939
um than to be kind of very serious about

355
00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:07.660
it. So there's many ways in which humor just

356
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.229
makes our life easier and makes us more approachable.

357
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:12.780
Um, YEAH, so I think of it almost as

358
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.800
a kind of executive virtue that controls other virtues,

359
00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:18.939
but at the same time, I think you could

360
00:20:18.939 --> 00:20:23.380
also see it on the Aristotelian spectrum of the

361
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.579
virtue in the middle and the two extremes, two

362
00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:30.449
or more extremes at the ends, um. I've always

363
00:20:30.449 --> 00:20:34.500
thought of kind of boorishness on one end of

364
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.849
the spectrum, like when somebody's really not, doesn't just

365
00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:40.619
doesn't understand humor, isn't receptive to a joke at

366
00:20:40.619 --> 00:20:44.300
all, is way too serious. They can be boorish,

367
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.750
but on the other side, when someone's like, Really

368
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.479
like, like a buffoon, like buffoonery, making stupid jokes

369
00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:54.000
all the time and doesn't, isn't able to read

370
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.880
the room and, you know, tries to be funny

371
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.560
but ends up just being offensive and annoying. Then

372
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.560
that's, those are also kind of like two ends

373
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.719
of the spectrum and a and a good sense

374
00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:07.839
of humor is somewhere in the middle. And actually

375
00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:10.000
I think a good sense of humor requires a

376
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.239
lot of intelligence, um, so it's extremely epistemic.

377
00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:18.930
Mhm. Uh, I mean, when we talk about character

378
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.930
traits, we usually think about or refer to individual

379
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:28.239
character traits. We are more talking about individuals, but

380
00:21:28.239 --> 00:21:32.569
do groups also have characters and how do they

381
00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:33.489
manifest?

382
00:21:34.439 --> 00:21:37.349
Yeah, I'm glad you asked. This is one of

383
00:21:37.349 --> 00:21:42.260
my favorite topics, um. Yes, so I think that

384
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.819
groups definitely have characters. You only need to think

385
00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:49.900
about the last three groups that you've been a

386
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.819
part of. So whatever that is, whether it's like

387
00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:56.500
a sports team, whether it's a company that you've

388
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.780
worked for, whether it's your ex-partner's family, right, um.

389
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:05.829
You can tell that groups have different character traits,

390
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.060
bigger groups do and smaller groups do as well.

391
00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:11.910
And I think that just like with an individual

392
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:17.390
person whose character grows slowly over time and can

393
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.910
be nourished and can be affected by external circumstances

394
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.829
in the same way, a group also grows a

395
00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:31.430
character over time. And that's why if you Something

396
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.160
like a group of people sitting on a bus

397
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.510
that have only maybe seen each other um for

398
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.670
for 10 minutes. Um, I wouldn't say that they

399
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.069
really have a group character, but if you think

400
00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:48.390
about a group that meets over a long period

401
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.989
of time, then they have the space and the

402
00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:54.349
time to develop a character, just like an individual

403
00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:59.579
person and actually Um, Aristotle and Plato, they both

404
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:03.099
talked about city states as being a kind of

405
00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:05.939
mirror for the individual person. So just like the

406
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:09.000
soul should have this component and that component and

407
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.099
possess this virtue and that virtue in the same

408
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.579
way, the city should also have different groups of

409
00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:20.300
people that possess different virtues, right? Um. And I

410
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.979
think Aristotle even had this, had this sort of

411
00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:26.500
metaphor of the city being like one man with

412
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.780
lots of feet and lots of hands, and the

413
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.119
more diversity you have in it, also the more

414
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:35.959
wisdom you have in it. Um, Yeah.

415
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.479
So, uh, let me ask you then, what is

416
00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:45.160
collective intelligence and what do you think is important

417
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.439
for us to know about it to then apply

418
00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:52.609
virtue ethics and virtue epistemology to groups?

419
00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:57.280
Uh, YEAH, so collective intelligence, um, yes, this is

420
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.810
a good topic, um. So, like I said earlier,

421
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.900
Aristotle said that there was only one way to

422
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.939
be good, but badness is kind of diverse and

423
00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:14.000
devious, um. If you think about that, and then

424
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.859
you think about what collective intelligence is, um, then

425
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.040
I think you quickly realize that collective intelligence tends

426
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.680
to arise out of diversity. So Mills's idea of

427
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.010
the marketplace of ideas being a good kind of

428
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.170
society when there's a lot of diverse people living

429
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.170
very diverse lives, there's lots of different ideas to

430
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.969
choose from, right? And this is actually epistemically valuable,

431
00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:46.010
so diversity has lots of value, and the idea

432
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.359
of the wisdom of the crowds is actually also

433
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.930
dependent on You know, intelligence being dispersed by there

434
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.650
being lots of lots of diversity. Um, SO then

435
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.329
when you think about virtue being sort of uniform

436
00:25:02.329 --> 00:25:06.300
and vice being diverse, um, Yeah, then you start

437
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.300
to see that there might actually be ways in

438
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:14.069
which More diversity, having some, having some diversity, um,

439
00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:16.790
in terms of virtue as well might actually be

440
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:22.189
good for a group. Um, SO collective intelligence, I

441
00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:26.189
think this point sort of links very closely with,

442
00:25:26.229 --> 00:25:30.079
with my idea of Mandevillian virtue. So maybe Maybe

443
00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:32.280
it's an idea to to move to that, or

444
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.959
shall we do collective virtues first? Uh

445
00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:37.989
YEAH, let's do collective virtues first and then we'll

446
00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:41.540
talk about Mendevillian virtues and vices, so.

447
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.010
Yeah, OK. OK, so collective virtues like that. I

448
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.739
think this is a good bridge there, right? So,

449
00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:54.040
um, For a very long time I've thought about

450
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.359
this issue of can we take something like virtue

451
00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:01.239
ethics and virtue epistemology and apply it to groups

452
00:26:01.239 --> 00:26:04.959
of people, because if you take Plato and Aristotle's

453
00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:07.040
suggestion that the city is kind of a man

454
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.359
with multiple hands and feet and um, you know,

455
00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:15.280
is one big collective agent, then maybe we should

456
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.040
also be talking about the virtues and vices of

457
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.160
groups, right? Um, I feel that we often do

458
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.689
if we, if we look at, for example, um,

459
00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:26.000
you know, people, people will often say like, oh,

460
00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:31.829
Shell is an irresponsible company or the government is

461
00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:34.760
the government is being idiotic or something like that.

462
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.920
So in our just natural language use we tend

463
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.160
to attribute vices and virtues to groups all the

464
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.989
time, so. Maybe we should have some theory supporting

465
00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:47.390
that as well. Um, SO that's something I've been

466
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.219
thinking about a lot. And so maybe one example

467
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.869
of a collective virtue is something that I've written

468
00:26:55.869 --> 00:27:00.270
about together with colleagues, which is collective intellectual humility.

469
00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:05.280
Um, SO earlier I talked about intellectual humility being

470
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.239
a kind of, or sorry, um, I talked about

471
00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:12.109
open-mindedness, but intellectual humility is slightly different. Intellectual humility

472
00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:14.119
is a is a trait that is considered an

473
00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:18.520
epistemic virtue, and intellectual humility is basically the ability

474
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.949
to correctly assess your own um intellectual capacities. So

475
00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:27.079
being sort of overconfident might be on one side.

476
00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:28.829
And on the other side being kind of, you

477
00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:33.310
know, servile or underestimating yourself intellectually, and an intellectually

478
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.630
humble person is someone who is able to respond

479
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.939
to. Opposing viewpoints and you know doesn't kind of

480
00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:48.260
overestimate themselves or underestimate themselves. And If you think

481
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.140
about intellectual humility inside the individual, you have a,

482
00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:54.699
you have a certain, you know, you have an

483
00:27:54.699 --> 00:27:59.420
image of an intellectually humble person in mind, but

484
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.979
of course this trait, everything that the intellectually humble

485
00:28:02.979 --> 00:28:07.709
person does can also be displayed by a group.

486
00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:10.060
So for example, if a community has a really

487
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:16.420
strong norm about dissenting majority viewpoints. Um, IF a

488
00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.180
group has a strong norm that everybody should be

489
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.979
able to voice their opinion, and that if there

490
00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:25.349
is a certain, um, For example, if there's a

491
00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:28.430
certain idea which is very prevalent, that it is

492
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.270
OK to challenge that idea, um, then these are

493
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.510
sort of system properties that are gonna likely in

494
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.670
many situations going to lead that group to be

495
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.510
more intellectually humble and we can contrast that with,

496
00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.550
for example, a group that has a very strong

497
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.689
hierarchical norm. So if you think about like a

498
00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:52.319
company where you have a really dictatorial boss, um,

499
00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:56.310
who you are not allowed to challenge ever. And

500
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.800
then whenever they say something, everybody else knows that

501
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.359
they kind of have to go along with it,

502
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.430
otherwise they'll get fired. If you have a group

503
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.520
with a culture and a kind of policy that

504
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.530
really discourages dissenting, um, then I think Even if

505
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.770
individuals might privately disagree with the boss, they're most

506
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.250
likely going to just go along with the boss,

507
00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:23.329
and it could be that even in their personal

508
00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:28.170
lives, everybody who works there is in fact very

509
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.489
good at dissenting the majority viewpoint, but it could

510
00:29:31.489 --> 00:29:33.969
be that they simply cannot do so because the

511
00:29:33.969 --> 00:29:36.609
structures in that workplace make it so that it

512
00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:40.290
is impossible for them to dissent. So then you

513
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:46.670
get actually a group. Which displays intellectual servility or

514
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.500
gullibility even though all of the people in that

515
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.260
group might actually be very intellectually humble and very

516
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.089
willing to challenge majority viewpoints in their private lives.

517
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.500
And in contrast to that, you can also have

518
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.780
a group that arranges its policies and its culture

519
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.540
and its norms in such a way that you

520
00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.780
get collective intellectual humility.

521
00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:16.790
Right, but I mean, when it comes to collective

522
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:22.599
virtues and vices, are they the same as the

523
00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:27.430
individual virtues and vices, or do they differ from

524
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.400
one another?

525
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.569
Yeah, that's, yeah, that, that's a really good question

526
00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:35.800
and also very, very difficult question, I think. Um,

527
00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.079
HOW I would answer to that is that I

528
00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:45.250
think that just like in individuals. In groups, you

529
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:51.339
have different levels of robustness. And Maybe it helps

530
00:30:51.339 --> 00:30:54.010
if I just explain this idea of kind of

531
00:30:54.010 --> 00:31:00.729
robustness of a virtue. So, Sometimes an individual, let's

532
00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:03.489
let's start with the individual person. Sometimes an individual

533
00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:08.890
person might look virtuous from the outside, but it

534
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.170
could be that that virtue is actually very fragile

535
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:16.729
or very situational. Um, SO to use an example

536
00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:20.810
from literature, I've just finished a wonderful book by

537
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.569
Iris Murdoch called The Sacred and Profane Love Machine.

538
00:31:25.699 --> 00:31:28.250
And in that book there is a character, a

539
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.489
woman whose husband cheats on her, and it turns

540
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:35.329
out that the husband has a second family that

541
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:38.170
this woman has had no idea about for years

542
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:43.609
and years. Obviously she is distraught, but she reacts

543
00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:47.680
like an angel. So she tells the man off,

544
00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:51.560
but she forgives him and she reaches out to

545
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.280
the other woman. And she makes sure that the

546
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.430
husband gives her a fairer sort of financial share

547
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.680
to sort of put her son to a good

548
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.560
school and so on. So you see actually a

549
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.680
woman that is responding to a kind of moral

550
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.760
crisis, responding to wrongdoing to her like an angel.

551
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.390
But then as the plot progresses, um, it turns

552
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.199
out that The woman is responding like an angel.

553
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.640
She's displaying forgiveness, but she is doing it because

554
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.640
her forgiveness makes others dependent on her and appreciative

555
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.520
of her. And as soon as this kind of

556
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.280
as the caring relationship between them and as soon

557
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.280
as the appreciativeness disappears, then she completely crumbles and

558
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.180
falls apart, and I think that. We recognize this

559
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.089
behavior in um in, in many of the people

560
00:32:48.579 --> 00:32:51.180
around us, right? Something can look like a virtue,

561
00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:53.609
but then it can turn out that for example,

562
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.869
somebody's um Generosity is linked to a kind of

563
00:32:58.869 --> 00:33:01.829
will for control of the other person or it

564
00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:04.430
can be linked to an anxiety about something which

565
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.510
is actually detrimental to the person's flourishing and not

566
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.709
kind of helping their flourishing. So in a case.

567
00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:15.520
Like in the character in the book that I

568
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.050
just described, the lady who's cheated on reacts like

569
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.359
an angel but does so so that she kind

570
00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:23.959
of has, you know, so that everybody is dependent

571
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:26.359
on her. This is a case of a more

572
00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:30.160
fragile virtue. So it's, it is virtue in a

573
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.439
particular situation, but as soon as that situation changes,

574
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.680
she actually just falls apart, whereas a person who

575
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.170
is able to be forgiving, um, Across a range

576
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.699
of situations and is able to respond to the

577
00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:49.579
situation changing with a similar kind of sense of

578
00:33:49.579 --> 00:33:53.989
forgiveness, then, then you would say that That the

579
00:33:53.989 --> 00:33:57.589
trait is deep, that it is robust. So within

580
00:33:57.589 --> 00:34:01.209
an individual person there's different levels, levels of robustness

581
00:34:01.209 --> 00:34:03.469
of a virtue, and the same goes for vices,

582
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.859
I think. Some people are only vicious in a,

583
00:34:06.069 --> 00:34:09.540
in a very specific situation in a very specific

584
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.790
relationship or constellation of people around you, but that

585
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.629
can, that can also just change. It can be

586
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:17.830
that the vice is not a deep feature of

587
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:22.188
somebody at all. So that's robustness. Um, NOW, I

588
00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:26.099
think that in collectives, You have a similar thing.

589
00:34:26.428 --> 00:34:28.829
So a group of people that are on an

590
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:32.148
airplane and the airplane is delayed, they might kind

591
00:34:32.148 --> 00:34:34.069
of like band together and they might say, Hey,

592
00:34:34.148 --> 00:34:36.138
we're, you know what, we're all of us together,

593
00:34:36.228 --> 00:34:39.748
we're going to ask this airline for compensation. We'll

594
00:34:39.748 --> 00:34:43.668
band together and we'll, and we'll do this. In

595
00:34:43.668 --> 00:34:45.989
such a case, we can say that the group

596
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:50.320
of people, the group of passengers. Shows a kind

597
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.179
of collective perseverance, but this kind of collective perseverance

598
00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.199
is probably not going to be very robust because

599
00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:01.550
this group hasn't had time to sort of form

600
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.040
and become a real group agent. So if you

601
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.159
look at like an activist movement or for example,

602
00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:11.520
you know, perhaps a civil society group or a

603
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.639
company or a family or a group of people

604
00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:16.514
that needs to Together very often, then they might

605
00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:20.064
have a much more robust form of group perseverance.

606
00:35:20.405 --> 00:35:22.754
Um, SO I do think that there are, there

607
00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:26.514
are similarities, but there are also differences. I think

608
00:35:26.514 --> 00:35:31.264
that there might be some virtues that only groups

609
00:35:31.354 --> 00:35:35.754
can possess. Um, YEAH, I mean, a lot of

610
00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:39.004
people talk about something like inclusivity being a good

611
00:35:39.004 --> 00:35:42.520
feature of a group, um. I have no idea

612
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.639
how an individual person could be inclusive because I

613
00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:50.840
think that the word inclusiveness implies actually that there

614
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.719
is a that there is a group doing it.

615
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.719
An individual person cannot be inclusive. I mean they

616
00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:57.679
can be unbiased, they can be kind, they can

617
00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:01.689
be respectful, but an individual cannot be inclusive. So

618
00:36:01.689 --> 00:36:04.159
these are kind of, I would say these are

619
00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.719
examples of things that we might call group virtues.

620
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.080
Right, but.

621
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:13.659
Uh, YEAH, but, but when we see the same

622
00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:20.290
virtue or the same vice in individuals and collectives,

623
00:36:20.709 --> 00:36:26.030
are the collective traits just scaled up versions of

624
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.429
the respective individual traits or not?

625
00:36:29.989 --> 00:36:34.080
Yeah, yeah, right, um, so I actually think that

626
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.750
it can be very, it's very useful to think

627
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.479
of it in that way, um, because if you

628
00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:45.320
think about something like individual, uh, you know, being

629
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.750
compassionate, a compassionate person, then they're gonna have certain

630
00:36:50.629 --> 00:36:55.590
Certain motives that keep reasserting themselves. They might have

631
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.590
certain personal principles that they adhere to and they

632
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.120
might have a certain, you know, self-image regarding that,

633
00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:06.350
um, that, that trait that they have which also

634
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.110
keeps it going and keeps them motivated to sort

635
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:13.469
of feed and continue um displaying that trait, um.

636
00:37:14.709 --> 00:37:16.729
Then if you look at something like a group

637
00:37:16.949 --> 00:37:20.239
that is compassionate. I think that we can see

638
00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:25.439
a lot of analogs between the individual components of

639
00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:30.250
virtue and components of group virtue. So even though

640
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.840
a group is not a person in the same

641
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.199
way that an individual is, they don't have, for

642
00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:40.959
example, emotions in the same way. It's, it's, they

643
00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:43.669
don't have a kind of um It might be

644
00:37:43.669 --> 00:37:46.270
difficult to make that kind of comparison. Do groups

645
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:50.580
have, uh, for example, ideas? Do groups have emotions,

646
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.199
um, Our groups a moral person in the same

647
00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:57.080
way that an individual is, um, but I think

648
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.000
that there's many analogs. So, for example, there's been

649
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.270
a lot of work on collective emotions. So if

650
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:11.969
you see, for example, Um, A company responding to

651
00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:17.250
a serious financial threat, um, or for example, a

652
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.679
group, a platoon of soldiers uh responding very quickly

653
00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:25.000
to a threat. There is a sense in which

654
00:38:25.209 --> 00:38:29.169
there is a kind of collective emotion there and

655
00:38:29.169 --> 00:38:33.610
there's also um a collective motivations can also have

656
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:39.919
collective analogs. So for example, If somebody appoints you

657
00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:44.360
at your workplace to be The sort of health

658
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.439
and safety steward or something like that and then

659
00:38:47.439 --> 00:38:49.360
you're sitting in a meeting and you're in the

660
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.520
role of the, you know, health health steward of

661
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.320
your of your group or whatever and then there's

662
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.389
a question about whether we should provide. Alcoholic drinks

663
00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:05.189
at, you know, social events of the group, then

664
00:39:05.189 --> 00:39:07.790
you might privately think, well, actually, I would like

665
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.639
to have a drink at these events. I, I

666
00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.120
think it's a pretty good idea, it would be

667
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.370
nice. Um. But because you are in your institutional

668
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.149
role of, you know, the health representative, then you

669
00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:21.310
might for that reason say we should not have

670
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.070
alcohol there because you put on a kind of

671
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.379
a mask when you are in an institutional role,

672
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.459
and that makes you act in a certain way.

673
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.790
So it could be that for example you have

674
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.550
a board of directors who all privately disagree with

675
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.590
a certain policy, but because of their role in

676
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.189
being the board of directors, they say, OK, no.

677
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.129
We must, we must agree with this policy because

678
00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:47.129
it's in line with the interests that we should

679
00:39:47.129 --> 00:39:49.409
have with regard to the role that we have

680
00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:51.770
here. So this is a situation where you see

681
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.770
that the collective motive and the collective motivation to

682
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.800
do something really comes apart from the individual motivation.

683
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.449
So in this way, I do think that there

684
00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:04.850
is a kind of analogy there. It's not always

685
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.129
going to be perfect, um. But there are very

686
00:40:09.129 --> 00:40:12.209
similar components of virtue inside a collective as there

687
00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.479
are in the individual person.

688
00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:18.070
Mhm. I understand. So let me ask you a

689
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.479
question that I think will make for a good

690
00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:27.290
segue into Mendevillian virtues and vices. Are virtues always

691
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:32.560
virtues and vices always vices independently of the context?

692
00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:40.959
Yeah. Yeah, right. Our virtues always virtues and our

693
00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:46.000
vices always vices. Um, SO in many cases, like

694
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.879
I said earlier, it's really complicated to disentangle. Sort

695
00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:53.679
of when is a trait of virtue and when

696
00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:57.429
is a trait of vice. Um, I think even

697
00:40:57.429 --> 00:41:02.360
the question of How do we separate a single

698
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.520
character out of the complex mess of what a

699
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.280
human being in its entirety is? Um, THAT'S already

700
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.919
a difficult question, uh, let alone to kind of

701
00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:16.250
give it a normative label, um. But I do

702
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.969
think that if we have managed to disentangle, we

703
00:41:19.969 --> 00:41:23.879
have managed to point to using a word, a

704
00:41:23.879 --> 00:41:28.169
tendency in a human being that is likely to

705
00:41:28.169 --> 00:41:32.610
lead them away from flourishing considering the greater scheme

706
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.080
of things in the entirety of their life, then

707
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.169
I would say that that is going to be

708
00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:41.469
always a vice. Um, AND if we have managed

709
00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:44.409
to point to a trait that is going to

710
00:41:44.409 --> 00:41:48.239
lead them towards flourishing or a kind of admirable

711
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:52.179
existence, then that is always going to be a

712
00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:57.330
virtue, but virtue on the individual level. So given

713
00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:01.090
that person's life, yeah, um, so I, I do

714
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.889
think that virtues and vices actually exist, um.

715
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.320
So, uh, let me ask you then, let's get

716
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.959
into the topic of Mendevillian virtues and vices. So

717
00:42:12.959 --> 00:42:16.629
let's start with the virtues. So what are Mendevillian

718
00:42:16.629 --> 00:42:20.600
virtues and what would be examples of it, of

719
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:20.879
them?

720
00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:27.860
Yeah. Yeah, right. So, virtues, if we can really

721
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.659
truly disentangle a virtue, if we can truly say

722
00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:33.489
yes, this is indeed going to help your flourishing,

723
00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:36.580
and that is a virtue, and if we find

724
00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.429
a vice, then that is a vice, um. But

725
00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:44.350
many years ago, I read a paper by a

726
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:50.179
colleague, uh, my colleague Paul Smart, on Mandevillian intelligence,

727
00:42:50.469 --> 00:42:53.070
and this is a paper that really kind of

728
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.600
threw me in a loop at the time. Um,

729
00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.459
I've always been very convinced of the idea that

730
00:42:59.459 --> 00:43:04.840
virtues and vices do exist. Um, But this paper

731
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.909
pointed out to me that simulations with network models

732
00:43:09.919 --> 00:43:13.219
sometimes show that if you've got like a network

733
00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:17.989
of nodes, nodes that represent people that are trying

734
00:43:17.989 --> 00:43:23.229
to figure out some epistemic task, then sometimes this

735
00:43:23.229 --> 00:43:28.760
group of nodes actually figures things out better. When

736
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:34.870
some of these notes are, um, Stupid Um, or

737
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:41.100
cognitively suboptimal. So actually a network can get smarter

738
00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:47.770
when it includes stupider nodes. Now, um, What do

739
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:51.090
I mean by that? Um, WHAT I mean is

740
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.689
that let's say that they are playing a kind

741
00:43:53.689 --> 00:43:55.929
of, um, let's say that they are playing a

742
00:43:55.929 --> 00:44:02.169
game where they have to Choose between sort of

743
00:44:02.169 --> 00:44:04.439
where they have to explore an area and see

744
00:44:04.439 --> 00:44:08.129
where they can find resources. Um, SO then every

745
00:44:08.129 --> 00:44:11.560
node has the kind of has a choice between,

746
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.330
OK, where do I go next? Do I see

747
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.489
whether I can, I can get some, get some

748
00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:18.649
resources in this area? Can I find some resources

749
00:44:18.649 --> 00:44:22.010
in another area? And if they see another node,

750
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.929
acquire resources somewhere else, then they might go and

751
00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:27.919
copy that node, right? So if we're playing, if

752
00:44:27.919 --> 00:44:32.199
we've got a problem space like that, then actually,

753
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:36.090
In these cases with a certain kind of problem

754
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.169
space, when one of these nodes has very strong

755
00:44:40.169 --> 00:44:43.360
priors, so for example, they think they are biased

756
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.189
towards there being resources in that direction for no

757
00:44:46.189 --> 00:44:48.689
apparent reason. They just think, you know, there's something

758
00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:50.889
in that direction. I don't know why, but I

759
00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:53.689
just want to go that way. Then they might

760
00:44:53.689 --> 00:44:57.169
actually behave in a way that is less rational,

761
00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.760
so they might see all their neighbors around. Going

762
00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.199
to a certain area and getting lots of resources

763
00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:07.389
there, um, But then because they are biased in

764
00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:09.750
this way, they are likely to go the other

765
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.419
way anyway, even though it is actually much more

766
00:45:12.419 --> 00:45:14.340
rational to follow what the rest of the group

767
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.780
is doing. Um. And what this, what this means

768
00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.610
is that a group with those kinds of notes,

769
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:30.229
um, Cognitively suboptimal nodes, irrational nodes, is actually gonna

770
00:45:30.229 --> 00:45:32.010
perform better as a group because there is a

771
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:39.530
wider scope of exploration, um. So cognitively suboptimal nodes

772
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.370
or people can actually be beneficial for the rest

773
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.330
of the group because they explore areas that would

774
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.290
otherwise not be explored and they make sure that

775
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.850
the group does not kind of converge on a

776
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.850
suboptimal solution way too quickly, that they don't kind

777
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.010
of all settle on a consensus because it seems

778
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.090
like the most rational thing to do, but that

779
00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:03.810
they kind of keep exploring um. And this kind

780
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.530
of thing works in computer simulations, but there's lots

781
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.020
of arguments for this being the case in the

782
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.040
philosophy of uh sort of in the, in the

783
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.449
history of science as well. So there's an example.

784
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.639
That I've read about a few times, um, which

785
00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:22.780
is about The discovery of the cause of stomach

786
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.050
ulcers of a certain kind of stomach ulcer. Um,

787
00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:28.979
INITIALLY people thought that it was, yeah, there was

788
00:46:28.979 --> 00:46:31.260
lots of hypotheses for what it could be. One

789
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.699
of them was the bacterial hypothesis. And then somebody

790
00:46:34.699 --> 00:46:38.260
did an experiment that seemed very legit that actually

791
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.020
showed that it cannot be the bacterial hypothesis. It

792
00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.209
was rational at the time just to go with

793
00:46:44.209 --> 00:46:46.300
that, but then it turned out that there was

794
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.820
a very unlikely flaw in the experiment, and the

795
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.550
bacterial hypothesis turned out to be the correct one.

796
00:46:53.899 --> 00:46:58.070
And the reason why we discovered this, this. IS

797
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.820
because there were scientists that were sort of very

798
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.179
dogmatic and arrogant about the bacterial hypothesis being correct,

799
00:47:05.229 --> 00:47:08.219
even though all the evidence was pointing to a

800
00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:12.100
completely different direction. So that's an example of, you

801
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.090
know, suboptimal cognitive behavior being good for a group,

802
00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:19.100
not just in a computer model but also really

803
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.260
in a practice like science, um. Now, when I,

804
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.939
when I read this paper, when I started getting

805
00:47:25.939 --> 00:47:30.489
into this stuff, um, I immediately started to think,

806
00:47:30.739 --> 00:47:36.090
hmm, OK, if this is the case in epistemology,

807
00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:42.820
if it is possible that Epistemic vices which are

808
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.780
bad for the knowledge of the individual are actually

809
00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.969
good for the knowledge of the group. Could that

810
00:47:48.969 --> 00:47:52.479
be the case for ethics as well? So could

811
00:47:52.479 --> 00:47:56.270
it be the case that people that have moral

812
00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:04.719
vices are actually beneficial to groups? And I started

813
00:48:04.719 --> 00:48:10.300
thinking about this, um, and I realized that Exactly

814
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.050
the same kind of mechanism that is responsible for

815
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.010
wisdom of the crowds is very likely going to

816
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:19.449
be responsible for something like moral wisdom or practical

817
00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:23.419
wisdom. Because If you have got a group of

818
00:48:23.419 --> 00:48:28.120
people and everybody is very, very virtuous, then very

819
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:34.189
often certain perspectives or views or pursuing a certain

820
00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:36.780
issue, even though it seems like another issue is

821
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.139
much more important, you know, the virtuous people aren't

822
00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:42.739
going to do that. Um, BUT the vicious people

823
00:48:42.739 --> 00:48:46.020
might be much more sort of egoistic in towing

824
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.659
an issue that they care about, even though perhaps

825
00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:51.620
they shouldn't be caring about it as much. But

826
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.419
this means that certain issues are addressed. So while

827
00:48:56.419 --> 00:49:02.070
a very vicious person Might not Might not kind

828
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.229
of push an issue to the forefront, um, even

829
00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:07.919
though it is an issue, but it simply isn't

830
00:49:07.919 --> 00:49:10.659
a priority. A vicious person might be a bit

831
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:14.469
more sort of perseverant in doing that, which means

832
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.889
that the issue is addressed. Um, AND another maybe

833
00:49:17.889 --> 00:49:21.790
a controversial example of this is like everybody thinks

834
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.669
that like bigoted people are very bad, and I

835
00:49:24.669 --> 00:49:26.620
think that like, you know, often it sucks if

836
00:49:26.629 --> 00:49:28.939
if you've got a bigot in your group, right?

837
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:36.389
Um. But let's say that The bigoted person. Say

838
00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:41.709
some very bigoted things in public, then It might

839
00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:44.360
give an opportunity for the other members of the

840
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.110
group to kind of stand up and oppose it

841
00:49:48.429 --> 00:49:51.719
and to and to actually sort of acknowledge that

842
00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:54.840
the issue is alive, so the sort of very

843
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.439
quiet morality that nobody talks about gets suddenly heated

844
00:49:59.439 --> 00:50:03.419
up and it becomes an ethical discussion. Um, OF

845
00:50:03.419 --> 00:50:05.780
course these situations can be very annoying, right, and

846
00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.929
we don't always like to get into these discussions,

847
00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:10.260
but they can also be very productive, and I

848
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.949
really think that they can also be moments where

849
00:50:12.949 --> 00:50:16.179
the group sets new norms and takes a moment

850
00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:19.229
to get everybody on board with those new norms,

851
00:50:19.379 --> 00:50:23.439
right? Um, SO I don't think that annoying, you

852
00:50:23.439 --> 00:50:29.159
know, sort of emotionally difficult political discussions are always

853
00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:33.360
a bad thing. Disrupting the harmony isn't necessarily a

854
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.550
bad thing. Sometimes it is better that these things

855
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:38.040
bubble to the surface so that they can be

856
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.520
dealt with appropriately. So that's one example that I

857
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.229
think of when I think of moral vices actually.

858
00:50:46.649 --> 00:50:49.090
Being more being sort of morally beneficial for a

859
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.090
group. Um, BUT there's another, there's another aspect to

860
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:55.409
this as well. So if you think about the

861
00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:58.250
uh something like a division of labor, for any

862
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:01.250
task that human beings want to accomplish, it is

863
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.649
often efficient to have a division of labor. Um.

864
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:13.040
For something like mercy and punishment, um, it might

865
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.870
actually be much better if a group has people

866
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:21.070
that specialize in forgiveness and mercy, and others that

867
00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:25.939
specialize in sort of vindictiveness and spitefulness and punishment.

868
00:51:26.419 --> 00:51:29.810
Because if you think about the system of moral

869
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.330
norms that we have. It kind of needs, needs

870
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.610
both of those things. So we need some people

871
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.530
that are going to enforce a moral norm that

872
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.120
are going to punish you if you transgress it.

873
00:51:41.649 --> 00:51:43.330
But then again, we also need a little bit

874
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:46.489
of flexibility because there might be special circumstances where

875
00:51:46.489 --> 00:51:49.739
people cannot fulfill a certain moral norm, right? Um,

876
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.729
SO we do need people that are forgiving, and

877
00:51:53.729 --> 00:51:56.520
we also need people that are harsh and merciless,

878
00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.260
and It's very difficult for one person to be

879
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.260
both of those, um, to develop a skill in

880
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.739
being forgiving and also to develop a skill in

881
00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:09.419
being very harsh and punishing. I think that in

882
00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:11.939
most cases this is just not going to work

883
00:52:11.939 --> 00:52:14.250
for a single person, maybe unless you are very,

884
00:52:14.379 --> 00:52:17.850
very wise and you know exactly when to sort

885
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.739
of play a more harsh role and exactly when

886
00:52:20.739 --> 00:52:23.379
to be more forgiving. But I think for the

887
00:52:23.379 --> 00:52:26.419
vast majority of cases, it's gonna be better if

888
00:52:26.419 --> 00:52:32.100
there's different people specializing in different things, so. Actually,

889
00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:36.459
rather than having a bunch of very uniform, very

890
00:52:36.459 --> 00:52:41.540
similar, very balanced individuals, I think we actually should

891
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.810
have some people that are very Punishing and spiteful

892
00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.659
and others that are very forgiving. So I, I,

893
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.540
I prefer people with two opposite vices rather than

894
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.820
a set of virtuous people, and this is of

895
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.020
course very contradictory to virtue theory, but this is

896
00:52:59.020 --> 00:52:59.899
just what I think.

897
00:53:01.469 --> 00:53:05.100
So, uh, in the what, how about the Mendevillian

898
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:10.250
vices? What are them, and would, could you also

899
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.959
give us examples of that?

900
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:17.590
Yeah, sure. So Mandevillian virtues is when a vicious

901
00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:24.379
person contributes to collective virtue. Um, But Mandevillian vices

902
00:53:24.379 --> 00:53:29.520
are the opposite, so that's when The virtues of

903
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.439
a group of people actually culminate in something like

904
00:53:32.439 --> 00:53:38.189
vice, um. An example of this could be something

905
00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:43.389
like apt deference. So apt deference is an epistemic

906
00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:47.399
virtue, and what it means is that when a

907
00:53:47.399 --> 00:53:51.790
person does not know, um, does not know the

908
00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:54.070
answer to some question, that they are able to

909
00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:57.399
defer to somebody else who does. So for example,

910
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.780
saying something like, oh, I, well, I don't know

911
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.610
anything about, uh, I don't know anything about this

912
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.489
topic. I, I, I'm going to defer to this

913
00:54:06.489 --> 00:54:09.239
expert, uh, who is an expert on this topic.

914
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.719
That's an example of apt deference. And it is

915
00:54:13.719 --> 00:54:17.199
also a fact that when you don't know what

916
00:54:17.199 --> 00:54:20.510
the best solution to a problem is, very often

917
00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:23.560
the wisdom of the crowds, so the sort of

918
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.929
shared opinion of an entire group of people, is

919
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:29.600
more likely to be correct than your individual opinion.

920
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.560
So very often it is actually very rational for

921
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.709
people to defer to majority opinion because the majority

922
00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:44.360
is very often right about things. So Then you

923
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.760
get a kind of paradoxical thing where if every

924
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.820
single person inside a group is an apt deferer

925
00:54:53.199 --> 00:54:55.830
then in a situation where they don't know something,

926
00:54:56.199 --> 00:54:58.479
where there aren't any experts to tell them what

927
00:54:58.479 --> 00:55:02.500
to do, they're gonna defer to majority opinion. But

928
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.219
if everybody is deferring to majority opinion and if

929
00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:08.540
it is also rational for everyone to defer to

930
00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.179
majority opinion, then everybody is deferring to everyone and

931
00:55:13.179 --> 00:55:15.899
everyone else is deferring to everyone else. And then

932
00:55:15.899 --> 00:55:19.860
you get this weird sort of regressive deferring that

933
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.979
actually doesn't have any basis. So in order for

934
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:28.989
Majority opinion to be worth deferring to. You need

935
00:55:28.989 --> 00:55:31.600
a diversity of people and you need some people

936
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.070
at least who are not just deferring to what

937
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:37.350
other people are doing, right? So that's, that's a

938
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.909
very clear example of a Mandevillian vice. So where

939
00:55:40.909 --> 00:55:44.070
a good character trait like apt deference actually means

940
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:46.350
that um yeah, that you get this kind of

941
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:50.590
weird baseless collective behavior and I think that's um.

942
00:55:51.189 --> 00:55:53.540
Yeah, and I think that the same kind of

943
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.899
the same goes for lots of other collective traits

944
00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:58.340
as well, that they can sort of, even though

945
00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.459
individually these traits are good, they culminate in something

946
00:56:01.459 --> 00:56:03.479
negative. Mhm.

947
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.469
So, uh let me ask you then, particularly when

948
00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:10.909
it comes to the Mendeelian virtues. Uh, I mean,

949
00:56:10.919 --> 00:56:15.310
is it that because a rate, uh, that a

950
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:20.550
vice in particular individuals might end up being good

951
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:24.030
for the collective debt. I, I, I mean, does

952
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.300
that have any implications for how we think about

953
00:56:27.629 --> 00:56:30.989
that particular vice on an individual level? I mean,

954
00:56:31.149 --> 00:56:35.489
does it make it A good then or not?

955
00:56:35.909 --> 00:56:38.350
Yeah, yeah, so it, it, it gets a bit

956
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:41.590
paradoxical, right? Um, BECAUSE if on the one hand

957
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.590
I'm saying that app deference is bad when everybody

958
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:49.179
has it, does that mean that it becomes a

959
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:53.229
vice for the individuals who have it? Um, AND

960
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:56.669
my, so my answer to that would be that

961
00:56:56.669 --> 00:56:59.500
I still think that app deference is a virtue.

962
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.800
And I still think that a vice is a

963
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.010
vice, even if it has this kind of positive

964
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:10.169
effect within a group, but what we need to

965
00:57:10.169 --> 00:57:12.409
do is we need to say we need to

966
00:57:12.409 --> 00:57:15.080
see it as a vice on the individual level,

967
00:57:15.409 --> 00:57:18.290
but a virtue on a collective level, right? So

968
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:20.770
we need to shift the lens or the sort

969
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:24.250
of system that we are assessing that trait in.

970
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.300
Um, SO I don't, I wouldn't say that a

971
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.379
trait suddenly becomes a virtue just because it is

972
00:57:31.379 --> 00:57:34.209
useful in a particular context. I would say no,

973
00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.500
it is still, it's still a vice because you

974
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.060
take that person and you put them in any

975
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:41.010
other context, most likely they're not going to flourish

976
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.699
there and they're not going to cause others to

977
00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:47.590
flourish either. Yeah, so I think vices are just

978
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.260
vices and virtues are virtues. It's just if you

979
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.659
put them in a system with a bunch of

980
00:57:51.659 --> 00:57:53.939
other people, then we need to evaluate it in

981
00:57:53.939 --> 00:57:55.929
a slightly different way on a different level.

982
00:57:56.689 --> 00:58:00.179
Right. So let me ask you one last question

983
00:58:00.179 --> 00:58:07.040
then. How can virtue theory accommodate for Mendevillian emergent

984
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.639
goods?

985
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:13.459
Yeah, yeah, so this is um. Like, as I,

986
00:58:13.929 --> 00:58:16.370
as you know, as we talked about before, um,

987
00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.570
it's a bit of a paradox that vices can

988
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.860
sometimes be, you know, good or valuable and that

989
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.530
virtue can sometimes be bad. Um, SO I think

990
00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:30.409
that virtue and vice ethics need a kind of

991
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.179
way to accommodate this. They need some kind of

992
00:58:33.179 --> 00:58:37.590
answer to this problem. And the answer that I've

993
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:40.729
been developing in the last years is kind of

994
00:58:40.729 --> 00:58:43.949
a kind of a threefold answer. There's probably lots

995
00:58:43.949 --> 00:58:46.909
of other answers as well, but I think the

996
00:58:46.909 --> 00:58:50.310
first move we can make as theorists is to

997
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:55.510
say that Mandevillian virtues or vices on the individual

998
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:59.270
level, but at the moment that somebody's sort of

999
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:02.389
bigoted character traits is causing a group to be

1000
00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:08.209
very reflective and intellectually humble. The group has a

1001
00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:11.370
virtue, but the individual still has a vice. So

1002
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:13.889
it's about how that vice is embedded in the

1003
00:59:13.889 --> 00:59:16.290
rest of the group. So I think that there

1004
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.250
is a, there is kind of like a, there

1005
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.489
are two levels there. Something that is a vice

1006
00:59:20.489 --> 00:59:24.850
at the individual level can constitute or co-constitute a

1007
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:27.610
virtue at the collective level. And I think when

1008
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.520
you look at it like that, there doesn't need

1009
00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.729
to be a paradox there. So vice and virtue

1010
00:59:32.729 --> 00:59:36.290
are kind of like system properties that repeat themselves

1011
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:40.370
at different ontological levels. And um you know, the

1012
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.449
same goes for virtues as well. Like if you

1013
00:59:42.449 --> 00:59:45.409
have a Mandevillian, um, you know, so a Mandevillian

1014
00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:48.889
vice, so when lots of individually virtuous people culminate

1015
00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:51.050
in something bad, we say that the group has

1016
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:54.280
a vice, but all those individuals, they're still virtuous.

1017
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:57.649
So that's one way in which virtual theory can

1018
00:59:57.649 --> 01:00:01.090
respond by postulating that there is also something like

1019
01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:06.179
group character which is distinct from individual character. And

1020
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.830
another thing that we might do is, we might

1021
01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:11.149
just say that there are different types of vices

1022
01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:15.100
and different types of virtues. So, We might say

1023
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:21.449
that somebody's like bigotry is a motivational vice because

1024
01:00:21.449 --> 01:00:25.449
it's like the motivational structure behind it is one

1025
01:00:25.449 --> 01:00:29.209
that involves things like closed-mindedness and prejudice and bias

1026
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.659
and perhaps even a disposition towards spite or hatred.

1027
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.679
But we could see it as a teleological virtue.

1028
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.989
We could see it as um as a kind

1029
01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:44.580
of um as a way of improving a certain

1030
01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:47.699
kind of group that somebody's a part of, right?

1031
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.189
Um, SO we might say that there are different

1032
01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:53.080
virtues and vices and some of them are more

1033
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.030
focused on achieving a certain goal, right? So that's

1034
01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:02.780
another way to make that difference. And Then another

1035
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.610
thing we might do is to acknowledge the normativity

1036
01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:12.340
of vicious roles inside a group. So we might

1037
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.949
say that For example, for every group that makes

1038
01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:20.969
decisions, there should be at least one. At least

1039
01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:25.729
one like asshole representing a certain perspective, right? There

1040
01:01:25.729 --> 01:01:28.000
should be at least kind of like a devil's

1041
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.959
advocate, you know, a devil's advocate is a role

1042
01:01:31.169 --> 01:01:33.600
that is often given to people inside a group

1043
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.024
and that can be very productive. But of course,

1044
01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:40.415
a devil's advocate role is most likely going to

1045
01:01:40.415 --> 01:01:44.094
be played much better by an actual devil than

1046
01:01:44.094 --> 01:01:47.364
an angel pretending to be a devil, right? Um,

1047
01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:51.415
SO actually including vicious people inside a group might

1048
01:01:51.415 --> 01:01:54.695
be productive for that group and whether, whether it

1049
01:01:54.695 --> 01:01:57.334
is an epistemic task or a moral task that

1050
01:01:57.334 --> 01:02:00.340
you are engaged in, um. So those are kind

1051
01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.870
of my three theoretical solutions to the problem. We

1052
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.709
might might make a distinction between levels, individual collective

1053
01:02:07.709 --> 01:02:13.209
level virtues, a distinction between teleological and motivational virtues,

1054
01:02:13.639 --> 01:02:16.979
or just saying like, well, every group needs a

1055
01:02:16.979 --> 01:02:19.070
devil's advocate, and if we're going to have a

1056
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:22.469
devil's advocate, maybe that's just have a devil. Um.

1057
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.280
And I think, yeah, that it's, I, I like

1058
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.000
the solution a lot um because it it is

1059
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.479
kind of a solution of tolerance, right? Um BUT

1060
01:02:32.479 --> 01:02:36.719
rather than kind of saying that everybody should fix

1061
01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:40.600
themselves and become a kind of virtuous angel, I

1062
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.399
mean, of course I would love that. I would

1063
01:02:42.399 --> 01:02:44.840
love that if we wouldn't have vicious people in

1064
01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.399
the world anymore, would probably be great, but Since

1065
01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:51.399
that's, you know, often going to be unproductive and

1066
01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:54.479
maybe an unrealistic goal to strive towards, then maybe

1067
01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:57.790
we should just try to be good enough together

1068
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.159
and take the vicious people that are going to

1069
01:03:00.159 --> 01:03:02.639
be there anyway and try to figure out how

1070
01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:04.830
we can put them in a place that their

1071
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:10.060
vice is as As harmless as possible, and maybe

1072
01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.459
even productive for the rest of the group.

1073
01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:18.070
So, anything else we need to know about Mendevillian

1074
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:21.870
virtues and vices before we wrap up our conversation?

1075
01:03:22.989 --> 01:03:25.389
Anything else you need to know about Mandevillian virtues

1076
01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:30.969
and vices. I think I've probably said already the

1077
01:03:30.969 --> 01:03:34.979
most important things, um. I am going to be

1078
01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:37.010
working on this topic in the future as well,

1079
01:03:37.219 --> 01:03:40.770
uh, so do, do kind of keep my, um,

1080
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.770
do check out my web page.

1081
01:03:45.699 --> 01:03:48.790
OK, yeah, and apart from your web page, where

1082
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:51.669
can people find you and your work on the

1083
01:03:51.669 --> 01:03:52.000
internet?

1084
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.879
Yeah, I think my web page is actually the

1085
01:03:55.879 --> 01:03:58.350
best, but you can also send me an email

1086
01:03:58.659 --> 01:04:07.260
at m. Dot Atola at Tuft.nl. Um, I love

1087
01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:10.540
getting emails from people, so if anyone wants to

1088
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:15.189
um sort of challenge my viewpoints, um, or tell

1089
01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:17.949
me that I'm completely wrong or that I'm completely

1090
01:04:17.949 --> 01:04:20.790
right, uh, do reach out to me. I like

1091
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.360
