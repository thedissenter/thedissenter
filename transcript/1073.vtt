00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.769
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopton today

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.289
I'm joined by Doctor David Wolpert. He's professor at

4
00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
the Santa Fe Institute. Most of his work is

5
00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.889
in thermodynamics or computation, foundations of physics, dynamics of

6
00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:22.500
social. Organizations, machine learning game theory, and distributed optimization

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.959
slash control. And today we're going to focus on

8
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.239
a paper of his titled The Past as a

9
00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.090
stochastic Process. So, Doctor Wolpert, welcome to the show.

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.380
It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.529
It's a pleasure to be here. Very good to

12
00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:39.529
meet you and everybody else online. Yeah.

13
00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:43.290
So, just to introduce the topic, what is a

14
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.200
stochastic process?

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.520
Hm, OK. So, um, a deterministic process is something

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.630
that is governed, for example, by a differential equations.

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.599
Um, IT is something where the state of a

18
00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:05.040
system right now and this, um, uh, definition of

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.839
state might be somewhat elaborate, but the state of

20
00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:12.180
the system right now uniquely defines its future trajectory.

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.309
There is no randomness at all. So, um, the

22
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:21.010
idea of physics is that at the very foundation

23
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.099
of physics, if you have a closed system, so

24
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.660
it's isolated from the outside world, it is completely

25
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.019
deterministic. If I were to tell you right now

26
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:35.459
the precise positions of all the planets in the

27
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.220
solar system, And the sun, along with their masses

28
00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:43.199
and their velocities, and the, um, if there were

29
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:46.760
no gas to sort of add some randomness, then

30
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.279
I could tell you the positions and velocities of

31
00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:53.120
the planets millions of years into the future. Everything

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.599
is deterministic. It's bang, bang bang. Um, A stochastic

33
00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.959
process is the general, well, formerly in mathematics, what

34
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.860
the term refers to is A general um uh

35
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.419
mathematical structure that allows us to talk about trajectories

36
00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.199
into the future that, um, do not have that

37
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.500
characteristic that they're all bang bang deterministic. There is

38
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.460
inherent randomness. So, to give a simple example from

39
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.380
the foundations of physics, um, if there were to

40
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.600
be a quantum mechanical effects. That um have any

41
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.960
kind of implication for the trajectory of the system

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.240
we're interested in, then we have a stochastic process

43
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.800
going into the future. But also more generally, if

44
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.080
I don't have a system so precisely isolated from

45
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.440
all other variables, and it's so small and easy

46
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.889
to consider like the plants in the solar system,

47
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.979
then we as humans. Phenomenologically it's a simple matter

48
00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:09.080
of practice. Um, CANNOT avoid having stochasticity in all

49
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.860
of our, um, uh, predictions about the future process.

50
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.919
Um, WHAT are the stock markets going to be

51
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.399
tomorrow? What's the weather going to be in one

52
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.169
week? What's going to happen with the new power

53
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.330
in the United States starting up today? What are

54
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.210
the implications for the whole geopolitical system within a

55
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.360
month? Things like this. These all have somewhat randomness,

56
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.009
um, uh, some degree of randomness, and also that

57
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.240
randomness can grow. So in the most general sense,

58
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.289
a stochastic process is a mathematics. That allows us

59
00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:54.710
to deal with, allows us to analyze and investigate

60
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.520
and make predictions using such stochastic processes.

61
00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.500
So, but we're going to focus on the history

62
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.910
specifically here, which is what you do in your

63
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.789
paper. So what kinds of methodologies do you apply

64
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.410
when studying history?

65
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.429
OK, yeah. So, um, for example, if we were

66
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:19.178
predicting the future, that question about the geopolitical situation

67
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.679
one month from now. Um, SO, History, so in

68
00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:27.149
the, in the papers you're referring to of mine,

69
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.600
of mine and many others, um, we are considering

70
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.799
what's called deep history over very, very long time

71
00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:41.829
spans, um, phenomenology that applies to all civilizations. So

72
00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:47.649
the amazing thing. Um, THIS was developed, um, originally

73
00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:52.369
by about a group of about 50 archaeologists, um,

74
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.410
something called the Seshat data set. Seat was an

75
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.369
Egyptian god of, I forget what, to be quite

76
00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:03.359
honestly. Um, AND what it is, is a recording

77
00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:07.329
over um century intervals, so the year 100, the

78
00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:12.089
year 200, the year 300, of about 50 different

79
00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:17.940
characteristics of A human society at about 30 or

80
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.910
40 different locations on all planets all over the

81
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.480
world. And so it's a massive data set. It

82
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.679
was a huge undertaking. The reason that so many

83
00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.480
different archaeologists and anthropologists and historians were involved, was

84
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.920
because they had to all agree on a common

85
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.989
set of standards for measuring these 50 variables. What

86
00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:45.589
they found astonishing, it, it almost can't be true,

87
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.910
but it is, is that all civilizations across all

88
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.910
time, all human cultures, there are very, very striking

89
00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.989
clear trends in these time series data sets. All

90
00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:04.940
civilizations, all humans do the same kinds of things

91
00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.359
over intervals of century to century. Where we're talking

92
00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:12.910
at the level of big um uh geopolitical societies,

93
00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.559
things like Latium, the uh plain of uh Rome,

94
00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:21.950
things like the um uh plain um that had

95
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.075
uh um Kyoto, um. ERA Japan, things like um

96
00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:32.144
Mesoamerica, the Mayans, things like this, the um uh

97
00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:37.114
the um uh Khmer civilization, the Mekong Delta, the

98
00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:41.515
Mekong Rivers, those were all the geopolitical regions and

99
00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:44.785
the societies that existed there over these time scales

100
00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:51.109
followed these very striking trends. Bizarre. It's almost can't

101
00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:53.260
be true. It's like a joke from some science

102
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.510
fiction movie, a grade B science fiction movie. So

103
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.149
when I first encountered this, me and some of

104
00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.109
my collaborators, um, I didn't believe it. I dug

105
00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:06.350
into the statistics of this paper, um, because I

106
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.549
have a background doing machine learning. I've done a

107
00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:12.940
ton of different things in the past. Um, AND,

108
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.709
but I found that, nope, statistics is correct. These

109
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:19.940
conclusions are valid, but it was a first pass.

110
00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:22.589
There are some subtle things that they had not

111
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.149
looked into, or, or not so subtle, in fact,

112
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.660
some of them. So this is where me and

113
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.250
some of my collaborators, we start to investigate these

114
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.290
phenomena, and we found, for example, the following elaboration.

115
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.480
It turns out that all societies, when they start

116
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.119
going, get getting going, so things like through the

117
00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.559
year 500 or so, ancient China, ancient Rome, so

118
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:52.510
on and so forth, first, they grow in size

119
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.500
without any increase in their ability to perform computation,

120
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.519
where you measure a society, how well it can

121
00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.079
do computation. Um, IN terms of things like how

122
00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:06.359
sophisticated is the monetary system, how good is the

123
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:09.880
transport system, how many levels of bureaucracy, and so

124
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.119
on. At first, every single society grows in size

125
00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:17.790
without any increase in its ability to perform computation,

126
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.399
then it stops growing in size, only increases in

127
00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.440
essence, how smart it is until it reaches a

128
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.880
new threshold, and it's the same threshold for all

129
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.500
societies. And then bang, now it can start increasing

130
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.619
in size again. They all do this. So, how

131
00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.460
can we measure these things? This is a very

132
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.700
roundabout way of answering your question, but I'm getting

133
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:45.429
there. How can we um analyze this situation? One

134
00:08:45.429 --> 00:08:51.349
century intervals over say 56 1000 years for about

135
00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:56.900
30 different societies, since these are 50 different variables,

136
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.270
that is a teeny teeny teeny data set. It's

137
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.700
far too small for the dimension of the space

138
00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:08.349
to use some of the standard time series techniques.

139
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.169
You may have heard of things you or your

140
00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:14.950
um uh listeners, your viewers, like what are called

141
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.150
auto regressive models, ARMA models, um, a nonlinear time

142
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.140
series. These are the kinds of things that are

143
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.700
used all over Wall Street and so on. Those

144
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.719
require vastly more data than we have. So, what

145
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.679
we're doing is we're um using some of the

146
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:38.210
tools from the stochastic process literature. Which allow us

147
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.169
to say that we can view um the um

148
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:45.809
dynamics of all these societies in this 50 dimensional

149
00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:50.289
space, as though it were just a sum of

150
00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:55.760
two very simple processes. One is a deterministic trajectory.

151
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.940
If my society is here, the deterministic component says

152
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.489
we're going there in the space of characteristics of

153
00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:07.409
the society. But there's also Gaussian noise added to

154
00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:11.330
it. Wherever we end up in one century, that'll

155
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.210
be a new position, so there's a new trajectory

156
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.369
vector, and then we go in that direction where

157
00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:20.210
we add a little bit of noise, Gaussian noise

158
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.010
to that. And we just keep doing this, a

159
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.489
step by step by step where we add noise

160
00:10:26.489 --> 00:10:29.460
at each step. This has many fewer what are

161
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.020
called degrees of freedom, far, far simpler to fit

162
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.979
to the data set, and that's actually what we

163
00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:39.210
um have been considering in things like the paper

164
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.099
that you're referring to, that more recent one, the

165
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:46.690
past stochastic process. That is the underlying technical tool.

166
00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:49.690
It's called things like if, if anybody wants to

167
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.729
look it up, it's called Fucker Planck um dynamics,

168
00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:57.049
F O K K E R and then Planck

169
00:10:57.049 --> 00:11:00.760
is the um the very, very famous um physicist,

170
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.039
P L A N C K.

171
00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:06.979
So you might have answered partly at least the

172
00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:09.820
question I'm going to ask now, but what is

173
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.380
a stochastic process framework? How does it apply to

174
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.900
the study of history and what can we learn

175
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.690
from it?

176
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.690
Yes, so the, um, what I just gave you

177
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.440
is a simple example of of Farker-Planck dynamics where

178
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.219
you have what's called a veenner process, um W

179
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.640
I N E R. These are all famous. Mathematicians,

180
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:38.359
scientists from about a century ago, um, where you

181
00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:42.359
have Gaussian, um, noise added to each step. There

182
00:11:42.359 --> 00:11:46.159
are many variations of this basic idea that you

183
00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:49.760
can do, where at each moment, the key feature

184
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.039
of this that makes it so powerful and so

185
00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.469
easy to fit even when there's not much data,

186
00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:00.010
is that we are considering only the present. To

187
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.210
figure out where to go next. We're not looking

188
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.450
at the previous time steps as well. There's no

189
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.450
hidden variables with extra memory, like in what are

190
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.409
sometimes called hidden Markov models. We're ignoring all of

191
00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:15.650
that. We're approximating it away. That's what makes it

192
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.609
powerful. And there are things you can do like

193
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.119
you could have the um size of the Gaussian

194
00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:27.179
noise. The characteristics is called of the vener process.

195
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:31.140
Those could change across your space. You could have

196
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.349
there be a more sophisticated ways of changing this

197
00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:39.229
some uh underlying vector of directions and how it

198
00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:43.570
varies across the space. Your step that you're going

199
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.179
to take and then add a little bit of

200
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:49.340
noise to how that step, the direction, the size

201
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.849
of that step, how it varies across the space.

202
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.200
You can vary all these kinds of things. What

203
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.229
makes it again so powerful as a tool to

204
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:02.400
analyze human societies is precisely the fact that you

205
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.239
don't need to know all these earlier um values

206
00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:09.000
of my state. To figure out where I'm going

207
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.760
to go next, I don't need to know where

208
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.400
was I yesterday, the day before, the day before,

209
00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:18.320
and the day before that. In contrast, things like

210
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.760
what are called an auto regressive model or standard

211
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.479
nonlinear time series, you need to know all those

212
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:28.640
values as well, and that vastly complicates the entire

213
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.690
analysis. So that was, that's what makes it a

214
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:40.280
good tool. The underlying Philosophy. Is the following. There's

215
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.599
a vast amount of work in social sciences, and

216
00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:46.080
I've done it as well, cause I used to

217
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.599
do a bunch of work in game theory, but,

218
00:13:48.609 --> 00:13:51.340
uh, game theory as a field is kind of

219
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.549
broken, so you can only do so much there.

220
00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:57.080
Um, BUT, uh, the vast majority of social scientists,

221
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.500
including game theory, they are based on introspection. We

222
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.059
all sort of think about, oh, Ricardo, what do

223
00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:09.190
you think are the important issues concerning um how

224
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.909
a society will evolve? Oh, David, if I were

225
00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:14.739
a society, I would be paying attention to, um,

226
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:17.309
you know, I think people care about the rate

227
00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:19.710
of inflation. OK, that sounds good. Let's put that

228
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.030
in as a variable. And when we're talking about

229
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.849
just person to person interactions, social networks, what do

230
00:14:25.849 --> 00:14:29.469
we think is important? Well, um, uh, my buddy

231
00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:33.429
Ricardo. Do I think that Ricardo, um, is somebody

232
00:14:33.429 --> 00:14:36.909
who was good to me last week? Yeah, he,

233
00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:39.179
you know, he did, he did me some good,

234
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.159
good, good turn last week, so I'm feeling well

235
00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.359
to Ricardo right now, so I'm more likely to

236
00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:48.039
give him a little bit of slacker, you know,

237
00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:49.919
whatever it is that I can give. We do

238
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:54.400
this all based on introspection. We don't do that

239
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.640
for any of the other sciences. If you consider

240
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.520
something like physics or chemistry or biology, it's crucially

241
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.900
all based on observation. You let nature tell you,

242
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.559
the scientists, what is really going on. Um, WHEN

243
00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:14.940
I, uh, in another previous career, I was an

244
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.500
aerospace, um, an aeronautics professor at Stanford. One thing

245
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.539
that I used to say that was, I found

246
00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:27.780
to be so important about doing engineering as opposed

247
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.570
to just pure theory. Is that that provided a

248
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.010
way for nature to tell me what the truth

249
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.369
was rather than me to just introspect and think

250
00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:41.520
how it should go. Nature could take my brilliant,

251
00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:45.929
absolutely beautiful theoretical work, and then when it doesn't

252
00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:50.729
fly, nature turns around and says, so nature can

253
00:15:50.729 --> 00:15:53.570
turn around, I'm a human too. So nature can

254
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.369
turn around. And they can kick me in the

255
00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:59.729
ass, saying, David, you thought you were so smart,

256
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:01.609
you thought you had it figured out how the

257
00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:05.809
world really is. You're wrong. Your airplane just fell

258
00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:07.849
out of the sky. Go back to the drawing

259
00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:11.320
board, think about it again. This whole body of

260
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.909
work where we just had these 50 variables, that

261
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:18.150
far more than we would think about in terms

262
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.309
of introspection. These are the ones that have been

263
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:24.330
found working out in the archaeological field. In this

264
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.049
case, by looking at these flow patterns, these stochastic

265
00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:33.530
processes, going through these spaces of 50 variables, we

266
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.789
are allowing nature to tell us. What is going

267
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:41.469
on. We can sit here and think, oh, I

268
00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:44.549
would expect that once um my society grows to

269
00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:47.830
be the following size, then it might just keep

270
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.909
on growing. It doesn't have anything to do with

271
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:55.109
the computational power. No. Nature tells us, that's what's

272
00:16:55.109 --> 00:16:57.590
so important about this new body of work for

273
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:03.109
analyzing history. It's especially very, very different from the

274
00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:08.209
standard approach in what's called history or historiography, which

275
00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:11.910
is all based upon storytelling, it's narratives. It's the

276
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:17.689
last refuge. Of people from the 19th century who

277
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:22.880
did not want to introduce numbers and mathematical reasoning

278
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:27.449
into our understanding of the way the world works.

279
00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:30.599
That's in many ways, unfortunately, the profession of history.

280
00:17:31.089 --> 00:17:32.890
And this is just blowing that out of the

281
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.770
water, just walk, stepping around, all of that to

282
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.959
let nature tell us what's going on.

283
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:44.660
And in what ways is history a stochastic process?

284
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.189
Um, BECAUSE the evolution is noisy. As you and

285
00:17:48.189 --> 00:17:50.630
I were discussing, um, at the very beginning of

286
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.689
this interview, we don't know. We can make some

287
00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:57.089
predictions, and they might be likely to be true,

288
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.449
but we don't know what the state of the

289
00:17:59.449 --> 00:18:03.079
world is going to be. Is Ukraine going to,

290
00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.130
well, to just sort of speak politically, is Ukraine

291
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.250
going to face reality and actually form a peace

292
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.890
treaty where Putin will get some of the territory

293
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.770
but not have one, or is Ukraine going to

294
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.410
do a battle to the death? What's going to

295
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.010
be happening to the Chinese economy right now? It's

296
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.079
having a lot of difficulty. Is that going to

297
00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:27.040
continue and is it going to actually impede the

298
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.599
possibilities of China, um, slowly taking over the South

299
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:36.790
China Sea? Um, IS the United States going to

300
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.430
invade Greenland and the Panama Canal? What's going to

301
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.550
happen to NATO? We don't know. These are all

302
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:48.030
random, so that's the stochasticity. um, IN the stock

303
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.430
market, what's going to happen to the world's stock

304
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.670
markets in, um, in Japan, the Nikkei, in the

305
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.349
US, in Europe, what's going to be happening? These

306
00:18:57.349 --> 00:19:00.660
are all social systems. These are all part of

307
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.180
history. They will go into the history books that

308
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.939
are written about 2025, but it's random, so it

309
00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:11.760
is a stochastic process. That's the key. Everything in

310
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.760
the real world is a sarcastic process because we

311
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.800
cannot model things down at the level of atoms

312
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.199
and molecules, which is what which we would need

313
00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:25.060
to do to actually be able to view it,

314
00:19:25.199 --> 00:19:27.250
model it as a deterministic process.

315
00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:31.880
So as an example in the paper, you talk

316
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.119
about jumps in the socio-political complexity of politics. What

317
00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:40.109
can we learn about them through this framework?

318
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.239
Um, PRECISELY because of the, um, I gave as

319
00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:45.180
an example, maybe it was, I should have waited

320
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.459
until now, these two thresholds, if you look at

321
00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:56.660
If you very roughly decompose the um the dynamics

322
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.930
of the systems in the space of 50 variables

323
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.219
down to two separate variables. One, as I was

324
00:20:03.219 --> 00:20:07.660
mentioning, measuring the computational power of a society, and

325
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.420
one, just its size, how many people are in

326
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.709
your capital city, that kind of thing. So here

327
00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:17.619
is size, here is computational power, trying to get

328
00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:22.150
it right. Um, AND what you would see, there

329
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.150
are very clear thresholds. It's a sawtooth pattern. It

330
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.030
does this. It's not even a sine wave, it's

331
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.349
very sharp, and it's true for all societies. And

332
00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:35.290
so what we have learned, you, I could now,

333
00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:39.390
we could discover a new society somewhere. Figure out

334
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.780
what is its population according to um this measure,

335
00:20:42.989 --> 00:20:45.750
and what is its computational power according to this

336
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.180
measure, we would see, oh, it is right now

337
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.709
in between this jagged tooth and pointing down and

338
00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:58.310
this jagged tooth pointing up. So we could then

339
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.900
predict. Not exactly, but to high accuracy. Its future

340
00:21:03.189 --> 00:21:05.030
is going to be that it will keep on

341
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.829
growing its um computational power until it hits that

342
00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:11.670
spot, and then it will be growing in size

343
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.270
again. We can now do these things looking into

344
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.859
the past. It's amazing. Nobody thought there would be

345
00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:22.300
these kinds of rules. It's almost like Isaac Asimov's

346
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.739
foundation series, but it's all driven purely by the

347
00:21:25.739 --> 00:21:28.060
data rather than by mathematics.

348
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.900
So just a few minutes ago, you talked a

349
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.979
little bit about narrative approaches in the history. Is

350
00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:41.099
a stochastic process framework supposed to replace them or

351
00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:42.329
to complement them?

352
00:21:43.729 --> 00:21:50.199
Compliment, I guess, um, a more. Properly speaking, it's

353
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:55.479
a very strange thing, the sociology of the sciences

354
00:21:55.479 --> 00:22:01.579
of archaeology, anthropology. And history. Mostly, I guess I'm

355
00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:06.560
talking about the West, um. So what happened was,

356
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:12.589
everything was very, very quantitative, numerical, um, uh, economics,

357
00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:15.959
um, a whole bunch of the famous, um, economists

358
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:20.750
from the 19th century were also famous, um, uh,

359
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.880
physicists, for example. And then there was also Darwinism

360
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.290
and the idea that everything is a competition. All

361
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:35.689
of that is completely accepted. It's true. But there

362
00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.369
was a political process in the West. It was

363
00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:45.050
called social Darwinism, eugenics. People misinterpreted, people who were

364
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.069
not scientists, politicians, they had other purposes in mind

365
00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:50.810
of what they wanted to do rather than just

366
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:56.280
uncover the truth. They um took these insights. And

367
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.000
misunderstood them, misused them just like misinformation. It's, it's

368
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.489
an age-old kind of phenomenon to try to argue

369
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.680
certain races are intrinsically less advanced, they are all

370
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.760
deficient compared to others. Of course, their race, of

371
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.719
course, was the best one, and their country was

372
00:23:16.719 --> 00:23:18.359
the top, and so on and so forth. This

373
00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:22.079
was social Darwinism, this was eugenics, people going so

374
00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:25.729
far as to say that you should. Um, GIVE

375
00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:29.609
rights for having children based upon the intelligence of

376
00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:34.180
the adult. There was then a very, very strong

377
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.849
reaction against this. That reaction, it was very vicious

378
00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:44.569
and it was an overreaction. There's similar things in

379
00:23:44.569 --> 00:23:48.569
the field of biology. There's always overactions and then

380
00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:52.859
overreactions. It's the way these fields very often tend

381
00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:56.339
to go, the ones that have large aspects to

382
00:23:56.339 --> 00:24:00.949
them that are not just mathematics-based. Um, uh, BUT

383
00:24:00.949 --> 00:24:06.020
it was particularly pronounced. Anthropology and archaeology have started

384
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.670
to recover. You can now talk about equations and

385
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.630
so on in those fields for the most part.

386
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:18.859
History still has not. It's now you will. There

387
00:24:20.189 --> 00:24:23.219
Jokes made about how if you were to go

388
00:24:23.219 --> 00:24:26.439
to the annual meeting of the American Historical Association.

389
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:33.680
And propose a session on numerical approaches to world

390
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.839
history. There's no way that anybody would even consider

391
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.530
having such a special session. It's just, it's dogmatism,

392
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:47.530
it's theology. Um, THAT this is not what history

393
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:54.709
is, and that Thesis is actually very often. Presented

394
00:24:54.709 --> 00:25:04.270
associated with some. Almost moral. Reaction that's to try

395
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.510
to introduce numbers into these kinds of analysis of

396
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.660
human nature is immoral, it's evil. It almost has

397
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.560
that kind of a feel. Nobody says that. But

398
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.569
it, and they might not, nobody that might not

399
00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:19.569
even be conscious, but that is how strong the

400
00:25:19.569 --> 00:25:20.640
reaction can be.

401
00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:25.989
So I have one last question then talking about

402
00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:28.839
the future now and not so much about the

403
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:33.040
past. Would this sort of framework, a stochastic process

404
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.439
framework also allow us to make accurate predictions about

405
00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:41.439
the future and if so, what kinds of predictions?

406
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:46.540
Of course, there's a cliche. Prediction is hard, especially

407
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:53.040
about the future. Um, SO, Yes and no. We

408
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.709
are starting this we as a very broad group

409
00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:05.739
are starting to Bring these analyses up to involving

410
00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:09.180
more recent data sets. The kinds of stuff I

411
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.380
was presented before Seat, it's some successor, which is

412
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.900
called Equinox or many other data sets is what's

413
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.380
called the Human Atlas. Of um I forget what

414
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.290
it is, a human atlas or something or other,

415
00:26:22.459 --> 00:26:26.180
um, the these data sets mostly deal with the

416
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.130
deep past. When you come up closer to the

417
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.569
present, closer to the modern day, the past 500

418
00:26:32.569 --> 00:26:36.349
years, Your problem is no longer not enough data,

419
00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:40.770
it's far too much. Rather than only being able

420
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.050
to um uh record 50 variables, because that's all

421
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.729
that's left in the ground that we can actually

422
00:26:47.729 --> 00:26:51.719
look at, now there are millions, trillions, you know,

423
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:56.199
billions of variables that you could actually consider. So,

424
00:26:56.489 --> 00:27:02.359
to apply these tools to more modern situations, there

425
00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:04.130
is some work, a lot of it coming out

426
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.680
of the Santa Fe Institute, people like um Hidalgo

427
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.469
and Bernardo Uber and Bernardo um. Uh, I'm blanking

428
00:27:13.469 --> 00:27:17.750
on his name. It'll come to me. Um, THESE

429
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.699
are kinds of people, Housman, Ricardo Hausman, um, these

430
00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:25.229
people are doing certain kinds of analysis along these

431
00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:28.550
lines. Um, THERE'S also work being done by a

432
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.270
fellow called Peter Churchn. Um, THERE'S also me and

433
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.270
some of my other collaborators are starting to try

434
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.310
to, um, analyze more recent data sets. It's a

435
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:47.660
much more Challenging exercise and analyzing the past because

436
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.140
there's too much data now. There are other issues

437
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.420
as well. In a certain sense, history is speeding

438
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.739
up. So when we were looking at the past,

439
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.489
What was going to be 1000 years of changing

440
00:28:02.489 --> 00:28:05.969
of one particular society in the past can now

441
00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:10.040
happen in like a year, 5 years at most.

442
00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:12.010
It's very, you know, depends who knows how to

443
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.670
precisely measure it, but it's very, very fast because

444
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.050
population densities are so high and so on, and

445
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.329
this has to do with scaling behavior, what are

446
00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:27.089
called nonlinear, um, scaling properties of human cities and

447
00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:29.750
so on, and there. There's a huge amount of

448
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.819
work by people like Luis Bettencourt and Jeff West,

449
00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:35.959
and Chris Campus, other people associated with the Santa

450
00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:40.670
Fe Institute, and also many sociologists who were um

451
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.510
preceded them to actually start analyzing all of these

452
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.949
data sets about super linear scaling. What that means

453
00:28:47.949 --> 00:28:50.979
is that in a very real sense, the speed

454
00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:56.550
of historical changes is faster in large dense cities

455
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.770
than it is. In lower density ones, populations have

456
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.810
been going up, so that's speeding things up. Technologies

457
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.729
are changing very, very quickly. All of these things

458
00:29:08.729 --> 00:29:12.069
mean that what we could worry about for how

459
00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:14.770
accurate the predictions were for 10 or 2 1000

460
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.560
years when looking at the past. Now might be

461
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.050
the only kinds of accuracies we could even hope

462
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.199
to come to for looking into the future for

463
00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:26.969
5 years, except now that we have so many

464
00:29:26.969 --> 00:29:28.890
more variables, so we're not even sure how to

465
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.609
do it. So, long, long-winded answer, but the end

466
00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:38.209
of it is, yes, these different approaches that I've

467
00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:41.530
been talking about. Can be used to make predictions,

468
00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.849
geopolitical, um, economic predictions. We are sociopolitical predictions. We

469
00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:50.810
are starting to think about how to do this,

470
00:29:51.369 --> 00:29:55.380
but it is far more challenging, and those predictions

471
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.180
when we do have them, are going to be

472
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.410
far um less certain. They're going to be less

473
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.770
crisp than the ones that we did about the

474
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.250
past.

475
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:10.260
Great. So, doctor W purchase just before we go,

476
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.510
would you like to tell people if there are

477
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.869
any places on the internet where, where they can

478
00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:16.819
find your work?

479
00:30:17.869 --> 00:30:20.750
Um, THE easiest stuff, I guess, is my scholar

480
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:26.260
page. You can also, um, I've got a website,

481
00:30:26.449 --> 00:30:31.550
um, I think it's called this, um. I think

482
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.410
that's it. Um, MY own, uh, so you can

483
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.890
find a whole bunch of my stuff there, but

484
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.930
mostly in terms of this kind of work, it's

485
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.849
on my Google scholar. Um, I just, the thing

486
00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:47.260
is, I work in a huge number of fields.

487
00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:49.770
I work in what we've been talking about today.

488
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.530
I also work in computer science theory. I work

489
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:58.410
in a field called stochastic thermodynamics. Analyzing the stochastic

490
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.459
thermodynamics of computers like the one in your head

491
00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.729
right now, you call it your brain, or the

492
00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:07.160
one that we're, you know, the other very similar

493
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.250
computers that we're right now conversing over. Um, I've

494
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.250
got other bodies of work where I'm looking at

495
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.439
foundations of math. I have, I work on very,

496
00:31:18.569 --> 00:31:20.410
very many things. I'm still doing a little bit

497
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.650
of machine learning way back like 40 or 50

498
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.000
years ago. No, no, not that long. Um, 40

499
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.949
years ago, I was actually one of the original

500
00:31:28.949 --> 00:31:32.520
people doing machine learning. Before I frankly got bored

501
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.719
of it. Um, I got bored of it and

502
00:31:34.719 --> 00:31:36.880
I was also actually kicked out because I came

503
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.239
up with things called the no free lunch theorems.

504
00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:42.540
And people did not like those, um, it was

505
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.819
pretty vicious. Um, BUT any case, so I've been

506
00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:49.250
working on all these kinds of things. So what

507
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.839
we're talking about today, you can find it on

508
00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:55.810
my scholar, Google Scholar, but it's it's um buried

509
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.640
in with all these other kinds of papers as

510
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:57.920
well.
