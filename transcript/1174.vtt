00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.019
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.090
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.180
today I'm joined by Doctor David Bader Woods. He's

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.899
an associate professor in the department of philosophy at

5
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.569
the University of Warwick, and today we're talking about

6
00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.149
his new book, Arthur Schopenhauer, The Life and Thought

7
00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.940
of Philosophy's Greatest Pessimist. So, Doctor Bather Woods, welcome

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.540
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.129
Hi, thank you, it's a pleasure to talk with

10
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:28.750
you today.

11
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.159
So let me just ask you first, what got

12
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.080
you interested in Schopenhauer and his philosophy?

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.490
Good, so Schopenhauer was my gateway philosopher. I started

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.250
thinking about philosophical questions. In fact, I was probably

15
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.049
thinking about philosophical questions for a long time as

16
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.610
a, you know, as a child and certainly as

17
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.369
a teenager. I liked going into that level of

18
00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.599
depth about any given topic. But then I realized

19
00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:58.130
that was a thing, it was called ship of,

20
00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.069
you know, philosophy. And there was a sort of

21
00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.599
few questions I was particularly interested in. I, I

22
00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:07.279
was like. Interested in sort of more theoretical questions,

23
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.339
questions about free will and determinism, and I discovered

24
00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:14.900
this essay that Schopenhauer had written that he'd submitted,

25
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:16.739
I later learned as a uh you know, as

26
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.900
part of a competition, which he won in that

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.980
case, um, on the freedom of the will. And

28
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.779
reading it was just a transformative experience because I

29
00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:30.050
found him so clear. And he had views that

30
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.480
were in sympathy with my kind of naive assumptions,

31
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.330
but had communicated them with such precision and gone

32
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.150
so much further, and he was so entertaining, um,

33
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.889
it was, it was really, you really felt like

34
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.050
you could meet him there in the text, whereas

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.360
lots of other philosophers, I felt like there was

36
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.010
always barriers. I tried reading Kant and Heidegger and

37
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.410
people like that, and it was just hard to

38
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.989
wrestle with. So Schopenhauer was like a nice invitation

39
00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.989
that felt like there was depth there, but it

40
00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.629
wasn't inaccessible and he wanted you to know what

41
00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:05.949
he meant. So that was how I got interested

42
00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:07.699
in Schopenhauer and then it's just been an abiding

43
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:11.500
influence ever since, like I wrote my undergraduate dissertation

44
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.990
on Schopenhauer, I wrote my PhD thesis on Schopenhauer

45
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.309
and I've continued to write and read about him

46
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.809
ever since.

47
00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.850
Mhm. OK, so let's talk then about what you

48
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.169
explore in the book, his life and philosophy. You

49
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.850
start the book by exploring his life when he

50
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.449
was in the grip of both uh midlife crisis

51
00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.839
and the global health crisis. So tell us about

52
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:36.570
that bit.

53
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.440
Yeah, well I suppose I started the book or

54
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.899
the idea for the book during the, the pandemic.

55
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.360
I remember having a, a Zoom er seminar with

56
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.320
a few colleagues to talk about an idea I

57
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.509
was writing about Schopenhauer on solitude or um given

58
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.220
that we were all self-isolating, I was interested in

59
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.600
the question of the value of solitude and the

60
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.559
value of sociability. Um, AND then. I hadn't realized

61
00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.770
until starting to really research the book and going

62
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.960
in a more biographical direction, that of course Schopenhauer

63
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.889
lived through a pandemic, you know, cholera, which er

64
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.449
we do think of, like if you think of

65
00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.070
a, Any 19th century novel, probably cholera, somebody's gonna

66
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.509
die of cholera. Either cholera or tuberculosis, because it

67
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.350
was really prevalent, it was kind of, there was

68
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.710
a, a big pandemic of uh cholera early in

69
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.169
the 19th century and then a second wave uh

70
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.990
in the 1830s that really ripped through Europe. And

71
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.710
Schopenhauer was caught in that, um, in particular as

72
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.139
it manifested in, in Berlin. Uh, BUT it was

73
00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.419
also in Berlin, it was towards the end of

74
00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.979
his, one of the most, you know, disappointing periods

75
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.250
of his life. For a man who thought that

76
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.550
life was just endlessly disappointing, if that's saying something.

77
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.259
And, um, and so it was kind of an

78
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.199
interesting. Pivotal moment to start in where the world

79
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.039
is kind of frightening and frightening in a way

80
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.270
that readers would be familiar with, having all of

81
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.399
us, I think lived through a pandemic of a

82
00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.329
different disease. And then er you know, having a

83
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.769
very personal significance for Schopenhauer cos it's the moment

84
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.290
when he is weighing up whether to stay in

85
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.440
a city where everything had gone wrong, he'd gone

86
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.489
there to teach and hadn't had much success as

87
00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:32.029
an academic. So yeah, it seemed like the right

88
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.570
place to sort of see Schopenhauer at kind of

89
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.890
his lowest ebb in order maybe to build him

90
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.869
back up throughout the book.

91
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.059
I'm, and I mean, you mentioned solitude. What role

92
00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.119
do you think solitude played in Schopenhauer's life?

93
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.100
Yeah, pretty consistent role, I think he was, I

94
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.420
mean he had a few. A very few close

95
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.820
friends, particularly in the first half of his life,

96
00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.980
um, he had one friend who was a. The

97
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.130
son of one of his father's French business associates,

98
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.660
who, who was kind of came in and out

99
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:18.200
of Schopenhauer's life. Um, Jeanine, uh, Gregoire, uh, and,

100
00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.489
um. That was really his only really close friend

101
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.709
in his in his childhood. Um, AND his sister

102
00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.850
as well who came along when Schopenhauer was about

103
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.230
9 or 10. Other than that, he just struggled

104
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.820
to have any kind of intimate relationships, you know,

105
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.869
meaningful, profound relationships. And so he was a quite

106
00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:43.109
a solitary, you know, lonely man. By circumstance and

107
00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:47.299
disposition. But he works that out in his philosophy,

108
00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:50.269
he kind of gives a. A kind of philosophical

109
00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:53.570
basis on which to defend the condition of solitude,

110
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.420
that it, that it might be in some ways

111
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.790
a virtue to be able to, spend time with

112
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.470
yourself, be comfortable in your own company, and it

113
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.940
might even be, A condition of certain other values

114
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.489
like being able to think for yourself without too

115
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.779
much outside influence, um, and so you know, he

116
00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.619
was solitary as a person, as a biographical fact,

117
00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.420
but he also thought that he also gave a

118
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.500
kind of philosophical defense of, of solitude and it's

119
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.160
grounded in the idea that. Um, SOLITUDE is. A

120
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.959
precondition of being able to, to think for yourself,

121
00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.640
to be able to come to your own conclusions,

122
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:35.980
which was a really important intellectual value for him.

123
00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:39.339
Um, IF, if something isn't the result of thinking

124
00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.399
for yourself, he, he seems to think it's not

125
00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.320
in a way not real knowledge, which is kind

126
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.799
of an interesting stance on knowledge because we might

127
00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.339
think that knowledge is just about having the correct

128
00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:51.290
information, the correct facts, but he actually focuses quite

129
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.130
heavily on where, where the information comes from. Whether

130
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.820
it's been really gathered and chewed over by yourself

131
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.140
and and and and therefore becomes a kind of

132
00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:06.320
organic part of your, Um, of your system of

133
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.000
beliefs or what have you, or whether it's kind

134
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.200
of a Frankenstein's monster of bits and pieces you've

135
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.350
scraped together from sources that you haven't really considered

136
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.399
critically, so it's quite interesting that he thinks that

137
00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.640
knowledge, good quality knowledge is as much about the

138
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.779
process by which you, you come to it. Um,

139
00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.320
SO that's why he thinks thinking for yourself in

140
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.440
a condition of solitude is the, is the best

141
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.339
way to know the world.

142
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.950
So there's also an element of self-reliance in his

143
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.320
philosophy. Correct.

144
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.149
Yeah, absolutely, you know, um, he does think, I

145
00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:41.799
mean to the point where. To the point where

146
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:45.700
it becomes a little bit implausible, like these days,

147
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.250
I think we are happy to acknowledge that. Human

148
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:58.570
beings have indissoluble social needs. And there's something irreducibly

149
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.290
valuable about interacting, like, like you and I are

150
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.450
now, right? We're not just here to have a

151
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.730
knowledge exchange, you and I, by talking together, deriving

152
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.769
all sorts of. Things that are making our day

153
00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:14.709
go better than just than just a knowledge interchange.

154
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.290
Yeah. Um, THAT'S something that Schopenhauer kind of studiously

155
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.149
ignores, you know, perhaps because he, he has to

156
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:27.250
reckon with the fact that he doesn't have a

157
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.529
lot of people in his life to, to derive

158
00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:32.250
that kind of value from, what have you. So

159
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.150
he goes to great lengths to. Give alternative explanations

160
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.549
for where sociability comes from, like for instance, he

161
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.469
thinks ultimately people socialize just because they're, they're bored,

162
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.070
you know, and, and, and by disposition we actually

163
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.590
find each other very, you know, hard to take

164
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.789
and intolerable, but, but we become so bored if

165
00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:54.289
we don't eventually kind of interact with somebody that

166
00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:56.669
that it um that it drives us back into

167
00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:59.789
society and so on. So yeah, so he almost

168
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:04.750
overdoes the whole self-reliance, the whole solitary lone wolf

169
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.030
thing er by today's standards. But because of that

170
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.369
kind of blind spot, it means he he has

171
00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:13.510
to do a lot of work thinking about the

172
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.070
value of solitude, so he goes really deep in

173
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.849
that direction of what the value of solitude is,

174
00:09:19.229 --> 00:09:22.469
um. So it's, yeah, even though I do think

175
00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:24.789
he was a bit blind to the value of

176
00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:28.510
sociability, um, I do think it made him really

177
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.989
focused on the idea of solitude in a way

178
00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:34.229
that um means he develops lots of the depths

179
00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:37.270
and details of why it's important to be, you

180
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.710
know, to be self-reliant. In particular again cognitive self-reliance,

181
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.250
he's not really talking that much about. Emotional self-reliance

182
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.770
too much or material self-reliance, he's not talking about

183
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.289
Thoreau going into the woods and being able to

184
00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:53.169
chop your wood, not that I think that Thoreau

185
00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:56.890
actually apparently lived that kind of really that kind

186
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.169
of secluded existence, but he's not talking about, you

187
00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:02.590
know, paddling your own canoe and, you know, whatever.

188
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.690
Uh, IT'S, it's cognitive self righteous that really being

189
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.130
a free thinker in, in, in, in the true

190
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.469
sense of all your views coming from yourself.

191
00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:13.849
Mhm. So I, I wanted to ask you, I

192
00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:16.770
mean, I was thinking about saving this question for

193
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.830
later after we went through all of the main

194
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.770
events in his life and the, the main aspects

195
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.690
of his philosophy, but perhaps I will ask it

196
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.289
now. So, uh, I mean, to what extent do

197
00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:36.724
you think his philosophy was informed. By his own

198
00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:40.684
psychological predispositions because I mean, I'm not saying or

199
00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:46.205
claiming that all of his psychology was uh innate

200
00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:48.205
in some way that he was born with it,

201
00:10:48.284 --> 00:10:50.885
but perhaps there was some of that, but, but

202
00:10:50.885 --> 00:10:54.724
he also went through some particular kinds of experiences

203
00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:58.244
that we can talk more about in our conversation.

204
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:03.090
But I, I mean, sometimes philosophers get a little

205
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.969
bit upset if, for example, someone says that maybe

206
00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:13.590
the philosophy of a particular philosophy, philosopher was very

207
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.650
influenced by his own psychological predispositions instead of just

208
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.130
looking into his arguments and if they are sound

209
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.489
or solid or something like that. But in the

210
00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:28.010
particular case of Schopenhauer, I mean, would you say

211
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:33.789
that perhaps his pessimism was, uh, a, um, I

212
00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:38.450
mean, the result of his own psychological predispositions, at

213
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.469
least to, to an extent?

214
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.820
Yeah, it's, it's a really interesting area like both

215
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.010
in. In looking at Schopenhauer, and looking at philosophy

216
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:56.200
and biography, you know, in general. And I want

217
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.940
to try to be really careful. About You know,

218
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.219
specifying that relationship because yeah, you're right, you want

219
00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:07.260
to, you, you want to avoid a kind of

220
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.059
really crude, psychological reductionism or or biographical fallacy where

221
00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:14.489
you think that all of his views are just

222
00:12:14.489 --> 00:12:17.979
expressions and functions of his of his temperament, of

223
00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:20.909
his biography and and so on, you know. N

224
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.080
Nietzsche kind of skirts that line a little bit

225
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.780
in the way that he sometimes discusses Schopenhauer, and

226
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.500
even Nietzsche, you know, famously says that all philosophy

227
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.200
is unconscious autobiography or something like that. Uh, WHICH

228
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.679
is a, it's an interesting idea. I don't, I,

229
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.479
you know, I'm sure there's more to, to Ntsche's

230
00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:39.440
view than that. Um, AND especially when it comes

231
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.880
to making evaluative judgment, you know, it would, I

232
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.679
think it would be a fallacy to say, for

233
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:48.109
instance, well, Scherenhauer's pessimism is philosophically groundless because it's

234
00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:52.239
all just him working out his, you know, grief

235
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.400
and anguish about the, some of the tragic events

236
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.039
that happened in his life. That would be obviously

237
00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:01.270
wrongheaded, um. So we need to avoid those dangers.

238
00:13:01.609 --> 00:13:04.890
On the other hand. On the other hand, I

239
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:13.090
mean, I think it's It is interesting context. To

240
00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:16.630
consider, you know, his views. In light of his

241
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.929
life. Um, SO for instance, some, some, some of

242
00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:24.809
the views that might seem surprising turn out not

243
00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:27.760
to be as wild and surprising as, as one

244
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.090
might think. Uh, HIS views on sexuality, for instance,

245
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.770
at first I thought, wow, he must be, he's

246
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.809
really, um, going out on a limb here because

247
00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:40.679
for instance he discusses same-sex relationships briefly. Um, AND

248
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.659
his views on that are kind of. A little

249
00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:45.780
bit iffy, to say the least, but it's interesting

250
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.409
nonetheless that a person in the 19th century, 19th

251
00:13:48.409 --> 00:13:52.510
century Europe would be talking about those things. But

252
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.830
then the more I look into it, the more

253
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.989
I realize that actually there were others too who

254
00:13:56.989 --> 00:13:59.270
were who were trying to say similar things and

255
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.609
maybe even say things that were more advanced than

256
00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:04.950
what Schopenhauer's thinking on these on these topics. Same

257
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.909
with maybe his views on race and and and

258
00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:09.750
so on. Um, OR if you look at the,

259
00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:11.390
you know, he, he often tries to put his

260
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:16.150
own pessimism in context by giving loads of quotations

261
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.150
from sources that go all the way back to

262
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.739
the ancients, whether it be both Eastern and Western

263
00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:25.830
traditions. Um, AND put it on a real, you

264
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.030
know, a real philosophical footing, you know, where, where

265
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.750
you can see, well, no, this isn't just one

266
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.630
man's battle with his temperament. This is something that

267
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.270
human beings have been. You know, writing about, I

268
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.640
mean the the the idea that maybe we shouldn't

269
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.729
have been born is something that, and I thought

270
00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:45.950
that human beings have been. Mulling over for yeah

271
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:51.000
for literally mill millennia, um, so, so I, I

272
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.659
find it. I find it helpful to look at

273
00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:57.530
the ideas in context. Um, I actually find it

274
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.969
sometimes helps to, to look at it both ways,

275
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.989
which is. Not just to think of, not, not

276
00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:07.590
just to look at his ideas in the light

277
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.989
of the events in his life. Whether his ideas

278
00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:13.590
may have came from, but actually looking backwards, which

279
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.830
is to kind of use his own ideas as

280
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.059
a way of interpreting his life events, right, um,

281
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.140
which I think is a nice sometimes way of

282
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.580
getting around the, this kind of genetic fallacy, is

283
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.030
that we're not saying that his ideas have come

284
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.020
out of that, um. Simply, you know, and straightforwardly

285
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.460
come out of those events, but now, you know,

286
00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.090
once we've got those ideas in place, we can

287
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.729
use those ideas to analyze and interpret his life

288
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.179
events. So his views on suicide, for instance, you

289
00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.500
know, because his own father died in what was

290
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.659
suspected to be a suicide when Schopenhauer was a

291
00:15:44.659 --> 00:15:48.890
teenager. You know, I think the crude reductionist view

292
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.969
would be, oh well, his views are all just

293
00:15:50.969 --> 00:15:53.250
a function of er his views on suicide is

294
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.369
just a function of um his, his the biographical

295
00:15:57.369 --> 00:15:59.849
facts of his life and what have you. But

296
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.229
and a kind of more interesting way to look

297
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.510
at it is say well these are the facts,

298
00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:04.799
these are what happened in his life, these are

299
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:07.390
the views that he can give a philosophical grounding

300
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.989
for, and now can we use the views as

301
00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:13.309
a way of interpreting the facts. Uh, CAN we,

302
00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:14.710
can we use that as a way of shedding

303
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.789
light and understanding his life events better. So that's

304
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:19.950
something I try and do in the book as

305
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.469
well, is try and read the events in the

306
00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:24.039
light of the ideas rather than the other way

307
00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:27.669
around. So. So yeah, I have, I haven't managed

308
00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:30.950
to be as um specific as I, I think

309
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.349
it's hard to be totally precise and specific. I

310
00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:34.710
suppose the one thing I can say for sure

311
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.570
is that I, I'm not of the view that

312
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.590
biography has nothing to do with philosophy. I think

313
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.429
they have everything to do with each other, even

314
00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:45.770
though I think you need to avoid certain fallacies

315
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.869
um of just reducing theo the philosophy to the

316
00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:49.630
life events.

317
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.929
OK, so let's talk about the topic of punishment.

318
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.770
First of all, before we get into Schopenhauer's philosophy

319
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.909
about that and what he had to say about

320
00:17:00.909 --> 00:17:05.050
it, in what ways was Schopenhauer exposed to punishment

321
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.949
in his early life?

322
00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:11.368
Yeah, there's, there's a very famous, um, a kind

323
00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:13.968
of another pivotal moment in Schopenhauer's life which I,

324
00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:15.608
which I discussed in the book and which is

325
00:17:15.608 --> 00:17:19.198
in, I think all the biographies. Which is, um,

326
00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:22.398
his parents, when Schopenhauer was a teenager in the

327
00:17:22.398 --> 00:17:26.048
early 1800s, um, his parents took him on a

328
00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:28.848
grand tour of Europe which was very fashionable for,

329
00:17:29.328 --> 00:17:32.509
you know, upper middle class families at the time,

330
00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:38.000
um. And the Schopenhauer family were quite cosmopolitan, internationalist,

331
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.780
and that, you know, er they enjoyed world literature

332
00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:45.719
and international culture and so on. Um, IT was

333
00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:47.239
offered to Schopenhauer sort of as a little bit

334
00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:49.339
of a bribe actually as well, cos he already

335
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:50.949
was showing signs that he might not want to

336
00:17:50.949 --> 00:17:53.040
go into his father's business of being a, a

337
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.839
shipping merchant. And they said, well, come along, you

338
00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.680
know, as a kind of appeasement, come along for

339
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.760
this wonderful 2 year grand tour, and when you

340
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.520
come back there you've got to go and become

341
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.599
a merchant and what have you. But as part

342
00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:06.400
of it, um, one of the kind of more

343
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.520
grisly sides of early 19th century tourism, which would

344
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.839
be unthinkable today I guess, unless it was very

345
00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:15.839
kind of veiled. Is that they would go to.

346
00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:20.569
Sites of human suffering, um, they would go to

347
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.969
visit prisons and work camps, um, they would even

348
00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:27.530
visit asylums in some cases like the Schopenhauer nearly

349
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.170
visited Bedlam Asylum when it was loc at the

350
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.619
time located in central London. Um, ALTHOUGH even by

351
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:37.089
then in the early 19th century, we're talking 1803,

352
00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:39.859
1004, it was closed to the public, so already

353
00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:41.339
there was a shift in attitude that this was

354
00:18:41.339 --> 00:18:43.569
really inhumane to kind of show these people off

355
00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:45.900
as a spectacle. But what was still there as

356
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.569
a spectacle in, in France, so in, in, in,

357
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.540
um, on the south coast of France, there was

358
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.650
the very famous Baue of Toulon, which was an

359
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.270
open air. Slave labor camp, and um if you've

360
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.229
ever seen the trailer maybe for Les Miserables, the

361
00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:04.630
film version, if you've read the novel that's even

362
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.209
better, but, um you might have caught the um,

363
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.469
you know, Hugh Jackman, who plays Jean Valjean, um

364
00:19:12.469 --> 00:19:15.430
pulling these huge, you know, ship masts and stuff

365
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.890
and you know, these enormous chains and things because

366
00:19:18.229 --> 00:19:20.709
the character of Valjean is, is, is imprisoned in,

367
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.869
in this uh labor camp. And actually Schopenhauer was

368
00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:29.030
there at the time when, Hugo, um. McDougall, who

369
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.270
wrote the er the novel Les Miserables, sets the,

370
00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:36.410
the events and um Sherman actually saw these men.

371
00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:41.599
Being, you know, literally chained to their benches, chained

372
00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:43.930
to one another, they would, they would have some

373
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.670
of the most serious offenders would have their sentences

374
00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:51.479
and their crimes branded on their skin. I've read

375
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:56.140
anyway. Um, REALLY horrendous inhumane stuff. And as a

376
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.410
teenager, Schopenhauer was about, I don't know, 1516. Uh,

377
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.109
AT the time, and, uh, he, he writes in

378
00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:06.790
his diary how shocked he is. Um, IT really

379
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.900
is an awakened, later he reflects on it like,

380
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.239
like the Buddha's awakening, like, um. Like a prince

381
00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:16.069
who's been lived a sheltered life, coming out and

382
00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:17.949
seeing the world and realizing it's just all death

383
00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:22.209
and suffering, things like that. Um So he knew

384
00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.670
a lot about suffering and uh you know punishment

385
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.729
um and and how inhumane it can be, and,

386
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.650
and, and if you, you know, use that as

387
00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.449
a way into his work, you can see there's

388
00:20:31.449 --> 00:20:36.479
just, there's, Metaphorical and literal examples of punishment just

389
00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:40.569
everywhere, it's one after I think business metaphors, which

390
00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:43.449
is, that can also be read biographically given his

391
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.910
backstory. After business metaphors and financial metaphors, I think

392
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.750
metaphors of punishment appear most frequently in the way

393
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.910
that Schopenhauer tries to articulate his pessimism. Mhm

394
00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.709
And so what did he write on the topic

395
00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:04.949
of punishment? How did he approach it philosophically?

396
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.459
Yeah, so if we're thinking about literal punishment, um,

397
00:21:08.469 --> 00:21:10.920
it's quite easy to discern Schopenhauer's views. He was

398
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.430
very firmly a deterrentist. Um, HE thought there was

399
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.689
no such thing as deserved punishment. He was rather

400
00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:21.030
like Jeremy Bentham. Jeremy Bentham famously had a horror

401
00:21:21.369 --> 00:21:23.770
of the idea of somebody deserving to suffer because

402
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.209
he just thought suffering is just negative, you know,

403
00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:29.540
it's just a bad thing. Um, AND so it's

404
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.069
never deserved even if maybe it can be justified

405
00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:34.900
in, in, you know, for some kind of more

406
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.650
future orientated goal like, like setting a. An effective

407
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.930
deterrent, and Schopenhauer's very much of that camp and

408
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.089
there's more in his political philosophy than he does

409
00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:47.949
to to justify a deterrent theories, theory of punishment.

410
00:21:49.469 --> 00:21:52.290
Um, IF we're talking about metaphors of punishment though.

411
00:21:53.469 --> 00:21:58.890
Um, HE thinks that one way to navigate life.

412
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.369
One kind of overarching interpretation of what life is.

413
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.189
Is a is a sort of punishment, um, in

414
00:22:08.189 --> 00:22:11.900
order to make some of. Some of life's events

415
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.300
more intelligible, more legible to us, because if we

416
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.560
think of, if we navigate life as though it

417
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.060
was perhaps a place of reward, that it's a

418
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.540
kind of paradise and therefore of course that would

419
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.560
be incredibly naive, but there's elements of that view

420
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.530
in everyday psychology when we're kind of surprised. That

421
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.609
we aren't more happy and that there are, you

422
00:22:33.609 --> 00:22:37.510
know, we're surprised that we're constantly being frustrated and

423
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.380
er we're constantly. Um, FACING adversity and things like

424
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.819
that, none of that is surprising if you think

425
00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:47.660
of. The world not necessarily literally as a place

426
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.579
of punishment, although sometimes Schopenhauer comes close to that.

427
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.130
But as akin to it or structured like a

428
00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.130
place of punishment. Um, LIKE an open air prison,

429
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:03.609
you know, um, and, and then in particular, so

430
00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:05.930
he, he often talks about life as a kind

431
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.489
of its own hell, you know, that there's no

432
00:23:08.489 --> 00:23:11.770
need for a kind of an infernal afterlife because

433
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.500
it's, we're already here, you know, we're already. Um,

434
00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:18.660
YOU know, the, the crime, whatever it is that

435
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.599
we've committed and that, that means that we're here,

436
00:23:21.979 --> 00:23:24.489
uh, is its own, is its own punishment, to,

437
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.619
to, to exist is the crime and to exist

438
00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:29.849
is, is, is the punishment. So he uses, uh,

439
00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:32.020
kind of overarching metaphor of punishment as one way

440
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.459
of understanding, making sense of what the world is

441
00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:37.900
like, and, and, and it's not necessarily a comforting,

442
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.839
that's the thing, he. He doesn't think, one of

443
00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:44.140
his kind of big principles is that we shouldn't

444
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.750
use comfort as a guide for making sense of

445
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.479
the world cos it's often going to misguide us.

446
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.400
Um, WE should use, you know, an imminent sense

447
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.380
of self, uh, a sense of, uh, making, making

448
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.219
sense. Um, SO we should, uh, try to opt

449
00:24:01.219 --> 00:24:03.239
for those interpretations of the world that actually just

450
00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:06.219
make all the pieces fit together, like solve the

451
00:24:06.219 --> 00:24:10.880
jigsaw puzzle and. The puzzle is Much more coherently

452
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.400
solved if we think of the world as like

453
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.060
adversity being, and frustration being baked into it in

454
00:24:17.069 --> 00:24:18.560
in the way that is the case with the

455
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.439
punishment, um, rather than it would, it's the world

456
00:24:22.439 --> 00:24:24.719
becomes very confusing if we, if we think of

457
00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:27.079
it as anything else really. So that's where the

458
00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:31.109
metaphorical sense of sense of punishment comes in. Um,

459
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.859
AND sometimes he became specifically interested, like I've done

460
00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:37.469
some work on Schopenhauer's views on solitary confinement, which

461
00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:39.780
again, this is another, this is a really good

462
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.910
example of where looking at things in context is

463
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.510
important, because until the late 18th century, early 19th

464
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:53.369
century. Imprisonment was, was a kind of um, wasn't

465
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:55.449
itself a form of punishment, so you would imprison

466
00:24:55.449 --> 00:24:59.339
somebody when they were, Awaiting punishment, and punishment would

467
00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:04.140
be something like. You know, being pilloried or being

468
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.619
hanged or being fined if you're lucky, or, or

469
00:25:07.619 --> 00:25:11.260
whatever, um, but imprisonment itself, just incapacitation of a

470
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.680
person, was not, of course it would be unpleasant,

471
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.339
it'd be something people would want to, it might

472
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:16.979
be function as a deterrent in itself, but it

473
00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:20.300
wasn't considered a form of punishment. Now, in the

474
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.260
21st century, we consider all of those other things

475
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.540
I just mentioned inhumane, well, at least in any

476
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.599
kind of, Humane country Nevertheless, we tolerate imprisonment, we

477
00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:34.479
just, we, we almost equate punishment with imprisonment. That's

478
00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:36.479
when you say, you know, you might be punished,

479
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.000
you're, you're, you instantly think of being imprisoned. But

480
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.800
that's a, that's a historical development. Um, AND in

481
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.599
particular, being imprisoned on your own, so the form

482
00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:50.719
of solitary confinement was a 19th century invention. And

483
00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:53.810
that's something that again, Schopenhauer was, was obviously wise

484
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.000
to because there's traces of references to it in

485
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.180
his work and how he thought that was a,

486
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.209
A punishment that seemed more humane, that it was

487
00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:06.319
moving away from these terrible. Overtly violent forms and

488
00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:08.479
brutal forms of punishment, but he thought it was

489
00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:11.760
very, like a, a secretly, a surreptitiously brutal, like

490
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.060
mentally, one of the most brutal forms of punishment,

491
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:17.359
you can find, and there he was actually, once

492
00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:19.119
you tease that view out ahead of his time

493
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.000
because, or, or kind of at least aware of

494
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.349
how the times were moving, because now we are

495
00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:28.109
very aware, and there are whole charity groups and

496
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:34.569
activists who um who watch um um. Keep a

497
00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:38.170
watch out for instances of solitary confinement and and

498
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.660
human rights violations and things like that, so, so

499
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.140
yeah, so there's the, the literal theory of punishment

500
00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.410
which is he's a deterrent deterrentist. There's the way

501
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.660
he uses the metaphor of punishment to articulate his

502
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.500
pessimism, and there's specific forms of punishment that show

503
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.979
that he was keeping abreast of the, of the

504
00:26:55.979 --> 00:26:57.810
news of what's going on in the, in the

505
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.000
19th century world.

506
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.420
So earlier you mentioned how there's the suspicion that

507
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.459
his father might have committed suicide. So how did

508
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:12.280
Schopenhauer approach suicide philosophically?

509
00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:17.219
Good, yeah, so, so. We're kind of nicely ordering

510
00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:19.420
these things chronologically and that when they come back

511
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.400
after the Grand Tour, Schopenhauer's father. Is looking physically

512
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.800
and mentally unwell, and then um when Germanenhauer was

513
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:35.359
17. In 1805, his father is found dead in

514
00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:37.609
the canal behind the family home in, in Hamburg.

515
00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:43.260
Mhm. Um, AND although it's not public publicly announced

516
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.050
this way, the family, it seems, suspect, um, that

517
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:51.569
he died by suicide. Yeah, um, OK, so those

518
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.709
are the facts, and what, what's the philosophy? Well,

519
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.839
the philosophy's quite easy to state, um. So Schopenhauer

520
00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:02.400
thinks that we have a right. To choose suicide.

521
00:28:03.209 --> 00:28:05.949
That it's not immoral to take your own life.

522
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.849
However, He, he thinks we have a moral reason.

523
00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:15.569
Not to choose suicide. So we have a right

524
00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:17.609
to choose suicide, but we have a reason not

525
00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:21.369
to. Um, IN other words, If we were to

526
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.130
commit suicide or choose suicide, we wouldn't be doing

527
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.280
anything morally wrong. But Schopenhauer thinks we have a

528
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.280
reason to kind of renounce that right, to never

529
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.819
actually activate it. Um, NOW, now just looking at

530
00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:38.560
those views, I think that's quite a sensible stance.

531
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.910
Um, THESE days as well, like I think the

532
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.579
times have caught up with Schopenhauer is that we

533
00:28:43.579 --> 00:28:46.060
take a much more, again in any kind of

534
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.579
civilized society, we take a much more sympathetic view

535
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:52.260
towards suicide. In Schopenhauer's day, again, looking at it

536
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.719
in context, one of the, I found this in

537
00:28:54.989 --> 00:28:57.300
Al Alvarez's book A Savage God, one of the

538
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.579
best books on suicide. I think there is. Um,

539
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.829
HE mentions in passing in Danzig, which is where

540
00:29:03.829 --> 00:29:07.290
the Schopenhauer family actually came from, um, before it

541
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.270
was annexed by Prussia. If somebody died by suicide

542
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.229
at home, they, they, it was, it was, you

543
00:29:14.229 --> 00:29:17.390
know, outlawed to remove them by the front door,

544
00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:18.750
they had to be kind of winched out of

545
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.790
the window. Who knows why, but it's these kind

546
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:26.150
of inhumane punishments that people inflict on, on a

547
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.550
corpse really, and then there was, there was all

548
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.430
kinds of things, people would do horrible things to

549
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.500
the corpses of, of, of, of people who'd chosen

550
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.989
suicide. Nowadays, you know, of course it's controversial and

551
00:29:37.989 --> 00:29:40.579
it's, it's, it's painful, it's tragic, it's a sensitive

552
00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:43.229
topic, but in general I think we, we take

553
00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:47.310
a more sympathetic view towards, um, you know, people

554
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.540
who choose suicide or are considering suicide. Not just

555
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.859
out of practical reasons that it's actually maybe in

556
00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:55.420
the interest of suicide prevention, that that means that

557
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.780
people don't become secretive and and all sorts of

558
00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.619
things that might lead to suicide, but just on

559
00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:02.599
the moral grounds that these people deserve our sympathy.

560
00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.010
And they deserve respect and they deserve to be

561
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.650
treated with dignity even though um, well not even

562
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.400
though but you know it has nothing to do

563
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.130
with the fact that they're considering this. So I

564
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.199
think that the fact that Schopenhauer thinks there's a

565
00:30:15.199 --> 00:30:18.410
right to suicide shows that he's. He's got a

566
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.839
more humane approach, but most of us, again, again,

567
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.849
not everyone, but, but a lot of people think,

568
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.469
OK, even though people who are contemplating suicide deserve

569
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.729
sympathy and respect and dignity, we still want to

570
00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:35.369
discourage them, right, generally, um, you know, um, which

571
00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:37.640
again might be surprising given Schopenhauer's pessimism, you might

572
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.770
think, well, if he thinks this is the right

573
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.119
suicide, why isn't he saying well we should all

574
00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:43.000
end our lives as soon as possible. Yeah. Um,

575
00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:44.819
AND we'll get to why he thinks that specifically,

576
00:30:44.959 --> 00:30:47.400
but the idea that he thinks that it wouldn't

577
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.199
be wrong to do it, but still you shouldn't,

578
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.160
I think that chimes with most people, you know,

579
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.079
um, uh, I don't know, everyone, Schopenhauer makes his

580
00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:57.040
point, probably everyone has been touched by suicide. Everyone

581
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.199
has a family member or a friend who either

582
00:31:01.199 --> 00:31:05.339
has chosen that or, or has considered it. Um,

583
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.660
AND generally we'll kind of approach them with saying,

584
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.790
well, we want to respect their decision, but at

585
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.260
the same time we want to discourage them. So

586
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.579
now this is where it gets all very kind

587
00:31:15.579 --> 00:31:18.660
of specific to Schopenhauer, which is that his reason

588
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.699
for discouraging suicide is quite unusual. So most of

589
00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:24.390
us would give kind of maybe psychological grounds, say,

590
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.500
OK I know you feel desperate now, but give

591
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.500
it time, you'll feel better. I don't know what

592
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.020
the best kind of way to talk about this

593
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.010
is necessarily, but um we have, we might give

594
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.900
other reasons, probably not moral reasons, we wouldn't probably

595
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.660
try and discourage somebody by saying it would be

596
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.300
wrong for you to do that these days, we

597
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.180
would probably take a more psychological approach. Schopenhauer's view

598
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.430
is that the suffering that somebody, that leads somebody

599
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.079
to the point of want, you know, choosing suicide

600
00:31:50.469 --> 00:31:53.030
might actually be a path to a genuine form

601
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.349
of escape. And this leads to a different kind

602
00:31:55.349 --> 00:31:57.569
of a higher level of his philosophy which is,

603
00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:02.229
um, the, the, the kind of ultimate solution to

604
00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:05.390
the problem of suffering for Shobha is, is aesthetic.

605
00:32:06.189 --> 00:32:08.229
Resignation of the kind you find in, in the

606
00:32:08.229 --> 00:32:12.550
Buddha or in kind of Christ's crucifixion or, or

607
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.390
in, you know, monastic monkish, aesthetic life or the

608
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:18.989
or the kind of mystics of various world religions

609
00:32:18.989 --> 00:32:21.670
and so on. Renunciation of the world and so

610
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.530
on, so he, he seems to think that like,

611
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.449
He, uh, one of the metaphors he uses is

612
00:32:27.449 --> 00:32:29.729
that somebody who chooses suicide is like a person

613
00:32:29.729 --> 00:32:33.439
who stops a painful operation halfway through, and therefore

614
00:32:33.439 --> 00:32:36.609
never becomes cured. And, and, and this actually links

615
00:32:36.609 --> 00:32:38.439
to his views on the idea of the, the

616
00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:40.689
world as a place of punishment, and that this,

617
00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:43.050
this suffering, like in a punishment, the suffering has

618
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.130
a purpose, um, uh, and, and he actually does

619
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.410
think that, I mean, again, he, it's hard to

620
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.930
know how literally he means this, but if there's

621
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.410
any purpose to suffering. It's, it's trying to tell

622
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.930
us this message that we, we need to renounce

623
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.670
the world or what have you. So it, it,

624
00:32:59.719 --> 00:33:02.540
it would, it would almost never work as a

625
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.219
method of suicide prevention. If you would, if if

626
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:07.199
if somebody was saying I'm thinking of killing myself

627
00:33:07.199 --> 00:33:09.280
and you said well hang on, if you stick

628
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.520
it out, maybe you'll achieve salvation through aesthetic resignation.

629
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.670
They'll probably go, what are you talking about? I,

630
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.400
you know, I, I, that's not gonna, that's not

631
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.619
keeping me hanging on by any means, you know.

632
00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:22.839
And that makes me wonder whether Schopenhauer actually intended

633
00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:25.359
his philosophy of suicide to, to, you know, for

634
00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:27.040
that purpose. I don't think he's trying to talk

635
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.290
anybody off a ledge. I think he's trying to

636
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.670
give the philosophical grounds for um for forming an

637
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.189
evaluative judgment about the act of suicide from a

638
00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:38.869
third party perspective, rather than a kind of second

639
00:33:38.869 --> 00:33:41.430
person view where you're trying to actually say, You

640
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.849
know, you would probably take a different, more sensitive,

641
00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:47.099
you know, route if you're actually trying to discourage

642
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:48.489
somebody from taking that choice.

643
00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:53.900
He, he also wrote on the topic of madness.

644
00:33:53.979 --> 00:33:57.500
I mean, did it play a specific role in

645
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.119
his life and what were his ideas on madness?

646
00:34:01.699 --> 00:34:03.729
Yeah, I mean, one link we can, one immediate

647
00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:06.780
link we can make here is that um it's

648
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.449
quite a specific one. But he, he thought that

649
00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:14.050
character, this is where it's really tempting, really hard

650
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.469
not to look at Schopenhauer's life in the, er,

651
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.370
you know, look at Schopenhauer's life events and put

652
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.728
them side by side with his philosophy. But he

653
00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:23.389
thought that character traits were inherited from the father.

654
00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.458
Um, THERE were other sources saying these sorts of

655
00:34:27.458 --> 00:34:32.659
things, um, so he's not completely creating something out

656
00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:35.810
of thin air to suit his life events. But

657
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.500
he did find those sources, he, he kind of

658
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.179
had a motivation for finding those sources. And, and

659
00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.060
one of the character traits he says, you know,

660
00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:46.080
he, he's actually specifically interested in certain parts about

661
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:50.628
the descendants, the inheritance of mental disorders. And in

662
00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:54.529
particular, um, mental disorders that might lead to suicide.

663
00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.749
He says that suicide, the tendency to suicide, he

664
00:34:57.749 --> 00:35:00.049
says, he actually says is the most heritable trait.

665
00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:03.050
And again, you know, I'm trying to toe this

666
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.290
line here of not reading too much into the

667
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.010
ideas, too much of the life into the ideas,

668
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.489
but one does wonder whether Schopenhauer thought he might

669
00:35:10.489 --> 00:35:14.169
have inherited a kind of, you know, um, mental

670
00:35:14.169 --> 00:35:17.689
ill health from his father. Um, THAT'S something I

671
00:35:17.689 --> 00:35:20.409
do kind of. You know, reference in the book

672
00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:23.889
here and there. Um, BUT his actual theory of

673
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:26.330
madness is, is interesting in a few respects. I

674
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.889
mean, obviously madness, these days we wouldn't tend to

675
00:35:28.889 --> 00:35:30.969
use that term. Obviously it's a, it's a not

676
00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:33.290
a medical term, but that's the term that, or

677
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:39.669
the term that's translated Schopenhauer's using, um. And one

678
00:35:39.669 --> 00:35:41.229
interesting thing is that when he was a, so

679
00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:43.989
after he had left the family home to go

680
00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:47.229
to university after his father's death with a bit

681
00:35:47.229 --> 00:35:50.110
of negotiation with his mother who had gone on

682
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.510
to start her own career as a writer in

683
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.820
Weimar. When he's a student, as many students were

684
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.500
encouraged to go to visit, again in a very

685
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.409
19th century way that would be kind of, quite

686
00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:05.139
inappropriate now unless you were a medical student. Go

687
00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:08.500
and actually visit the asylum, the Berlin charity, the,

688
00:36:08.649 --> 00:36:11.760
the wing, the psychiatric wing of their, their hospital.

689
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.500
And just look at the patients, you know, have

690
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.699
a nose around or what have you. But Schopenhauer

691
00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:19.840
did that with a, way more of a, er,

692
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.479
stronger motivation which was that he was going to

693
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.399
lectures. Uh, FROM Vichter, one of the big post-Kantian

694
00:36:26.399 --> 00:36:28.959
philosophers at the time, and Victor kind of casually

695
00:36:28.959 --> 00:36:31.439
said that, you know, as part of his philosophy,

696
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.719
you know, he was saying that, um, genius is

697
00:36:34.719 --> 00:36:37.719
divine, whereas madness is animal, and Schopenhauer was thinking

698
00:36:37.719 --> 00:36:39.639
actually, he was sort of this kind of, again

699
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:42.320
slightly romanticized notion that genius and madness may have

700
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.790
gone hand in hand. And so he, he went

701
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.530
to visit these patients. With a more specific motive

702
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.090
of actually finding out the relationship like well, the,

703
00:36:53.729 --> 00:36:56.649
the origins of madness and its relationship with, with

704
00:36:56.649 --> 00:37:00.469
genius rather than um with kind of animal nature.

705
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.449
And so that's the, that's the kind of context.

706
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.310
um AND then the theory he comes up with.

707
00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.169
It's again quite prescient because um in a way

708
00:37:11.169 --> 00:37:17.530
that prefigures Freud, Schopenhauer um argues that basically madness

709
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.770
is a, is a um well he says it's

710
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.860
the torn thread of memory. So it's when we

711
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:30.830
kind of deliberately. Conceal facts about our personal history

712
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.750
from ourselves because they are threatening or humiliating or

713
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.530
traumatic. It's a theory of repression, he uses those

714
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:43.610
words. Um, AND because of so much of. Uh,

715
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.419
HEALTHY social and psychological function is to do with

716
00:37:48.419 --> 00:37:53.639
knowing who you are. Right. Um, DISRUPTING our personal

717
00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:57.840
histories in that way, um, has, you know, a

718
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.879
huge and general, er, dysfunctional effect on, on a

719
00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:07.260
person. Um, SO, so yeah, so that's his, his

720
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.659
theory of madness, that madness is, um, it's basically

721
00:38:10.659 --> 00:38:12.699
based on a theory of repression, and it's not

722
00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:14.540
all purpose, it's something I don't mention in the

723
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.020
book is that like, he really must be thinking

724
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.800
of a certain kind of. Um, Mad person or

725
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.449
an insane person, person of bad ill health, um

726
00:38:25.449 --> 00:38:30.719
because um, you know, men, disordered memory isn't gonna

727
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:34.280
explain every type of mental dysfunction, it's only gonna

728
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.280
explain a certain type of maybe, a certain type

729
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.209
of psychosis. Um, AND I wonder, this is very

730
00:38:42.209 --> 00:38:44.189
speculative, but I wonder whether that's a kind of

731
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:49.030
artifact of his research method. In that Schopenhauer's theory

732
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.189
is based on. Patients who he could talk to.

733
00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:57.520
And learn about their personal histories from, from them.

734
00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:00.620
And then they would try to communicate their personal

735
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.729
histories to him, and they would be, you know,

736
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:08.780
all, you know, badly disordered. And he would, and

737
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.379
then he kind of drew the conclusion that oh

738
00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:13.709
well they're. Their, you know, their madness must lie

739
00:39:13.709 --> 00:39:17.629
in this disordered sense of their personal history. Um,

740
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.830
BUT you know, imagine all the patients he wasn't

741
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.850
speaking to, the ones who couldn't speak to him,

742
00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:25.149
the catatonic ones in the corner, for instance, the

743
00:39:25.149 --> 00:39:28.590
paranoid ones who, um, who were fearful of, of

744
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.540
a stranger. I don't know, I, I, you know,

745
00:39:30.909 --> 00:39:34.120
but, um. Not that I discussed this in the

746
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.810
book, but I feel like his, his method was

747
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.449
in some ways quite limiting, um, and only gave

748
00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:40.610
him a partial look into the nature of madness,

749
00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:43.370
into a particular type of subject he could speak

750
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.870
to. Um, AND so I don't think his, his

751
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.770
theory, you know, ultimately generalizes, but it's still interesting

752
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.459
and we're still quite um. You know, quite prescient,

753
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.679
definitely predicted some elements of Freud.

754
00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.219
Mhm. But why did Schopenhauer never marry? I mean,

755
00:40:01.379 --> 00:40:05.840
was that something that derived also from his philosophy,

756
00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:08.219
did he have something to say on the topic

757
00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:09.610
of marriage as well?

758
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.300
Yeah, again, it's hard to know which way, um,

759
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.139
to order things because he definitely said things to

760
00:40:17.139 --> 00:40:20.100
the effect that a true free thinker, going back

761
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.419
to this idea of self-reliance. Um, HE thought that

762
00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:29.219
any kind of practical aims, practical imperatives might ultimately

763
00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:34.949
distort. A person's ability to think freely, so if

764
00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:36.459
you have to, if you have a, you know,

765
00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:39.550
a wife and a family, um, and you have

766
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.030
to earn a living and so on, that might

767
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:49.139
incentivize you to, to taint, to distort your, your

768
00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:51.669
philosophy so that it's, you know, er it gets

769
00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:54.550
you a job and gets you um, sells your

770
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.870
books and things like that. So, um, you know,

771
00:40:56.949 --> 00:41:00.080
he does seem to think that. A precondition of

772
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.840
being a free thinker is to be somewhat of

773
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.199
a, of an outsider also in the sense of

774
00:41:04.199 --> 00:41:06.959
like avoiding kind of bourgeois, you know, middle class

775
00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:09.120
family life and so on, it's again hard to

776
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.139
know whether that's a a a a kind of,

777
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.129
Retrospective rationalization, um, but it's true that he never

778
00:41:17.129 --> 00:41:20.530
did marry, um, he did have a, somewhat, you

779
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.370
know, an active sex life, there is, there is

780
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.409
evidence of that from the way he talks about

781
00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:25.929
his life events and the way that some people

782
00:41:25.929 --> 00:41:29.959
talk about him, um, so he wasn't, you know,

783
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.850
monkish in that, in that respect. Um, BUT, um,

784
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.979
and then, you know, the, the answer to the

785
00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:37.939
question why you never could just be married, answered

786
00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:43.439
biographically rather rather than philosophically that he was. It

787
00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:46.120
wasn't just that he found people difficult to be

788
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.199
around, people found it difficult to be around him,

789
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.360
he, he would not have been an easy man

790
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.239
to marry, I think, and um, and I often

791
00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:56.199
think that, you know, there's, there's a way of

792
00:41:56.199 --> 00:42:02.300
looking at him. Um, WHERE he's, he's, he's, um,

793
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.659
I don't know, some kind of failure or something

794
00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:07.219
like that, that he failed to, to, to get

795
00:42:07.219 --> 00:42:09.379
married. But the other way to look at it

796
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.340
is that it's, it's in some way a kind

797
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.409
of a mercy, it's, um. It's only fair that

798
00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:22.010
he didn't impose. Himself on any other person to

799
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.530
that degree of intimacy because it would have been

800
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.209
hard to be married to Gopinha, like if you

801
00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:30.850
read the biographies of, you know, great men, there's

802
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.570
a few who who had good marriages, like, the

803
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.110
few that spring to mind are John Stuart Mill,

804
00:42:37.169 --> 00:42:40.120
and well, his eventual relationship with Harriet Taylor seemed

805
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.350
to be, he seemed to be a good, Um,

806
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.120
partner, um, for especially by the standards of his

807
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.229
time, and I think Charles Darwin as well, from

808
00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:52.010
reading a biography, a big biography of Darwin, you

809
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.439
get the impression he was a, he was a

810
00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:57.520
decent man and a decent family man. Yeah, OK,

811
00:42:57.639 --> 00:43:00.360
so those are some positive examples, but then you

812
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.639
look at Marx and Hegel, and, and you look

813
00:43:03.639 --> 00:43:06.860
at, I mean Schopenhauer had misbegotten children, you know.

814
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.870
Children with women he wasn't married to, but Marx

815
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.669
and Hegel had children with women they weren't married

816
00:43:13.669 --> 00:43:15.939
to, while they were married to other women, and

817
00:43:15.939 --> 00:43:17.709
these other women who they were married to were

818
00:43:17.709 --> 00:43:21.229
expected to kind of, maintain the man and so

819
00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:23.419
that they could go on to, you know, Chernow

820
00:43:23.419 --> 00:43:25.449
could have made a different point, which was that,

821
00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:28.590
He, he, he sort of suggests that in order

822
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.229
to be a free thinker, he needs to not

823
00:43:30.229 --> 00:43:31.909
have a wife, not to be tied down to

824
00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.030
a wife or whatever. But lots of men saw

825
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.189
it the other way around, which is that in

826
00:43:35.189 --> 00:43:36.949
order to be a free thinker they needed a

827
00:43:36.949 --> 00:43:40.070
caretaker, who they would marry, you know, there are

828
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.169
books about these subjects like. Uh, Anna Funder's book,

829
00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:48.189
uh, Wifeom, which looks at, um, You know, er,

830
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:54.639
George Orwell's, um, wife, um, and. Uh, AND how

831
00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:58.899
they're basically treated as additional servants and support and

832
00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:01.260
things like that, so. I don't know what I'm

833
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.110
what point I'm going for here, which might be

834
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.739
that it was kind of um there's something that's

835
00:44:05.739 --> 00:44:09.360
slightly noble rather than a failure about Schopenhauer's not

836
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.080
marrying. Um, WHEN you look at the the, the

837
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.120
ignoble ways that other men of the 19th century

838
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.679
treated, treated their wives, so it's probably a good

839
00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:19.580
thing that he didn't marry.

840
00:44:21.629 --> 00:44:24.270
So, but that's on the topic of marriage. What

841
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:29.189
about more generally, uh, love? I mean, what worries,

842
00:44:29.389 --> 00:44:30.449
thoughts on love?

843
00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:34.360
Good, um, so if we're talking about romantic love,

844
00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.040
because we might want to distinguish between romantic love,

845
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:44.020
um, sexual love, on the one hand, and moral

846
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.419
love, or or which to Schopenhauer would be compassionate

847
00:44:46.419 --> 00:44:50.540
love, and he's um he's very uncynical about moral

848
00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.659
and compassionate love, in fact his whole moral philosophy

849
00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:56.560
is based on, The possibility and actuality of, of

850
00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.639
genuinely compassionate love between, not just between intimate friends

851
00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:03.199
but also between strangers and things like that. Putting

852
00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:05.360
that aside and thinking about romantic love, there he's

853
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.820
more, he characters, characterizes his view as realistic. Erring

854
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.739
towards the cynical, you know, in that he thinks

855
00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:19.350
that romantic love is this kind of. Disguise that

856
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:24.429
the drive to procreate, wears in order to coax

857
00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:28.949
individuals into this kind of absurd, um merry go

858
00:45:28.949 --> 00:45:34.449
round of, The rebirth and renewing a new generation

859
00:45:34.449 --> 00:45:37.340
of human beings who are only gonna suffer, you

860
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.459
know, so the, the pessimism is there in the,

861
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.979
in the background of that as well. Um, SO

862
00:45:42.979 --> 00:45:44.689
yeah, so that, that's another view that can be

863
00:45:44.689 --> 00:45:47.979
summarized quite, quite succinctly, which is that he thinks

864
00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:52.879
that. Romantic love, sexual love is a delusion that

865
00:45:52.879 --> 00:45:56.320
masks the drive to procreate and ultimately all love

866
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.199
is rooted in the sex drive, he's pretty, he's

867
00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:01.080
pretty clear about that. Having said that, he, you

868
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.229
know, he thinks that that explains a lot because

869
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.199
rather than giving, making that, you know, by calling

870
00:46:08.199 --> 00:46:10.120
it a delusion that might seem like he's making

871
00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.199
romantic love a kind of thin veil, you know,

872
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.050
that it's, that it's really nothing. Uh, THAT it's

873
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.870
all appearance. But he's actually going for the opposite

874
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.000
point, which is he's trying to add depth and

875
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.020
urgency to romantic love. He's trying to explain why

876
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.159
this thing is something that people will do incredibly

877
00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:31.840
irrational things for the sake of, you know. If

878
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.510
two star-crossed lovers can't be together, they might both

879
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.399
end up, you know, dead, trying to, trying to

880
00:46:37.399 --> 00:46:39.929
be together and failing. Or the lengths people will

881
00:46:39.929 --> 00:46:42.780
go to to um to get this partner who,

882
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.300
from an outside perspective looks indistinguishable like. From anybody

883
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.100
else, like why is this person pursuing that person

884
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.179
so doggedly. When they could probably get the same

885
00:46:54.179 --> 00:46:56.330
thing if they're a bit more open-minded out of,

886
00:46:56.659 --> 00:46:58.719
you know, thousands of other people in the population

887
00:46:58.719 --> 00:47:00.300
or what have you. So, it's a kind of

888
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.580
interesting problem why, why, why does, why is love

889
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.419
pursued with such urgency, and it's, he thinks it's

890
00:47:05.419 --> 00:47:09.699
because, Um, because there is more to it than

891
00:47:09.699 --> 00:47:12.659
just the, uh, there's more to it than what

892
00:47:12.659 --> 00:47:16.909
it appears, um, and, and. The, the, the kind

893
00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:19.669
of additional depth or or heft to it is

894
00:47:19.669 --> 00:47:27.810
this, um really important um, Function of, Producing and

895
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.929
perfecting, because he has a, you know, view about

896
00:47:30.929 --> 00:47:32.729
what makes two people attracted, which is that they

897
00:47:32.729 --> 00:47:35.729
kind of equalize each other's qualities, which can go

898
00:47:35.729 --> 00:47:40.189
in a slightly dodgy eugenics direction, but ultimately they,

899
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.370
they are, um, serving a kind of really deep

900
00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:49.489
and profound purpose, um, and so, what's driving them

901
00:47:49.489 --> 00:47:52.310
is something that's, that, that it's very high stakes,

902
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.530
um, that they, they've been tasked with quite an

903
00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.469
important goal. And that would explain why what on

904
00:48:00.469 --> 00:48:03.310
the surface might seem like quite a frivolous and

905
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.729
superficial and irrational pursuit is actually something that's er

906
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.229
that's really quite urgent and serious. So he's trying

907
00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:11.090
to, yeah, he's trying to explain that problem.

908
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.050
Uh, SO you mentioned that he probably wouldn't have

909
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:20.989
been a great partner also in part due to

910
00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:23.870
his own views on women. So what were his

911
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.550
views on women and were they the typical views

912
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.449
of 1/19 century man, or

913
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.939
what? Yeah, in some respects, yeah, so this is,

914
00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:34.534
this is. One of the more regrettable parts of

915
00:48:34.534 --> 00:48:37.155
Schopenhauer, one of the things, one of the negative

916
00:48:37.854 --> 00:48:40.094
character traits he's, he's, he's best known for, which

917
00:48:40.094 --> 00:48:42.064
is that he was an out and out misogynist.

918
00:48:42.135 --> 00:48:44.774
Like he wasn't even trying to hide it. He

919
00:48:44.774 --> 00:48:47.715
really did think that women were in, in most

920
00:48:48.254 --> 00:48:51.455
respects inferior to men. And that's, you know, in

921
00:48:51.455 --> 00:48:55.560
some, in some ways just an irredeemably. Retrograde view

922
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.199
and, and it wasn't even as if he was

923
00:48:58.899 --> 00:49:00.659
simply a man of his times, he was worse

924
00:49:00.659 --> 00:49:02.379
than a man of his times in that respect

925
00:49:02.379 --> 00:49:04.899
because, by the mid-nineteenth century, you know, I've mentioned

926
00:49:04.899 --> 00:49:08.679
John Stuart Mill for instance, who's um, who's a,

927
00:49:08.699 --> 00:49:12.719
who's who's born, you know, after, After Schopenhauer was

928
00:49:12.719 --> 00:49:15.520
born, but still is living in the same, roughly

929
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.560
the same 19th century world and and just look

930
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.580
at how more advanced Mills's views on women were

931
00:49:20.959 --> 00:49:23.300
compared to Schopenhauer, even if, even if Mills weren't

932
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.689
views weren't perfect either. So Schopenhauer could have known

933
00:49:27.689 --> 00:49:30.469
better, and in other areas of sort of social

934
00:49:30.929 --> 00:49:33.909
importance, he did know better, he knew better about

935
00:49:33.909 --> 00:49:37.330
treatment of animals, he knew better about um, you

936
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.929
know, the treatment of other human groups, in particular,

937
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.850
you know, he was, I mentioned in the book

938
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.840
that he was, he kept an eye on what

939
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.850
was going on with the um. Transatlantic slave trade

940
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.939
and was appalled by it. So, um, so we

941
00:49:52.939 --> 00:49:55.010
can't, we can't just assume, you know, we can't

942
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.290
just say oh he was a man of his

943
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.060
times, he, he, like I said, he was worse

944
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.159
than a man of his times. But can we

945
00:50:00.159 --> 00:50:04.949
say anything positive? Um, WELL, well, here is, you

946
00:50:04.949 --> 00:50:06.340
know, some things I've discussed in the book actually

947
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.360
come from the research of other people who've looked

948
00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:13.110
into Schopenhauer's views on women and found that. That

949
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.750
he has, his views on women have this kind

950
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.370
of ironic afterlife. In the views of early feminist

951
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:23.939
philosophers, um, and so actually, you know, this is

952
00:50:23.939 --> 00:50:27.969
where it gets, Quite complicated, but the generation, talking,

953
00:50:28.169 --> 00:50:29.850
keep coming back to Mill, I don't talk about

954
00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.399
Mill that much in the book actually, I mentioned

955
00:50:31.399 --> 00:50:33.399
that once in, in a different context, but for

956
00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:35.919
some reason it's on my mind today and um

957
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.959
the generation after Mill, the kind of late 19th

958
00:50:38.959 --> 00:50:43.370
century Britain, there was a kind of collection of,

959
00:50:43.489 --> 00:50:45.090
you know, there was quite a lot of free

960
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.570
thinkers who were trying to think about new ways

961
00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:50.570
of, of living, were really impressed by Mill's kind

962
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:53.350
of liberalism and. You know, taking it in the

963
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.909
different directions, particularly around sexuality and, and, and um.

964
00:50:59.209 --> 00:51:03.429
And ways to, you know, have relationships and things

965
00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:06.570
like that. And gender as well and and and

966
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.389
the and the the idea of the new woman

967
00:51:08.389 --> 00:51:10.810
and so on. And Schopenhauer was being read by

968
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.409
these people and taken seriously and and and maybe

969
00:51:13.409 --> 00:51:14.929
they were just trying to, you know, turn a

970
00:51:14.929 --> 00:51:16.760
blind eye to the stuff that was out and

971
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.459
out misogynist. But, but Chebna did raise question marks

972
00:51:20.459 --> 00:51:25.580
about whether. Um, WHETHER the version of womanhood that

973
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.860
gave women their liberty was a version of womanhood

974
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.179
that fitted for all women. So in particular, um,

975
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.540
the version of womanhood that gave women their liberty

976
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.139
was a married woman, or a woman who had

977
00:51:37.139 --> 00:51:40.860
married prospects, which is. At the time very heteronormative

978
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.399
given that there was no kind of marriage equality,

979
00:51:43.699 --> 00:51:46.689
um, but also, you know, it would limit women

980
00:51:46.689 --> 00:51:49.620
who wanted those kinds of um freedoms, they would

981
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.540
have to seek marriage and the women who didn't

982
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.840
want to seek marriage or couldn't for whatever reason

983
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.610
were left in a very vulnerable position, you know,

984
00:51:58.939 --> 00:52:01.260
and again you can think about this somewhat biographically

985
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.280
in that Schopenhauer's mother was a widow. And his

986
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.159
sister, never married, was a so-called spinster, you know,

987
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:10.659
not a very nice term, I don't think, but,

988
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.919
and you can think of other women too where

989
00:52:12.919 --> 00:52:14.800
marriage just isn't part of their lives or what

990
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.979
have you. What do you do for those women?

991
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.439
ER what happens to those women? Schopenhauer thinks that

992
00:52:19.439 --> 00:52:23.260
they are often um they often have to seek

993
00:52:23.719 --> 00:52:27.320
quite difficult labor, sometimes sex work for the, for

994
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.719
lower class women generally, um, or, or, or they

995
00:52:31.719 --> 00:52:35.129
are kind of. They don't have a way of

996
00:52:35.129 --> 00:52:39.080
a foothold in exerting any influence on society, um,

997
00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:42.209
and you know, to a, you know, to a

998
00:52:42.209 --> 00:52:45.489
feminist, that might be quite interesting, that that raises

999
00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:48.649
interesting questions about maybe we do need to reconsider

1000
00:52:48.649 --> 00:52:51.729
the type of, you know, our conception of womanhood.

1001
00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:56.310
And the conditions of equality and liberty. Um, AND,

1002
00:52:56.429 --> 00:52:58.949
and in particular the institution of marriage, which Schopenhauer

1003
00:52:58.949 --> 00:53:01.969
was, he did think that monogamous marriage was unnatural

1004
00:53:01.969 --> 00:53:04.189
and he goes into all these views about like

1005
00:53:04.189 --> 00:53:06.229
how he he advocates polygamy and stuff like that,

1006
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.229
which starts to get a bit. A little bit

1007
00:53:08.229 --> 00:53:13.050
dodgy again, um, but still. It's ironic and interesting

1008
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.129
that Schopenhauer's for being such a sexist and a

1009
00:53:16.129 --> 00:53:19.129
misogynist, he actually had this, he was read seriously

1010
00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:22.290
by um by first wave feminist thinkers.

1011
00:53:24.189 --> 00:53:27.389
But on the topic of gender, I mean, what

1012
00:53:27.389 --> 00:53:29.870
did they have to say about it and the

1013
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.590
understanding of gender that people had back in the

1014
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:36.750
19th century, was it similar to ours in the

1015
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.300
sense that we separate sex from gender or no?

1016
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.270
Uh, THAT'S a good question. So, so I do,

1017
00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:49.149
um. That is a good question because on the

1018
00:53:49.149 --> 00:53:52.939
one hand I wanna say that. Um, THE separation

1019
00:53:52.939 --> 00:53:55.399
of sex and gender is a, is a development

1020
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:58.409
that, that comes out later in the history of,

1021
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.020
you know, feminist philosophy, may, maybe with the, the

1022
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.439
second wave of it with, with, with Beauvoir and,

1023
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.159
and saying about becoming a woman and so on.

1024
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.179
You know Beauvoir was a reader of Schopenhauer too.

1025
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.219
Um, AS I mentioned in the book, some people

1026
00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:13.620
think that she may have got the title of

1027
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.860
The Second Sex from Schopenhauer's essay on women, even

1028
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.060
though it's a classical reference that goes back even

1029
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.040
further. Um, SO I don't know whether Termina doesn't

1030
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.010
seem to be focused on that, although he, he

1031
00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:31.020
must have known. About gender indeterminacy. Uh, AND sexual

1032
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:36.520
indeterminacy. So for instance, um if I, I can't

1033
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.820
remember why I was looking at this, in fact

1034
00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.360
I think it was, so this is quite a

1035
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.080
specific, this is quite um a niche thing, but.

1036
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.590
Um, Shermanner had interesting views on race, or at

1037
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.229
least what I thought were interesting views on race

1038
00:54:48.229 --> 00:54:50.949
in that he didn't think that, um, whiteness was

1039
00:54:50.949 --> 00:54:53.580
natural. He, he, he even says there's no such

1040
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.500
thing as a white race. He thinks that all

1041
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.750
human beings ultimately, the, uh, the first human beings

1042
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:02.310
would have had dark skin, um, er, which is

1043
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.590
actually borne out by the scientific facts now with

1044
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:08.070
the kind of theory of, um, evolutionary anthropology that

1045
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.909
we have now. But he wasn't really, um, thinking

1046
00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:13.709
of that, but anyway. It turns out that that

1047
00:55:13.709 --> 00:55:16.350
wasn't actually a, you know, terribly radical view, in

1048
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:20.820
fact, one of Schopenhauer's teachers, um. Blumenbach, who, who,

1049
00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:24.989
um, was an early race theorist, had a similar

1050
00:55:24.989 --> 00:55:29.040
degenerativist view, the idea that, um, The human race

1051
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.080
starts out with darker skin and then it becomes

1052
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.719
kind of bleached as it, you know, moves between

1053
00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:36.280
different climates and civilisations or what have you. But

1054
00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.919
I went back and you might be wondering what's

1055
00:55:37.919 --> 00:55:39.320
this got to do with gender. I, I, I

1056
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.560
was kind of, he did actually Schopenhauer studied under

1057
00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:45.590
Blumenbach at Gottingen University where, where, where Schopenhauer went

1058
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.159
before he went to Berlin. So I went back

1059
00:55:47.159 --> 00:55:50.040
and looked at his notes on taking Blumenbach's class.

1060
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.760
I wondered whether he, Blumenbach talked about race in

1061
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.399
the classes. Now, I can't see Blumenbach talking about

1062
00:55:56.399 --> 00:56:02.090
race, but, Bloombach does talk about um human sexual

1063
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:09.159
tastes and talks about um a particular statue in,

1064
00:56:09.459 --> 00:56:11.379
I know I can't remember which culture he's talking

1065
00:56:11.379 --> 00:56:13.860
about, but basically it's a, it's a presentation of

1066
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:19.510
human beauty that has male and female sexual uh

1067
00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.610
you know, um, organs. Um, SO it has breasts,

1068
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.139
but it also has a penis, um. And, and,

1069
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.429
and he, Sherman now knew that um. Ancient human

1070
00:56:31.429 --> 00:56:38.889
cultures. Didn't necessarily. Have a conception of human physical

1071
00:56:38.889 --> 00:56:44.580
beauty that was um kind of um, Had a

1072
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.860
kind of binary gender, um, so I know that's

1073
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.159
a very kind of specific, Point to pick up

1074
00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:54.169
on, but, but, but I just think Chernhower was

1075
00:56:54.169 --> 00:56:56.530
so aware of the way that he, particularly around

1076
00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.810
sexuality, marriage, sexuality, marriage, he was so aware that

1077
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:04.870
this, these are historical things, that sexuality has been

1078
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.770
very different over time, that marriage has been very

1079
00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.820
different over time. Um, THAT I can't help but

1080
00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.110
wonder that he, you know, when, when he's talking

1081
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:17.979
about. The 19th century concept of womanhood that gave

1082
00:57:17.979 --> 00:57:23.610
a certain subgroup of women. Liberty and equality, I

1083
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:25.729
can't help but wondering whether, you know, he's got

1084
00:57:25.729 --> 00:57:29.489
at least the right ingredients to realize that the

1085
00:57:29.489 --> 00:57:33.290
concept of gender itself changes over time. Um, AND

1086
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.520
that a woman in 19th century Europe is, is

1087
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.889
kind of classified under a different idea than let's

1088
00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:43.929
say, a woman in East Asia, in, in the

1089
00:57:43.929 --> 00:57:46.679
kind of, you know. Um, IN the, in its

1090
00:57:46.679 --> 00:57:48.840
classical period or what have you, so although he

1091
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.479
doesn't put his finger on that, I, I think

1092
00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:53.820
he's, He's actually more historical about concepts that people

1093
00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:54.679
give him credit for.

1094
00:57:55.649 --> 00:58:00.379
Interesting. So uh you said earlier that contrary to

1095
00:58:00.379 --> 00:58:04.540
some common misconceptions, he did have an active sex

1096
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.580
life, so what did he write on the topic

1097
00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.530
of sexuality, what were his thoughts on it?

1098
00:58:10.899 --> 00:58:12.739
Yeah, well, so, so we've already mentioned that he

1099
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:15.939
thinks that sex is ultimately, you know, sexual love

1100
00:58:15.939 --> 00:58:22.050
is ultimately driven by um sexual desire. Um, AND

1101
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:25.209
the desire in particular to procreate, which gives his

1102
00:58:25.449 --> 00:58:28.229
obviously a kind of very heteronormative as we'd say,

1103
00:58:28.879 --> 00:58:31.959
model. Um, BUT he, this is again an instance

1104
00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:38.080
of where he's, he's clearly a historically literate. You

1105
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.520
know, student of sexuality in that he realizes that

1106
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.090
there are, there have been throughout history forms of

1107
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:49.399
sexuality that do not follow this pattern of um,

1108
00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.840
You know, uh, procreation, in particular, um, he's thinking

1109
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.629
of same-sex relationships, so why is it that same-sex

1110
00:58:58.629 --> 00:59:01.510
relationships, or at least certain kinds of same-sex relationships

1111
00:59:01.899 --> 00:59:05.219
are found in every culture. In every part of

1112
00:59:05.219 --> 00:59:07.070
history, in every part of the world, there will

1113
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:12.360
be same-sex partners, um. How, how is that happening

1114
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.540
if sexuality is all about procreation given that, you

1115
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:20.169
know, um, generally same-sex partners er can't procreate, um,

1116
00:59:20.379 --> 00:59:25.580
naturally with one another, um. And um and so

1117
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.020
he tries to develop a solution to that which

1118
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.449
is again a little bit dodgy because firstly he

1119
00:59:29.449 --> 00:59:31.679
makes a lot, a bunch of assumptions. He, he,

1120
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.850
his, his model of same-sex relationships is what what

1121
00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:38.820
is now what what was then called pederasty, which

1122
00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:40.620
is today can be used as a slur, you

1123
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.520
know, you can, you can call someone a pederas

1124
00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.189
and you use that in a homophobic way. Um,

1125
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:47.629
BUT to him it just meant the, the kind

1126
00:59:47.629 --> 00:59:51.389
of classic Greek model, which actually talking about classic

1127
00:59:51.389 --> 00:59:53.070
Greek models was a way that sometimes some of

1128
00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:54.790
these free thinkers towards the end of the 19th

1129
00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.659
century could, could even begin to talk about same-sex

1130
00:59:57.659 --> 01:00:01.030
relationships in public by kind of borrowing some of

1131
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:05.030
the. Eridition and the prestige of, you know, being

1132
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.040
a classical scholar, so you can, you're kind of

1133
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.590
studying it, You know, you, you could only really

1134
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:14.050
maybe study these, these sorts of um verboten sexualities

1135
01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:19.500
by studying them medically or studying them classically. Um,

1136
01:00:19.739 --> 01:00:21.620
AND so Schopenhauer's kind of doing that too by

1137
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.899
saying, look, in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, men

1138
01:00:25.899 --> 01:00:27.600
would have sex with each other all the time,

1139
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.860
and they wouldn't have to necessarily hide it even,

1140
01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:33.179
that it might be vener a venerable tradition. And

1141
01:00:33.179 --> 01:00:35.580
generally it was an age differentiated sexuality, it would

1142
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.739
be boys and men. And that gave Schopenhauer a

1143
01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:42.620
foothold in finding a solution, which is that he

1144
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.310
thinks that. These sorts of, this particular form of

1145
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:51.270
same-sex relationship develops because it's undermature, sexually undermature, reproductively

1146
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:56.969
under mature men. Having sex with reproductively overmature men,

1147
01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:59.709
so they are still serving nature's goal of producing

1148
01:00:59.709 --> 01:01:04.229
fit offspring, but negatively by avoiding, producing unfit offspring,

1149
01:01:04.429 --> 01:01:07.459
which by today's standard is a crazy way to

1150
01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:10.330
think about it, but. By the standards of the

1151
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.770
time, it's interesting that he's even publishing this, like

1152
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.909
this is, this is not in a private notebook,

1153
01:01:14.989 --> 01:01:17.570
this is in the last version of his, of

1154
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.129
his main works. So it's public, and he knew

1155
01:01:20.129 --> 01:01:22.290
he was taking a risk by talking about it

1156
01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.389
that way. There are some scholars who try to,

1157
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:27.610
I think this is going too far, retrospectively kind

1158
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.129
of read this as evidence that Schopenhauer himself may

1159
01:01:30.129 --> 01:01:34.719
have had um. May have been gay or bisexual

1160
01:01:34.719 --> 01:01:37.699
or something like that, um, I think that's going

1161
01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.340
a bit too far cos there's nothing really in

1162
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.260
the sources to bear that out, but then why

1163
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.820
would there be, you know, another parallel going back

1164
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.679
to the utilitarians would be Bentham, who wrote about

1165
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.820
in defense of same-sex relationships, um, and there's a

1166
01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.540
stronger case to be made there that was personal

1167
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.080
to him. Um, BUT you wouldn't leave evidence lying

1168
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.520
about, so it's, it's a, it's a difficult, you

1169
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.520
know, thing to answer. But, uh, again, so that's

1170
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.919
another example we're, we're, we're finding, something I was

1171
01:02:04.919 --> 01:02:07.540
surprised to find is that Schopenhauer is very historical.

1172
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.540
Um, HE, he, and this, this goes back to

1173
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.280
the, uh, the, the one, an idea we talked

1174
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.560
about earlier which is thinking for yourself. Like he

1175
01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.320
wasn't just gonna take the idea that, so in

1176
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.040
the 19th century, he could have got by on

1177
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.659
just saying, well. Same-sex relationships are abhorrent because they're

1178
01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:26.939
an offense to procreation. You know, he could have

1179
01:02:26.939 --> 01:02:29.739
just dogmatically asserted that and, and, and nobody would

1180
01:02:29.739 --> 01:02:32.899
have really challenged him. But instead he realizes actually

1181
01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:35.020
that, that is just dogma, because if you look

1182
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.010
at the world, you find it can't just be

1183
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.219
all about procreation, or at least it's not as

1184
01:02:39.219 --> 01:02:42.020
straightforward as that, because look, the, the world is

1185
01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.709
telling you that, that, that um. That same-sex relationships

1186
01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:48.389
are happening everywhere, so what are we to make

1187
01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:49.830
of that, so it goes back to this idea

1188
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:53.580
if you really wanted to um. Make sure that

1189
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.590
his observations were grounded in a in a in

1190
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.030
a honest study of the world. Yeah.

1191
01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:03.129
So if I remember correctly and if I understand

1192
01:03:03.129 --> 01:03:06.449
it correctly, and if not, please correct me, but.

1193
01:03:06.709 --> 01:03:11.550
Um, WHEN it comes to his ethics and how

1194
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.479
he derived it from, what he derived it from,

1195
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.709
I mean, I think it has to do at

1196
01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:20.629
least to some extent with his metaphysics having to

1197
01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:22.909
do with the will and how the will then

1198
01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:27.189
eventually leads to suffering. So I mean, is that

1199
01:03:27.189 --> 01:03:30.510
correct and what were his ethics

1200
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:37.409
exactly? Good, yeah, so. So There's two ideas really

1201
01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:41.000
here. Um, ONE is, um, his idea of kind

1202
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.689
of morality as compassion. So when we, when somebody

1203
01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:49.300
does some kind of generally an interpersonal uh moral

1204
01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.350
action, whether it's of an of an omission, so

1205
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:56.370
where I refrain from er interfering with somebody or

1206
01:03:56.370 --> 01:04:00.169
whether it's uh you know, action or commission where

1207
01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:06.010
I aid somebody, his understanding of that, um. Of

1208
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:10.850
that relationship is based, squarely and exclusively on the

1209
01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:14.169
idea of compassion, where compassion is being incentivized by

1210
01:04:14.169 --> 01:04:17.169
somebody else's suffering to, to, to help or, or

1211
01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:19.479
you know, or to not harm them. So that's

1212
01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:21.520
one idea that he thinks that morality is based

1213
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.820
on compassion, as distinct from say utility or duty,

1214
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.719
so he's he's he's um he's not a utilitarian,

1215
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.149
he's not a deontologist. Some people argue he's some

1216
01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:34.159
form of virtue ethicist, although even then he would,

1217
01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:37.540
he would be an unconventional sort. Um, HE'S more

1218
01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.250
in the lineage, he, he knows his history, he

1219
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.739
knows that maybe Rousseau is the, is the, is

1220
01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:45.510
the most recent prominent precursor to this cos Rousseau,

1221
01:04:45.659 --> 01:04:47.739
in contrast to Hobbes, thinks that human nature has

1222
01:04:47.739 --> 01:04:51.610
a kind of innate pity, and innate, you know,

1223
01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:53.899
fellow feeling for one another. So that's his kind

1224
01:04:53.899 --> 01:04:57.840
of philosophy of morality, let's say. And then I've

1225
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.280
already mentioned that he has this higher ethical stance

1226
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.760
of salvation, which is more to do, less to

1227
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.080
do with like aiding others or not harming others

1228
01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.959
and more to do with achieving a kind of

1229
01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:11.360
escape from life's suffering, the, the kind of suffering

1230
01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.000
that's in, that's the kind of subject matter of

1231
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.780
his, of his pessimism. Yeah. And so um and

1232
01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.739
so yeah, there's this other side of his ethics

1233
01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:24.780
too, where, where he advocates asceticism rather than compassionate

1234
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.600
action. Um, AND you might, so in these respects

1235
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.040
he's very similar to the, the Buddhist philosophies that

1236
01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.959
he was very inspired by, like one thing that

1237
01:05:33.959 --> 01:05:36.189
I haven't mentioned too much, although there's been hints

1238
01:05:36.189 --> 01:05:40.159
is that he was from, you know, um. From

1239
01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:43.719
the earliest works he was producing, he was literate

1240
01:05:43.719 --> 01:05:48.040
in classical Indian philosophy, um, both its ethics and

1241
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.750
it's metaphysics, and sometimes he was a bit, Idiosyncratic

1242
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.189
in his reading of these sources, I don't know

1243
01:05:53.189 --> 01:05:55.709
whether he'd necessarily pass muster with today's, you know,

1244
01:05:55.790 --> 01:06:00.560
scholars of these religions and these philosophies, um, but

1245
01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.679
you can see the resemblance there that, that one

1246
01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:04.679
of the, you know, his kind of primary moral

1247
01:06:04.679 --> 01:06:08.879
virtue is compassion, and, um, the form of salvation

1248
01:06:08.879 --> 01:06:11.679
that he advocates comes uh in, in the form

1249
01:06:11.679 --> 01:06:17.820
of a, Resignation and a and a um. And

1250
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.489
a um and a negation of, of er of

1251
01:06:21.489 --> 01:06:25.820
desire, um, including sexual desire for instance, so all

1252
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.500
that stuff we've been talking about sexuality, that would

1253
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.620
be undone by achieving salvation.

1254
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.649
So let's talk now about the later stages of

1255
01:06:36.649 --> 01:06:41.250
his life, particularly what was the impact of the

1256
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:45.929
publishing of Perega and Perelli Pomana on his life

1257
01:06:45.929 --> 01:06:49.620
and how did he deal with, uh, the southern

1258
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.810
fame ego. Yeah,

1259
01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.929
good, um, so yeah, so that's the standard, yeah,

1260
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.929
story which I more or less stick to, which

1261
01:06:55.929 --> 01:07:01.449
is that, um, he doesn't become. Known until the

1262
01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:04.169
1850s, which is the last decade of his life

1263
01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:08.010
because he dies in 1860. In that time, um,

1264
01:07:08.129 --> 01:07:10.909
so all through from, from, you know, from childhood

1265
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:16.270
to into his sixties, he has been, um, producing

1266
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.969
work, he, he, he's always writing in his notebooks,

1267
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.629
he's, you know, he has a very strict and

1268
01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:24.330
disciplined writing routine, so he's always working on philosophy,

1269
01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:26.959
but he's not publishing all the time. Um, YOU

1270
01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:29.919
know, the 1830s, for instance, yeah, I mean he

1271
01:07:29.919 --> 01:07:32.840
maybe puts out like re-editions of certain works, but

1272
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.260
he doesn't publish any new works in the 1830s.

1273
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.120
Um, YOU know, again, there's a nice historical contrast

1274
01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.719
there which is that a lot of the philosophers

1275
01:07:40.719 --> 01:07:43.090
of his day would have been writing in. In

1276
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:45.290
journals and magazines as well as, you know, in

1277
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:47.290
order to kind of help support their living, but

1278
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:49.439
also to help kind of raise their profile and

1279
01:07:49.439 --> 01:07:52.330
stuff, but Schopenhauer has long gaps between publishing works

1280
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.889
and none of them really capture much attention critically

1281
01:07:55.889 --> 01:07:59.969
or with the public. Um, INCLUDING works like The

1282
01:07:59.969 --> 01:08:02.870
Worlds and Representation, The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,

1283
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:05.330
um, on Vision and Colors, which he writes with

1284
01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:08.949
Goethe on, on Goethe's kind of unusual theory of

1285
01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:12.010
color, on the will and nature, and his first

1286
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:13.610
book on the fourfold root of the principle of

1287
01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.870
sufficient Reason, which is his doctoral dissertation. All of

1288
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:19.310
these are kind of met with silence, and to

1289
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.790
the point where he begins to think there's something

1290
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:24.700
more to it, he becomes quite conspiratorial, I think,

1291
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:27.270
sort of, sort of thinks that, or conspiracist sort

1292
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.419
of thinks that maybe his views are too hot

1293
01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:31.430
and the public can't take them and the and

1294
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:35.009
the philosophy professors are starting to um suppress them.

1295
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.580
So he writes this last book in 1851 and

1296
01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.319
publishes it in 1851, which kind of actually gathers,

1297
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.259
if you look in his notes, you know, he's

1298
01:08:43.259 --> 01:08:45.439
been writing some of these ideas for decades, but

1299
01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:48.319
um. In Peregri and Palopomina, which is additions and

1300
01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:51.700
omissions or offshoots and offcuts, um, it's these kind

1301
01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.379
of more occasional, more accessible, more worldly, more outward

1302
01:08:55.379 --> 01:08:59.370
looking version of Schopenhauer, slightly slightly less systematic, a

1303
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:03.299
bit more, uh, dilettantic in the best possible sense

1304
01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:06.459
that he's sort of dipping into everything from noises

1305
01:09:06.459 --> 01:09:10.259
to Sanskrit literature, and he's got views on suicide

1306
01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:11.899
and this way we find the essay on women

1307
01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:13.500
and things like that, and then he's kind of

1308
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.828
rehearsing some of his views on. The history of

1309
01:09:15.828 --> 01:09:20.957
philosophy and on suffering and things, and finally, um,

1310
01:09:21.019 --> 01:09:26.060
a review gets published in 1853. In, in the

1311
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.580
Westminster Review. Now this was an organ and this

1312
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.299
was a journal. I've been, I didn't mean to

1313
01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:33.459
talk so much about British culture, but that was

1314
01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:36.220
edited by John Stewart, founded by Bentham, edited by

1315
01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.000
John Stuart Mill. So Schopenhauer gets actually taken on

1316
01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.520
by radical liberal thinkers in the, in the UK

1317
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.020
which he would have been happy with because he

1318
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.899
loved the UK, he was an Anglophone ever since

1319
01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:50.390
the trip he made with his parents. Um, AND

1320
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:53.000
this starts to bring him fame and renown. Suddenly

1321
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.709
people realize, oh, there's this, there's this 60, 70

1322
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:59.589
year old philosopher in Frankfurt who's been writing about

1323
01:09:59.589 --> 01:10:03.720
these most profound. Um, ASPECTS of the human condition

1324
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.200
for decades, and nobody's been talking about him and

1325
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.879
suddenly he gets this level of fame where people

1326
01:10:08.879 --> 01:10:10.990
want to paint portraits of him, take his photo,

1327
01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.120
I talk in the book a lot about Schopenhauer's

1328
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.470
experiences with the birth of photography. Um, I, I

1329
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:18.990
kind of wager that he might be the first

1330
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:21.870
major philosopher to be, to be photographed. He must

1331
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:25.069
have been certainly very close to being the first,

1332
01:10:25.109 --> 01:10:27.229
cause he gets photographed in the early 1840s, which

1333
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:29.830
is only just after the, the most early forms

1334
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:33.709
of portrait photography have been, uh, you know, publicized.

1335
01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:38.000
Um, AND yeah, he, he likes the fame, and,

1336
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.600
and again he sort of starts to give it

1337
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.520
a rationalization which is that actually this is the

1338
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.799
right kind of fame, which is, it's not a

1339
01:10:43.799 --> 01:10:47.279
kind of quick fame that burns out. Um, HE,

1340
01:10:47.399 --> 01:10:49.149
uh, but it's the kind of fame that is,

1341
01:10:49.359 --> 01:10:51.910
that has, you know, that is backed by all

1342
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:53.959
the decades of work he's been doing, like he

1343
01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.680
thinks he's famous for the right reasons. That he

1344
01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.680
hasn't tried to pander to the public, in fact,

1345
01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.910
he's actively tried to avoid pandering to the public,

1346
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.629
he's just been diligently working on what he thinks

1347
01:11:03.629 --> 01:11:06.509
is true, and finally, the times have caught up

1348
01:11:06.509 --> 01:11:09.759
with him. Um, THERE'S an alternative explanation that some

1349
01:11:09.759 --> 01:11:12.339
people go for, so the, the, the Marxist philosopher

1350
01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:17.689
George Lukas. Um, ARGUES that it's actually because of

1351
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:22.049
the 1848, the, you know, failed revolutions in, in

1352
01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:24.729
Europe. And that actually Europe was going through a

1353
01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:27.490
quite pessimistic period and Schopenhauer was then taken onto

1354
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:29.410
the, into the mainstream because he was kind of

1355
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.770
giving voice to the doom and gloom and Schopenhauer

1356
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.689
resisted that interpretation as well, um, but that's an

1357
01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:36.890
alternative, that it wasn't really anything to do with

1358
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:39.490
Schopenhauer himself so much as, um, the mood of

1359
01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:43.330
pessimism that was kind of, Uh, lurking around Europe

1360
01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:46.589
in those days. Um, BUT yeah, he was, he

1361
01:11:46.589 --> 01:11:49.649
was pretty grateful even though it did mean that

1362
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:52.069
the attention, like people were knocking on his door

1363
01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:53.549
and trying to visit him and things like that,

1364
01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:55.649
and some of them he kind of greets kindly,

1365
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.430
um, depending on what their motives are for seeking

1366
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:59.669
him out, and some of them he's a bit

1367
01:11:59.669 --> 01:12:02.439
gruff, so there's always that. That solitary nature that

1368
01:12:02.439 --> 01:12:05.060
we started our conversation with is, is, is bumping

1369
01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.529
up against this, um, launch into the world, yeah.

1370
01:12:09.009 --> 01:12:11.589
OK, but at a certain point there you said

1371
01:12:11.589 --> 01:12:14.770
that he fought, he became famous for the right

1372
01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:18.049
reasons, but what would be the wrong reasons, I

1373
01:12:18.049 --> 01:12:20.250
mean, what else did he have to say on

1374
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.479
the topic of fame?

1375
01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:25.750
Yeah, good, well, the wrong reasons would basically be

1376
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:32.839
um. If somebody had um, OK, so if somebody

1377
01:12:32.839 --> 01:12:41.140
was famous for. Let's say. There were, there were

1378
01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.149
certain philosophers, I mean it's, it's hard not to

1379
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:45.229
bring up Hegel again because he's an example that

1380
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:49.549
Schopenhauer often returns to, um, who he thought that

1381
01:12:49.549 --> 01:12:53.790
the, that the public had been fooled into thinking

1382
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:55.870
that Hegel, not just that what Hegel was saying

1383
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:58.089
was right, but that Hegel had anything to say.

1384
01:12:58.709 --> 01:13:00.899
Again, like lots of Hague aliens will be holding

1385
01:13:00.899 --> 01:13:03.580
their head in their hands saying Schopenhauer just. Got

1386
01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.950
Hegel totally wrong, but, but it's, it, it, we're

1387
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:08.470
looking really at what Sherenhauer thought here rather than

1388
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:11.509
what er what Hagel thought, Terenhower thought that Hegel

1389
01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:13.549
had nothing to say but he was saying it

1390
01:13:13.549 --> 01:13:16.680
anyway. And um that he thought was the wrong

1391
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.600
kind of fame and we might think that I

1392
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.069
mean it's the accusation often made, you know, an

1393
01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:24.279
insult often thrown from one philosopher to another who

1394
01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:26.680
when they think, you know, so Jacques Derrida famously

1395
01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.240
got kind of treated this way by a lot

1396
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.839
of people and Foucault gets treated away a lot

1397
01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:34.080
by by um treated this way by a lot

1398
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.560
of people where. Um, WHERE really there's no substance

1399
01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.200
to what they're saying, and Trevor I thought that

1400
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.740
there was a lot of people who'd found fame,

1401
01:13:42.959 --> 01:13:46.080
purely because of just public perception of them being

1402
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.939
a brilliant philosopher when there really wasn't any substance

1403
01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:52.899
to it. And there's, there's there's, there's there's, there

1404
01:13:52.899 --> 01:13:56.379
are certain philosophers who, who, you know, he thinks

1405
01:13:56.379 --> 01:13:59.220
might have deliberately engineered that, that they weren't doing

1406
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.620
that in false consciousness, like it's not that they

1407
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.419
thought they were saying something and they actually weren't,

1408
01:14:03.459 --> 01:14:06.060
but actually they were kind of willing to bend

1409
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.339
their philosophy to just to kind of, they were

1410
01:14:08.339 --> 01:14:13.419
incentivized to, um, to meet with public approval, cos

1411
01:14:13.419 --> 01:14:16.709
you, you've got to remember that like um, With

1412
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:22.310
different academic disciplines or different intellectual disciplines. There are

1413
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:25.799
more objective ways to judge its success, so Schopenhauer

1414
01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:29.040
is particularly reverential of the sciences because you can

1415
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.200
prove a scientific hypothesis and it of course we

1416
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.160
do have, you know, peer reviewing who check the

1417
01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.200
method and the results and replication and things like

1418
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.000
that, but ultimately there is a, the method is

1419
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.160
ultimately, you know, sovereign in those disciplines. With philosophy,

1420
01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:46.359
it's not like that in that we, we, we,

1421
01:14:46.509 --> 01:14:50.629
the, the, the method we have. Is determined by

1422
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.770
peer perceptions, um, and so if you can influence

1423
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.620
those peer perceptions. In a way that's not to

1424
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.589
do with actually producing, you know, true philosophy, but

1425
01:15:03.589 --> 01:15:07.060
just by, I don't know, appealing to tastes, inclinations,

1426
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.899
agendas and so on, then you might win that

1427
01:15:09.899 --> 01:15:14.040
public and peer approval. Even though your philosophy is

1428
01:15:14.049 --> 01:15:17.229
is empty. So, so that's the, that's the thing,

1429
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:21.270
Trevor now thought that his philosophy. Had got the

1430
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:24.990
recognition it deserves, because it deserved to be recognized,

1431
01:15:25.169 --> 01:15:27.370
because it was true, because it was wise, cos

1432
01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:31.290
it was knowledge. But you could win that recognition.

1433
01:15:32.169 --> 01:15:34.970
By means of other things, and too many people

1434
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:38.870
he thought had won that recognition by, Um, or

1435
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.350
treated winning that recognition as an end in itself,

1436
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:44.109
as if it could be detached from saying what's,

1437
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:46.810
what's true and what's, what's honest and what's wise.

1438
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:49.209
That's the kind of fame he thought was wrong

1439
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:51.370
and would ultimately be shown to be a farce.

1440
01:15:51.549 --> 01:15:53.709
So he did expect Hegel to just descend into

1441
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:55.930
oblivion, which he did for a bit, but then

1442
01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:59.069
Hegel was revived, and now he's going strong. Same

1443
01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:02.220
for Schopenhauer really, fame tends to fluctuate, but. He,

1444
01:16:02.299 --> 01:16:04.540
he kind of hoped and thought his fame would

1445
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.500
last because it was based on a solid philosophical

1446
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.620
footing, whereas these other philosophers who just sought fame

1447
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:14.459
for its own sake, he thought ultimately people would

1448
01:16:14.459 --> 01:16:16.339
see that it's based on nothing and those philosophers

1449
01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.359
would disappear.

1450
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.819
So just before we explore the end of his

1451
01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:25.180
life and his legacy, there's another topic I would

1452
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.379
like to talk about here. So Uh, of course,

1453
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.939
when we think about Schopenhauer, uh, we tend to

1454
01:16:31.939 --> 01:16:36.580
think about his metaphysics, his ethics, his aesthetics, and

1455
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:39.640
some of the other topics we talked about today.

1456
01:16:39.979 --> 01:16:43.779
But what about politics? Did he have much to

1457
01:16:43.779 --> 01:16:46.459
say on the topic of politics because we don't

1458
01:16:46.459 --> 01:16:50.140
tend to think about Schopenhauer as a political philosopher

1459
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:50.580
at all,

1460
01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:53.620
right? No, you're right, we don't, and, and, um.

1461
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:57.609
So he does have things to say about politics.

1462
01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:01.740
Um, HE has a political philosophy. It doesn't take

1463
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.839
up a significant, a substantial part of his philosophy,

1464
01:17:04.919 --> 01:17:07.439
it's a few sections of um the world as

1465
01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:09.779
a representation, and there's an essay or two in,

1466
01:17:11.069 --> 01:17:14.890
Perega and Palapometer that's on politics and jurisprudence, he's

1467
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:19.330
not, he's certainly not um, There's a good reason

1468
01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.140
why he isn't known as a political philosopher, cos

1469
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.250
he doesn't spend that much time doing actual political

1470
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:26.009
philosophy. Although as we've mentioned, I mean, we've been

1471
01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:28.810
talking about his views on sexuality, I've mentioned his

1472
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.410
views on race and, and gender, and we've been

1473
01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:34.129
talking about his, I mentioned in passing his views

1474
01:17:34.129 --> 01:17:37.970
on animals and on the international slave trade. These

1475
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.390
are political issues, right? It's the thing is that.

1476
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:42.580
It might have been a, you know, there are

1477
01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:46.569
people, scholars who've argued that perhaps by confining his

1478
01:17:46.569 --> 01:17:50.330
political philosophy in a very concentrated area, he was

1479
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:55.370
sending the message that um the actual kind of

1480
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.910
political philosophy, you know, er in the proper sense

1481
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:02.609
is relatively limited in terms of addressing the, the

1482
01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:04.509
problems of pessimism, because even if you have a

1483
01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:10.680
ideally organized society. All these perennial existential horrors and

1484
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.879
terrors are still gonna be there. Politics can't get

1485
01:18:12.879 --> 01:18:15.189
to the root of the human condition for Schopenhauer,

1486
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.750
and that's why his political philosophy is confined to

1487
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:22.509
such a concentrated and and limited place, but, If

1488
01:18:22.509 --> 01:18:25.189
you look outside that, you find politics in a

1489
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:30.339
broader sense, um of the way that um. The

1490
01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.850
politic, you know, political mismanagement, you know, for instance,

1491
01:18:33.859 --> 01:18:36.700
the way that animals for centuries in Europe and

1492
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.819
still to this day are going without certain essential

1493
01:18:38.819 --> 01:18:41.890
protections can add to the general quantity of misery

1494
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:44.140
in the world. Similarly with the conditions of women,

1495
01:18:44.259 --> 01:18:47.540
similarly with the conditions of um people of other

1496
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.569
races or, you know, other to the society that

1497
01:18:50.569 --> 01:18:54.399
they're in. Um, SO, so I think Charna has

1498
01:18:54.399 --> 01:18:59.259
actually a deeply political character even though. Kind of

1499
01:18:59.259 --> 01:19:04.500
maybe deliberately, he um he confines actual political philosophy

1500
01:19:04.899 --> 01:19:07.459
within very strict limits cos he, he's not hopeful

1501
01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:09.930
that politics will get to the root of our,

1502
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.419
of our condition. People have started to write about

1503
01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.500
this, there's a very good book by Jacob Norberg,

1504
01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.540
who works at Duke University called Schopenhau Politics, that's

1505
01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.009
probably, that's definitely the most recent full length monograph

1506
01:19:21.009 --> 01:19:22.899
on Schopenhau politics and makes some of the points

1507
01:19:22.899 --> 01:19:25.299
that I've just mentioned. I've written a little about,

1508
01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:29.529
a little bit about Schopenhauer's politics. Um, But I,

1509
01:19:29.589 --> 01:19:32.870
I, I, I think it's more interesting to look

1510
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:35.509
at the way that Schopenhauer applied his general philosophy

1511
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:38.790
to political issues and looked at them, so for

1512
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:41.979
instance, in the case of animals. He's talking about

1513
01:19:41.979 --> 01:19:44.720
what is a political issue, but he's using it

1514
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.200
in a way to talk about his philosophy of

1515
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.169
compassion, for instance, because he thinks that um animals

1516
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:54.490
have, have not been treated as proper moral patients,

1517
01:19:54.549 --> 01:19:58.069
you know, some, you know, beings that deserve genuine

1518
01:19:58.069 --> 01:20:01.089
and direct moral treatment, and he thinks with his

1519
01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:03.399
philosophy of compassion that that's wrong because there's no

1520
01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.569
reason why a being that suffers like an animal

1521
01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:09.410
shouldn't deserve our compassion in, in exactly the same

1522
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:12.560
way. As a, as a, as a human being,

1523
01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.209
so he often looks at political issues, he just

1524
01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:17.399
doesn't necessarily look at them like a political philosopher.

1525
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:23.470
Mhm. So when and how did he die, and

1526
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:26.109
I mean, do you think he would have been

1527
01:20:26.509 --> 01:20:31.229
satisfied with his own death? What were his more

1528
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:33.689
general ideas on the topic of death?

1529
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:37.430
Good. Um, OK, so he dies on the 21st

1530
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:42.819
of September. 1860. He dies at home in his

1531
01:20:42.819 --> 01:20:45.060
in his adoptive home city of Frankfurt, where he's

1532
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.430
lived for 2 or 3 decades. Um, HE dies

1533
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:52.529
of probably something like a pulmonary pulmonary embolism, some

1534
01:20:52.529 --> 01:20:56.330
sort of respiratory cardiovascular respiratory condition, cos he's suffered

1535
01:20:56.330 --> 01:21:00.220
with shortness of breath. Um, PROBABLY that was the

1536
01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.640
death he wanted in the sense of he really

1537
01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:06.299
had a terror, a horror of losing his cognitive

1538
01:21:06.299 --> 01:21:09.620
faculties like Kant did. So he would have much

1539
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.729
rather go relatively quickly to a physical illness. Than

1540
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.430
for instance a long drawn out kind of neurological

1541
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:21.200
disease, that would have been his, his absolute nightmare.

1542
01:21:21.359 --> 01:21:22.950
So in that sense, that was the death that

1543
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:26.370
he wanted. He was also by then well known,

1544
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:28.189
he could see the, the beginning, the dawn of

1545
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:32.069
his fame across Europe. That's another tick, like he

1546
01:21:32.069 --> 01:21:33.709
would have been happy with going out on that

1547
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:37.049
note. Actually, on the other hand, another way to

1548
01:21:37.049 --> 01:21:39.299
look at that is that he's kind of disappointed

1549
01:21:39.299 --> 01:21:42.040
that he's only just, just enjoying the success that

1550
01:21:42.049 --> 01:21:43.779
that, you know, he's just tasting the fruits of

1551
01:21:43.779 --> 01:21:46.250
his labor, of his decades of labor. So in

1552
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.459
that sense he's a little bit eager for more

1553
01:21:48.459 --> 01:21:50.819
life, you know, there's one reflection that a friend

1554
01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:54.629
of his. Um, RIGHTS to, to, to say that

1555
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:56.149
he, he, Sherman and I was saying, oh I

1556
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:57.990
could live to 90 and then I'll really see

1557
01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:01.790
off the professorial class of philosophers, like, um, he

1558
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:04.069
wanted to, to see his fame grow and grow

1559
01:22:04.069 --> 01:22:05.640
and to kind of lean into it and really

1560
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.720
start to demolish academic philosophy in German universities. He

1561
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.839
doesn't get that far because he only dies at

1562
01:22:10.839 --> 01:22:13.040
72, he doesn't get into his, into his 90s.

1563
01:22:13.279 --> 01:22:14.759
So at that point he's lusting maybe for a

1564
01:22:14.759 --> 01:22:17.160
little more life, which is kind of ironic in

1565
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.399
where we started, given that he, he's a pessimist,

1566
01:22:19.479 --> 01:22:22.120
he thinks that, you know, um, life is a

1567
01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.439
mistake. So, so it's actually um ironic how I

1568
01:22:27.439 --> 01:22:29.319
actually think that Schopenhauer was in a good place

1569
01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:32.680
when he died. Um, HE had people who respected

1570
01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.640
his work, who were willing to help him to

1571
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.939
publicize it. Um, HE lived, you know, he, you

1572
01:22:39.939 --> 01:22:41.540
know, in the first half of his life he

1573
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.580
was moving around all the time. He barely left

1574
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.979
Frankfurt in the last two decades, so I actually

1575
01:22:46.979 --> 01:22:50.459
think, you know. He was, he was happy, which

1576
01:22:50.459 --> 01:22:53.100
is an odd thing to say about Schopenhauer. Anyway,

1577
01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.939
so those are the, those are the biographical facts

1578
01:22:54.939 --> 01:22:58.500
and then um, the philosophy is an interesting one,

1579
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:03.450
so. So Schopenhauer kind of picks up the tradition

1580
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:06.640
of the philosophy of death whereby the goal is

1581
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.009
not only to describe what death is in philosophical

1582
01:23:10.009 --> 01:23:13.930
terms, but also perhaps to provide some consolation for

1583
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:17.089
the fact of death, you know. Um, OF course

1584
01:23:17.089 --> 01:23:19.770
Schopenhauer, you know, as a kind of matter of

1585
01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:25.140
principle, isn't going to let the consolatory goal. Distort

1586
01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:27.640
the the kind of descriptive one, so he's not

1587
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.799
gonna give you, he's not gonna describe death in

1588
01:23:29.799 --> 01:23:33.959
a way that's, um, you know, at all costs

1589
01:23:33.959 --> 01:23:36.160
must give consolation cos that would be wrong, you

1590
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.060
know, his ultimate value is truth and honesty, so

1591
01:23:39.379 --> 01:23:41.819
if it turns out that he can't give a

1592
01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.259
consolatory description of death, well too bad, you know,

1593
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.640
um, he, you know, honesty is, is, is, is

1594
01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.959
important to Chopin above all, but he recognizes that

1595
01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:55.750
ever since Socrates, philosophy, philosophers have. Uh, LINKED the

1596
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:59.910
motive to do philosophy with the fear of mortality.

1597
01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:03.259
And that maybe becoming a philosopher is one way

1598
01:24:03.259 --> 01:24:05.100
of coming to terms with the fact of our,

1599
01:24:05.299 --> 01:24:06.919
you know, of our deaths and things like that.

1600
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:10.959
So, um, so, so the question then is how

1601
01:24:10.959 --> 01:24:14.640
does he go about that, well. One version of

1602
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.879
uh of this philosophy would be the kind of

1603
01:24:16.879 --> 01:24:20.399
epicurean stance which is that death is not something

1604
01:24:20.399 --> 01:24:22.479
to be feared of, it's not something we should

1605
01:24:22.479 --> 01:24:25.120
be afraid of because um, you know, it's not

1606
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.959
something that really happens to us, we'll we'll, you

1607
01:24:26.959 --> 01:24:29.629
know, we'll be dead, um we shouldn't worry about

1608
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:31.799
it because we won't, we won't be here to,

1609
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:35.810
to, um, To er to experience it, and some

1610
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:37.600
people might be able to take consolation from that,

1611
01:24:37.689 --> 01:24:39.529
although others might be like, well that's exactly what

1612
01:24:39.529 --> 01:24:41.669
I'm afraid of, there's a, there's a poem by

1613
01:24:41.879 --> 01:24:44.689
Philip Larkin called Oba, where he, it's one of

1614
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:46.609
the best poems I know about the fear of

1615
01:24:46.609 --> 01:24:49.890
death and, and he, you know, Larkin, you know,

1616
01:24:50.009 --> 01:24:53.549
kind of belies this epicurean Epicurean argument by saying,

1617
01:24:54.049 --> 01:24:55.919
oh like not being able to think, not being

1618
01:24:55.919 --> 01:24:59.169
able to talk, not being able to write, uh

1619
01:24:59.169 --> 01:25:01.290
you, you know, you tell me that's consolation, well

1620
01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:04.569
that's exactly what I'm afraid of, um. The other,

1621
01:25:04.689 --> 01:25:10.120
the other um option is, is personal immortality. So,

1622
01:25:10.209 --> 01:25:13.270
OK, er don't be afraid of death because actually

1623
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:16.109
death is an illusion, the essential part of yourself,

1624
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:19.729
which many people locate in the conscious mind, the

1625
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:22.649
living, breathing, thinking part of ourselves, that will go

1626
01:25:22.649 --> 01:25:26.990
on eternally after death, that's consolation for some. Um,

1627
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:30.549
Schopenhauer thinks that's foolish. He thinks, um, one thing

1628
01:25:30.549 --> 01:25:33.939
the Epicurean has right is the idea that, um,

1629
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:37.509
death is the extinguish extinguishing of the individual, that

1630
01:25:37.509 --> 01:25:40.549
the conscious, consciousness, individual consciousness doesn't survive death according

1631
01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:44.089
to Schopenha, that's just wishful thinking. So what, what,

1632
01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:46.339
so, so what does he actually think? He kind

1633
01:25:46.339 --> 01:25:48.620
of has a blend of these two views in

1634
01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:55.410
that he, he. On the one hand Um On

1635
01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:59.689
the one hand, he, he thinks that individual consciousness

1636
01:25:59.689 --> 01:26:03.399
is er eliminated in death, so that is annihilated,

1637
01:26:03.689 --> 01:26:06.310
but on the other, he doesn't think that our

1638
01:26:06.339 --> 01:26:10.000
essence, the essence of the human being is annihilated

1639
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.290
in death. So he kind of has a mixture

1640
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.930
of the annihilationist view and the the immortalist view.

1641
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:19.990
Um, BUT then the question arises, well, what is

1642
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:21.910
it, what is it about the essence of human

1643
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.990
beings that survives? Well, it's kind of for sure

1644
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:26.910
now the impersonal part of, of, of, of our

1645
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:29.740
essence because something we haven't really teased out in

1646
01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.430
his theoretical philosophy is that he thinks that all

1647
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:34.709
human beings are just manifestations of what he calls

1648
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:38.149
the will to life, um, or the, the will

1649
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:40.589
to life is a manifestation of some wider metaphysical

1650
01:26:40.589 --> 01:26:42.649
reality that is, you know, maybe some at bottom

1651
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:46.549
somewhat mysterious. Um, AND so, so there is some

1652
01:26:46.549 --> 01:26:50.350
kind of, um, ultimately each human being is never

1653
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:52.430
really, the essence of each human being is never

1654
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:54.149
really born in the first place. There was, there's

1655
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:55.990
a part of each human being, it's part of

1656
01:26:55.990 --> 01:27:00.709
every, you know, existent thing that existed before it

1657
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:02.669
and will go on to exist after it, so.

1658
01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:06.189
To, to kind of take any consolation in the,

1659
01:27:06.339 --> 01:27:08.270
or to take or to take uh the fear

1660
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:10.109
out of death, we have to kind of, it

1661
01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:12.560
involves a kind of transformation of consciousness or a

1662
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.350
or a shift in perspective, whereby we don't identify,

1663
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:21.830
we don't locate our identity in the individual consciousness

1664
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:24.109
that actually does, as a matter of fact, die.

1665
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:28.180
But we locate our identity in something deeper that

1666
01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.729
has been around before us and will go on

1667
01:27:29.729 --> 01:27:32.049
after us. Now, a lot of people won't take

1668
01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:34.339
consolation in that, right, they'll be like, no, the

1669
01:27:34.339 --> 01:27:35.580
bit that you're saying is going to die is

1670
01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.180
the bit I want, you know, at all costs

1671
01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.759
to survive. Forch now that's a no hope view.

1672
01:27:40.859 --> 01:27:42.180
He thinks look, nobody's going to be able to

1673
01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.479
consolate, if you fixate on that, you're always going

1674
01:27:44.479 --> 01:27:47.020
to be afraid. So too bad if you can't,

1675
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.979
and actually he thinks that maybe a certain kind

1676
01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:51.379
of moral transformation is required, so it's not just

1677
01:27:51.379 --> 01:27:53.740
a cognitive shift, but in order to be more

1678
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.649
reconciled to death. You may need to change your

1679
01:27:57.649 --> 01:28:00.629
moral outlook in a way where you kind of

1680
01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:04.930
live your life from a slightly more expansive perspective

1681
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:08.009
and you, and you consider yourself part of an

1682
01:28:08.009 --> 01:28:11.089
ongoing um you know, process or reality or what

1683
01:28:11.089 --> 01:28:13.330
have you. And, and you know, in the funeral

1684
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:16.330
rites, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it's all

1685
01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:18.830
sort of thing. There are references to that idea

1686
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:20.330
that we come from dust, we go back to

1687
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.970
dust and we're part of the whole cycle of

1688
01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:24.149
life. Do you remember I was just trying to

1689
01:28:24.569 --> 01:28:28.169
find a way for people to take consolation er

1690
01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.850
in, in that notion, yeah.

1691
01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:34.120
So for people to get a better understanding of

1692
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.200
the sort of standing that Schopenhauer has uh when

1693
01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.399
it comes to the history of philosophy, who are

1694
01:28:42.399 --> 01:28:48.000
some of the most prominent people, philosophers he influenced?

1695
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.879
Good, well, the names that spring to mind are.

1696
01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:55.410
Friedrich Nietzsche, that's the one that immediately springs to

1697
01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:58.580
mind because Nietzsche was obsessed with Schopenhauer after discovering

1698
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.379
him when Nietzsche was a young man. They never

1699
01:29:01.379 --> 01:29:04.490
met. Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche was about 16 when Schopenhauer

1700
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:07.339
died and wasn't, you know, uh, interested in philosophy

1701
01:29:07.339 --> 01:29:09.419
really at that point. He starts out in classics

1702
01:29:09.419 --> 01:29:14.220
and moves into philosophy. Um, BUT Nietzsche took up

1703
01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:18.620
this challenge of pessimism, uh, and tried to come

1704
01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:20.250
up with a solution to it that wasn't the

1705
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:22.200
negation of life, but it was actually its opposite.

1706
01:29:22.859 --> 01:29:26.939
One way to understand Nietzsche's project is various different

1707
01:29:26.939 --> 01:29:32.549
ways of overcoming Schopenhauer and inspired pessimism, um, by

1708
01:29:32.549 --> 01:29:36.350
affirming life, whether it's through art or. You know,

1709
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:40.870
self-creation or value creation, there's lots of different ideas

1710
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:43.430
that Nietzsche, experiments with over the course of his

1711
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:47.850
career, so there's, there's that, the early Wittgenstein, um,

1712
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:50.549
so, Wittgenstein was kind of, in a way that

1713
01:29:50.549 --> 01:29:54.379
may be disingenuous, famously kind of, Didn't read much

1714
01:29:54.379 --> 01:29:56.720
philosophy, but it was kind of a natural born

1715
01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:00.419
logician and philosopher and um, but one philosopher he

1716
01:30:00.419 --> 01:30:03.620
really did read was, was Schopenhauer and the kind

1717
01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.620
of traces of Kantianism in the early Wittgenstein in

1718
01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:09.240
the, in the tractus, the, the sense in which

1719
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.240
the tractator may be some sort of transcendental project,

1720
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:16.220
um may be influenced by the way that that

1721
01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.819
Schopenhauer presents Kantian philosophy in, in, in, in his

1722
01:30:19.819 --> 01:30:24.859
more theoretical works. Um, ANOTHER in the philosophy world,

1723
01:30:25.069 --> 01:30:26.870
another actual philosopher that rings to mind is Max

1724
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:32.339
Horkheimer. Um, OF the Frankfurt School, um, who was

1725
01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:34.609
a, a, a member of the Schopenhauer Society since

1726
01:30:34.609 --> 01:30:37.339
1917 or something like that, very early, you can

1727
01:30:37.339 --> 01:30:39.620
look at the, the list of members on the,

1728
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:41.259
in the, in that edition of the Schopenhauer book.

1729
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:44.750
So, um, and he was actually the first philosopher

1730
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:49.450
that, uh, Horkheimer read supposedly, um, and, and there's

1731
01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:50.870
another interesting one which is that when he met

1732
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:52.839
his wife, when Horkheimer met his wife, or the

1733
01:30:52.839 --> 01:30:54.709
woman who would become his wife, he did a

1734
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:56.149
very odd thing which is to give her a

1735
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:58.779
reading list. And top of that reading list was

1736
01:30:58.779 --> 01:31:02.779
Schopenhauer's essay on er humanity's metaphysical need or man's

1737
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.200
need for metaphysics. So he thought that it was

1738
01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.950
required reading for any prospective partner to, to, to

1739
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:11.419
read Schopenhauer. And later in the post-war period, Horkheimer

1740
01:31:11.419 --> 01:31:13.799
becomes, you know, even more deeply involved with the

1741
01:31:13.799 --> 01:31:17.109
er the Schopenhauer Society. He gives addresses at their

1742
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:20.919
conferences that then become seminal papers. Um, HE actually

1743
01:31:20.919 --> 01:31:24.149
co-teaches with the president of the Schopenhauer Society, Arthur

1744
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:26.870
Hoopscher, who also works in Frankfurt. They, they teach

1745
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:29.729
seminars together on the philosophy of religion. And one

1746
01:31:29.729 --> 01:31:32.339
difference between Horkheimer and on the one hand and

1747
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:35.299
and Nietzsche and Wittgenstein on the other is that,

1748
01:31:36.589 --> 01:31:39.270
So there's very much, like lots of philosophers, there's

1749
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:41.750
a distinction between the early and the later, and

1750
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.660
I, you know, you'll know that I specified the

1751
01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:46.029
early Wittgenstein because the later Wittgenstein doesn't seem that

1752
01:31:46.029 --> 01:31:49.290
interested in, in Schopenhauer. Certainly Nietzsche, you know, he

1753
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:51.660
starts out as a kind of self, you know,

1754
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:54.350
labeling card carrying Schopenhauer and then by the end

1755
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:58.770
of it he thinks he's Schopenhauer's polar antipode. Whereas

1756
01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.509
the difference with Horkheimer is that Horkheimer doesn't seem

1757
01:32:01.509 --> 01:32:03.270
to want to have this instinct to kind of

1758
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:06.430
kill the father, he doesn't wanna disavow his early

1759
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:09.939
influences. If anything, Horkheimer leans into them. So Horkheimer's

1760
01:32:09.939 --> 01:32:12.270
a good example I think because he doesn't turn

1761
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:14.350
his back on Schopenhauer, he's kind of Schopenhauer from

1762
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.859
beginning to end, even though if you read Horkheimer's

1763
01:32:16.859 --> 01:32:18.620
work, you don't see that much Schopenhauer in it

1764
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.790
because it's maybe bedded on a quite a deep

1765
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:23.549
level, whereas you see more discussion of Hegel and

1766
01:32:23.549 --> 01:32:25.549
Marx and the tradition that the, the Frankfurt School

1767
01:32:25.549 --> 01:32:28.169
falls into. Those are some philosophers or, or, you

1768
01:32:28.169 --> 01:32:32.669
know, intellectuals. Um, AND then the, the actual, the

1769
01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:34.959
influence is much wider if we talk about creative

1770
01:32:34.959 --> 01:32:37.830
artists in particular writers. So because Schopenhauer's such a

1771
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:39.700
great writer, you know, we started this conversation with

1772
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.020
me saying that I loved the way Schopenhauer writes.

1773
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.029
Lots of people did too, so the list is

1774
01:32:45.029 --> 01:32:49.700
endless, Proust and Hardy and Kafka and er Thomas

1775
01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:55.040
Mann and Jorge Luis Borges. Simone de Beauvoir, Iris

1776
01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.850
Murdoch, um. Schopenhauer, you know, Beauvoir and Murdoch obviously

1777
01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:04.020
are philosophers as well as novelists. Um, Sherman I

1778
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.540
was very influential in the arts, uh, not least

1779
01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:07.939
because he thought that the arts were a way

1780
01:33:07.939 --> 01:33:10.580
of escaping suffering, but also because he was kind

1781
01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.939
of a model of a philosopher artist, you know,

1782
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.580
that that's what Thomas Mann calls him, an artist

1783
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.100
of thought. They thought he was really stylish as

1784
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.779
well as always in tune with quite the quite

1785
01:33:20.779 --> 01:33:25.500
deep human, uh, issues that often motivate works of

1786
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.500
art. Samuel Beckett was another one, you know, Beckett

1787
01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.160
was a was a. And you can see the

1788
01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.939
influence of Schopenhauer's pessimism in how it comes out

1789
01:33:33.939 --> 01:33:36.560
in Beckett, given the kind of Piketty and very

1790
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:43.060
sparse, um, austere, hard, absurd worldview, yeah,

1791
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:49.439
yeah. And finally, what is Schopenhauer's contemporary relevance, I

1792
01:33:49.439 --> 01:33:52.950
mean, what is his relevance nowadays?

1793
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:57.660
Ah, good question. I mean, so a, a kind

1794
01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.350
of very tempting and obvious answer is that these

1795
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:04.290
are pessimistic times I feel, or, or, You know,

1796
01:34:04.399 --> 01:34:12.359
um I think that Schopenhauer's. Um, WE can sympathize

1797
01:34:12.359 --> 01:34:16.080
with Schopenhauer because things seem kind of gloomy these

1798
01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.279
days, and actually that's one of the reasons why

1799
01:34:18.279 --> 01:34:22.069
Horkheimmer liked him was that, Schopenhauer was unafraid, he

1800
01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.479
he wasn't kind of burying his head in the

1801
01:34:23.479 --> 01:34:27.040
sand and kind of thinking wishfully and optimistically that

1802
01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.069
things will turn out right. Um, SO he takes,

1803
01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:34.379
you know, suffering seriously, um. I think that's something

1804
01:34:34.379 --> 01:34:37.009
that that that people can resonate with today given

1805
01:34:37.009 --> 01:34:42.410
the spirit of the times. Um, Having said that,

1806
01:34:42.819 --> 01:34:45.939
you know, that makes Schopenhauer's relevance quite time specific,

1807
01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.020
as if like, well if, if we were all,

1808
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.600
if, if we were in a better place globally,

1809
01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.859
um, these days, maybe we wouldn't have a need

1810
01:34:53.859 --> 01:34:56.020
for Schopenhauer, but one has to remember that the

1811
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.620
pessimism that Schopenhauer has in mind is something that

1812
01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.759
he thinks of as being perennial and independent of,

1813
01:35:01.819 --> 01:35:04.100
you know, the ups and downs of, you know,

1814
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:07.140
human history and civilization, so there's something that's always

1815
01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.700
gonna be relevant about Schopenhauer. Uh, IF, if, if

1816
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.680
he's right that he's speaking to something that's universal

1817
01:35:13.939 --> 01:35:18.779
and transhistorical, then the things that Schopenhauer, um, is

1818
01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.589
talking about the struggles of being a human. Are

1819
01:35:21.779 --> 01:35:23.580
just never gonna go out of fashion, never gonna

1820
01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.140
become irrelevant, and, and, and, and, and he's reaching

1821
01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.290
back to that history when he talks about, the

1822
01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:32.169
ancient Greeks, the ancient Indians, um, you know, he,

1823
01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:34.979
he, he's saying look, they were human too and

1824
01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:37.020
the Buddha was going through the things that you're

1825
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.509
going through and, Um, and Sophocles was going through

1826
01:35:40.509 --> 01:35:43.069
the things that you're going through, and Shakespeare was

1827
01:35:43.069 --> 01:35:44.589
going through the things that you're going through, and,

1828
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:46.250
and, and, and all of them were picking up

1829
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:49.359
on something that's never, you know, um, unfortunately an

1830
01:35:49.359 --> 01:35:52.029
inellimitable part, you know, much as we might want

1831
01:35:52.029 --> 01:35:54.490
to get rid of it, it's an inellimitable part

1832
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:55.910
of, of what it is to be human, so

1833
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:58.509
that's always gonna be relevant. And then to sort

1834
01:35:58.509 --> 01:36:01.279
of slightly take the edge off the dark. Side

1835
01:36:01.279 --> 01:36:04.129
of that, I just think, you know, Schopenhauer's views

1836
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:08.549
on compassion. Are quite important because in times of

1837
01:36:08.549 --> 01:36:10.500
doom and gloom, when, when, when all the things

1838
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.189
that we're going through, not only kind of can't

1839
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:14.430
be taken out of us but are really at

1840
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:16.069
the forefront of our minds because we're seeing so

1841
01:36:16.069 --> 01:36:21.189
much inhumanity, and brutality and tragedy, um, the reminder

1842
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:24.410
that the solution to that is to, to try

1843
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:29.370
to be compassionate, to try to, Really be moved

1844
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:32.229
to act by the suffering of others, I think

1845
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:34.589
that's one of the, you know, one of the

1846
01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:38.509
things that we do need today, um, to see

1847
01:36:38.509 --> 01:36:42.029
that um, if we lose that then everything really

1848
01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.830
is lost, er if we didn't have compassion, I

1849
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:46.939
think, you know, one thing I start out the

1850
01:36:46.939 --> 01:36:48.299
book by saying is that if we didn't have

1851
01:36:48.299 --> 01:36:52.129
compassion, Schopenhauer's view would be not just pessimistic but,

1852
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:56.660
Intolerably nihilistic. It's only because we can hold each

1853
01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.939
other up with compassion that, that, that Schopenhauer's, you

1854
01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:03.220
know, I think Schopenhauer is, is, gives us a

1855
01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.120
view that we can, that we can live our

1856
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.680
lives with. So there's that, I think so it's

1857
01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.740
the, the message of kind of, Historical pessimism, also

1858
01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.410
transhistorical pessimism and compassion as a solution, or as

1859
01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.819
at least a way of er bearing with the

1860
01:37:18.819 --> 01:37:20.819
weight of that pessimism, that's what I think Trevor

1861
01:37:20.819 --> 01:37:22.359
Noah has to, to say today.

1862
01:37:24.009 --> 01:37:27.370
So the book is again Arthur Schopenhauer, The, The

1863
01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:30.810
Life and Thought of Philosophy's Greatest Pessimist, and I'm

1864
01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:33.089
leaving a link to it in the description of

1865
01:37:33.089 --> 01:37:36.970
the interview. And Doctor Bather Woods, apart from the

1866
01:37:36.970 --> 01:37:39.810
book, where can people find your work on the

1867
01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:40.089
internet?

1868
01:37:40.819 --> 01:37:43.580
Oh good, um, so um if you were to

1869
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.259
look on the Warwick website, you would find my

1870
01:37:46.259 --> 01:37:48.939
staff page which has some of my academic publications

1871
01:37:48.939 --> 01:37:51.290

1872
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.100
be open access, so, so do have a look

1873
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:56.020

1874
01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.459
of public formats like Eon magazine, Psyche magazine, these

1875
01:37:59.459 --> 01:38:02.080
are just free to access articles which talk about

1876
01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:04.419
