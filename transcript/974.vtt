00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.150
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.090
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.970
joined by Doctor Robert Welton. He is professor in

4
00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.449
the philosophy department at the University of Colorado. Colorado

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.075
Springs. His areas of special specialization are philos of

6
00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:20.545
mind, philosophy of neuroscience, and the work of Friedrich

7
00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:24.995
Nietzsche. And today we're talking about his latest book,

8
00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:29.725
Nietzsche's on the Genealogy of Morality, a guide. So

9
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.514
Dr Welton, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

10
00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:33.115
to everyone.

11
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.159
Thank you so much for Cara, for having me

12
00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.360
on.

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.139
So before we get into some of the specific

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.049
content of the book, I mean, I've already had

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.360
a ton of conversations on the show about Nietzsche

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.599
and his philosophy in many, many different aspects of

17
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.119
his philosophy. But today, we're focusing on a specific

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.150
book of his, on the genealogy of morality. What

19
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.340
goals did you have in mind with this sort

20
00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:06.440
of guide to his book?

21
00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:10.419
Well, as the title of the book suggests, it's

22
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.389
a, it's a mo modest set of goals. Um

23
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.319
I wanted to steer readers of the genealogy through

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.779
all of it and then to expand on some

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.870
of its most important and it's intricate and so,

26
00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:28.849
and even the perplexing facets of the book, I

27
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.839
also wanted to introduce uh readers to a number

28
00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.889
of the insights that have been developed uh by

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.199
other Nietzsche scholars in the last 40 or 50

30
00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.639
years. But more than that, um and fundamentally, I

31
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.819
wanted readers to come away from reading the book

32
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.870
uh wanting to read more Nietzsche uh because I

33
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:54.489
think Nietzsche is one of the great philosophers and

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.379
uh somebody whose writings uh bear readings and rereading

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.029
uh for many years.

36
00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:06.790
Mhm. And where would you place on the genealogy

37
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.550
of morality within Nietzsche's literary corpus? I mean, when

38
00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.279
exactly did he write it? And how do you

39
00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.339
look at how it relates to some of his

40
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.169
previous works and the works that came after,

41
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:29.289
you know, I think of Nietzsche's uh career as

42
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.199
um distinguishable into a couple of different phases. There's

43
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.320
the early phase when he was still a professor

44
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.509
at the University of Basel. And then for various

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.940
reasons, most of them related to his poor health.

46
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.259
He resigned from his position at Basel in 1877

47
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.380
or 1870 maybe 1878. And that left him uh

48
00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:01.000
without teaching responsibilities and he really began his philosophical

49
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.059
development at that point. Um The books that came

50
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.559
out immediately upon his resignation were uh human, all

51
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.850
too human and daybreak. And then he produced the

52
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.029
first four books of uh the gay science, also

53
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.509
known as Joyful inquiry. And then he wrote Zarathustra

54
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.600
over the course of three years and returning from

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.669
Zarathustra, he wrote Beyond Good and Evil, which was

56
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:34.429
published in 1886. During the winter of 1886 1887

57
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:40.410
he was immensely productive and he produced revised editions

58
00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.350
of the books that he'd already published. He wrote

59
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.550
new prefaces and Fords for them. And in the

60
00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.179
case of uh the Joyful Inquiry, he wrote an

61
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.820
entire new book for that publication. That book. The

62
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.580
fifth book is one of the clearest statements of

63
00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:06.800
uh Nietzsche's mature philosophy. But having completed these new

64
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.869
prefaces and forwards and the fifth book of uh

65
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.440
Joyful Inquiry, he started to get serious about what

66
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.178
had been for him percolating for at least two

67
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.570
years. Um This magnum opus was his great project.

68
00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:25.239
It was supposed to be called The Will To

69
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.910
Power. He later changed the title to re Evaluation

70
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.040
of all values. He had started sketching it out

71
00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:36.899
in 1885. But in the spring of 1887 he

72
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.529
started to commit himself almost full time for the

73
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.359
project. And then in a three week burst in

74
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.140
July while he was summering at Sils Maria in

75
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:52.290
Austria. He wrote virtually all of what he considered

76
00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:55.660
to be a preparatory study for the magnum opus

77
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.950
re rev revaluation of all values. And that was

78
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:03.589
on the genealogy of morality. It was published in

79
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.450
1887 later that year in November he then traveled

80
00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:15.609
to Turin in the late spring of 1888 to

81
00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:20.760
continue work on his revaluation of values project. His

82
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:24.779
health was good at this point. And while he

83
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.640
was in Turin, he was very productive, he was

84
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.700
pretty annoyed with what was happening in Germany at

85
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.730
the point at this point in time. And he

86
00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:43.829
was fearful that the death of, uh, Friedrich, the

87
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:48.570
third's, uh, Friedrich, the third would lead to hostilities

88
00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.700
um that were even more deadly than the frank

89
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:56.320
oppression war. So he diverted himself uh during his

90
00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:59.890
last summer in Sils Maria with a statement on

91
00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:04.059
Wagner and that was published in September of 1888.

92
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.510
As the case of Wagner, he then returned to

93
00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.350
turn from Sils Maria and he was determined to

94
00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:16.910
get going and complete the revaluation of values project.

95
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.559
He shaped some of the already written material from

96
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.640
that project into two shorter manuscripts. Twilight of the

97
00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.260
idols and the anti-christ. And those were published after

98
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.640
he went mad. Uh The twilight of the idols

99
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:37.910
was published in 1889 and anti-christ was published in

100
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.570
1894. And then he collapsed over the Christmas holidays

101
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:47.690
of 1888 1889. Uh The famous stories about this

102
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.970
are we well documented and he never did any

103
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.140
more productive work in some ways. Then on the

104
00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:03.130
genealogy of moral morality is a continuation of uh

105
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.410
his prelude to a future philosophy that he announced.

106
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.640
And beyond good and evil. And it's a kind

107
00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:15.519
of first installment in that future of philosophy. He

108
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:19.519
recognized that it wasn't the revaluation of values itself.

109
00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:24.070
It was a preparatory study for that. But um

110
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:27.869
it was important for him to get it out

111
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.420
of the way.

112
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:33.230
So let me ask you then before we get

113
00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:39.989
into the specific content of his book, this evaluation

114
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.390
project, what does it mean exactly? What does it

115
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:49.109
mean to evaluate all values for Nietzsche?

116
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:56.010
Be Nietzsche? Um The genealogy of morality is a

117
00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:00.440
kind of modest book. It presents a description of

118
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.040
how our moral evaluative practices have developed over the

119
00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:09.440
past 3000 years or so, but it doesn't critique

120
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:16.660
those practices. That's kind of a a misdirection. He

121
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.160
actually does engage in some critique even in genealogy

122
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.480
morality, but he announces that it is a description,

123
00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:30.690
a history, a psychosocial history of how we came

124
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.229
to believe the moral things that we believe and

125
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:36.359
how we came to have the moral evaluative practices

126
00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:39.549
that we have. And in so far as that's

127
00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:41.510
the case, it's only the first part of the

128
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.179
evaluation part. The other part of the evaluation project

129
00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:52.450
is to criticize, to critique moral evaluative practices. And

130
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.010
this part is far more significant than anything that's

131
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.559
offered in genealogy of morality. But because he collapsed

132
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.880
and never came back, he never finished the cri

133
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.119
the c the really critical part of moral evaluative

134
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:16.859
practices. This idea about criticizing moral evaluative practices goes

135
00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:19.900
back a long way in his, in his work,

136
00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.869
even while he was writing human and all too

137
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.909
human and da and Daybreak, he was already interested

138
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.070
in something larger than the origin of the value

139
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.330
of un egoistic moral values as he inherited those

140
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.179
kinds of un egoistic moral values from Schopenhauer. Um

141
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:44.510
He understood that the origins of morality had to

142
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.530
be understood in order to criticize whether they had

143
00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:55.729
any value or not. And he started that project

144
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.109
in Daybreak inhuman Hum. Hum Beyond good and evil,

145
00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:06.020
gay uh gay science, genealogy morality. He thought that

146
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.109
all kinds of studies were going to help to

147
00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:12.739
reveal the many facets of morality and would have

148
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.000
to contribute to our better knowledge of its value.

149
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.880
And so in genealogy morality, for example, he suggests

150
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.940
that all of the sciences have to prepare the

151
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.909
way for the future work of the philosopher where

152
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:30.309
the future work of the philosopher is solving the

153
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.390
problem of values and ha having to decide on

154
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.260
the rank order of values. Now, I'd also say

155
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.250
that the critique is uh a much more interesting

156
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.099
endeavor than providing the history of moral valuation. It

157
00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:53.150
was the goal of his revaluation book and he

158
00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:57.799
never really uh got off the ground with that

159
00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:01.239
part of the project very quick. Uh Very far

160
00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:07.650
having said that and having acknowledged that genealogy morality

161
00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:10.000
is really kind of a preliminary set of studies.

162
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.729
Um We have to accept that Nietzsche readily has

163
00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:21.119
in mind, a set of results from the critical

164
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.789
part as he engages in the historical analysis of

165
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:30.789
moral moral values in genealogy, because the standard um

166
00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.890
against which the value of all moral values and,

167
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.179
and ideals have to be measured is whether they

168
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.820
promote or hinder human flourishing. That is whether they're

169
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.599
symptoms of psychological and cultural sickness, decadence, nihilism or

170
00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:51.559
whether they're symptoms of psychological and cultural flourishing health

171
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.669
in anti decadence.

172
00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.070
Mhm. But the book is titled on the Genealogy

173
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.630
of Morality. What does genealogy mean in this particular

174
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.789
context? What is the genealogical method? Exactly?

175
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.500
Well, as I've already suggested, it has two components.

176
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.900
Uh The first is to describe how, in fact,

177
00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:22.780
we came to hold our beliefs and judgments about

178
00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:26.270
good and evil, good and bad and to identify

179
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.919
the mechanisms for enforcing those beliefs and those mechanisms

180
00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:34.669
are, are really quite diverse. The second part is

181
00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:38.109
to critically analyze the value that moral values have.

182
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.700
These two facets together comprise uh the revaluation project.

183
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.559
Most of genealogy is devoted to the first task,

184
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.849
but it has to be admitted, I think to

185
00:12:53.859 --> 00:12:56.719
anybody who's read the genealogy that towards the end

186
00:12:56.729 --> 00:13:01.400
of each of the essays, his descriptions, Nietzsche's descriptions

187
00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:05.460
of the mechanisms by which we came to believe

188
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.419
our moral beliefs and by which those moral beliefs

189
00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:14.130
are enforced, his descriptions become laden with evaluative judgments

190
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.989
about the topics he's describing. So the entirety of

191
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.440
genealogy lies within the scope of the evaluative context

192
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.219
fixed by the second task, which is the critique

193
00:13:26.229 --> 00:13:29.900
of moral values whose development is described in genealogy.

194
00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:34.419
I think we can also say that uh genealogy

195
00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:38.140
is an instance of a recognizable kind of intellectual

196
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:46.140
project. It presents historical psychological philological, anthropological and philosophical

197
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.140
evidence about the origins of our moral beliefs, our

198
00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:54.690
moral evaluative practices and our moral values themselves. And

199
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.500
given that morality has historically been understood as a

200
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.119
branch of intellectual inquiry that lays down the principles

201
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.739
of how we ought to live. Uh The gravity

202
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.400
of the project is pretty clear.

203
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.820
So addressing another topic, when it comes to the

204
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.789
methodology that he applies in the book, this is

205
00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:19.500
something that I've already talked about on the show

206
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.130
with some other Nietzsche scholars. But he, he has

207
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.659
a sort of commitment to philosophical naturalism, right? So

208
00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:34.210
what does naturalism mean in this context? I I

209
00:14:34.219 --> 00:14:37.369
need to ask you that because nowadays in the

210
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.330
sort of intellectual slash cultural environment that is more

211
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.739
dominant in our society, we tend to associate naturalism

212
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.880
with science, the sciences, the scientific method or methods

213
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.450
and not so much with philosophy. So in the

214
00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:00.890
context of Nietzsche's philosophical approach, what does naturalism entail?

215
00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:05.960
I'd say it entails at least the following. It

216
00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:09.830
also entails, I think much more. I think first

217
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.830
naturalism is a view about what exists, mm It's

218
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.059
an ontological claim. Reality is exhausted by what exists

219
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.880
in nature. But that begs the question, what's nature

220
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.760
and the term nature refers, I think in Nietzsche

221
00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:34.419
to the set of every causally efficacious phenomena, the

222
00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:38.169
set of all causally efficacious phenomena, whether those phenomena

223
00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:41.280
be objects or properties or processes or states or

224
00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:46.640
events or systems structures, whatever they are so long

225
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.380
as they're found in the spatial temporal world. And

226
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.960
so long as they're studied by the natural sciences,

227
00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:55.960
the life sciences, the social Sciences, the Formal sciences.

228
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.929
Um And so long as it also includes uh

229
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:08.229
creative products of culture, these are objects are phenomenal

230
00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:14.489
within the domain of a naturalistic philosophy. Second, I

231
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.099
think naturalism is also a view about what we

232
00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:21.799
can know. It's the epistemological claim that we can

233
00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:25.789
have knowledge only of what exists in nature in

234
00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.020
this rich complicated way that I've just tried to

235
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:35.960
unpack above. And third, I think that naturalism is

236
00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:39.020
a view about how we acquire knowledge. So it

237
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.210
can also be a kind of methodological claim that

238
00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:45.619
the cognitive tools, the procedures and the routines by

239
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.909
which we gain our knowledge are continuous in some

240
00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:55.369
sense between philosophy and empirical science. So that's a

241
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.929
kind of basic understanding of uh naturalism in nature.

242
00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:03.150
I think this is consistent with some of the

243
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.209
uh proposals for naturalism that other Nietzsche scholars have

244
00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:11.890
made. Uh And this would include people like Ricardi

245
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.140
and uh Katsas Katzif Fanis and lighter and so

246
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.880
forth. So I think it's consistent with their views

247
00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:28.650
I'm also impressed by uh Richard Shack's idea that

248
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.729
naturalism has to be more than this because naturalism

249
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.329
can be understood to be kind of a reductionist

250
00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:45.800
point of view. And for Shaq Nietzsche's naturalism is

251
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:52.699
not reductive for Shat uh Nietzsche's naturalism also has

252
00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:57.420
to include the unusual facet of human beings that

253
00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.540
we are no longer merely animal. We are a

254
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.380
deeply cultural and cultured species. And so uh a

255
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.569
a more robust form of naturalism cannot be in

256
00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:16.430
Shaq's terms, scientic cannot privileged science over all other

257
00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:20.020
kinds of in inquiry into how we are the

258
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.410
way we are or what we can do. We

259
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.109
are a strange species and this picks up on

260
00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:31.199
all of those facets of Nietzsche's work that emphasizes

261
00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:34.530
just how peculiar we really are. Nietzsche calls us

262
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.119
the sickly species. He calls us the most uncanny

263
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.959
species. We, he calls us the most fragile species.

264
00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:47.060
And that's because our way of life, although it

265
00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:51.770
is grounded in our natural and animal existence is

266
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.709
much more than that as well. And what is

267
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:59.660
more than that has emerged from but can no

268
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.349
longer be reduced to these animal needs. And so

269
00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:08.469
a naturalism for shacked has to take these additional

270
00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:12.569
facets into account. And that entails that we no

271
00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:17.189
longer think that um naturalism is simply a view

272
00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:21.390
that favors science above everything else. We must also

273
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.630
recognize the important contributions of the visual arts, the

274
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.630
musical arts, the literary arts, and all of the

275
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.459
other creative activity that we engage in. And we

276
00:19:36.469 --> 00:19:39.880
must also accept that we are a highly technological

277
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.199
species. We surround ourselves with do Gws and fast

278
00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:48.109
and uh and gadgets and Nietzsche is interested in

279
00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:53.380
that as well. But what follows from even the

280
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:59.089
basic view of naturalism is that there can't be

281
00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:07.380
any causally efficacious non spatial temporal objects. There can't

282
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.910
be things that exist outside of space and time.

283
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.949
So there are no transcendent objects. And since knowledge

284
00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:19.150
is exhausted by what we know of what exists

285
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.030
in nature, there can't be any knowledge of non

286
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:27.760
spatial temporal objects or properties either. And since philosophy

287
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.449
and the empirical sciences work together uh to develop

288
00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:35.800
knowledge of the natural world by using their various

289
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.319
distinctive methods, there can't be any means of gaining

290
00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:43.930
knowledge of nature that transcends the methods. And so

291
00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:50.719
the philos so philosophy's long insistence that there is

292
00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:55.989
a real world beyond the world of perception immediately

293
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.699
falls the ground. The claim that there is anything

294
00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:04.660
beyond what is given in sensory perception and our

295
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.939
experience, our p our empirical experience has to go

296
00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:16.349
by the boards that is kind of the basis

297
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.849
for his rejection of all of the transcendental nonsense

298
00:21:22.109 --> 00:21:27.890
that philosophers have um taken themselves to be spokespersons

299
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.390
for.

300
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.180
So with that uh last bit in mind, let

301
00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:39.349
me ask you then in undertaking this project, this

302
00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:44.780
project about re evaluating or evaluating all moral values

303
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.310
in on the genealogy of morality. Um IN what

304
00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:57.500
ways would Nietzsche criticize prior philosophers, theologians and religious

305
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:02.010
advocates. When it came to their approach to moral

306
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.010
psychology?

307
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:09.670
There is too much to say as a response

308
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.569
to your question, then I can possibly do justice

309
00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:20.280
to. In this interview. I will say the following.

310
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.670
If you look at his criticisms of philosophical theological

311
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:35.209
and religious moral psychology, you can categorize his criticisms

312
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.569
using a conceptual scheme that he introduces himself in

313
00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:44.719
twilight of the idols. Twilight of the idols is

314
00:22:44.729 --> 00:22:47.030
one of the very last manuscripts that he prepared

315
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.989
for uh prepared for before collapsing, prepared for publication.

316
00:22:54.109 --> 00:23:01.209
And in this, he distills his philosophical thinking into

317
00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:05.849
a series of very short aphorisms. And one of

318
00:23:05.859 --> 00:23:09.959
them is sets of a versions. And one of

319
00:23:09.969 --> 00:23:14.050
these is his summary statement of four errors that

320
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.229
are common to all philosophers and theologians and religious

321
00:23:17.239 --> 00:23:21.729
advocates. And these are errors that are the basis

322
00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:26.319
for many of his criticisms of theological and religious

323
00:23:26.329 --> 00:23:31.819
and philosophical moral psychology. The first one is to

324
00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:38.819
confuse cause and consequence. When philosophers and religious advocates

325
00:23:39.699 --> 00:23:45.099
confuse cause and consequence, they identify some event or

326
00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:48.359
state as causing another Avenger state. But in fact,

327
00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:52.270
the latter causes the former. He thinks that this

328
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.189
mistake is rampant in religion and religious psychology, moral

329
00:23:57.199 --> 00:24:04.489
psychology. They argue for example, that virtue has happiness

330
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.709
as its consequence. But Nietzsche's counter is that happiness

331
00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:12.709
has virtue as its consequence. And he thinks that

332
00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:17.170
this what we, he, he thinks that this uh

333
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:23.750
reversal of causation is characteristic of the topsy turvy,

334
00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:27.130
moral psychology that you find in religion and theology

335
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:33.160
and philosophy. The second error that he identifies is

336
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:39.119
that philosophers and religious advocates routinely posit false causes.

337
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.400
They identify some event or state as causing another

338
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.189
advent or state when in fact, the former doesn't

339
00:24:46.199 --> 00:24:50.689
cause the latter at all. And so when we

340
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:54.130
think about this one, this one is particularly pernicious

341
00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:01.540
and is particularly widespread. He I quickly identifies three

342
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:08.560
false causes, willing conscious thoughts and the subject, the

343
00:25:08.569 --> 00:25:13.250
i the unified philosophical subject. These are all constituent

344
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:19.609
elements of philosophical and theological, moral psychology. And Nietzsche

345
00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:23.010
thinks that all three of them simply are non

346
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.890
existent. We think that the subject of conscious thought,

347
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.390
the philosophical subject I causes our thoughts. We think

348
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.420
that conscious thoughts cause acts of a willing faculty

349
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.670
and we think that acts of a willing faculty

350
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.130
cause various events inside and outside of us. But

351
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.660
all three of them are fictions. According to Nietzsche.

352
00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:53.400
The third error that philosophers and theologians make is

353
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:59.390
introducing imaginary causes. They identify some event or state

354
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.310
that causes another event or state when in fact

355
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:06.430
the identified uh event or state is completely fictional.

356
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.949
And here, Nietzsche has a kind of general thought

357
00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:17.439
in mind. I think we are experts at manufacturing

358
00:26:17.449 --> 00:26:24.280
expla uh explanations and theologians and philosophers um are

359
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.930
no different. We think we're all prone to a

360
00:26:27.939 --> 00:26:33.099
very familiar pattern of thinking. We experience something unexpected,

361
00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:36.180
something new and we wanna know what caused it.

362
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.989
And so to relieve the cognitive dissonance, the cognitive

363
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.349
confusion and the psychological anxiety that attends our ignorance.

364
00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:47.420
We try to explain the phenomenon by fitting it

365
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.939
into an already existing but usually crude web of

366
00:26:51.949 --> 00:26:56.910
beliefs and knowledge. And he says in this section

367
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.030
of twilight that we're not particularly uh fussy about

368
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.920
easing our, So our anxiety, as long as we

369
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.959
ease our anxiety and cognitive distance, that will be

370
00:27:08.969 --> 00:27:12.040
satisfactory. And so we usually latch on to the

371
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.550
very first idea uh that comes to us, but

372
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.699
given our own background, that will be that we

373
00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:25.369
will rely on what is familiar to us. So

374
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.180
as he points out in the twilight, when the

375
00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:32.089
bankers um confronted with something new, he immediately thinks

376
00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:36.790
of business and the Christian thinks of sin, these

377
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.329
kinds of explanations while they're uh sometimes serviceable for

378
00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:46.500
easing dissonance and confusion, ignore the fact that what

379
00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.040
we're most familiar with and what we find most

380
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.939
plausible are really good measures for fixing the actual

381
00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:57.270
causes of the phenomenon. And so that's the third

382
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.920
error. And then the final error is um he

383
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.560
uh he, he notes that free will in particular,

384
00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:12.609
is a uh separable and specific kind of error.

385
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.869
Philosophers and religious advocates try to routinely act uh

386
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.989
identify acts as being produced by free will as

387
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.709
an inventor or state that's freely chosen by a

388
00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:31.540
subject but free will is a fiction and cannot

389
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.989
freely choose any act at all. So that's the

390
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.829
fourth error. These four errors I think lie at

391
00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:46.349
the lie in the background of his criticisms of

392
00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:52.300
theological, philosophical and religious moral psychology. There are theoretical

393
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.599
objections and he fills in that theoretical uh that

394
00:28:56.609 --> 00:29:00.969
that conceptual framework with a lot of detail throughout

395
00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:02.569
genealogy of morality.

396
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.579
So in the book, there are three big essays

397
00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:13.479
and the first one you identify as being about

398
00:29:13.489 --> 00:29:19.010
the impact of Rehema on Christian moral evaluation. So

399
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.229
my first question about that would be why is

400
00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:26.310
it that apparently Nietzsche sets out to tackle the

401
00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:31.500
genealogy of morality but then shifts to Christianity.

402
00:29:32.569 --> 00:29:38.699
Um The answer here is pretty straightforward morality and

403
00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:44.939
Christianity overlap so much for nature that any analysis

404
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:48.250
of the origins and the development of one of

405
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.589
them has to also be an analysis of the

406
00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:55.380
origins and development of the other of them. So

407
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.439
when we look into the history, psychology, etymology of

408
00:29:59.449 --> 00:30:02.260
the use of the language in our talk about

409
00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:06.489
good and evil, which is of course, the genealogy

410
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.689
of morality to which we all as Europeans adhere.

411
00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:14.510
He thinks we must also at the same time

412
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.439
investigate the history, psychology and etymology of the language

413
00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:22.310
they use in Christianity, which is the dominant European

414
00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:30.530
religion. So there is no way to understand the

415
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.849
origins and development of our moral practices, our moral

416
00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:39.579
value to practices without understanding the origins and development

417
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:45.119
of Christianity in particular, but religion in general.

418
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.930
So in his view, it is from Christianity, at

419
00:30:50.939 --> 00:30:58.880
least particularly in Europe that uh terms like good,

420
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.060
bad and evil stem from, right.

421
00:31:05.069 --> 00:31:08.479
I would say no, that's not where they stem

422
00:31:08.489 --> 00:31:11.430
from. They have a prehistory to the their history

423
00:31:11.439 --> 00:31:19.010
within Christianity, within the judeo-christian um religious um uh

424
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:33.050
tradition. Here we engage Nietzsche's philological past. He thinks

425
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.790
that he has discovered what he calls a conceptual

426
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.599
transformation in the ways that terms that were originally

427
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:45.189
used by a class of individuals. He calls the

428
00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:50.329
masters to describe their social, their economic and their

429
00:31:50.339 --> 00:31:59.300
political superiority came to characterize what's noble. He thinks

430
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.099
that there's a similar conceptual transformation that governs how

431
00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:07.380
descriptive terms that were once reviewed, re reserved for

432
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:12.520
the lower classes, the rabble, the herd, parallel descriptive

433
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.290
terms for what is being base and vulgar in

434
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:25.479
an individual. This conceptual transformation, three dates. Uh THE

435
00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:29.119
emergence of Christianity and emergence, the the emergence of

436
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:33.439
Christianity takes these terms that were already in use

437
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:39.430
on board as it developed as a religious and

438
00:32:39.439 --> 00:32:47.770
as a moral and a philosophical tradition. So, um

439
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.630
I'm I'm sure that your listeners are familiar with

440
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.439
the idea that Nietzsche's makes a distinction between the

441
00:32:58.449 --> 00:33:00.699
difference between good and bad on the one hand,

442
00:33:00.709 --> 00:33:04.640
and good and evil on the other hand, but

443
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:09.869
he broadens it well beyond German and other European

444
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.670
languages and traces these roots back to Sanskrit and

445
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.739
Ancient Greek and Latin. So, for example, he talks

446
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:24.969
about the term from Sanskrit uh called AA, which

447
00:33:24.979 --> 00:33:28.349
comes from, you know, about 1000 before the common

448
00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:32.030
era or 1000 years before the common era. It

449
00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.229
refers to wealthy ownership and the wellborn classes and

450
00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:40.319
to the character trait of being noble and privileged.

451
00:33:41.449 --> 00:33:44.699
Now, this term is of course the root of

452
00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:51.439
Aryan, aryan. But it's also a term that served

453
00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:55.900
as a self designated anonym for people living then.

454
00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.079
And what is now Northwestern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and

455
00:34:00.089 --> 00:34:02.930
Iran. In fact, it's the basis of the term

456
00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:08.560
Iran and Iranian. So it's not just that there

457
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:15.569
is German uh etymological evidence about good and bad

458
00:34:15.579 --> 00:34:19.668
and good and evil. It is a common feature

459
00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:24.069
of ancient languages and so on the basis of

460
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.719
this, Nietzsche draws a a generalization in all these

461
00:34:29.728 --> 00:34:35.739
ancient languages. The primordial evaluative terms were self reflexive

462
00:34:35.748 --> 00:34:40.688
designations by members of a master class of aristocrats

463
00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:47.830
and warriors. And those self reflexive designations subsequently underwent

464
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.580
a conceptual transformation to become self reflective descriptions of

465
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.879
their individual character traits. So they simply started by

466
00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:05.060
identifying themselves as the good as the privileged and

467
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.800
then they unpacked that later in this conceptual transformation

468
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.250
by identifying the individual character traits they had in

469
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:19.320
virtue of which they were good. Now, we have

470
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.139
to remember that the highest cla cast in an

471
00:35:22.149 --> 00:35:26.959
ancient society was not always the nightly aristocratic caste

472
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.659
it probably was the norm. But in some ancient

473
00:35:30.669 --> 00:35:36.439
societies, priests, aristocrats and warriors coexisted uh side by

474
00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:40.540
side. In some, they continuously fought with one another.

475
00:35:41.209 --> 00:35:44.469
And in some the priests, the clergy held the

476
00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:49.489
highest cast, whatever their relations to the warriors and

477
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.179
aristocrats may have been like the clergy. However, was

478
00:35:53.189 --> 00:36:00.239
always different in crucial ways. The nightly aristocratic mode

479
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:05.500
of evaluations painfully simple and based on nothing more

480
00:36:05.649 --> 00:36:10.739
sophisticated than pronouncing that they were good. And then

481
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.260
as an afterthought, they decreed that the rabble the

482
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:23.209
herd were base, they were bad, the clergy, although

483
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:27.439
they were also members of the nobility emphasize something

484
00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:33.540
different. They emphasized purity and cleanliness. And so their

485
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.040
contrast was between the pure and the clean on

486
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.479
the one hand and the impure and dirty. On

487
00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:43.899
the other hand. Now, in the old master slave

488
00:36:43.909 --> 00:36:49.379
societies, the distinction between good and bad and between

489
00:36:49.389 --> 00:36:55.409
pure and impure was incredibly crude. Uh Nietzsche says

490
00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:58.340
at one point in genealogy that it was coarse,

491
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:03.879
superficial, narrow and un symbolic to a degree that

492
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:09.679
we can scarcely imagine. For example, the term pure

493
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:16.590
originally referred only to those sanitary few who wash

494
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.270
themselves regularly, who refrain from eating certain kinds of

495
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.139
food and who who refrained from engaging in sex

496
00:37:24.149 --> 00:37:29.909
with commoners? That's how direct and un symbolic purity

497
00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:30.679
really was.

498
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.909
So, could you tell us now about the phenomenon

499
00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:42.870
of Reema? Where is it? And does it play

500
00:37:42.879 --> 00:37:46.649
a role in the slave revolt in morality.

501
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:54.919
It does. Um If I may, I'm gonna prepare

502
00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.149
to answer your question by stepping back and unpacking

503
00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:06.350
a little bit about what master slave Miraval actually

504
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.199
looks like. And then start talking about Raison Tal.

505
00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:14.979
Mhm. The great contrast between the masters and the

506
00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:22.469
slaves is a historical con contrast. The masters had

507
00:38:23.389 --> 00:38:29.699
certain socio-economic properties, they had certain physiological properties, they

508
00:38:29.709 --> 00:38:36.449
had certain psychological properties and those properties. The socio-economic

509
00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:40.149
ones, the physiological ones and the psychological ones were

510
00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:46.050
contrasted with the same kind of socio-economic properties, physiological

511
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:51.669
properties and psychological properties of the slaves. So in

512
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:57.179
the book, um I identify a set of these

513
00:38:57.189 --> 00:39:01.139
properties and their contrasts. If you think about the

514
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:06.540
socio-economic dimensions, the masses were aristocratic and noble. The

515
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.169
slaves were lower class, they were heard they were

516
00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:16.469
commoners. The masters were typically knightly and warriors and

517
00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:20.629
the slaves were pacifists. The masters were wealthy, they

518
00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.520
were prosperous. They were well born, the slaves were

519
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.649
poor, they were unfortunate. They were ill born, the

520
00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:32.060
masses were privileged, the slaves were deprived, they were

521
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.979
beasts of burden. The masters dominated and oppressed others.

522
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.149
The slaves were oppressed and were ill treated by

523
00:39:41.159 --> 00:39:45.929
the masters. The masters were superior. The slaves were

524
00:39:45.939 --> 00:39:51.629
mediocre physiologically, the masters were healthy. The slaves were

525
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.840
sick and diseased. The masters were energetic and vital.

526
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.800
The slaves were weary, exhausted and lethargic. The master

527
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:07.050
were powerful and potent. The slaves were powerless and

528
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:13.070
impotent. The masters were active. The slaves were reactive

529
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.570
psychologically, the masters were happy, the slaves were unhappy.

530
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:26.899
The masters were creative. The slaves were reactive. The

531
00:40:26.909 --> 00:40:30.699
master said yes to things and life. The slave

532
00:40:30.709 --> 00:40:35.110
said no to things and life. The masters were

533
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.050
adventurous. The slaves were timid and submissive. These kinds

534
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.790
of contrasts and there are lots of them drawn

535
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:51.179
in genealogy. Morality are essential for understanding what re

536
00:40:51.709 --> 00:40:54.320
resentment is and why it's so important for Nietzsche

537
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:08.280
on to mom was Nietzsche thinks already well in

538
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:13.030
place before the slave revolt and r morality. He

539
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.300
even acknowledges in genealogy that the old masters experienced

540
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:22.649
it as well. He's also, he also insists that

541
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.100
uh resent him. Ma is not determined solely by

542
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:30.689
one social class. So it's not a reaction uh

543
00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:36.040
whose content consists solely in countering noble values. Renton

544
00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:41.219
is instead a kind of instinctive reaction. He thinks

545
00:41:41.229 --> 00:41:43.929
it's found in every human being and at all

546
00:41:43.939 --> 00:41:48.669
times in history, it occurs as naturally as a

547
00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:54.060
kind of involuntary and largely unalterable set of physiological

548
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:58.580
and psychological responses to certain kinds of input to

549
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:03.560
our psychology and its effective qualities. And by that,

550
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.600
I mean, it's phenomenological characters and the various emotions

551
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:13.419
that it causes. These two are largely involuntary and

552
00:42:13.429 --> 00:42:17.340
unalterable across individuals when prompted by a particular set

553
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:23.770
of inputs as it's found in the slaves. And

554
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.659
the priests, Renton is the focus of most of

555
00:42:27.669 --> 00:42:32.530
Nietzsche's attention because as found in the slaves and

556
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.110
the priests it reveals something that is familiar to

557
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.860
most of us moderns, the kind of powerlessness and

558
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:45.820
poverty and ill health, unprotected social standing and the

559
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:50.679
kinds of suffering they cause together entailed that the

560
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.530
slaves couldn't engage in direct retaliation against insult and

561
00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.199
injury without immediate risk of losing either their life

562
00:42:59.879 --> 00:43:05.000
or one of their limbs or whatever social status

563
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.600
they had meager as might have been for them,

564
00:43:11.389 --> 00:43:16.110
direct response to an insult was barred entirely. And

565
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.770
so they had to settle for a kind of

566
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.229
indirect retaliation. They had to compensate for the impossibility

567
00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:27.100
of direct revenge with what Nietzsche calls imaginary revenge.

568
00:43:28.709 --> 00:43:34.379
And that is what's characteristic of re anti. If

569
00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:40.530
you think about resulting as Nietzsche presents it, it

570
00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:50.780
is an entire physio psychological sociological economic complex. It's

571
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:56.840
a huge cauldron that takes inputs, conjoins those inputs

572
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:01.320
with pre-existing beliefs, desires, and hopes and spits out

573
00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:06.689
particular kinds of other emotions, other actions and so

574
00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:11.790
forth. And at the root, it's a kind of

575
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:18.379
revenge. But if you think about the kinds of

576
00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:22.719
revenge that we have to discuss here, it's a

577
00:44:22.729 --> 00:44:29.189
unique kind of revenge. We can, if somebody bumps

578
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:32.949
us in the subway with their elbow, we will

579
00:44:32.959 --> 00:44:37.330
typically move their arm out of the way. That's

580
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.669
not ri antimo, even if it is a kind

581
00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:44.629
of revenge, it's self protection. Um And we might

582
00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:48.649
even I have some kind of defensive counter blow,

583
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:54.580
but the desire to cause suffering in others is

584
00:44:54.590 --> 00:45:01.219
not there in regent, the desire to cause suffering

585
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:07.070
is there. And so resentment recruits other beliefs in

586
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.209
effective states so that we can displace or transfer

587
00:45:11.219 --> 00:45:16.050
our suffering onto another a culprit. And that culprit

588
00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.179
is held causally responsible for our suffering. And we

589
00:45:20.189 --> 00:45:24.550
thereby as Nietzsche puts it narcotize or anesthetize our

590
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:30.879
own suffering, that kind of anesthetizing transference of suffering

591
00:45:30.889 --> 00:45:33.669
on to another person who we hold causally responsible

592
00:45:33.679 --> 00:45:37.080
for our own suffering is typical of rezoning. All

593
00:45:39.409 --> 00:45:43.149
it effectively redirects the sufferer away from the true

594
00:45:43.159 --> 00:45:47.489
reason for pain and on to some other cause

595
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:52.620
for it once fed into the cauldron of uh

596
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.080
resentment, the inputs mix with all kinds of other

597
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:02.199
effects, all kinds of other emotions, drives desires, beliefs

598
00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:07.250
about oneself and one others and, and others. It

599
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.790
becomes unlike the masters who resolve their rezoning law

600
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:19.770
quickly and with violent acts of physical behavior, it

601
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.620
becomes a stew, it continues to churn and it

602
00:46:25.629 --> 00:46:29.360
adds other ingredients all the time. Make that makes

603
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:37.439
it um ruminative, provocative, poisonous, creative, and imaginative.

604
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.659
So, moving on to another topic and still in

605
00:46:44.729 --> 00:46:49.790
regards to the first essay of the book, what

606
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:56.260
role does uh Nietzsche's psychology of drives and effects

607
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.550
play in the genealogy of morality?

608
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.899
Uh Ricardo, I'm afraid that I can't really talk

609
00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:12.219
a whole lot about this because this is such

610
00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:15.000
a core part of the genealogy and it's so

611
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:20.429
poorly discussed in the genealogy. It's, it's a remarkable

612
00:47:20.439 --> 00:47:24.260
facet of the genealogy that he presupposes this complex

613
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.489
drive and affect moral psychology and almost never talks

614
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:32.360
about it. So at least in the genealogy, but

615
00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.800
II, I will say uh a couple of things,

616
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:44.209
OK. For Nietzsche, the subject, the eye, the ego

617
00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:49.179
is fused with action. A strong person is somebody

618
00:47:49.189 --> 00:47:55.389
whose actions confront difficult conditions directly. A weak person

619
00:47:55.399 --> 00:47:59.600
is someone who acts to avoid challenging conditions or

620
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.889
who quickly capitulates to them or dissembles about them

621
00:48:04.159 --> 00:48:10.429
or dithers about them or procrastinates about them. These

622
00:48:10.439 --> 00:48:16.219
kinds of subjectivity and agency were embodied in the

623
00:48:16.229 --> 00:48:21.100
old masters. They were healthy, they affirmed life, they

624
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.179
were powerful, they were energetic, they were cheerful, they

625
00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:29.850
were spontaneous and they were all of those things

626
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.889
simply because that's how they acted day in and

627
00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:36.879
day out. They rarely reflected on whether they exercise

628
00:48:36.889 --> 00:48:41.709
free will. They've rarely reflected on much of anything

629
00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:45.389
at all. And so they didn't have time or

630
00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:52.979
psychological space for Rizzoni man to take hold. It

631
00:48:52.989 --> 00:49:02.929
wasn't because they were um more complicated psychologically than

632
00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:07.209
anybody else and it exercised free will to overcome

633
00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:13.600
resentment. It was because they didn't care and they

634
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:19.620
didn't remember insults long enough for those insults to

635
00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:24.870
take hold in their own psychology and demand deferred

636
00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:31.429
retribution. They were direct immediate in her moral psychology.

637
00:49:31.439 --> 00:49:36.580
On the other hand, the subject comes untethered from

638
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:41.360
its action. And so Nietzsche describes this in uh

639
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:46.860
essay one section 13 as the indifferent substratum behind

640
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.959
the person who has the freedom to manifest strength

641
00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:57.560
or weakness. And this indifferent substratum is the soul,

642
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:03.639
the philosophical subject. Assuming that there is a kind

643
00:50:03.649 --> 00:50:11.080
of detached soul that's outfitted with free will to

644
00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.320
choose to act in numerous ways, different ways in

645
00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:21.250
every circumstance that the person engages, licenses hurt morality

646
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:24.810
to direct attention away from actions and towards that

647
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:30.679
soul, its choices and its intentions. So this gives

648
00:50:30.689 --> 00:50:34.610
herd animals the impression that their weakness is actually

649
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.989
a kind of expression of their strength. They're strong

650
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.429
enough to choose submission to others, to choose to

651
00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:44.810
turn the other cheek, to choose to obey God's

652
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:51.209
mandates. Nietzsche tries to stamp out every remaining spark

653
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.300
of the pretension. Um THAT any component of our

654
00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:04.419
psychological economy originates from something nonna. He likewise tries

655
00:51:04.429 --> 00:51:08.679
to replace all of these non natural components with

656
00:51:08.689 --> 00:51:14.860
natural psychological components. And that's the basis of his

657
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:21.729
drive affect psychology. His argument isn't just that natural

658
00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:27.830
drives and affects coexist with other non natal psychological

659
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.770
components like conscious thought, logical and rational abilities or

660
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:38.989
moral and religious injunctions. Nietzsche's ambition is much stronger.

661
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.860
He tries to understand all of the complexities of

662
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:46.209
human behavior and psychology by using these two categories,

663
00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:52.139
drives and affects. He also adds memory, sensory perception

664
00:51:52.149 --> 00:51:56.840
and taro exception and conscious thinking. These are either

665
00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:01.649
readily applicable to other organisms or they are developments

666
00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:05.870
for what's already readily applicable to other organisms. So

667
00:52:05.879 --> 00:52:08.610
that's kind of the basis of his drive affect

668
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:14.320
psychology. It's his best attempt to provide a conceptual

669
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:19.500
framework for the fundamental entities in the domain of

670
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.979
our psyche. And as a result, it has to

671
00:52:22.989 --> 00:52:26.330
do away with all of the supernatural nonsense and

672
00:52:27.429 --> 00:52:33.280
puffery of philosophy and religion. I think if you

673
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:39.219
ask me, what is a drive I've argued for

674
00:52:39.229 --> 00:52:41.979
many years and so have others that it's a

675
00:52:41.989 --> 00:52:48.629
kind of long standing, relatively stable and for most

676
00:52:48.639 --> 00:52:55.459
of them subconscious activating or impelling or invert urging,

677
00:52:55.979 --> 00:53:00.030
it's a kind of disposition which if you feed

678
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:04.149
it certain prompts reliably and regularly tends to result

679
00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:09.169
in certain behaviors of specific kinds that satiate the

680
00:53:09.179 --> 00:53:12.649
props. So that's in, in general, what I think

681
00:53:12.659 --> 00:53:17.239
a drive is, they are internal to us and

682
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:20.270
they're embodied in us, but not just us. Any

683
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.060
organism that's alive is comprised of drives psychologically as

684
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:30.360
well. They're dynamically coupled with other sub organ organism

685
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:35.909
drives and with other sub organism, physiological and psychological

686
00:53:35.919 --> 00:53:42.820
states. Um They're not modular in photo sense. They

687
00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:46.159
don't just turn away at a particular task. They

688
00:53:46.169 --> 00:53:49.620
are closely coupled with all kinds of things inside

689
00:53:49.629 --> 00:53:54.189
us. Since they causally uh couple with other drives

690
00:53:54.199 --> 00:53:58.419
of states and are not modular, they're never encapsulated,

691
00:53:59.709 --> 00:54:03.760
they're never isolated from other drives and affects. And

692
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:08.280
since we as organisms inhabit a larger environment that's

693
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:12.580
made up of or other organisms, the sub organismic

694
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:17.260
drives typically couple with and embed themselves in those

695
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:22.260
extra organism environments. So the overall picture you get

696
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:27.709
in Nietzsche is of this unbelievably energetic, incessantly stimulating

697
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:33.639
highly interactive and ever changing uh psyche not only

698
00:54:33.649 --> 00:54:37.979
between drives within organisms, but also between organisms and

699
00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:42.149
their environment and between organisms and other organisms.

700
00:54:45.729 --> 00:54:50.669
So getting now into the essay number two of

701
00:54:50.679 --> 00:54:54.330
the genealogy of morality. In your book, you presented

702
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.810
as being about the moral psychology of conscience and

703
00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.139
uh conscience and guilt. But to pave the way

704
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:05.510
into talking about conscience and guilt, let me ask

705
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.610
you first, what is the morality of custom and

706
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.590
what are its psychological implications or consequences?

707
00:55:14.399 --> 00:55:18.340
Nietzsche mentions in genealogy but does not really discuss

708
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:23.689
the importance of customs and the morality of custom

709
00:55:23.699 --> 00:55:28.399
and the psychology of customs. He does discuss these

710
00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:33.580
issues in daybreak. And so when in the book,

711
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.820
I talk about these things, I talk about what

712
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:40.290
Nietzsche says in Daybreak about customs. He thinks that

713
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:47.459
in general customs traditions, whether they be economic, cultural

714
00:55:47.469 --> 00:55:54.580
or religious helped to install memory, emotional regulation, attention

715
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.729
control, self awareness and a feeling of obligation to

716
00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:05.379
the community. And these things occurred well before uh

717
00:56:05.389 --> 00:56:13.550
Christianity, these are, these are uh psychological phenomena that

718
00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:22.360
probably go back 4 to 8000 years as these

719
00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:27.159
communities first became to first came to be distilled

720
00:56:27.169 --> 00:56:31.879
out of roving bands of nomads. So thousands of

721
00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:34.979
years before the slave revolt and morality even began

722
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.139
this primitive morality of custom, established a bunch of

723
00:56:40.149 --> 00:56:49.340
conventions that distinguished acceptable behavior from unacceptable behavior, distinguished

724
00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:56.800
it from atypical behavior and captain those who were

725
00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:01.219
subject to it, this constant, he calls it a

726
00:57:01.229 --> 00:57:10.500
perpetual compulsion to practice customs from an embodied embedded

727
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:15.600
perspective of the mind. This is a particularly interesting

728
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:20.020
facet of Nietzsche's genealogy because it focuses on the

729
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:27.959
ritualized behavior of customs and traditions. He claims that

730
00:57:27.969 --> 00:57:31.580
it infiltrated the this practice of custom and tradition

731
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:38.929
infiltrated education, marriage, farming, war, speech, health care and

732
00:57:38.939 --> 00:57:42.790
the interactions with one another. And the gods. What

733
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:48.300
is crucial in all of this psychology of custom

734
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:53.820
and tradition is that customs are fundamentally superfluous stipulations

735
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.010
as he puts it, you are to engage in

736
00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:03.439
this particular kind of physical behavior because we say

737
00:58:03.449 --> 00:58:09.020
so. And because that is the custom fundamentally, the

738
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:15.550
particular motor behaviors r trivial and uninteresting, but they

739
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.760
become laden with meaning and significance. The frequent rehearsal

740
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:27.020
of these customs and habits hardened and helped cultivate

741
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.820
memory. They helped to cultivate emotional regulation, they help

742
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:35.909
to cultivate attention control because we had to focus

743
00:58:35.919 --> 00:58:39.689
endogenously, we had to focus on the custom in

744
00:58:39.699 --> 00:58:42.800
front of us. And so we had to regulate

745
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.510
our emotions long enough to be able to engage

746
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.229
in that endogenous attention control control more than that

747
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:55.610
customs and traditions co inculcated a sense of obligation

748
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.840
to the larger collective. It was because we engaged

749
00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:01.679
in these customs and traditions that we were members

750
00:59:01.689 --> 00:59:06.719
of this larger collective. Nietzsche is convinced that we

751
00:59:06.729 --> 00:59:14.129
cannot comprehend how inescapable, this compulsory dimension of morality

752
00:59:14.139 --> 00:59:17.479
of custom must have been. And he also thinks

753
00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:21.229
that that's only because we've so internalized it, that

754
00:59:21.239 --> 00:59:25.939
its novelty is no longer salient millennia of later

755
00:59:25.949 --> 00:59:30.510
developments have papered over all of the compulsory dimensions

756
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.909
of a morality of custom. They just become part

757
00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:33.669
of who we are.

758
00:59:34.439 --> 00:59:37.830
And what is the role played by punishment?

759
00:59:38.229 --> 00:59:40.860
Nietzsche has more interesting things to say about punishment

760
00:59:42.209 --> 00:59:45.810
uh than almost any other philosopher. I exempt Foucault

761
00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.870
who also has very interesting things to say about

762
00:59:47.879 --> 00:59:55.250
punishment. I will say autobiographically that when I first

763
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.050
read the genealogy of morality, I didn't understand what

764
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.399
he was going on about with punishment. And it

765
01:00:03.409 --> 01:00:07.689
took a long time to understand why he would

766
01:00:07.699 --> 01:00:12.959
focus on punishment except for some sadistic interest in

767
01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:19.330
the practice. But it's quite clear that for him,

768
01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:25.629
punishment is a mechanism for embedding and cultivating memory.

769
01:00:27.719 --> 01:00:30.629
It's as he puts it a technique of Memnon

770
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:37.800
Xs. He thinks that it is one of the

771
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:47.689
crucial social psychological mechanisms for cultivating within us, a

772
01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:53.330
sense of synchronic and diachronic identity and for cultivating

773
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.820
within us, the expectation that we will continue into

774
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.959
the future. So long as we have memory of

775
01:01:01.969 --> 01:01:12.439
our past, his fascination with the brutality of punishment

776
01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:19.719
regimes is kind of disturbing. But he thinks that

777
01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:23.080
it has to be this way because we were

778
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:30.780
when punishment first emerged little more than animals. And

779
01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.080
he thinks that the public and private procedures of

780
01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:39.689
punishment eventually burned into our, into our memories. Five

781
01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:47.750
or six thou shall nots and these thou shall

782
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.600
not and thou shells were necessary conditions to enjoy

783
01:01:53.939 --> 01:02:01.189
the advantage of living in a peaceful society. Of

784
01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:04.750
course, he thinks that there are etymological support um

785
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:10.040
for his way of thinking about punishment. And he

786
01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:17.909
thinks that punishment is allied with um guilt and

787
01:02:17.919 --> 01:02:23.679
deaths and using that etymological evidence. He starts to

788
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:29.639
crowbar his way into the long history of creditor,

789
01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:34.570
debtor exchange relationships and the punishment that accompanied them.

790
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:41.330
He thinks this particular socio-economic set of relationships was

791
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.639
the basis of our eventual notion of bad conscience

792
01:02:45.649 --> 01:02:51.050
and guilt. When punishment first appeared, there was no

793
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.719
distinction between the subject and the and its actions.

794
01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.770
So the modern thought that we have that we

795
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.929
always punish miscreants to cure them of their wicked

796
01:03:02.939 --> 01:03:09.280
choices already pres presupposes way too much. If you

797
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:13.620
look back at the practice of punishment. This is

798
01:03:13.629 --> 01:03:15.300
one of the things he's most famous for in

799
01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:19.310
genealogy. You can see that it's overladen with various

800
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.669
functions. But what continues to be the case from

801
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.040
the early part of our human history up until

802
01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:31.830
today is the practice of punishment. Various functions are

803
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.090
laid on top of that practice. But what's universal

804
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:39.060
and cross temp across time is the practice of

805
01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:43.530
punishment. And so he warns against projecting back to

806
01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.379
the origin of punishment. What is for us? Now,

807
01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:49.449
the obvious thought that the criminal deserves to be

808
01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:52.620
punished because he could have acted otherwise. For most

809
01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:55.750
of our history, punishment simply inflicted suffering on a

810
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.810
wrongdoer who caused others injury. Not as we now

811
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.530
think because the wrong doer is morally responsible for

812
01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:08.820
choosing to act intentionally. And here, I think that

813
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:15.780
you can draw an analogy with um phenotypic expressions

814
01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:22.550
of um of genetic information. There are all kinds

815
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.300
of adaptations, there are all kinds of expectations, There

816
01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:31.129
are all kinds of ma adaptations in that are

817
01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:37.820
discussed in evolutionary theory. What's common across all of

818
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:42.719
them is the expression of genomic information in a

819
01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:47.719
phenotype that interacts with its environment. And there's no

820
01:04:47.729 --> 01:04:54.810
reason to think that a particular mutation that originally

821
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:59.370
developed generations ago had at the time of its

822
01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:03.610
origin, the same function that it currently has. Nietzsche

823
01:05:03.689 --> 01:05:06.060
is well aware of this and he's deeply impressed

824
01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.219
by it. And so he takes that kind of

825
01:05:09.229 --> 01:05:16.790
conceptual framework and applies it to punishment. The crucial

826
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.129
thing about punishment is that it he thinks it

827
01:05:20.139 --> 01:05:24.389
arose in exchange in commercial relationships, but it's not

828
01:05:24.399 --> 01:05:27.830
the only um place that emerge. But let's talk

829
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.229
just about those. When the, when a debtor didn't

830
01:05:33.239 --> 01:05:35.429
live up to the promise that was established by

831
01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:40.149
some contract with a creditor, the creditor could inflict

832
01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:44.110
all kinds of torture and dishonor on the debtor.

833
01:05:45.219 --> 01:05:47.719
And so he could cut off as much flesh

834
01:05:47.729 --> 01:05:50.489
as seemed appropriate for the dead. This is the

835
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.110
basis of an eye for an eye, tooth, for

836
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.530
tooth and so forth. The logic here is completely

837
01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:01.709
simple. It's undemanding and it's gruesome. There was no

838
01:06:01.719 --> 01:06:05.840
in kind compensation. We didn't repay loan money with

839
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:09.800
interest. We didn't forfeit our processions, we didn't sacrifice

840
01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:14.129
our labor. Instead, the creditor, the person to whom

841
01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:16.639
the money was owed had the pleasure of having

842
01:06:16.649 --> 01:06:20.790
the right to exercise power over the powerless, the

843
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.060
pleasure to do evil for the pleasure of doing

844
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:29.489
evil and its this punishment. The equivalence between receiving

845
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.050
a harm and obtaining the license to mistreat that

846
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.500
becomes entrenched in us. And that's because Nietzsche thinks

847
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:41.760
that it's a psychological truth that to make someone

848
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:46.080
suffer is pleasure in its highest form. He says

849
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:48.840
that in uh essay two section six,

850
01:06:51.129 --> 01:06:55.790
but then how do we get to bad conscience

851
01:06:55.879 --> 01:07:00.229
and guilt? And what is the distinction between them?

852
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:08.590
The bad conscience? Mhm I'm going to assume that

853
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.280
the term bad conscience and the term guilt cofer.

854
01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.679
I know there are some Nietzsche scholars who think

855
01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:18.239
that there's a distinction between bad conscience and guilt.

856
01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:25.500
But for um purposes of genealogy, moral morality, I

857
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:30.280
think we can assume that they are basically co

858
01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:36.699
referential when you Nietzsche asks us. And section 14

859
01:07:36.709 --> 01:07:41.239
of the second essay, I think, to consider the

860
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:49.350
psychology of the criminal criminals feel the pang of

861
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.820
guilt or bad conscience at best erratically, and Nietzsche

862
01:07:54.899 --> 01:07:58.570
gives four reasons why this is the case. Um

863
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:04.040
Criminals typically think to themselves. Not that they did

864
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:11.479
something bad but something unexpected happened. They got caught.

865
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.780
They don't think that they are guilty. They think

866
01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:19.709
that they got caught and there's a certain former

867
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.029
president of the United States who is an example

868
01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.779
of this kind of thinking, a this former president

869
01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:31.499
doesn't think that he's guilty of anything. It's just

870
01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:34.660
that he gets caught and he gets caught by

871
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:44.240
people who are out to get him. Criminals also

872
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:49.709
have to face the court. And those who judge

873
01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:57.189
wrongdoers typically target their cause of responsibility for harm

874
01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.359
caused and try to find measures that will block

875
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:06.160
the criminal from causing more of it. The courts

876
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:08.560
rarely remain focused for very long on whether the

877
01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:18.479
convict feels guilty. Third judged and sentenced convicts typically

878
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:23.500
feel not guilt but sadness. They don't think that

879
01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:25.330
they ought not to have done what they did.

880
01:09:26.569 --> 01:09:34.799
They typically think, oh, I got caught and I'll

881
01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:37.379
submit to the punishment in the same way that

882
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:43.319
I'll submit to an illness. I'll be brave and

883
01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:49.459
I'll be fatalistic. And fourth prison life itself does

884
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:52.189
virtually nothing to cultivate the pang of gu of

885
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:59.450
guilt and converts. So if you strip away all

886
01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:07.419
of the misperceptions about guilt and bad conscience, what

887
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:15.069
remains nevertheless is the durability of the methods and

888
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:24.520
procedures of punishment, its causal consequences, its effects. And

889
01:10:24.529 --> 01:10:31.270
Nietzsche thinks that punishment achieves more than anything else.

890
01:10:31.279 --> 01:10:37.540
A lengthening of memory. It results in a will

891
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.419
to be more cautious to be less trusting, to

892
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:47.600
go about things circumspectly, any increase in fear, the

893
01:10:47.609 --> 01:10:54.950
intensification of intelligence, the mastering of desires, we then

894
01:10:54.959 --> 01:11:02.069
add the notions of predictability, attention control, promise, making

895
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.060
emotional regulation that are already in place from the

896
01:11:07.069 --> 01:11:11.359
morality of custom. And what we're describing are the

897
01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:21.459
psychological prerequisites for prudential agency. Prudential agency or responsibility

898
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:27.180
is that entire suite of psychological capacities that were

899
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:31.390
cultivated in human animals by custom, by the c

900
01:11:31.399 --> 01:11:34.870
by the credit or debtor relationship and by punishment,

901
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:40.430
a prudential agent is a human animal who is

902
01:11:40.439 --> 01:11:47.629
prudentially responsible and the incarceration mechanisms for creating this

903
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:54.720
potentially responsible person. Those mechanisms are primarily the morality

904
01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:58.339
of custom, the set of credit or debtor relationships

905
01:11:58.509 --> 01:12:04.299
and punishment that allows us to introduce the notion

906
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:08.069
of conscience and from conscience, we can then introduce

907
01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.689
the notion of bad conscience or guilt. I think

908
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:17.459
for Nietzsche conscience is being reflectively conscious of our

909
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:22.790
prerogative of responsibility and promise making. It's being reflectively

910
01:12:22.799 --> 01:12:27.759
conscious of our power over ourselves, of being answerable,

911
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:32.250
accountable to ourselves and to others in short of

912
01:12:32.259 --> 01:12:37.029
being an agent. Nevertheless, being reflectively aware of our

913
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.720
prudential responsibility is not the same as bad conscience.

914
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.330
Bad conscience is the reflective awareness of guilt and

915
01:12:47.339 --> 01:12:51.649
the accompanying qualitative effect of suffering of feeling guilty.

916
01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:57.839
This is a relatively late flowering phenomenon. So when

917
01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:05.600
his primitive progenitors first appear these ances, the ancestral

918
01:13:05.609 --> 01:13:10.770
feelings of its primitive pro progenitor guilt isn't bad

919
01:13:10.779 --> 01:13:15.990
conscience, isn't he? He isn't even present. The question

920
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.899
is for essay two, how this primitive ancestral feeling,

921
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:25.560
a prudential responsibility grew with the various new interpretations

922
01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:30.370
into bad conscience or guilt. And this is a

923
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:39.379
monstrously complicated undertaking. In essay two, Nietzsche initially assumes

924
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:42.629
a couple of things. The origin of the ancestral

925
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:50.109
affect. A bad conscience occurred abruptly. It didn't even

926
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.390
cause raison in the domesticated populations where it was

927
01:13:54.399 --> 01:14:00.970
first, ah, found. The second assumption is that incarceration

928
01:14:00.979 --> 01:14:05.939
began with violence. Nietzsche says in uh essay two

929
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:11.109
section 17, that the first organized societies quote emerged

930
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.660
as a terrible tyranny, a repressive and ruthless machinery

931
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:20.379
and continued working until the raw material of people

932
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:24.330
and semi animals had been not just needed and

933
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:33.720
made compliant but shaped in this process, which he

934
01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:39.879
thinks was violent and rapid. Some group of masters

935
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:46.959
laid its hands on a wildly unruly group of

936
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:52.229
semi, semi animals and through custom and through punishment,

937
01:14:53.359 --> 01:14:57.339
shaped them, shifted them, created a structure for them.

938
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:03.259
Since they imposed order on the herd, these old

939
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.419
masters were necessary for the emergence of bad conscience

940
01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:11.910
without them. Uh Bad conscience and guilt would never

941
01:15:11.919 --> 01:15:16.810
have been possible. But the first individuals to experience

942
01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:21.250
the effects that were ancestral to bad conscience were

943
01:15:21.259 --> 01:15:28.120
the herd, those on whom order was imposed. And

944
01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:31.189
this is one of the more mysterious passages of

945
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.770
um the genealogy it occurs in section 17. He

946
01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:40.029
says, when the masters impose form and order on

947
01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:48.470
the herd, violent oppression was unavoidable and therefore they

948
01:15:48.479 --> 01:15:54.370
made or forcibly made Leighton most of the herds

949
01:15:54.379 --> 01:15:59.370
freedoms, they eliminated them or they made them latent.

950
01:16:00.279 --> 01:16:04.000
And Nietzsche says that there's a re remaining distillate

951
01:16:04.009 --> 01:16:06.779
of freedom, which he calls the instinct of freedom

952
01:16:07.299 --> 01:16:10.490
that was forcibly made latent by the masters turning

953
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.810
semi animals into humans. And this instinct for freedom

954
01:16:14.819 --> 01:16:23.140
of freedom, repressed and incarcerated within the self, a

955
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:28.660
whole set of violent and out typically outwardly directed

956
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:36.620
emotions inward. So that with the external expression of

957
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:41.220
the will to power thwarted by these imposed mechanisms

958
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:45.859
of culture. These humans in the early societies had

959
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:48.839
no option but to turn inwards on themselves. This

960
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:53.839
is his so-called internalization of man. And when that

961
01:16:53.850 --> 01:17:04.390
happened, humans started the job of self formation. This

962
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:10.529
Nietzsche calls active bad conscience. And he thinks that

963
01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:14.270
the act of bad conscious, this activity of self

964
01:17:14.279 --> 01:17:19.009
formation form, imposing labor on the self to make

965
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:24.060
ourselves prudential agents is the womb of every ideal

966
01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:29.020
and imaginative event. And that it is brought a

967
01:17:29.029 --> 01:17:31.450
quote. He he puts it this way in 18,

968
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:34.729
a wealth of novel, disconcerting beauty and affirmation to

969
01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:39.549
light. And for the first time, perhaps beauty itself,

970
01:17:41.109 --> 01:17:44.620
he then says it's only bad conscience only the

971
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:48.419
will to self violation that provides the precondition for

972
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.850
the value of the un egoistic. So that even

973
01:17:51.859 --> 01:17:55.140
if bad conscience is a sickness, it's a sickness

974
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:59.970
like pregnancy. So here the bad conscience is this

975
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:06.390
inward turning, internalization of outwardly direct, previously, outwardly directed,

976
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:12.109
uh violent or oppressive uh emotions and desires turn

977
01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.220
back against oneself. And it is responsible Nietzsche thinks

978
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:19.450
for what makes us so great. Now, that kind

979
01:18:19.459 --> 01:18:23.209
of act of bad conscience is unfortunately not the

980
01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.770
only form of bad conscience. He also introduces the

981
01:18:26.779 --> 01:18:29.680
other form of bad consciousness, not bad conscience. And

982
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:35.359
that's the one that's inculcated by religion. Hey Ricardo.

983
01:18:35.589 --> 01:18:39.859
Yeah, te tell us then about uh religious uh

984
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:42.839
guilt. I mean that religious bit that you were

985
01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.750
mentioning there before we move on to perhaps uh

986
01:18:46.759 --> 01:18:48.680
essay number three,

987
01:18:49.200 --> 01:19:00.669
religious guilt developed already in pre Cristian societies. And

988
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.509
if you think about the difference between our kind

989
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.970
of society, uh Let me rephrase if you think

990
01:19:08.979 --> 01:19:13.220
about the difference between these pre Christian societies that

991
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:18.200
were influenced by monotheism and the Greeks, you can

992
01:19:18.209 --> 01:19:22.589
start to tease apart some of the differences that

993
01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.669
were responsible for the developing religious guilt in Greek

994
01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.089
societies. Um The problem for people was that we

995
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:37.129
simply didn't know enough to know how to avoid

996
01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:42.390
getting into trouble. Our foolishness uh resulted in that

997
01:19:42.399 --> 01:19:45.299
most of us just stumbled around in a kind

998
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:50.689
of uninformed stupor and we constantly bumped into other

999
01:19:51.479 --> 01:19:58.600
idiots like ourselves. These pileups where we crashed into

1000
01:19:58.609 --> 01:20:03.589
one another and cause each other harm were not

1001
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.799
a reason for thinking that humanity was morally reprehensible

1002
01:20:07.509 --> 01:20:11.689
or responsible for choosing to be ignorant since the

1003
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:17.180
gods, the Greek gods, they were always there. And

1004
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:21.939
as since they were always there, any inward attempt

1005
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:26.160
to ground suffering and being guilty could be short

1006
01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:30.399
circuited when the Greeks reflected and looked inside to

1007
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:34.799
discover why they were so miserable. They didn't find

1008
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.520
that they were responsible for it, what they found

1009
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:42.879
or the consequences of God's trickery or their delight

1010
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.930
in our human suffering. These gods were never inside

1011
01:20:46.939 --> 01:20:51.459
us. They were external beings. And so looking inside

1012
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:55.020
themselves never revealed to the Greeks that they were

1013
01:20:55.029 --> 01:21:02.180
causally responsible for their suffering. The Christian God is

1014
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:10.100
very different. The Christian God added certain innovations to

1015
01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:13.979
the God blueprint that was already found in Judaism.

1016
01:21:16.319 --> 01:21:20.299
The first innovation for the Christian God was that

1017
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:25.200
it was maximal. It is still the greatest feeling

1018
01:21:25.209 --> 01:21:31.759
indebtedness of indebtedness on earth. Nietzsche asks us to

1019
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:37.220
remember that Christianity inherited its God from Judaism. And

1020
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:41.109
so we inherited the Jewish sense of religious indebtedness

1021
01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:48.819
to God for flourishing as a society. Judaism was

1022
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:54.160
novel itself. It refocused a set of dispersed debts

1023
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:57.810
to a pantheon of gods onto a single God,

1024
01:21:57.819 --> 01:22:02.620
a single point making their God the only God

1025
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:06.419
to whom we owe all debts. So for Judaism,

1026
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:11.529
God was kind of a solar furnace that refocused

1027
01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:16.640
all of our debts onto a single point. And

1028
01:22:16.649 --> 01:22:24.200
this maximal feeling of indebtedness is religious guilt, religious

1029
01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:30.950
guilts expression is still not moral guilt. And this

1030
01:22:30.959 --> 01:22:38.790
is where Christianity went beyond Judaism so long as

1031
01:22:38.799 --> 01:22:42.470
bad conscience or guilt remained tied to our indebtedness

1032
01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:45.649
to God. He was still about an external entity,

1033
01:22:46.549 --> 01:22:49.399
even if it was the case as with Judaism,

1034
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:54.160
that God is the maximal creditor, but moral guilt

1035
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:58.220
concerns the self. And so we still need other

1036
01:22:58.229 --> 01:23:02.250
elements to explain how this externally directed religious guilt

1037
01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:08.060
became internally directed moral guilt. And Nietzsche's explanation of

1038
01:23:08.069 --> 01:23:14.680
this in essay two section 21 is um not

1039
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.560
particularly clear. I think the best that I can

1040
01:23:18.569 --> 01:23:19.859
say about it is this.

1041
01:23:20.259 --> 01:23:24.189
So essay number three then is about the meaning

1042
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.319
of the aesthetic ideal and its spread through European

1043
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.100
society. Could you start by telling us what the

1044
01:23:31.109 --> 01:23:33.419
aesthetic ideal is for Nietzsche?

1045
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:38.899
Mhm It's a set of values, moral values and

1046
01:23:38.919 --> 01:23:44.890
Nietzsche identifies them as compassion, self denial, self sacrifice,

1047
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:53.950
poverty, humility and chastity. He sometimes in other works,

1048
01:23:53.959 --> 01:23:59.350
I um add selflessness and self renunciation. But it's

1049
01:23:59.359 --> 01:24:02.350
this, it's this set of values that are typically

1050
01:24:02.359 --> 01:24:06.540
associated with morality and acting in an un egoistic

1051
01:24:06.549 --> 01:24:07.060
way.

1052
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:12.209
And does it relate in any way to the

1053
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.890
slave revolt we talked about earlier?

1054
01:24:17.459 --> 01:24:24.500
Right? An answer to this question has uh basically

1055
01:24:24.509 --> 01:24:30.029
two elements. The first element is that um the

1056
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:36.140
old Aristocrats and warriors were convinced of their superiority

1057
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:39.520
and they were pleased with their happy lives and

1058
01:24:39.529 --> 01:24:43.950
they lived in this kind of bubble that Nietzsche

1059
01:24:44.009 --> 01:24:48.580
calls the pathos of distance. They had every reason

1060
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.049
there was to isolate themselves from the herd. The

1061
01:24:53.060 --> 01:25:00.250
herd was four. They were lazy, they were dirty,

1062
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:06.649
they were impure, they were resentful, they were conniving,

1063
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:13.240
they lied. And so the, the aristocrats, the masters,

1064
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:21.180
the old masters try to relinquish the task of

1065
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:26.910
mingling with the herd to somebody else. And they

1066
01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:32.910
were delighted when the priests accepted the job for

1067
01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:34.950
when the priests were in charge of the herd.

1068
01:25:36.299 --> 01:25:39.620
The old aristocrats and warriors could continue to ignore

1069
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:43.990
them. They were predisposed to do so anyway. And

1070
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.029
they f they found a functionary who was willing

1071
01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.279
to deal with them. But the priests made the

1072
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:57.490
old masters pay for taking on the disagreeable job

1073
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:04.049
of looking after the herd. The priests themselves were

1074
01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:09.660
interested in augmenting their social power with respect to

1075
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:14.009
the aristocrats and the warriors. And so they took

1076
01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:18.509
what they had learned about the creative possibilities of

1077
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.939
rezoning ma and turn it against the old masters.

1078
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:30.770
In the process. They sowed discontent within the old

1079
01:26:30.779 --> 01:26:35.180
masters and they made them feel ashamed about living

1080
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:39.100
happily. They made them feel ashamed of living without

1081
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:44.660
bad conscience. They convinced them, the priests convinced the

1082
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:49.600
old masters that otherworldly powers were even greater than

1083
01:26:49.609 --> 01:26:54.709
their earthly power. And so the priests adopted all

1084
01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:02.029
kinds of camouflaging tactics to undermine the old masters.

1085
01:27:03.779 --> 01:27:09.379
And one of those tactics was to talk about

1086
01:27:09.939 --> 01:27:13.259
the ascetic ideals and the way those uh the

1087
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.970
the aesthetic values and the ways in which those

1088
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:21.279
ex aesthetic values were preferable to the values that

1089
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:25.930
the old masters themselves lived by. But to be

1090
01:27:25.939 --> 01:27:31.160
cons successful against the old masters, the priest had

1091
01:27:31.169 --> 01:27:35.049
to convince them that their social standing, their happiness,

1092
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.569
their pathos of distance were all unjustified. They had

1093
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.490
to convince the masters that they were no different

1094
01:27:42.609 --> 01:27:48.319
than the herd and they had to convince the

1095
01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:52.709
masters that they suffered, not because they had to

1096
01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.649
endure the herd or because they had to endure

1097
01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.729
insults, but because they too were subjects of bad

1098
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:06.379
conscience and guilt. Now, this was true of some

1099
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:10.819
of the priests and clergy before Christianity. But Christianity

1100
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:16.529
really excelled at this project. The Christian priest was

1101
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:21.609
much cleverer than the old masters and was capable

1102
01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:26.629
of levels of dialectical finesse that completely threw the

1103
01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:33.549
masters. Moreover, uh the priest, the Christian priest carried

1104
01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:37.270
all of these ingenious doctrines around with him in

1105
01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:43.100
a sack and these ingenious doctrines, the immaterial soul

1106
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:45.089
that God gave to each of us, a free

1107
01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.799
will that was equally distributed to each of us,

1108
01:28:48.049 --> 01:28:50.169
the promise of power and happiness that the old

1109
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.899
masters never dreamed of achieving kind of everlasting life

1110
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:58.560
in heaven, focusing on gratitude into a single God

1111
01:28:58.569 --> 01:29:01.689
who had sacrificed himself for all of us left

1112
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:06.580
us saddled with original sin. All of these doctrines

1113
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:11.950
started to breed shame within the old masters. So

1114
01:29:11.959 --> 01:29:19.919
the priest, the Christian priest took his greater cleverness,

1115
01:29:20.359 --> 01:29:24.430
his mastery of dialectic and his collection of religious

1116
01:29:24.439 --> 01:29:30.430
doctrines and seduced the poor, less reflective old masters

1117
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.069
into feeling guilty about themselves and to doubt their

1118
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.459
right to happiness and then infected the old masters

1119
01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:42.629
with the doctrines of the aesthetic values, the ascetic

1120
01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.430
ideal to complete the job of making them ashamed

1121
01:29:46.439 --> 01:29:47.189
of themselves.

1122
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:56.660
But does Nietzsche also see positive aspects to aesthetic

1123
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:57.540
values

1124
01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:06.270
undeniably? He does. Um I think it's important for

1125
01:30:06.279 --> 01:30:08.759
us to recognize that he thinks that there are

1126
01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:13.529
both negative and positive aspects uh to aesthetic values.

1127
01:30:15.959 --> 01:30:19.850
And he catalogs the real dangers of ascetic values.

1128
01:30:19.859 --> 01:30:24.330
In section 17 through uh 21 of the third

1129
01:30:24.339 --> 01:30:30.890
essay. The first negative a aspect. The danger is

1130
01:30:30.899 --> 01:30:35.629
that aesthetic values narcotize our emotions. But they do

1131
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.470
so in an attempt to thwart depression, he talks

1132
01:30:38.479 --> 01:30:44.240
about this in section 17, for example, second, um

1133
01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:50.649
the ascetic values advocate mechanical activities and tiny pleasures

1134
01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:58.589
as methods for alleviating depression. Third, and this is

1135
01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:04.490
a more dangerous danger. They addict the sufferer to

1136
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.430
the priest's diagnosis of sin and guilt, bad conscience

1137
01:31:08.759 --> 01:31:12.560
and to the priest's cure for them. And they

1138
01:31:12.569 --> 01:31:20.359
thus ensure an ongoing dependency on religion. Fourth, they

1139
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:25.000
introduce a protocol that not only doesn't ease the

1140
01:31:25.009 --> 01:31:30.680
suffering but adds suffering to suffering. Thus, compounding rather

1141
01:31:30.689 --> 01:31:38.660
than abating suffering. Fifth, the ascetic ideals emphasis on

1142
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:43.939
sin and guilt and bad conscience. In n the

1143
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:49.939
sufferers to the priests feeling orgies, the priest loves

1144
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:55.109
to talk about our feelings and it thus desensitizes

1145
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.439
the sufferer to the pleasures of living and it

1146
01:31:59.450 --> 01:32:02.319
habituates them to hating what life actually has to

1147
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:09.669
offer. And finally, the ascetic ideals try to stipulate

1148
01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.729
that religions that embody them should be spread as

1149
01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:17.290
far and wide as possible. And this corrupts not

1150
01:32:17.299 --> 01:32:23.359
just others who suffer but even the healthy. No,

1151
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:28.660
Nietzsche spends a lot of time in section 16

1152
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:34.890
through 21 talking about these negative facets of the

1153
01:32:34.899 --> 01:32:38.790
aesthetic ideals. In fact, uh essay three section 17

1154
01:32:38.799 --> 01:32:43.000
is the longest single section in the book. And

1155
01:32:43.009 --> 01:32:47.169
it's the section uh where he talks about narcotizing

1156
01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:49.970
emotions and the role of ascetic ideals and narcotizing

1157
01:32:49.979 --> 01:32:56.200
emotions. But having said that and having cataloged all

1158
01:32:56.209 --> 01:33:00.240
of these negative facets of uh of the aesthetic

1159
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:05.240
values, he also allows that they have some positive

1160
01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:09.970
effects uh a aspects as well. And this will

1161
01:33:09.979 --> 01:33:15.020
lead us eventually into a discussion of nihilism. But

1162
01:33:15.029 --> 01:33:25.729
the point here is this ascetic values fixate on

1163
01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:34.660
and celebrate failure, decay, this fortune deprivation, destruction of

1164
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:41.049
the self, self flagellation and self sacrifice. But since

1165
01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:45.540
everything has to be measured in terms of its

1166
01:33:45.549 --> 01:33:50.720
value for life, the ascetic ideal must also be

1167
01:33:50.729 --> 01:33:54.149
a trick for the Preser preservation of life. But

1168
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.470
it's the preservation for a particular kind of life.

1169
01:33:58.009 --> 01:34:00.750
And that's what Nietzsche is most interested in. In

1170
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:06.339
this third essay, the people who are safeguarded by

1171
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:11.970
endorsing the ascetic ideal already live futile or decaying

1172
01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:16.839
lives. And they use the ascetic ideal to justify

1173
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:24.319
and preserve themselves and protect against further decline, their

1174
01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:27.549
miseries. The way they live is second only to

1175
01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.770
their heartbeat. And so they clutch the ascetic ideal

1176
01:34:31.779 --> 01:34:36.500
as a last hope as a way to continue

1177
01:34:36.509 --> 01:34:46.470
to live and avoid uh nihilistic suicide. The ascetic

1178
01:34:46.479 --> 01:34:53.779
priests who offered these ideals to the herd provide

1179
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:58.069
them with a diagnosis of their suffering, a prognosis

1180
01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.720
for its future course, if it's left untreated and

1181
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:06.560
a prescription regimen to treat their suffering. Now, Nietzsche

1182
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:11.299
thinks that all of this is gobbledygook and complete

1183
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:15.700
nonsense. But nevertheless, historically, it has proven to be

1184
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:21.740
remarkably effective in helping those of us who are

1185
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:29.000
not lucky to continue to live. It provides meaning

1186
01:35:29.009 --> 01:35:31.850
for our, the aesthetic values provide meaning for our

1187
01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:37.290
suffering and it's therefore the great consoling function of

1188
01:35:37.299 --> 01:35:42.649
the ascetic ideal. Until this point in history, Nietzsche

1189
01:35:42.729 --> 01:35:46.470
thinks that the ascetic ideal has been the only

1190
01:35:46.479 --> 01:35:51.919
interpretation and meaning of deep suffering. But it's been

1191
01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:56.509
enough because any meaning is better than no meaning

1192
01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:01.430
and with its explanation and justification of suffering in

1193
01:36:01.439 --> 01:36:06.120
hand, most of humanity could continue to live without

1194
01:36:06.129 --> 01:36:07.799
collapsing into despair.

1195
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.060
Uh But of course, we tend to associate the

1196
01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:20.870
ascetic ideal with uh priests, religious people. But according

1197
01:36:20.879 --> 01:36:23.060
to Nietzsche, please correct me if I'm wrong. But

1198
01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:26.899
according to him, uh we can also find ascetic

1199
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:33.509
values in people like artists, philosophers and even scientists

1200
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.200
correct

1201
01:36:34.359 --> 01:36:34.830
you all

1202
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:39.109
all true. Um I'll simply say a couple of

1203
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:44.140
quick things about the way artists and philosophers use

1204
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:51.180
aesthetic values. Artists and philosophers can use ascetic values

1205
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:55.819
as a kind of strategy to isolate themselves from

1206
01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.959
um those emotional commitments, those psychological commitments that deter

1207
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:08.640
them from their great projects. So philosophers in particular,

1208
01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:13.290
um philosophers in particular try to claim that they

1209
01:37:13.299 --> 01:37:22.379
are beyond the call of um binary. They are

1210
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:29.040
beyond the concerns of making a positive impression on

1211
01:37:29.049 --> 01:37:40.390
others. They are beyond emotional relationships with others. They

1212
01:37:40.399 --> 01:37:48.879
are beyond the need for social relationships of many

1213
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:53.589
kinds. But these are used strategically so that they

1214
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.430
can live with their beloved ideas. Their ideas are

1215
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:05.209
where they have their social interactions. They observe their

1216
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:09.680
ideas, they follow their ideas, they capture, they inspect

1217
01:38:09.689 --> 01:38:13.689
their ideas, they analyze their ideas, they distill their

1218
01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.819
ideas, they test their ideas, they research ideas, they

1219
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:21.089
organize their ideas. All of this requires a kind

1220
01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.959
of monastic life and the aesthetic values are used

1221
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:30.330
to encourage the conditions necessary for the production of

1222
01:38:30.339 --> 01:38:38.450
their, of their uh of their great ideas. Having

1223
01:38:38.459 --> 01:38:46.169
said that um artists too can do this but

1224
01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.290
not all artists do this. And he's particularly critical

1225
01:38:51.299 --> 01:39:01.399
of Wagner who thinks that chastity became antithetical to

1226
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:08.490
sensuality. And Nietzsche has nothing but contempt at this

1227
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:14.549
point in his career for Wagner's as a AAA

1228
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:24.439
affirmation of aesthetic values because he thinks that chastity

1229
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:28.729
and sensuality don't have to be contradictory. And then

1230
01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:31.819
even if they were, that's what makes life interesting.

1231
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:39.899
So as Wagner's are continued and deepened into his

1232
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:45.810
old age, it became increasingly ascetic and sickly. And

1233
01:39:45.819 --> 01:39:51.799
he has an analysis of Parsifal as a Christian

1234
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:58.029
exercise in asceticism. And he hopes that a Wagner

1235
01:39:58.049 --> 01:40:02.290
was intending it as a joke, but he fears

1236
01:40:02.299 --> 01:40:13.770
that he wasn't so bracketing these strategic uses of

1237
01:40:13.779 --> 01:40:19.600
the ascetic ideals, we have to return to the

1238
01:40:19.609 --> 01:40:27.310
moral use of asceticism. And here religious types, philosophical

1239
01:40:27.319 --> 01:40:32.839
types and moral types are all to blame for

1240
01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:38.830
advocating the universal applicability of aesthetic values to everybody.

1241
01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:49.979
And that includes the scientists. In the latter part

1242
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:58.399
of the third essay, Nietzsche criticizes the scientists and

1243
01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:02.640
science is a practice for continuing to inhabit the

1244
01:41:02.649 --> 01:41:08.089
vapors of asceticism. Even though um by the time

1245
01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.950
he was writing, science was already posing a danger

1246
01:41:12.959 --> 01:41:17.439
to religion. Nietzsche thinks that most of the scientists

1247
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:24.589
that he read was doing nothing more than being

1248
01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.109
a rabble rouser. And even if he admits the

1249
01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.169
scholars and scientists can be worthy and can be

1250
01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:37.629
busy and take pleasure in their craft, he thinks

1251
01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.189
that nevertheless, there's this contempt for the self in

1252
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:49.160
science, a kind of bad conscience and he identifies

1253
01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:53.020
the root of the problem here as not being

1254
01:41:53.029 --> 01:41:56.810
liberated from the ascetic ideal. And he thinks they're

1255
01:41:56.819 --> 01:42:01.370
not being liberated from the ascetic ideal because scientists

1256
01:42:01.379 --> 01:42:05.370
still believe in truth. This is one of his

1257
01:42:05.379 --> 01:42:10.470
most outrageous claims, but it's also an interesting one.

1258
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:18.810
And so when he says in essay 24 that

1259
01:42:18.819 --> 01:42:23.589
the science that science's laser focus on the factum

1260
01:42:23.609 --> 01:42:29.569
brut its renunciation of any interpretation, those things together

1261
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:34.359
express the asceticism of virtue just as well as

1262
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:42.160
any denial of sensuality. Now, that sentence condenses an

1263
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:48.160
entire argument, Nietzsche's convinced that there's only perspective of

1264
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:52.310
sensory experience. Nietzsche is convinced that there's only perspective

1265
01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.759
of knowledge. Nietzsche's convinced that there's only perspective of

1266
01:42:56.770 --> 01:43:04.560
concepts. But here is where his argument gets interesting.

1267
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:10.330
Science and scholarship in general think that they rely

1268
01:43:10.339 --> 01:43:15.149
on and are warranted by observation and measurement. But

1269
01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.069
both of these are sensory experiences. So both the

1270
01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.680
concepts of science and scholarship use and the discoveries

1271
01:43:22.689 --> 01:43:27.350
they make rely on and are warranted by perspective

1272
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:33.069
of perceptual experience. So scientific and scholarly concepts and

1273
01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.640
scientific and scholarly logic, uh knowledge are perspective of

1274
01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.620
themselves. They cannot deliver perspective free facts, but science's

1275
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:49.330
brute facts are supposed to be perspective free. And

1276
01:43:49.339 --> 01:43:53.669
since that's the case, neither empirical science nor scholarship

1277
01:43:53.899 --> 01:43:59.319
discover facts and assuming that perspective can be substituted

1278
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:04.759
for interpretation, we can directly infer that to the

1279
01:44:04.770 --> 01:44:07.379
extent that science and scholarship think they discover brute

1280
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:11.629
facts rather than interpretations rather than perspectives to that

1281
01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.660
extent. Do they mimic and reiterate asceticism's mistake of

1282
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:20.140
mistrusting sensory experience? That's the best argument that I

1283
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:23.040
can distill out of this outrageous claim that there

1284
01:44:23.049 --> 01:44:26.009
is no truth or that they still believe in

1285
01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:32.520
truth. So this is not, II, I, I'd like

1286
01:44:32.529 --> 01:44:35.049
to add one thing here. This is not to

1287
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.740
say the truth is worthless. Truth is a, a

1288
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:45.229
much truth is a significant advance over other objects

1289
01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.740
of faith. Um Because it's pursuit eventually leads us

1290
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:54.259
to questioning what it is and investigating whether it

1291
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:57.250
has the value it has heretofore been assumed to

1292
01:44:57.259 --> 01:45:02.259
have. So Nietzsche does not infer from the perspective

1293
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:05.830
of science that it's no better than religion or

1294
01:45:05.839 --> 01:45:13.240
other perspectives. It's certainly better. Um Its methods of

1295
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:18.649
knowledge acquisition are mentally much more hygienic than the

1296
01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:23.830
polluted wells of religious superstition and warrants confronting uh

1297
01:45:23.839 --> 01:45:30.049
religion and philosophy directly, close observation, hypothesis formation and

1298
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:35.270
testing empirical support, disc conformation, rigorous analysis. He thinks

1299
01:45:35.279 --> 01:45:40.250
all of these things are crucial, but we still

1300
01:45:40.259 --> 01:45:44.479
need to understand that the faith in truth is

1301
01:45:44.490 --> 01:45:48.430
something that itself has to be questioned and that

1302
01:45:48.439 --> 01:45:50.609
was going to be part of his big project

1303
01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:51.790
that he never completed.

1304
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:56.890
So uh I know that we are reaching our

1305
01:45:56.899 --> 01:45:59.790
time limit. So let me just ask you perhaps

1306
01:45:59.799 --> 01:46:05.040
a couple of questions, general questions about the genealogy

1307
01:46:05.049 --> 01:46:08.919
of morality. So after all of what we talked

1308
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:12.649
about, what would you say are the main merits

1309
01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:13.850
of this book.

1310
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:20.149
The book is so widespread, has such a broad

1311
01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.919
scope, digs into so many different details, is so

1312
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:30.959
creative, so imaginative, so alive with the love of

1313
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:36.319
thinking that it is in my considered opinion, impossible

1314
01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:41.410
to identify the main contributions of the book. It

1315
01:46:41.419 --> 01:46:49.549
is a work of great genius and philosophers who

1316
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:56.500
think about the genealogy of morality are confronted by

1317
01:46:56.509 --> 01:47:04.720
somebody whos thinking is demonstrably more imaginative, demonstrably more

1318
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:13.779
penetrating demonstratively, more um probing and comprehensive and profound

1319
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.020
than any of us are likely ever to achieve.

1320
01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.740
Having said all of that, I think his analysis

1321
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:30.819
of Renton is still not fully understood or appreciated

1322
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:36.200
its role in moral psychology, I think is still

1323
01:47:36.209 --> 01:47:45.709
not fully appreciated. Nietzsche's um analysis of the internalization

1324
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.910
of humanity, I think is something that we still

1325
01:47:49.919 --> 01:47:54.310
don't understand completely. We don't know whether it's even

1326
01:47:54.319 --> 01:47:58.850
accurate, we don't know. And I think that his

1327
01:47:58.859 --> 01:48:05.430
analysis of asceticism and his analysis of nihilism are

1328
01:48:05.439 --> 01:48:10.930
still among the most profound things that Nietzsche wrote

1329
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:16.350
and things that we are living through today. Nietzsche

1330
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:21.069
anticipated an enormous amount of what's happened since his

1331
01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:28.520
time. We who are in his wake, try sometimes

1332
01:48:28.529 --> 01:48:35.370
to demonstrate that he continues to be relevant by

1333
01:48:35.379 --> 01:48:39.520
trying to capture his thought within conceptual frameworks that

1334
01:48:39.529 --> 01:48:42.640
were familiar with. But he never even heard of.

1335
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:46.040
We do this as a way of honoring his

1336
01:48:46.049 --> 01:48:52.770
greatness and genius, but it minimizes him. It lessens

1337
01:48:52.779 --> 01:48:59.129
him the main merit of genealogy if there is

1338
01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.470
a single main merit is that it is a

1339
01:49:02.479 --> 01:49:09.009
document that exhibits a mind on fire and a

1340
01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:13.970
mind that was so full of so many different

1341
01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:20.270
kinds of knowledge that it, that it really struggled

1342
01:49:20.279 --> 01:49:24.459
to capture everything that was in that mind. And

1343
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:27.479
it didn't it? And there are, there are plenty

1344
01:49:27.490 --> 01:49:31.259
of reasons why genealogy is uh not a successful

1345
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:37.229
book, but it's, it's a success. It's a success

1346
01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:40.990
in so many ways that we don't typically acknowledge

1347
01:49:41.439 --> 01:49:46.870
um that we have to recognize that these other

1348
01:49:46.879 --> 01:49:52.040
ways of success trump its failures and its shortcomings.

1349
01:49:54.450 --> 01:49:57.669
And, and so my last question will be exactly

1350
01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.410
about that. What would you say are perhaps its

1351
01:50:00.419 --> 01:50:03.330
main gaps and shortcomings?

1352
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:06.560
Well, the obvious one is that he wrote this

1353
01:50:06.569 --> 01:50:13.890
in 1887. And uh I'm sorry, you, you wrote

1354
01:50:13.899 --> 01:50:20.910
it in uh 1887 1888. And he, he, he

1355
01:50:20.919 --> 01:50:24.569
published it in November of 1888 and then started

1356
01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:28.029
his big project of the revaluation of morality, the

1357
01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:34.770
revaluation of values. He only made headway for about

1358
01:50:34.779 --> 01:50:42.430
seven months by October of 1888. He was, I

1359
01:50:42.439 --> 01:50:45.520
think aware that he was never going to complete

1360
01:50:46.259 --> 01:50:51.450
the revaluation of value project. And so the defense

1361
01:50:52.589 --> 01:50:58.160
of these categories that make appearances in genealogy of

1362
01:50:58.169 --> 01:51:03.290
morality are never adequately defended. And chief among those

1363
01:51:03.299 --> 01:51:08.919
is his notion of power. Nietzsche mentions power in

1364
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:15.299
the genealogy of morality four or five times it

1365
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:19.779
that those mentions demonstrate that he was on his

1366
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:23.819
way to an analysis of power in the revaluation

1367
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:28.560
project. And that, that analysis would be used as

1368
01:51:28.569 --> 01:51:32.109
the Fulcrum around which is critique of moral values

1369
01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.799
that he analyzes the development of in genealogy would

1370
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:42.879
be focused. But he never got there. Um And

1371
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:47.720
that's the single greatest, uh it's not a shortcoming

1372
01:51:47.729 --> 01:51:50.470
of genealogy of morality because it was intended as

1373
01:51:50.479 --> 01:51:55.540
a kind of preliminary, a preliminary um statement that

1374
01:51:55.549 --> 01:51:59.720
was appropriate to the revaluation of values critical project.

1375
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:04.209
But he presupposes in genealogy the results of that

1376
01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:08.020
revaluation project and he doesn't adequately defend them in

1377
01:52:08.029 --> 01:52:12.580
the book. And so that's one of the shortcomings

1378
01:52:12.589 --> 01:52:17.009
of the book. Another shortcoming of the book is

1379
01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:21.680
that at times it gets a little histrionic and,

1380
01:52:22.279 --> 01:52:25.470
you know, that's a, that's a problem with Nietzsche

1381
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:32.279
um throughout his period from beyond good and evil

1382
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:36.890
forward. Um But I don't find that much of

1383
01:52:36.899 --> 01:52:41.220
a problem. Um It, it's a problem, especially towards

1384
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:44.240
the end of essay three. He moves at such

1385
01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:49.049
a fast rate that it's really difficult to understand

1386
01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:52.660
the logical structure of the arguments that are contained

1387
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:55.299
in that in those last four or five sections.

1388
01:52:57.689 --> 01:53:01.919
So the book is again, niches on the genealogy

1389
01:53:01.930 --> 01:53:05.390
of morality, a guide. I'm leaving a link to

1390
01:53:05.399 --> 01:53:08.419
it in the description of the interview. And doctor

1391
01:53:08.509 --> 01:53:11.589
w and apart from the book, uh are there

1392
01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.379
any places on the internet where people can find

1393
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:16.149
your work?

1394
01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:21.299
Uh No, I'm not much of a self publicize,

1395
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:25.290
so I don't have a web page. Um I

1396
01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:28.569
have, you know, I have a number of articles,

1397
01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:31.859
books about Nietzsche published over the years. I also

1398
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:35.359
work in uh the philosophy of Consciousness and I'm

1399
01:53:35.370 --> 01:53:38.830
particularly interested at this point in the emergence of

1400
01:53:38.839 --> 01:53:45.350
reflective consciousness in the uh paleolithic period and the

1401
01:53:45.359 --> 01:53:49.450
role of language in that emergence of con reflective

1402
01:53:49.459 --> 01:53:52.500
consciousness. Picking up on a Nietzschean theme, by the

1403
01:53:52.509 --> 01:53:55.229
way, you know, the consciousness is a function of

1404
01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.160
language. Mhm

1405
01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.410
