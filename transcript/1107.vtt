00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.049
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.000
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes sent

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.779
to the I'm joined by Doctor Donald Johnson. He

4
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.079
is the Virginia M. Ullman Chair in Human Origins

5
00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.279
and the school of in the School of Human

6
00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.309
Evolution and Social Change and the founding director of

7
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.959
the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.

8
00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.239
He has conducted lots of field and laboratory research

9
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.209
in paleoanthropology, most notably, he discovered that the, the

10
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:35.770
3.18 million year old hominid skeleton, popularly known as

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.029
Lucy. And today we're going to talk about Lucy,

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.520
uh, Australopithecuernzis more generally and also homo habily. So,

13
00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.209
Doctor Johnson, welcome to the show. It's a huge

14
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:48.209
pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.659
Well, it's a pleasure for me to be on

16
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.080
your show. Thank you so much.

17
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.669
OK, so less remark than the 50th anniversary of

18
00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.189
the discovery of Lucy and that's one of the

19
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.119
main reasons why I invited you on the show.

20
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:08.169
So, start by telling us, uh, first about the

21
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:10.550
history behind her discovery.

22
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.239
Well, uh, I was introduced to a, uh, geologist,

23
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.279
a French uh geologist in Paris, uh, in 1970.

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.160
Who unfortunately is no longer with us now. His

25
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.010
name is Maurice Taeb. And he was working uh

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.169
in the area you see behind me here, uh,

27
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.519
which is the Afar region of northeastern Ethiopia, which

28
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:42.139
is the largest expanse of the Great Rift Valley.

29
00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.419
And uh he was mapping the area. He was

30
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.459
trying to understand the origins and evolution of the

31
00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.169
geology in this area. And during the course of

32
00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:56.690
his field work, uh, he brought my attention to

33
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.370
the fact that this area was filled with all

34
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.319
kinds of fossil remains of animals, elephants and rhinos,

35
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.850
and pigs, and, uh, antelopes and so on, and

36
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.089
no anthropologist, paleoanthropologist like myself, someone who studies human

37
00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.889
origins, had ever visited that region. And he asked

38
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.250
me if I wanted to go with him. And

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.919
I was a young, uh, anthropologist at that time.

40
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.449
I had just gotten my doctorate, uh, from the

41
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.929
University of Chicago, I was getting my doctorate from

42
00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.690
the University of Chicago. And I was in Ethiopia

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.979
with my, uh, professor from the University of Chicago,

44
00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.809
working in the absolute opposite end of Ethiopia in

45
00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:48.229
southern Ethiopia. So, I was, um, Just beginning my

46
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:55.179
career in human origins research and uh surprisingly, he,

47
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.309
he offered the opportunity uh for me to accompany

48
00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.860
him there. And uh finally, after a couple of

49
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.539
years of uh organization and planning and uh finding

50
00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:14.089
financing, we made a visit in 1972. Uh, I

51
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.729
was still 2 years away from getting my doctorate,

52
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.350
so I was just a graduate student. And I

53
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.539
was absolutely amazed at how. Filled this area was

54
00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.979
with fossils. You could walk along and find a

55
00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.649
complete elephant skull. It was more than 3 million

56
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.289
years old. We knew that they were very old

57
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.229
because we looked at the, the teeth and the,

58
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.539
especially, uh, and they're good indicators of time. They

59
00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.990
evolve very quickly over time. And uh uh so

60
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.389
we decided to form an an expedition, a formal

61
00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:00.520
expedition called the International AFA Research Expedition. And uh

62
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.119
to systematically work in this area, which was really

63
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:13.500
terra incognita for anthropologists. And uh in 1972, we,

64
00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:19.000
we undertook this, um, you know, exploratory expedition, and

65
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.399
finally in 1973, we had uh arranged for funding.

66
00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:28.089
And an organization of a number of people to

67
00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.489
go and to sort of say, plant our flag

68
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:35.730
there. We, we got a permission from the Ministry

69
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.489
of Culture in Ethiopia, uh to go to this

70
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.369
particular place, which is called Hadar, H A D

71
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.600
A R. And uh I had not a great

72
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.079
deal of money. It was a, a really small

73
00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.149
amount of money and the pressure was on because

74
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.589
I was hoping we could find the remains of

75
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.000
a human ancestor. And, and you can see there

76
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.480
are no signs that say dig here or look

77
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.559
here, uh, and uh I was very fortunate in

78
00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:14.369
late October of 1973. Where I spotted a few

79
00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:18.380
bone fragments on the ground that uh constituted part

80
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.320
of a human knee. And we could tell it

81
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.799
was from a human knee because of the anatomy.

82
00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:27.109
And the anatomy told us that that knee worked

83
00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:29.829
the same way that your knee and my knee

84
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.589
works. In other words, it was from a creature

85
00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.779
that was walking upright. And, uh, within the world

86
00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.070
of mammals, as you well know, uh, humans really

87
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.540
stand out because we get from here to there

88
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.829
by walking on two legs. All other mammals walk

89
00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:52.510
on four legs. So we knew this was from

90
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.230
a human ancestor, and Maurice said, geologically, it looked

91
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.670
like it was from below a volcanic lava. That

92
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.790
eventually was dated at over 3 million years. We

93
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.309
now know that that knee was 3 is 3.4

94
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:16.549
million years. In in age. So all of a

95
00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:20.820
sudden we had the proof we needed that these

96
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.390
beautiful deposits behind me contained remains of humans. We

97
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.739
didn't know who that human was. We didn't know

98
00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:34.350
it it got the name Australopithecus, eventually, which, as

99
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.829
you said in your introduction, and named after the

100
00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:41.390
Aar region called Afaensis. But uh at the time,

101
00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.559
all we knew was it came from a creature

102
00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:49.089
that walked upright, and that For the very first

103
00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:52.369
time, was the proof we needed that this huge

104
00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:57.589
geological region contained fossils of our human ancestors, not

105
00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.730
just all kinds of mammals, but also those that

106
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.130
were an ancestor to later humans. And that was

107
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.329
what really launched uh our expeditions to this arena.

108
00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:17.019
And why were or even are still Lucy's fossil

109
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.470
remains so important.

110
00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:22.190
Well, Lucy, uh, we have to, you know, we

111
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.790
have to look back a little bit, uh, to

112
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.750
understand that, uh, in terms of what what we

113
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.559
knew at the time of her discovery. She was

114
00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:38.739
discovered the following year in 1973. Uh, WHEN I

115
00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:41.459
was out with one of my graduate students, and

116
00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:45.209
I happened to Look on the ground, I'm always

117
00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:48.829
looking at the ground and uh spotted a little

118
00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:53.489
piece of uh of elbow. Hm. And uh it

119
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:56.970
was just a small fragment, and I, I thought

120
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.920
this is not a monkey, this is not an

121
00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:01.369
antelope, this has to be from a human ancestor,

122
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.850
but it's so tiny. Well, I then thought the

123
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.989
knee was very small. Are all these pygmies or

124
00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:12.440
small people or what, what are they? And um

125
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.029
at that time, in the early 70s. In terms

126
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:23.250
of our understanding of human origins, everyone placed uh

127
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.769
the South African fossils, Australopithecus africanus, at the base

128
00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:32.979
of the human family tree that gave rise to

129
00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.940
everything from Homo habilis, uh, to robustus and Boisea,

130
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.630
and so on. And uh this discovery of Lucy

131
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.669
was going to be very critical in more closely

132
00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:52.190
examining that hypothesis, because Lucy was 40% complete. It

133
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.309
wasn't just a fragment of jaw. Uh, WE now

134
00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:59.070
knew that from the teeth, it belonged into the

135
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.030
genus Australopithecus. Uh, WE didn't know until 4 years

136
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.150
later, or announced till 4 years later. That she

137
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.159
represented a and she and the other fossils frompa

138
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:16.900
represented a new kind of human ancestry, more primitive,

139
00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:21.650
but walking upright, very small brain. That was a

140
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:27.349
much better candidate for the common ancestor. So, uh,

141
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.200
she. Really Caused us to reexamine the shape, the

142
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.369
geometry of the human family tree. And remove Africanus

143
00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:43.140
from a common ancestor to all the later branches.

144
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.809
And uh she led us to uh other fossils

145
00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:51.530
at the site, which indicated to us that this

146
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.179
was an early human species. We now know one

147
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:59.979
that lived close to a million years in eastern

148
00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:02.820
Africa, you know, you and I as Homo sapiens,

149
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.450
and maybe we've been around for 200, 250,000 years.

150
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.780
And that her species lived in Kenya, Tanzania, uh,

151
00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:17.909
Ethiopia, and probably also in North Central Africa in

152
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.909
Chad. So it was a very widespread species, geographically

153
00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:26.799
widespread, and it lasted a long time. Which meant

154
00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:30.200
that it was highly adaptable, that it could adapt

155
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.789
to different kinds of environments. And also, we learned

156
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:40.330
that the small individuals like Lucy, And like the

157
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:46.159
need. Uh, WERE from females. Uh, AND the males

158
00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:49.380
are much larger, that there was a large degree

159
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.710
of what we call sexual dimorphism that males were

160
00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:01.320
much larger, females much smaller. So this unleashed decades

161
00:11:01.609 --> 00:11:06.780
of uh re-examination of the earliest stages of uh

162
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.869
our our origins. And Lucy has continued to be

163
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.909
at the focal point. Of this research. Uh, WHENEVER

164
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.640
someone thinks about early humans, uh, and they pick

165
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.280
up their newspaper, I don't know what your local

166
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.479
newspaper is, but, um, and a new discovery is

167
00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:34.340
made, uh, in, in Africa, they always say, oh,

168
00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:37.239
it's older than Lucy, or younger than Lucy, or

169
00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:40.840
the same as Lucy, or different than Lucy. So,

170
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:48.390
Lucy continues to be that important comparison, comparison to

171
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.890
everything that is discovered. So she has become the

172
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:57.190
benchmark by which all other discoveries are compared and

173
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.179
evaluated. And uh it seems that uh Very frequently,

174
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:07.140
there are people who who find new aspects about

175
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.119
Lucy. For example, there's been recent research on the

176
00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:13.450
size of her brain, which was really quite small,

177
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.380
but the size of a good size orange. You

178
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.900
know, our brains are 3 or 4 times as

179
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.409
large as her brain. And um it it we've

180
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.700
been able to reconstruct those using technology in virtual

181
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.969
space to determine size of brain in bluey species.

182
00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:37.900
And it has shown us that uh already there

183
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.020
seems to be some natural selection for somewhat of

184
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.020
an increase in brain size. So, she, uh, and

185
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.020
all of her other, we have more than 500

186
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.070
specimens of her species now. So we have a

187
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:58.510
good understanding of her biology, and uh she continues

188
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.849
to be the real focal point of paleoanthropological research

189
00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.080
in this time period.

190
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:11.140
And what do we know about Australopithecus afarens? You

191
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.719
mentioned, for example, the places where these species lived

192
00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:18.929
in Africa, uh, but what other information do we

193
00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:22.880
know about it in terms of, for example, anatomy

194
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.809
and sociality? I mean, what other things do we

195
00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:27.500
know about it?

196
00:13:28.729 --> 00:13:33.950
Well, um, from, uh, there's, there's controversy about many

197
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.390
of these topics, but, uh, we have not found

198
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.469
any stone tools, uh, in association with any of

199
00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:45.669
the human fossils at Hawor. Uh, I think that

200
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:50.510
her species, uh, was not fashioning stone tools like

201
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.309
later species like Homo habilits, but we do know

202
00:13:54.309 --> 00:14:00.270
from uh discoveries at one fossil locality. Uh, WHICH

203
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.830
is called the first family. There are remains of

204
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:09.270
250 fragments of bones, including parts of skulls, uh,

205
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.070
a child's skull or baby skull, who died probably

206
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.789
around 3 years old, and so on, that there

207
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:19.109
are large specimens and small specimens, and there are

208
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.669
young specimens, and there are old specimens in this

209
00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:26.229
one geological layer, which means that they were certainly

210
00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:30.989
living in groups. Uh, LIKE modern chimpanzees, and I

211
00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:34.989
think when you are a biped like this, uh,

212
00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:38.280
and, uh, particularly in the case of females, Uh,

213
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.409
you need this protection of living in a group.

214
00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:44.020
So they were living in a group. Uh, WE

215
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.809
don't know exactly why this group died and was

216
00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:51.179
buried in this geological layer, but I suspect that

217
00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:55.340
they, their group size was not dissimilar, or may

218
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.280
have been very similar to what we see in

219
00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:01.780
in chimpanzees, maybe 30, 40 individuals. So, uh, and

220
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.039
we know that uh there is some extension of,

221
00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:11.440
of uh childhood, that they, uh, their brains continued

222
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.950
to grow. For a number of years after birth.

223
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.450
Uh, AND, uh, it means that there probably was

224
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.809
some particular care given to these offspring. They had

225
00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:30.200
more to learn about their world, let's say, than

226
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.469
a, than an average chimpanzee. Uh, WE know that,

227
00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:40.109
uh, from, uh, studies of isotopes. That uh they

228
00:15:40.109 --> 00:15:47.429
were um. Essentially vegetarians. Uh, WE know that, uh,

229
00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:53.119
they didn't just survive on vegetarians, because at the,

230
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.799
the, the particular locality where Lucy was found, uh,

231
00:15:57.809 --> 00:16:02.739
it's interesting, uh, during our excavations, we found a

232
00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:05.530
number of things that were surprising. We found uh

233
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.349
crocodile eggs. Uh, WHICH are more or less the

234
00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:13.500
shape of the eggs we have in our refrigerators,

235
00:16:13.909 --> 00:16:17.429
and we found round eggs, uh, which are turtle

236
00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:22.919
eggs. Uh AND uh what that suggested to us,

237
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.890
uh, was that Lucy had actually been buried in

238
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.489
a beach sand. Uh, IN the old, in the

239
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:35.130
ancient lake that was there, and perhaps she was

240
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.690
down at the edge of this lake, not only

241
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.440
to get a drink, uh, humans have to drink

242
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:47.219
every day, primates drink every day. And uh. But

243
00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:50.219
she may have been collecting turtle eggs or crocodile

244
00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:53.690
eggs, uh, and including them in in her diet.

245
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.979
She probably was climbing trees to eat and collect

246
00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:03.780
birds' eggs and small vertebrates, uh, and, uh, I

247
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.020
remember very vividly, one of our students on the

248
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.699
trip, uh, brought a a strange looking thing to

249
00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:16.660
me. Looked like an enormous canine, and upon further

250
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.819
examination, we realized it was a a claw of

251
00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.779
a crab. So maybe they enjoyed a nice crab

252
00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:29.798
dinner from time to time. Uh, BUT predominantly, uh,

253
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:32.938
the trace elements and the environment in which they

254
00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:35.098
live suggests and the and the wear on their

255
00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:40.499
teeth suggests that they were essentially vegetarians, but they

256
00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:44.739
certainly uh could have eaten um turtle eggs, crocodile

257
00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:48.400
eggs, and so on. And in a documentary I

258
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.369
did uh in the early 1990s. Uh, IF you've

259
00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:58.239
seen that, uh, I, uh, reconstruct had reconstructed Lucy

260
00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.089
using a, a, a, a twig or a blade

261
00:18:02.089 --> 00:18:06.369
of grass, taking termites like chimpanzees and eating the

262
00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:10.089
termites, which are a great source of protein, amino

263
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:14.109
acids, and so on. So, uh, I, no one

264
00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:17.349
ever had thought about that before, but of course

265
00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:22.410
if chimpanzees do it, why couldn't, uh, Australopithecus have

266
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.729
done this. So, uh, they were living in troops.

267
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.849
They probably weren't very dense on the landscape. There

268
00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:33.150
weren't a huge number of them on the landscape.

269
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.410
They were not big herd animals like the antelopes

270
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:42.819
and gazelles. Uh, SO they, they did live near

271
00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:46.540
a lake, a permanent source of water. And I

272
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.939
suspect uh that in many ways, uh they were

273
00:18:50.939 --> 00:18:55.670
very similar to uh chimpanzees and their behavior. Uh,

274
00:18:56.209 --> 00:19:02.319
BUT they were beginning to Probably move in a

275
00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:05.939
different direction in terms of social interaction with one

276
00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:10.199
another. We don't know for certain, um, we know

277
00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:14.949
they were lived in multi-male and multi-female groups. Uh,

278
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.270
AND we would love to know more, but, uh,

279
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.689
there are no, there are no signs of burials,

280
00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:25.209
there are no signs of elaborate tool making, so

281
00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:30.430
that, um, they were still, from our perspective, you

282
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.719
know, walking around with things like this, uh, quite

283
00:19:35.719 --> 00:19:40.900
different. And technologically nowhere as uh close to us

284
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.170
in terms of their uh cultural artifacts.

285
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:49.650
And what do we know about uh its phylogenetic

286
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.729
relationships? I mean, in terms of ominent species, what

287
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:57.890
were, or what are its closest relatives and how

288
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.729
does it relate to the homogenus?

289
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.630
Well, this is, this is a, a very exciting

290
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:12.219
time, uh, in paleoanthropology. Uh, YOU know, the 1970s

291
00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:16.439
in my first book, uh, called the, uh, the

292
00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:20.439
Golden Decade, you know, when my colleagues like Richard

293
00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:24.310
Leakey and uh his mother Mary Leakey were working

294
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.119
in Tanzania and in Kenya, finding fossil footprints of

295
00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:33.880
Lucy's species in Tanzania. Uh, THE late Richard Leakey

296
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.800
finding a new species, and, uh, some more complete

297
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.819
specimens of the early genus Homo, uh, up at

298
00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:47.189
Lake Rudolph, Lake Turana, as it's called now. And,

299
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.869
uh, there has been an increase in the number

300
00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:55.650
of specimens of various species, but today, One of

301
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.140
the, when, when I was asked uh uh during

302
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.979
the 80s and and 90s, what, what I thought

303
00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:07.300
was perhaps one of the most exciting aspects was

304
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.729
what is the relationship between Ahoensis and our own

305
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:16.650
genus Homo. Uh, SO your question is, is was

306
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.729
a question that all of us had for many

307
00:21:18.729 --> 00:21:24.630
years. And um we hypothesized, my colleagues and I

308
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.630
hypothesized that Lucy was a common ancestor to one

309
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.750
branch that led to our own genus, and led

310
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:39.209
also to other Australopithecus species. But the problem was

311
00:21:39.209 --> 00:21:43.770
it was a million years separating Lucy from the

312
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.579
genus Homo. And uh what was happening in that

313
00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:53.219
period? Well, scientists, I just spoke with one yesterday,

314
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.900
Kay Reed, who was at the Institute of Human

315
00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.630
Origins Emeritus now. But her team Uh, has found

316
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:08.469
a a lower jaw. Uh, THAT is, uh. About

317
00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:13.520
2.8 million Lucy's species went extinct about 3 million

318
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.910
years ago. So this is not long after Lucy's

319
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.739
species vanished, and in the front of the jaw,

320
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.150
you have a very angled chin. Uh, IN the

321
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.339
back of the jaw, you have a very homo

322
00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:33.060
arrangement of the teeth and jaws. So this appears

323
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.400
to be A descendant of Lucy, but it's placed

324
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.560
in the genus Homo. And uh it means that

325
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:49.400
uh there is a anatomical morphological connection between Lucy

326
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.310
species oferensis and early Homo. And in the mid

327
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.869
80s, uh a skull was found uh at Lake

328
00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:04.380
Turkana by uh Richard Leakey's team. Uh, THAT was

329
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.099
an Australopithecus, but it was a peculiar Australopithecus. It,

330
00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:11.030
it was called the black skull. It had a

331
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.020
very strong crest on the top of its skull,

332
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.829
but it had a very projecting face and enormous

333
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:21.829
teeth. Luy species did not have huge crushing and

334
00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:26.199
grinding teeth. So this specimen known as the black

335
00:23:26.199 --> 00:23:31.890
skull, or 17,000 is its Catalog number had a

336
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:38.530
projecting face like Lucy. But Massive muscles for mastication

337
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.689
for chewing and enormous crushing and grinding teeth, and

338
00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:45.630
it was at 2.5 million years, so it was

339
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.449
halfway between the disappearance of Lucy's species and the

340
00:23:50.449 --> 00:23:54.449
appearance of something we call nutcracker man, the skull

341
00:23:54.449 --> 00:23:57.930
that was found in 1959 at Oldvai Gorge by

342
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:03.069
Mary Leakey, which was this robust Australopithecus called Australopithecus

343
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:10.339
Boisea. So now we have a few connections. Between

344
00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:14.949
Lucy and later species of Homo, and later species

345
00:24:14.949 --> 00:24:20.130
of Australopithecus. So, uh, this is uh uh an

346
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.329
interesting hypothesis that we're working with right now. And

347
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.319
uh so that was one of the real focal

348
00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:30.339
points one of the real questions, you know, reporters

349
00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:33.459
would always say, what are the remaining questions? I

350
00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:36.760
said, well, there are, there, there are many questions

351
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.339
that I won't remaining questions that I won't bore

352
00:24:39.339 --> 00:24:42.630
you with, but the two major areas is where

353
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:48.550
did our genus come from? Homo Which ultimately led

354
00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:53.989
through some superorous route through phylogenetic changes to us,

355
00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:59.540
Homo sapiens. And uh what was the ancestor to

356
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.199
uh Lucy's species? BECAUSE Lucy was the only species

357
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:08.160
we had at that time between 3 and 4

358
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.000
million years. And it also seemed to me that

359
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.760
it was very strange that there were not other

360
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:21.479
species. So if we shift forward to today, Uh,

361
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:25.930
Richard Leakey's wife, Meeve Leakey, working south of Lake

362
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.479
Turkana, found uh a series of jaws and teeth.

363
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.939
Uh, THAT are clearly Australopithecus, and to evaluate those

364
00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:41.170
and to put them in perspective, or put a

365
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.900
forensis in perspective relative to them, they all came

366
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.260
to, uh, uh, M came with some of her

367
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.969
colleagues to my lab in Arizona, brought casts of

368
00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:57.209
everything. And we uh wrote a, a very important

369
00:25:57.209 --> 00:26:00.689
paper which showed that her fossils, which she called

370
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:07.530
Australopithecus animensis, was an immediate precursor to Aerensis. It

371
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.849
was Afareis, but even more primitive, had a very

372
00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:16.770
strong buttressing in the midline here. Uh, IT had

373
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.119
very straight tooth rows like you have in apes,

374
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.729
much straighter than what we see in our arns.

375
00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:27.510
And uh so this, this was suggested to be

376
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.319
a common ancestor or an ancestor to Lucy's species.

377
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:37.430
So, uh, most recently, uh, a team working in

378
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:43.619
the middle Awash area of Ethiopia found something. That

379
00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:48.180
is still uh under consideration by many people, because

380
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.729
we don't know uh if it really were really,

381
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.660
if it really was an ancestor to Animensis. And

382
00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.829
this was something called Ardipithecus ramidus. And it is

383
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.839
um a strange creature in many ways. It, it

384
00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:09.119
appears to be the beginnings of bipedalism. Uh, THERE

385
00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:12.619
are suggestions in the pelvis, but when you examine

386
00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:16.589
the foot, it has a foot like that. It's

387
00:27:16.589 --> 00:27:23.020
a grasping foot. For climbing, not necessarily adapted like

388
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.219
our foot, if we look, take our socks off

389
00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:27.859
and look at our feet, our big toe is

390
00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:30.060
in line with the rest of the foot, and

391
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.890
all these toes are shortened. So our foot is

392
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.209
not a grasping foot, but a way of helping

393
00:27:37.209 --> 00:27:42.439
us move forward. And uh it's got very long

394
00:27:42.439 --> 00:27:47.510
arms that come down uh below the knee, so,

395
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.560
uh, it was probably living a great deal in

396
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.930
the trees. Uh, AND, uh, there are not many

397
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.439
specimens well known of it. It's about 4.4 million

398
00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:03.609
years in age. Animensis uh goes back now very

399
00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:07.569
close to 4.3 million years. So is that enough

400
00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:12.160
time to evolve from a very ape-like creature to

401
00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:16.329
uh a creature that is more human-like? That's one

402
00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:20.209
of the big questions. And my colleague at the

403
00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:25.089
Institute of Human Origins, uh, Who is now director,

404
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.930
uh, I'm very uh happy that we got him

405
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.140
as a director. I'm, uh, will be retiring very

406
00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.739
shortly from university, but I stepped down as a

407
00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:41.780
director, and, uh, this is a, uh, fantastic, very

408
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:48.380
accomplished, uh, Ethiopian uh scholar named Johannes Haile Selassie.

409
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.790
He is, uh, he actually found the first bone

410
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:56.329
of Ardi Pitaggus Rainus. And um he is working

411
00:28:56.329 --> 00:29:00.689
in an area uh that I've known about since

412
00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:06.819
the early 70s, um, northeast of where Lucy was

413
00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:12.030
found, and uh he's finding uh one or two,

414
00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:15.660
maybe three different species at about the same time

415
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.800
as Lucy. And the big question is why was

416
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.040
there such diversity there and now no diversity at

417
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.699
Hat art. Uh, AND he found, he found a

418
00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:32.170
foot, a partial foot that shows that divergence. To

419
00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:36.670
that is contemporary with Lucy. Does that mean that

420
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:42.849
that was the Ardipithecus was a separate, independent lineage,

421
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.010
it lasted a long time, or was this just

422
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:52.859
parallel to it having given rise to Australopithecus? So

423
00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:55.250
there, there are a lot of new questions being

424
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.729
asked, and uh talking to my colleague Kay yesterday,

425
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.469
they found some new things uh at about 2.8

426
00:30:03.469 --> 00:30:08.750
million. Uh, THAT support the idea that perhaps, uh,

427
00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:11.800
there are more specimens of the genus Homo. It

428
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.439
has not been put into a species yet because

429
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:20.310
there's not enough diagnostic material. But uh they find

430
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:27.310
stone tools. At 2.6 million years, uh, hoping to

431
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.410
find them a little bit older. Uh, SO we're,

432
00:30:30.489 --> 00:30:34.959
we're, we're looking at an exciting time in paleoanthropology,

433
00:30:35.329 --> 00:30:39.760
when we're beginning to look at that very opaque

434
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.660
period of time between, say, 2.9 million and 2.5

435
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.810
million. And uh there are uh numerous uh scholars

436
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.560
uh working on this problem. And there's been a

437
00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.000
major development in Ethiopia. Uh, WE had a huge

438
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.800
conference last summer to celebrate the 50th anniversary of

439
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.780
uh Lucy's discovery. I can't believe that. I was

440
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.030
31 when I found that, today I'm 81, but

441
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.209
um I remember as if it was yesterday, and

442
00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:22.369
at that conference, what was so amazing, if I

443
00:31:22.369 --> 00:31:25.770
went to a conference like I did in Africa

444
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:30.030
in the early 1970s. There there were no African

445
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:35.000
scholars in the audience. Uh, AND, uh, just like

446
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.880
in, uh, in the United States, uh, we wouldn't

447
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.319
want all of these excavations of, uh, you know,

448
00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:47.709
Native American sites and so on being conducted by

449
00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:51.000
foreign scholars. We'd like to be participating in that

450
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.910
work. It's only natural. And over those many years,

451
00:31:56.199 --> 00:31:59.079
there have been efforts, uh, not just by me

452
00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:02.640
and my institute, the Institute of Human Origins. But

453
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.510
by many other scholars to train uh African scholars.

454
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:14.199
And this has been particularly uh notable in Ethiopia,

455
00:32:14.729 --> 00:32:19.050
where there are uh Ethiopians, a number of Ethiopians

456
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:23.739
who are undertaking their own expeditions and making their

457
00:32:23.739 --> 00:32:29.250
own discoveries. And making their own breakthroughs. Uh, Johannes

458
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.089
is a is a prime example of that. At

459
00:32:32.089 --> 00:32:35.560
the University of Chicago is a a close friend

460
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.890
of mine who did his postdoctoral work at the

461
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.199
Institute of Human Origins. His name is Zaa Alamseed.

462
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.640
And uh he was born and raised in uh

463
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:53.469
in Ethiopia. And uh he developed a real interest

464
00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:59.280
in uh human evolution. And uh made a discovery

465
00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.040
of a partial child skeleton, which is uh which

466
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.560
is 3.4 million years, 3.3 million years old, a

467
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.199
little bit older than Lucy, but the kind of

468
00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:13.719
baby that Lucy would have had. So he's now

469
00:33:13.719 --> 00:33:18.520
trying to understand how does a baby offers grow

470
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.560
up to an adult offererances? Is it slow? Is

471
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.310
it fast? Is it delayed, and so on. So,

472
00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:30.630
um, there are, and the Ethiopian government, the Ministry

473
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:35.189
of Culture in particular, uh, I met, uh, members

474
00:33:35.189 --> 00:33:39.069
of the ministry when I was there in August

475
00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:42.550
to give a, a very important paper, uh, to

476
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.270
open this big conference celebrating Lucy, and there are,

477
00:33:46.349 --> 00:33:50.270
there are laboratories. Uh, THERE'S a major building that's

478
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.430
been built to invite scholars from around the world

479
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.719
to come and study these fossils. So, uh, as

480
00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:01.290
we look back, uh, as it takes a long

481
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:06.390
time to study and understand and interpret these fossils,

482
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.870
it, you know, I always, I have an expression

483
00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:14.159
in that I use in my life that the

484
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:20.259
road to success is always under construction. No matter

485
00:34:20.259 --> 00:34:24.748
how hard you try, there's something happens. And uh

486
00:34:24.947 --> 00:34:28.039
it took a long time for this to happen

487
00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:31.888
in Ethiopia. It took almost 50 years. But now

488
00:34:31.888 --> 00:34:35.858
there are Ethiopian scholars who are doing cutting edge

489
00:34:35.858 --> 00:34:40.569
research, are as qualified as any researcher in the

490
00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:44.389
world. Uh, AS opposed to when I first began

491
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:49.010
in Ethiopia in 1970, uh, there were no laboratories,

492
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:52.938
there was no real place to store these fossils.

493
00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.000
There was no place to study them. There, there

494
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.320
were, there were these fossils were taken abroad to

495
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.159
be discovered, but everything has been returned to Ethiopia.

496
00:35:04.199 --> 00:35:08.280
It's all housed in the National Museum in Addis

497
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.110
Ababa. So, we're seeing the results of uh years

498
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.949
of study of the fossils, and years of efforts

499
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:23.129
to to bring African scholars into the research arena

500
00:35:23.129 --> 00:35:27.719
so that they themselves can organize their own teams,

501
00:35:27.919 --> 00:35:31.639
raise their own funds, make their own discoveries, and

502
00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:35.159
interpret the fossils that they themselves and their teams

503
00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:41.770
have discovered. So, Lucy was not only important for

504
00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:46.459
our understanding of human origins, not only important as

505
00:35:46.459 --> 00:35:51.020
a benchmark. If uh it seems that no matter

506
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.389
where I go, if I'm getting my by going

507
00:35:54.389 --> 00:35:57.110
to my doctor, for example, and the doctor will

508
00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.469
say, well, now your name sounds very familiar to

509
00:35:59.469 --> 00:36:01.590
me. What, what, what do you do? And I

510
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.639
said, Well, I'm an anthropologist. And he said, well,

511
00:36:04.709 --> 00:36:08.129
what kind of anthropologist? I say, I know Lucy,

512
00:36:08.389 --> 00:36:11.030
you know, she brought it all to the public.

513
00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:15.070
She brought human origins, the subject of human origins

514
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:21.310
to a worldwide audience. And thirdly, these early discoveries

515
00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:25.969
uh stimulated uh all of us, as well as

516
00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:29.360
the Ethiopian government to see how important it was

517
00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:34.409
to develop this research in Ethiopia itself with Ethiopian

518
00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:39.429
scholars. So, um, there is, there are people who

519
00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:41.770
have just come back from the field. Johannes just

520
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.729
came back from the field. I haven't spoken to

521
00:36:43.729 --> 00:36:46.280
him as to what he and his team have

522
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.830
discovered. But, uh, certainly there, there are going to

523
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.899
be many more discoveries made in Ethiopia to help

524
00:36:52.899 --> 00:36:57.149
us understand that transition from, uh, for instance, to

525
00:36:57.149 --> 00:37:01.669
Homo, and from Homo, whatever it is, we don't

526
00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:05.300
have a name for that earlier species yet, uh,

527
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:08.389
to the emergence of things like Homo habilis and

528
00:37:08.389 --> 00:37:08.830
so on.

529
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.850
OK, so let's talk then now about Homo habilis.

530
00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:17.370
Uh, YOU have also done some work on it

531
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.320
on this species. What do we know about it

532
00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.560
and its phylogenetic relationships?

533
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:29.090
Homo habilis, it probably goes back to about 2.4

534
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.040
million years, 2.3 million years. Uh, WE found, uh,

535
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:37.080
at the site of Hadar, uh, a complete, fairly

536
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.540
complete upper jaw. Which is completely different from an

537
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.139
Australopithecus jaw. It has a very high dome to

538
00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:48.100
the top of the mouth. There's a palate, for

539
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.899
example, uh, the teeth are very different, uh, the

540
00:37:52.899 --> 00:37:54.979
shape of the front of the nose is very

541
00:37:54.979 --> 00:37:58.620
different. So it belongs in the genus Homo. Uh,

542
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.500
WE'VE been reluctant to put it into a species,

543
00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:05.209
but there are aspects that are similar to Homo

544
00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:11.510
habilis. It was originally named in 1964. With discoveries

545
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:18.159
at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by uh Louis Leakey

546
00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:24.330
and uh Philip Tobias and John Napier. Uh, AND,

547
00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:28.120
uh, It is, uh, it, it has a larger

548
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.550
brain size, um, it's probably, you know, A few

549
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.199
100 cubic centimeters larger than what we're seeing in

550
00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:41.550
Australopithecus, maybe as much as uh twice the size

551
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:47.010
of Australopithecus, uh, associated with stone tools. Uh, ASSOCIATED

552
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:52.139
with butchered bones. Uh, CONTROVERSY as to whether or

553
00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:54.370
not they were really doing much hunting or just

554
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.929
scavenging, but they were now including a significant amount

555
00:38:58.929 --> 00:39:04.360
of meat in their diet. And uh meat is

556
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.159
very important because it is a high energy food.

557
00:39:10.189 --> 00:39:15.260
And as opposed to um predominantly being a vegetarian.

558
00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:20.679
We think that real hunting, that is having a

559
00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:23.419
strategy to go out and hunt and kill an

560
00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:29.080
animal, uh, really only traced back to about 1.5

561
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.550
million years in things like homo or gastro, that

562
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:38.790
Homo habilis was, uh, probably more of a scavenger.

563
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.060
But it was making regular tools, which are called

564
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.179
Ooin tools after old divide. And those old one

565
00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:52.860
tools can now be traced back to about 2.6

566
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.020
million years. So they were making uh stone tools

567
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.020
for quite a long time. We don't have any

568
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:07.699
cranial material from this 2.3 to 3 million year

569
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:10.100
time period, so we don't know what their faces

570
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.139
looked like, how large their brains were, how their

571
00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:17.189
bodies were built, and so on. But uh and

572
00:40:17.189 --> 00:40:22.459
what is interesting about Homo habilis is that. The

573
00:40:22.459 --> 00:40:26.739
one specimen that uh a team I led to

574
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:32.620
Tanzania found. Uh, IN the, in the 80s. Uh,

575
00:40:32.949 --> 00:40:39.530
WHICH is called Olvi hominid 65. Uh, IS that

576
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.080
it's got, um, Relatively long arms like you see

577
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.929
in. Australopius. So that ties Homo there again to

578
00:40:50.929 --> 00:40:57.080
Australopithecus. And um so there's a big discussion as

579
00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.919
to whether there is only one or more species

580
00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:07.260
than Homo habits living in contemporaneously. Uh, AND the

581
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.530
suggestion is that, uh, the hypothesis right now is

582
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:16.250
that to havelis did give rise to the African,

583
00:41:16.939 --> 00:41:20.360
uh, Homo erectus, which is called the Homo ergaster.

584
00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:26.699
Uh, AND, uh, in Homo orgaster, the Turkana boy

585
00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:29.709
found at Lake Turkana is a fairly, it's so

586
00:41:29.709 --> 00:41:33.500
wonderfully complete specimen. I just saw it, uh. A

587
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.429
couple of months ago when I was in Nairobi.

588
00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:38.139
And I've, I've seen it over the years, but

589
00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:41.340
it's, it's, it has a body like us. It

590
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.459
has a long, narrow body. It has a very

591
00:41:46.459 --> 00:41:51.659
long legs, relatively short arms, it has a larger

592
00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:55.800
cranial capacity, close to 1200 cubic centimeters, almost 3

593
00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.540
times the size of Lucy's. Uh, AND is associated

594
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.229
with stone tools and butchered animals. So Homo habilis,

595
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.110
uh, as always seems to be going undergoing some

596
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.909
sort of revision. There's this specimen along. In Homo

597
00:42:13.909 --> 00:42:18.629
habilis or should it be in homogaster and uh.

598
00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:23.159
We do need further materials to see if there

599
00:42:23.159 --> 00:42:26.500
were multiple species living at that at that early

600
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:31.800
time. But uh once we began to include meat

601
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.689
in our diet, Um, it, it was very important

602
00:42:36.689 --> 00:42:40.840
for the development of, uh, Our most important organ,

603
00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:44.699
which is our brain. Uh, OUR brains are, are

604
00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:47.750
one of the hungriest parts of our body. We

605
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:53.070
use a lot of calories. And um you, if

606
00:42:53.070 --> 00:43:01.260
you look at vegetarians, Uh, within mammals. Generally, uh,

607
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.500
and I'm not talking about humans, uh, my wife

608
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:08.659
is a vegetarian, but, uh, But uh uh animals

609
00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:12.899
that are vegetarians, they're not very Intelligent, they're not

610
00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:16.520
very bright. Um, YOU know, they, it, it doesn't

611
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.949
take a lot of intelligence. To for for herbivores.

612
00:43:22.709 --> 00:43:27.469
To run down bushes or grass, right? It's just

613
00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:30.120
there. But they have to eat all the time.

614
00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:32.290
They're eating all day long. You go out, I,

615
00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:36.090
I was out yesterday and there were a bunch

616
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.889
of sheep, uh, nearby, and, uh, you know, they're

617
00:43:39.889 --> 00:43:42.250
out there to cut the grass down, and they're

618
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:47.449
just eating all day. Um, BUT her but carnivores

619
00:43:47.449 --> 00:43:50.959
on the other hand, whether it's your family cat,

620
00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:55.370
uh or uh a coyote, which we have in

621
00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:01.850
California, uh, and Arizona. Um, THEY, they're, they, they're

622
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.689
brighter animals because they have to strategize, and it

623
00:44:05.689 --> 00:44:09.209
takes more brain cells to do that, to hunt

624
00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:13.520
down and kill their animals. And uh I think

625
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.909
that as our earliest ancestors were tied so closely

626
00:44:18.909 --> 00:44:22.840
to the African, a common ancestor with the African

627
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:27.739
apes, that they were vegetarians, there were dietary restrictions

628
00:44:27.739 --> 00:44:31.780
on feeding a brain. But once you had a

629
00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.780
high energy food source on a regular basis, like.

630
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:43.860
Uh, ANIMAL meat. Uh, THERE was natural selection for

631
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.770
larger brains. I mean, larger brains, better tools, better

632
00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:52.479
tools, more meat, larger brains in that feedback circle.

633
00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:56.810
So, uh, meat eating became very, very important, uh,

634
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.469
after, uh, 2 million years ago, and, uh, certainly

635
00:45:01.469 --> 00:45:06.610
is evident in the bones we find. Associated with

636
00:45:06.929 --> 00:45:11.610
Homo habits. For example, uh, at Olduvai, uh, have

637
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.620
you been to Africa?

638
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.830
Uh, NO, not yet.

639
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.399
OK. Well, when you go to Olduvai, as I

640
00:45:18.399 --> 00:45:22.399
hope you will someday, uh, you will see that

641
00:45:22.399 --> 00:45:26.840
the animal bones, the antelope bones and hippo bones

642
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.300
and whatever, are all broken up. You know, they're

643
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.060
smashed, and if you look closely, you can see

644
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.290
cut marks on them. So those cut marks were

645
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.969
made by stone tools, which were obviously in the

646
00:45:40.969 --> 00:45:47.739
hand of Homo habilits probably. Uh, DID Australopithecus Boisia

647
00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:51.909
use stone tools? I don't think so, but We'll

648
00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:57.820
see. And um so they were uh beginning to

649
00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:03.969
scavenge carnivore kills. And if you, uh, as I've

650
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:08.489
uh seen uh animal kills in Africa many times.

651
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.979
Uh, EVEN the hyenas can't get into some of

652
00:46:11.979 --> 00:46:16.300
these bones that have a very thick, uh, cortex

653
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.300
to them. But if you've got a, a, a,

654
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:25.239
a hammer stone. And small flakes to disarticulate the

655
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:29.510
skeleton and run away with a leg or whatever,

656
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.760
and you smash these bones and you open them,

657
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.260
there's bone marrow inside. And that was a meat,

658
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.300
it was a source of protein and energy that

659
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:45.919
uh even other animals couldn't. Get to Uh, but

660
00:46:45.919 --> 00:46:50.449
early humans could. And, uh, meat, once meat comes

661
00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:54.330
into the diet, I think we largely move in

662
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.169
a very different direction to a much more sophisticated

663
00:46:59.169 --> 00:47:05.919
uh groups living together, more sophisticated technology, um, and,

664
00:47:05.929 --> 00:47:08.850
uh, of course, uh, when we look around the

665
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:14.429
world today, uh, we were hunter gatherers until Well,

666
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:19.350
1214 1000 years ago, very good hunter gatherers worldwide.

667
00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.959
Uh, EVERYBODY was a hunter gatherer or a hunter

668
00:47:22.959 --> 00:47:27.959
fisher or fisher gatherer or whatever. But once agriculture

669
00:47:27.959 --> 00:47:32.270
came in and gave us even more leisure time,

670
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:39.719
Uh, our cultural innovations just rose asymptotically, uh, just

671
00:47:39.719 --> 00:47:42.199
in my lifetime of 50 years, when I think

672
00:47:42.199 --> 00:47:45.800
back to, you know, typing my doctoral dissertation on

673
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.280
an old typewriter, um, and today I have this

674
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.199
wonderful computer in front of me. Uh, SO, culturally,

675
00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:59.899
we're evolving very, very quickly. Um, SO, uh, the

676
00:47:59.899 --> 00:48:04.050
innovations, early innovations that were made, uh, set the

677
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:09.739
stage for advancements, and I think that the inclusion

678
00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:14.570
of, of even scavenged meat, uh, had a very

679
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.050
important impact on uh our evolutionary trajectory.

680
00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:22.219
Mhm. So, let me just ask you one final

681
00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:26.409
question because we've already done around 50 50 minutes.

682
00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:31.260
Do we know which was the first species of

683
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:35.419
the Homo genus? I mean, we have Homoaboles, you

684
00:48:35.419 --> 00:48:39.060
mentioned Homo ergaster. We also have Homo erectus. I

685
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:44.330
mean, was any of these species the first one

686
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.379
of the homogeneus or not?

687
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.550
Well, I, I, I think, uh, I think that

688
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:56.459
the, the mandible I mentioned at 2.8 million. Uh,

689
00:48:56.629 --> 00:49:03.399
IS, uh, Really almost half a million years older

690
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:08.360
than Habilis. And uh I would suspect it was

691
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.909
a different species, but we, we don't have enough

692
00:49:12.909 --> 00:49:17.639
of it to conclusively show that it's that different

693
00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:20.479
from Homo habits. So we have to, we have

694
00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:24.989
to get we have to get more material, um,

695
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.419
but I, I, I would go as far as

696
00:49:28.419 --> 00:49:36.100
to say. That the earliest homo. WAS A descendant

697
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:42.090
of Lucy's species of forensis. And That as far

698
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:46.379
as we know, this was an event. That happened

699
00:49:46.379 --> 00:49:53.439
in eastern Africa. And We are beginning to understand

700
00:49:53.729 --> 00:50:00.000
much more completely. Uh, THE, uh, a very important

701
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.020
boundary. In our evolutionary record. That before 3 million

702
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.699
years, we have only Australopithecus. After 3 million years.

703
00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:18.139
More recently, we have Australopithecus and Homo. So Homo

704
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:22.760
arrived around 3 million years ago, was my estimate.

705
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:30.709
And that uh Why did Afarensis disappear? Why were

706
00:50:30.709 --> 00:50:35.229
there new species of Australopithecus, and why did Homo

707
00:50:35.229 --> 00:50:38.250
appear around 3 million years? Well, what we know

708
00:50:38.909 --> 00:50:44.020
is that there was a significant climate change around

709
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:52.149
3 million years. And that climate change. Uh, Generally

710
00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:56.449
speaking, was a period when there was a drier

711
00:50:56.449 --> 00:51:01.959
period. And uh many of the more forested areas

712
00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:06.330
were beginning to disappear. And more open areas. I

713
00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:11.679
don't wanna say, you know, grasslands, woodlands, uh, began

714
00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:18.689
to appear. And We also interestingly see. That there

715
00:51:18.689 --> 00:51:22.580
were uh there was a uh explosion in the

716
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:29.909
diversity of herbivores. Uh, BIG herd herbivores like antelopes

717
00:51:29.909 --> 00:51:34.879
and gazelles that came in from Asia. And uh

718
00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:38.620
a diversity of some primates like baboons, which were

719
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:44.540
essentially herbivores and perhaps grass eaters. Uh, IN some

720
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:50.219
instances are seed eaters. And um. There was a

721
00:51:50.219 --> 00:51:53.340
there was a period of competition for for those

722
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:59.189
vegetarian food sources. And some of them specialized in

723
00:51:59.399 --> 00:52:04.590
strict vegetarianism, like robustus or Boise I or Nutcracker

724
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:09.679
man, that that group of robust Australopithecus, but they

725
00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:17.139
made the evolutionary mistake. That so many species do.

726
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.149
They don't know where they're evolving to. They became

727
00:52:20.149 --> 00:52:25.340
so specialized that when uh they had competition from

728
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:31.479
herd animals like gazelles and antelopes and baboons, um,

729
00:52:32.179 --> 00:52:37.149
They lost out Because they were just outnumbered, and

730
00:52:37.149 --> 00:52:42.580
they had less uh availability for the vegetarian diets

731
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:46.469
that they had developed. The other lineage that evolved

732
00:52:46.469 --> 00:52:50.260
into homo. That we get the earliest tools at

733
00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.310
2.6 million years, and there are supposedly tools at

734
00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:59.060
3 and 3.3 and these large tools at at

735
00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.570
Olduva or at uh Lake Jacana, but they're not

736
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:07.500
Oduin tools, they're just bashing tools. Uh, THERE are

737
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:12.219
cut marks on one bone from afarensis layer, but

738
00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:15.179
there are no tools nearby. Were those really made

739
00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:20.399
by purposeful stone tools or? Were they made by

740
00:53:20.399 --> 00:53:24.290
some other agency we don't know. But uh once

741
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:29.399
tools came into the record, it, it changed significantly.

742
00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:35.270
Um, THE availability of certain kinds of food. Um,

743
00:53:35.439 --> 00:53:39.179
WHICH, uh, I think early homo was beginning to

744
00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:43.889
exploit. And uh when you, uh, as I said,

745
00:53:43.969 --> 00:53:46.250
when once you, if you go to all the,

746
00:53:46.449 --> 00:53:48.489
all the bones are broken up because they're getting

747
00:53:48.489 --> 00:53:52.120
marrow and meat and so on. And I think

748
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:58.370
this begins uh fairly early, around just after Lucy's

749
00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:04.469
disappearance. And uh if that's the case, um, It

750
00:54:04.469 --> 00:54:08.310
means that there was a really different behavioral change,

751
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:12.679
a very significant behavioral change, that was ultimately influenced

752
00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:16.120
by competition for food sources, which was brought about

753
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.239
by changes in the environment. So, uh, I am

754
00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:25.310
eager to see a team find more complete homo,

755
00:54:25.959 --> 00:54:29.760
uh, at 2.5 to 3 million, to see what

756
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.909
that creature looks like, uh, to see if it

757
00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:39.110
retains a lot of our creatures. What changed first,

758
00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:42.560
uh, we know with the robust Australopithecus that the

759
00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.830
first thing that changed were the sizes of teeth.

760
00:54:46.209 --> 00:54:49.219
And the huge chewing muscles, and only later did

761
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:52.879
the faces become flat. So we're beginning to understand

762
00:54:52.879 --> 00:54:55.889
the sequence, and it's very important to understand not

763
00:54:55.889 --> 00:55:00.679
only uh the tempo, the speed of evolutionary change,

764
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.709
but the the kind of evolutionary change. And that

765
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.800
is where I think the field will be the

766
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.800
fieldwork will be so vitally important to help us

767
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.550
understand the emergence of Homo and its uh diversity.

768
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.449
Uh, SINCE you mentioned that, uh, as a last

769
00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.580
question, let me just ask you then, apart from

770
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:26.860
what you mentioned there, what would be other questions

771
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.889
about the ominent evolution that you would like to

772
00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:34.250
see answered in the near future?

773
00:55:35.439 --> 00:55:39.280
Well, I think, uh, uh, one of them is

774
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.439
uh very specifically where Johannes is working with 2

775
00:55:43.439 --> 00:55:47.439
or 3 species, uh, between 3 and 4 million

776
00:55:47.439 --> 00:55:51.080
years. Uh, WHY are there so many species there?

777
00:55:51.149 --> 00:55:53.439
And in Hadar there was only 1 species of

778
00:55:53.439 --> 00:56:00.270
Australopithecus. That's one. Crucial question. Um, THE other crucial

779
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:08.310
question is, um, What is the relationship of Ardipithecus

780
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.550
to later humans? And, uh, you know, once you

781
00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:16.870
get back over 4 million years, uh, I think

782
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:18.909
we're going to find some surprises that there may

783
00:56:18.909 --> 00:56:23.870
be different species there. Uh, AND, uh, so I

784
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:29.699
think we're still focused on, um, species diversity, different

785
00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:35.739
adaptations, uh, and, uh, ancestor descendant relationships between these

786
00:56:35.739 --> 00:56:39.520
early Pleo Pleistocene hominids. Mhm.

787
00:56:39.899 --> 00:56:43.330
Great. So let's leave it there, Doctor Johanson. Thank

788
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.739
