00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.390
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.280
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.279
today I'm joined by Doctor Laura Betzig. She's a

4
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.640
PhD in anthropology at Northwestern University, and she's held

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.639
research and teaching positions at Northwestern, the University of

6
00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:21.629
California, and the University of Michigan. And today we're

7
00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:26.010
talking about her latest book, The Badge of Lost

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.409
Innocence, A History of the West. So, Doctor Betsy,

9
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.889
welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure to

10
00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:33.090
everyone.

11
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.750
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.819
So, in the book, you try to quote unquote

13
00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.580
understand human history as natural history. Could you explain

14
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.950
that?

15
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.720
Yeah, um, I'm gonna start by asking you a

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.430
question.

17
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:52.169
OK.

18
00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.130
Did you know that the vast majority of animals

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.970
in the vast majority of species are solitary, that

20
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.130
they live alone?

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.209
Uh, I don't think I was aware of that,

22
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.449
no. Sociality is super uncommon. Only about 3% of

23
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.339
all mammals and 9% of all bird species live

24
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:18.449
in groups. About 90 98% of species overall are

25
00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:22.449
solitary. There are exceptions for small periods of time,

26
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
sexual organisms have to get together, and mothers and

27
00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.849
young will stay together for short periods of time,

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.580
but most animals for most of the time, live

29
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.059
alone. Um, Any idea why that is?

30
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.720
Uh, I don't think so.

31
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.330
OK, well, uh, naturalists have thought about this for

32
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.529
a while, and one of the most obvious reasons

33
00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:52.040
is that parasites love a crowd. If you're gonna

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.589
live alone, your parasite loads gonna go way down.

35
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.510
Another is that groups are more conspicuous to predators.

36
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.940
You're less likely to get picked off if you're

37
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.160
hiding it all by yourself and if you're trying

38
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.449
to hide with a bunch of other animals. Uh,

39
00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.000
THE most important problem is that when you find

40
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.710
a good Spot with lots of good resources. You

41
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.080
can have it all to yourself if you're alone,

42
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.059
if you're in a group, you have to compete

43
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.589
for everything there. You have to compete for food

44
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.789
and water, you have to compete if you're a

45
00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:33.050
sexual reproducer for mates. It's much easier to do

46
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.190
it yourself. So the next question is, Why does

47
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.309
anybody bother to live in groups all the time?

48
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.039
Why do we? We're obviously an extreme outlier. Uh,

49
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.360
WE not only are never an island, we live

50
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.270
in groups of, what's the population of India now?

51
00:02:53.649 --> 00:03:00.779
1.5 billion. Pretty, pretty unparalleled. The, again, the answer

52
00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.690
that naturalists have come up with is that where

53
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.470
it, where resources are patchy, where resources aren't evenly

54
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.039
distributed across space, um, Animals tend to clump. Um,

55
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.009
THE cost of leaving a good patch might be

56
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.039
high enough that you're willing to put up with

57
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.850
a little bit of bullying from somebody bigger and

58
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.360
stronger, uh, a smaller portion of a good piece

59
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.479
of fruit or a good piece of a carcass

60
00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:40.110
is is worth more than Nothing. If, if, if

61
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.990
the, if the option is wandering off in the

62
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.990
desert or, or trying to get across the mountain.

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.190
And so, I, I mean, uh, the, in answering

64
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.610
my question, I, I mean, what after all of

65
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.229
that, what would you say then? I mean, what

66
00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.360
is it to understand human history as natural history?

67
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.820
So, um. The first question is, if, if people

68
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.460
are animals, why do they live in groups? And

69
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.779
the answer again for across species is animals put

70
00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.260
up with all the inherent costs of living in

71
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.940
groups because they find They clumped resources and they

72
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.809
clump around good resources, especially where there are barriers

73
00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.390
to flight. If, if you're if you're on an

74
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.269
oasis and you're surrounded by desert, you end up

75
00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:36.549
living in groups and you end up putting up

76
00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:41.019
with inequality. The other important component of that argument,

77
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.750
history as natural history, is that inequality will increase

78
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.989
to the extent that the cost-benefit ratio goes up.

79
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.989
If, if the costs of escaping from that patch

80
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.559
are high enough, again, if you're surrounded by desert

81
00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:58.869
or there's a big mountain range, can't get over,

82
00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.040
um, the costs of leaving are high enough and

83
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.880
the benefits of staying are high enough because the

84
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.679
resources are very rich. Then you put up with

85
00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:16.059
increasing inequality. Increasing variance in dominance and reproductive success,

86
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.459
which is as a natural historian would put it

87
00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.420
about other organisms and is, and, and is how

88
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.619
I initially would have put it about people. There

89
00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:30.600
are more, there's more political. There is political skill

90
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.690
and there's more skewing family size. Mhm.

91
00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:38.859
But uh, I mean, in regards then to human

92
00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:41.649
history, what is the premise of your book? What

93
00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:44.559
do you try to, try to tackle here?

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.410
All right, good. So when I, when I started

95
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.890
looking at human histories, natural history, I was in

96
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.619
a natural history museum, um, I was surprised to

97
00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:04.220
find that. People Like other animals do. Parallel Political

98
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.779
skew with reproductive skew. We live, we live in

99
00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.760
a society where We pretty much expect everybody to

100
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.690
have. Similar reproductive opportunities and similar political opportunities. Uh,

101
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.929
OBVIOUSLY, we're flawed in both respects, but it's, it's

102
00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:24.809
what we expect and um as I started to

103
00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:29.970
read the anthropological record and um and then started

104
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.839
to read history, it became obvious that we're very

105
00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.410
much like animals in the sense that We, we

106
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.049
do vary a lot in political skew and where

107
00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:45.950
there is Despotism, extreme differences in power, you get

108
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.950
extreme differences in in family size, you get unit

109
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.989
guarded harems invariably, and you get lots and lots

110
00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:58.309
of castrated slaves. It's a, it's a hideous picture.

111
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.989
It's not nothing that I was expecting, it's nothing

112
00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:03.250
that I have been used to in my own

113
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.549
life, but it's, it's a fact of history and

114
00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:13.260
prehistory is all about. Minor differences in power and

115
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.369
reproductive differences, and trying to get away from them.

116
00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:21.100
Foragers, foragers as a rule, migrate. That's why we've

117
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.619
covered the earth. We've been running away from each

118
00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:29.100
other. Um, YEAH, I, I, Richard Lee, who studied

119
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.130
the best known foragers in the last century, the

120
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.260
congressman of Kalahari, kept saying in his, uh, famous

121
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.829
book, Hunters say to hell with it, when, when

122
00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:46.149
conflicts get High enough, they pick up what little

123
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:49.070
they have and vote with their feet. Foragers have

124
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:55.010
latitude to vote with their feet. And Agriculturalists, Neolithic

125
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.279
societies in general do not. So across the board,

126
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.500
agricultural societies, pre-modern agricultural societies, for instance, all of

127
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.299
the 1st 66 civilizations, um, were very, very sedentary,

128
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:16.220
and they were very, very unequal politically and reproductively.

129
00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:21.279
I wanted to write this book because The problem

130
00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:26.200
didn't become, was no longer, um, why are, why

131
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.559
are we Skewed like animal societies are. Why are

132
00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:34.099
we so fair? The problem is Why did we

133
00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:38.010
stop being unfair? What, what made us so odd?

134
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.599
Again, all of prehistory and all of history is

135
00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:47.900
all about. Inequality and trying to avoid situations where

136
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.270
some big men can beat up on little men,

137
00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:52.409
and big women can beat up on little women.

138
00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:55.469
Why did we get to stop running away and

139
00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:59.989
at the same time, Write the Declaration of Independence

140
00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:03.849
and expect most people to have. A couple of

141
00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:08.849
children. What, what made that happen? It's an important

142
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:13.960
question, and I've spent decades reading. Western history, mainly

143
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.099
because that's where the change first began, trying to

144
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.609
figure out. What accounts for? That's what the book

145
00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:21.099
is about.

146
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.070
Great, and we're going to talk about that. And

147
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.059
in the book, you talk about human events as

148
00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:34.059
competition for genetic representation in future generations. Could you

149
00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:34.580
explain that?

150
00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:37.280
That's pretty much what I was just talking about.

151
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:43.090
When I say um. Animals compete to reproduce. Individuals

152
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.289
compete to reproduce. That's exactly what they're trying to

153
00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:50.820
do. They're, they have evolved to. Uh, Pass their

154
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.260
gametes on and, and increase their gene genetication in

155
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.309
future generations. That's what life is about, that's what

156
00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:00.799
natural selection is about. Mhm.

157
00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:04.159
And what aspects of the theory of evolution by

158
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.640
natural selection do you think would be important for

159
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.400
people to keep in mind for the kinds of

160
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.469
questions you explore in the book?

161
00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:16.760
The, the key um refinement of the theory which

162
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.039
happened with the modern synthesis in the middle of

163
00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:23.400
the last century. Was in understanding that selection, natural

164
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.460
selection is most potent at the level of the

165
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.460
individual, not at the level of the gene or

166
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.859
the individual or at the level of the group.

167
00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:34.789
So individuals by and large, have evolved to compete

168
00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:37.349
with each other uh than groups to compete with

169
00:10:37.349 --> 00:10:39.789
each other or genes within the genome to compete

170
00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:42.440
with each other. That's why we get the kinds

171
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.859
of societies that we see.

172
00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:48.400
Mhm. And going all the way back, back to

173
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.940
100,000 years ago, what aspects of hunter-gatherer societies would

174
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.700
you highlight which you think are important for how

175
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.450
you present our history in your book?

176
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:09.469
Again, just touched on that previously, um. Most foraging

177
00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:13.760
societies are not tied to the land. And the

178
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.859
20 or 300,000 year history of Homo sapiens is

179
00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:23.119
a history of migration. We Start one on one

180
00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:26.320
little patch and exhaust it or are exhausted by

181
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.119
others in our group, and we say, we have

182
00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:31.000
very little to carry, we, we pick up and

183
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.770
we move somewhere else and we've been again, running

184
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.280
away from each other for as long as we've

185
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.159
been human, and we've populated the entire, covered the

186
00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:47.280
entire earth as a result. Um, I, I want

187
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.549
to point out, I know you've interviewed a couple

188
00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:52.799
of people like Banvi Singh and, and, uh, Luke

189
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:58.130
Levay and, um, and They're aware that in the

190
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.849
ethnographic record and now in the archaeological record, there,

191
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:06.669
there is evidence that In, uh, some preliterate societies,

192
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:12.380
some foraging societies, resources are good enough that, um,

193
00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:17.679
migration. Go way down. Um, AND the, the, the

194
00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:19.679
examples that are best known in the ethnographic record

195
00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:23.239
are the Northwest coast, the US or the southwest

196
00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:27.080
coast of the US where um you had tons

197
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.890
of marine resources and salmon runs and wild berries

198
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:36.599
and uh all kinds of resources. Clumped on Vancouver

199
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:40.349
Island or along the northwest coast, and mountain ranges

200
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:42.710
to the east and the vast ocean that you

201
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.270
couldn't cross to the west. So people were hemmed

202
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.070
in and they were very happy to be hemmed

203
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.159
in because the resources were enormous. So they were

204
00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:56.219
foragers, they weren't Neolithic, but they were highly skewed.

205
00:12:56.429 --> 00:13:01.760
You had chiefs, you had Big cedar houses with

206
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.030
uh one she had at least 10 wives and

207
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.840
um 50 slaves, mostly were captives, most of them

208
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.640
women, and he had sexual access to all of

209
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.520
them. So, all foraging societies for all of our

210
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.280
prehistory were probably not completely egalitarian societies, where we

211
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.169
found a good patch, we probably stuck on it

212
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.669
and um put up with a little bit of

213
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.830
unfairness, or sometimes a lot of unfairness.

214
00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:32.979
And what is the importance of the freedom to

215
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.179
move, and I think we'll come back to this

216
00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:38.020
topic later on in our conversation toward the end

217
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.479
of it. Um, I mean, in the kind of

218
00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:44.059
history you present in your book, what is the

219
00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:47.049
importance of this freedom to move?

220
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.130
Right. Well, I've already touched on that again, um.

221
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.460
In humans and and even in non-human societies. The

222
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.500
only way you escape an overlord, a dominant individual

223
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.140
who is taking more than his or her fair

224
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.419
share, is Literally by getting getting away physically. Freedom

225
00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:18.729
depends on freedom to flee. But in Nonhuman societies

226
00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:23.349
were. Acorn woodpeckers are defending a very, very rich

227
00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:27.109
resource or naked mole rats or surrounding. A clump

228
00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:31.500
of tubers surrounded by snakes in the desert. The

229
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.770
costs of fleeing are very, very high, and they

230
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.780
tend to stick where they are, and they put

231
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.349
up with a lot of inequality. Freedom depends on

232
00:14:40.349 --> 00:14:43.469
freedom to flee, and migration has been extremely important

233
00:14:43.469 --> 00:14:47.159
in human history, and extremely important in explaining why

234
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.530
humans have. For most of the time we've been

235
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:57.820
Homo sapiens, been an extremely egalitarian species. Mhm.

236
00:14:58.479 --> 00:15:03.469
And I mean, now talking about Neolithic societies, how

237
00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:06.840
is it that in those kinds of societies, little

238
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.479
by little, some people became celibates and others became

239
00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:16.080
part of sterile casts? How do we explain that

240
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.590
from an evolutionary perspective?

241
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.049
Um, I wanna drop a name. After looking at

242
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.190
Um, harems, uh, looking at very, very sexy men

243
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.469
for a long time, again, in field work and

244
00:15:31.469 --> 00:15:35.469
in the anthropological record, and, and finally in historical

245
00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:39.900
societies. I sent an email or got an email

246
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.179
from Richard Dawkins, and he said, what happens? What

247
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:46.710
happens to everybody else? If, if, if some of

248
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.140
these guys are Solomons and they're collecting 1000 women

249
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.669
and their sons are fathering 100 children, what, what

250
00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:55.679
happens, the sex ratio is going to stay at

251
00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:59.179
50/50. What happens to all, all the disfranchised men?

252
00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:04.219
And um I thought about that superficially. Obviously a

253
00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:07.859
lot of them are gonna. The poor and die

254
00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:09.380
young, and a lot of them are slaves, and

255
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.380
a lot of them are soldiers, but I started

256
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.299
to pay more attention to celibates and eunuchs, which

257
00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:20.780
come up over and over again in the historical

258
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.260
record. And again, there are non-human parallels. There are

259
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.229
helpers at the nest in bird societies. They delay

260
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:34.340
reproduction and sometimes fail to reproduce altogether. Instead, they

261
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.340
stay on their parents' nest and they They help

262
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.440
the dominant animals, often related animals in that case,

263
00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:45.400
to reproduce and, and forego reproduction themselves. They are

264
00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:51.330
unpair bonded or unmarried or or celibate. They're not

265
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.409
sterile, but they're celibate. There are breeders and there

266
00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:57.760
are celibates, and eventually some of the celibates inherit

267
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:04.390
or win territories by competition and become breeders. In

268
00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:10.170
other animal societies, extremely social societies like the eunuchs,

269
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.290
or the like the social insects, sorry, you have

270
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.098
a king or a queen and you have a

271
00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:19.939
large sterile cast, and you will approximate that even

272
00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:23.660
in some mammalian societies like naked mole rats, again,

273
00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:28.140
where you're clumped around patch of resources, you're surrounded

274
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.380
by snakes in the desert. It's very, very costly

275
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.599
to set off on your own and try to

276
00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:36.599
start a new nest. So you stick with your

277
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:40.180
parents and your parents, your mother keeps breeding and

278
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.609
breeding and breeding and breeding, she'll pick. 2 or

279
00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:47.239
3 partners, and the best you can hope for

280
00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:52.000
is to help your siblings grow and breed or

281
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.530
maybe after your parents die to become a breeder

282
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.890
yourself. Most of the most of these naked mole

283
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.989
rats are members of a permanent stroll cast. So,

284
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:10.130
again, We do that too. Um, THERE are, as,

285
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.979
as Neo Neolithic societies grow, and again, the key

286
00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:18.449
feature of Neolithic societies is sedentism is farming. Um,

287
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:25.040
You more and more of the um Of, of,

288
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.000
there are more and more losers. There are more

289
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.719
there are winners take a bigger and bigger share

290
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:36.680
of power and material resources and of reproductive resources.

291
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:39.079
You end up with harems and the and the

292
00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:47.430
disfranchised males. Uh, EITHER temporarily for go reproduction and

293
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.699
Fail to pair bond or marry or become permanent

294
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.540
parts of a sterile cast. Mhm.

295
00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:02.209
So, you mentioned eunuchs there, and that makes for

296
00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:05.369
a great segue into my next question because I

297
00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:08.890
want to delve into the Roman Empire. And my

298
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.329
first question about it would be, what were the

299
00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:15.630
roles of eunuchs in the Roman Empire? I mean,

300
00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:19.170
why did people with power at a certain point

301
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.469
start castrating some men?

302
00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:28.130
Yeah, um. Eunuch, as you probably know, is from

303
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.390
the Greek for bed guard or bedroom guard. Eunuchs

304
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:37.969
started out. Making sure that Other strange men didn't

305
00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:43.199
invade their women's spaces. They were. Make guards and

306
00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:47.469
castrated make guards are more trustworthy than not castrated

307
00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:51.579
my cards, um, so. The Romans continued a lot

308
00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:54.660
of great traditions, and they had bedroom guards or

309
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.819
eunuchs even under the republic. Caesar had uh eunuchs

310
00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:02.750
along with him when he got caught by pirates

311
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:08.459
in the Mediterranean, but the uh presence of eunuchs

312
00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:16.609
amplified enormously under the empire. Um, Under the first

313
00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:22.319
few emperors, they started to manage things like finances,

314
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.280
finance is always extremely important to a powerful man,

315
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.160
and then they, they had castrated men, castrated slaves,

316
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.979
I handle the money. Eventually, over the over the

317
00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:40.660
next few centuries, eunuchs filled more and more parts

318
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:46.619
of the civil service. By the time Constantine relocated

319
00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:50.150
the empire, see the empire from old Rome uh

320
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:55.150
to New Rome, which he called Cons Constantinople. Um,

321
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.310
Eunuchs in charge of the what he called the

322
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:06.569
sacred bed chamber. Uh, ESSENTIALLY ran both the palace

323
00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:10.260
and administration of the entire empire, and they were

324
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.500
supported by what were referred to as swarms or

325
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:19.410
hives of uh other eunuchs who Took various positions

326
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.050
and still cast. In the civil service, which was

327
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.979
a sterile cast.

328
00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:30.160
Mhm. But where did these men originate from, uh,

329
00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:34.449
socially? I mean, what was their social status when

330
00:21:34.449 --> 00:21:36.589
it comes to Roman society?

331
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.569
OK. Um, THERE is across empires in, in China.

332
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.729
The presence of eunuchs is, you know, thousands of

333
00:21:46.729 --> 00:21:51.930
years old, um, and eventually eunuchs became so powerful,

334
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.630
so early that uh poor people, poor parents would

335
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.130
sometimes castrate their children in order to get them

336
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.969
into the civil service. In Rome, Rome was a

337
00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:05.150
slave society, it was built on conquest and, and,

338
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.060
um, initially, a lot of these slaves. Became castrates,

339
00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:13.949
and those are the slaves that Roman emperors used

340
00:22:13.949 --> 00:22:17.130
to fill the civil service. Mhm.

341
00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:21.829
Uh, SO, changing topics, I still want to keep

342
00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:25.359
on the subject of the Roman Empire, but changing

343
00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:29.520
topics now, from an evolutionary perspective, what does one

344
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.140
gain by being an emperor?

345
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:37.479
I love that question. Well, You, you want to

346
00:22:37.479 --> 00:22:40.369
give it a go. Any idea what the evolutionary

347
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:41.349
advantage would be?

348
00:22:42.459 --> 00:22:46.630
I mean, having access to more sexual partners,

349
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.589
that's pretty much it. And access to more units

350
00:22:52.589 --> 00:22:55.510
to guard them and access to pretty much all

351
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.550
the resources in the empire and all the labor

352
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.180
in the empire, and, and it all got. It

353
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.109
it was all used to raise enormous numbers of

354
00:23:05.109 --> 00:23:05.699
children.

355
00:23:09.469 --> 00:23:15.109
So, was that uh also the reason why they

356
00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:20.310
uh men in positions of power heard women? I

357
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.540
mean, why did they have concubines, for example?

358
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:30.290
They, um, concubines are are bed partners, and, uh,

359
00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:36.150
absolutely, I mean. There's a new translation of Swatonius

360
00:23:36.969 --> 00:23:38.810
on the bestseller lists. I don't know if you

361
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.930
know Swatoni. You must know Sweattoni's European. Um, HE

362
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.250
wrote the biographies of the first Roman emperors, the

363
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:51.400
1st 12 Roman emperors, and It's scandal from. One

364
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.520
page one to the last page. Um, Tonius was

365
00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.400
a very respectable guy. He was the um Secretary

366
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.880
of State, literally Secretary of letters under Hadrian, who

367
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.229
was this early 2nd century emperor. He had access

368
00:24:08.229 --> 00:24:10.560
to the imperial archives. He read through all the

369
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:17.459
personal correspondence and and state correspondences and And he,

370
00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:21.500
he aired all the dirty linen. um, HE wrote

371
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.160
a sensational book and We all know because of

372
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.280
Sotones and obviously corroborated by other sources that a

373
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.949
lot of these 1st 12 emperors were highly promiscuous.

374
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.130
They had, they threw parties, uh, Tacitu says Nero

375
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.239
Nero threw parties in Rome as if the whole

376
00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:49.540
city was his personal home. He, he'd hire prostitutes

377
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.319
and put them on uh on the beaches and,

378
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:58.890
and float rafts on artificial lakes and uh and

379
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.339
cover them with women and uh occasionally go out

380
00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:06.540
at night in disguise with his friends and knock

381
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.880
people down and fornicate with their wives and Just

382
00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:17.439
random good times. Uh, Communists hired 600 women in,

383
00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:19.420
into his palace at a time, some of them

384
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.520
prostitutes, some of them just picked up on the

385
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.449
street. Tiberius sent slaves into Rome and had them.

386
00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:31.739
Kidnap freeborn children who were good looking and sail

387
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:36.339
them over to Care where he had 1412 separately

388
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:43.199
named villas that he Decorated with pornographic images and

389
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:47.209
messed around with them and there were these, these

390
00:25:47.209 --> 00:25:55.060
were very, very. Sexy guys. And the reason that

391
00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:01.420
Petonius is free to Mhm Uh, air that line

392
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.109
is because all these emperors were dead. The um

393
00:26:06.109 --> 00:26:09.709
the Caesars had been replaced by the Flavians and

394
00:26:09.709 --> 00:26:13.130
the Flavians had been replaced by the adoptive emperors,

395
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.150
and Hadrian was the first one of the first

396
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.890
adoptive vents, emperors, he said, go ahead with Tonius.

397
00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:23.989
Get into those archives and and tell those tales

398
00:26:23.989 --> 00:26:26.839
so that nobody minds that we that those those

399
00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:33.619
emperors are gone. Anyway, so lots lots of that

400
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:37.280
went on. We also know that The emperors put

401
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.030
up enormous palaces, uh. Deic, who was the last

402
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.910
of the Flavians lived at the end of the

403
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.650
first century, built what he called or what has

404
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:52.530
been called the Domus Augustana. Uh, STRETCHED along the

405
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.119
end one end of the circus Maximus, which is

406
00:26:55.119 --> 00:27:01.869
about 6 ft fields long, so it's just. Huge,

407
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.030
and Plutarch and uh plenty and various other people

408
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.189
got to look at it. They were contemporary, and

409
00:27:08.189 --> 00:27:11.290
they talked about swarms of units, and they talked

410
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:15.180
about concubines apartments, and they talked about secret bedrooms,

411
00:27:15.189 --> 00:27:17.109
and so there are plenty of women in the

412
00:27:17.109 --> 00:27:21.989
palace, but the big action in Rome and in

413
00:27:21.989 --> 00:27:27.719
any other empire was sexual access to slaves. And

414
00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:34.500
uh there were. Uh, 6 million slaves in the

415
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.099
Roman Empire at its height, um, the inscriptional evidence

416
00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:43.939
from the tombs, the epitaph in the tombs. Suggests

417
00:27:43.939 --> 00:27:46.089
that at least 1/3 of those slaves were women.

418
00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:50.050
Uh, OTHER evidence from Egyptian papyri, there are bills

419
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.050
of sale, suggest that when a Roman went to

420
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.650
market to buy a slave, a slave woman, he

421
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.449
always picked one of reproductive age, and the median

422
00:28:00.449 --> 00:28:06.010
age was right around 17. Um, Legal evidence from

423
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.280
the Digest. Um, LETS us know that, um, these

424
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.500
women were freed, rewarded with freedom if they bore

425
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.119
gave birth to a son, or if they gave

426
00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:22.209
birth to at least 3 daughters. So that they're

427
00:28:22.209 --> 00:28:25.849
picking women of reproductive age, they're paying more if

428
00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:28.569
they look good, they're locking them up and, you

429
00:28:28.569 --> 00:28:34.849
know, guarded. The states, country states or palaces in

430
00:28:34.849 --> 00:28:38.089
the city, they have sexual access to them, lots

431
00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:41.689
and lots of stories of that, and, and they

432
00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:45.489
reward those women for for burying children, so that's

433
00:28:45.489 --> 00:28:46.780
where most of the action was.

434
00:28:47.989 --> 00:28:50.410
Uh, AND are there any other ways by which

435
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.119
the emperors got sexual access to women? I mean,

436
00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:59.810
were they also gathering women from their war efforts?

437
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.410
I mean, whenever they won the war, would they

438
00:29:02.729 --> 00:29:05.280
also gather more women?

439
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:11.390
Sure. I That war captives of war were the

440
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.520
main slaves in the Rome society was built on

441
00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:20.170
uh conquest and tens of thousands of slaves would,

442
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.109
would come in in a single hall, and, and

443
00:29:22.109 --> 00:29:25.869
they were unequally distributed. Emperors were the biggest slave

444
00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:29.020
owners of all. They had. Tens of thousands of

445
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.459
slaves.

446
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.550
And how about the slaves? What did their lives

447
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.369
look like, look like in Roman in Roman society?

448
00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:44.630
Yeah. Well, um, for most of the men, it

449
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:49.410
wasn't good. Uh, MOST male slaves ended up working

450
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.680
in the mines or on the farms. In the

451
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.959
mines, life was messy Brutus, brutish, dark, and short.

452
00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.890
It's very, very rough life and um no women

453
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:06.790
at all. Um, Uh, ON the farms. Slave men

454
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:12.160
worked in chain gangs. And they slept in underground

455
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.869
cells with little slits overhead to let in light

456
00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:22.609
that were. Not avail not reachable. So, as I

457
00:30:22.609 --> 00:30:25.130
put it in my book, conditions not conducive to

458
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:31.569
family life. Um, MOST slave men had no reproductive

459
00:30:31.569 --> 00:30:35.119
opportunities at all, but then there were some slave

460
00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:41.050
men who were, um, highly educated and ended up

461
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.609
working in The civil service. The first, the first,

462
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:52.359
um, Civil servants were slaves. They were eventually replaced

463
00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:56.239
by castrated slaves or eunuchs. So you have this

464
00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:58.680
huge range from working in the mines or in

465
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.540
a chain gang to being a secretary of letters

466
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.050
or secretary of the treasury or occupying some other

467
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.239
civil service spot. But the vast majority would have

468
00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:17.709
led miserable lives. And very very. Few reproductive opportunities.

469
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.680
Right, OK, for the women, we gotta talk about

470
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.540
slave women. SLAVE women had or not. In the

471
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.099
mines or or on teen gangs at all, they

472
00:31:29.099 --> 00:31:36.300
tend to be. Um, They had easy jobs in

473
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.589
palaces or on country estates. They were. Uh, SEAMSTRESSES,

474
00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:45.579
they worked in textiles, servants and serfs and slaves,

475
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:50.619
women almost always make clothes and make cloth. Um,

476
00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:54.770
THEY also do. Women's jobs like uh you know

477
00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:02.410
midwives and uh wet nurses and babysitters. They weren't,

478
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:08.670
they weren't physically abused and they were. Always sexually

479
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:13.209
accessible to their masters. Mhm.

480
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.989
So another aspect of Roman society that you talk

481
00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:21.030
about in your book has to do with the

482
00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:25.560
genius. What was the genius in the Roman Empire?

483
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:29.560
I mean, in what ways did households make sacrifices

484
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.189
to him?

485
00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:33.380
Yeah. This is one of the last things I

486
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.530
Got to look at when I, when I, since

487
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.910
I started looking at Rome, and it's one of

488
00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:46.079
the funnest things. um, UNDER the republic in Rome,

489
00:32:46.689 --> 00:32:48.890
um, they had a tradition of families had a

490
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.599
tradition of making sacrifices. They set up small household

491
00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:55.900
altars and make sacrifices of food or wiering and

492
00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:01.410
to the potterfamilius or the ancestor who was the

493
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.579
head of their family or clan. And in particular,

494
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:10.030
they made sacrifices to what's called his genius, which

495
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:15.410
is a spirit that accompanies everybody. And ensures their

496
00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.939
generative power or fertility. So they made sacrifices to

497
00:33:19.939 --> 00:33:23.900
the fertility of the head of their family, or

498
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:29.319
Potterfamilius. After Augustus became the first Roman emperor. The

499
00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:33.680
Senate ordered that the same sacrifices should be made.

500
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.030
To what was the guy who is now the.

501
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.290
Potter Patrie or the father of his country. So

502
00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.890
Augustus was treated in the same way that the

503
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.689
father of families had previously been treated with the

504
00:33:51.689 --> 00:33:58.270
added. Dimension That Subjects who failed to make those

505
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:03.150
sacrifices to the fertility or genius spirit of the

506
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.810
emperor. Could be beheaded if they were Roman citizens

507
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.438
or thrown to wild animals in the circus if

508
00:34:13.438 --> 00:34:17.909
they were not. So, uh, people were tortured and

509
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:22.820
killed because they did not swear by the health

510
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.478
and fertility of the Roman Empire. So.

511
00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:31.830
Mhm. And what happened to members of the sterile

512
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.300
castes after the emperors moved east?

513
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:42.989
Um, Constantine the Great in 330 AD moved from

514
00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:48.860
Rome, which was Uh, more and more at risk

515
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:53.629
of being attacked by, uh, Germanic tribes to a

516
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:57.030
more secure spot on the Bosphorus, which he called

517
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.870
New Rome, uh, we call it Istanbul, and he

518
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:05.229
called it Constantinople after himself, and he took everything

519
00:35:05.229 --> 00:35:07.590
of value with him and that included his slaves

520
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.889
or his eunuchs. The eunuchs. Moved to Constantinople with

521
00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:17.659
the emperor and They became a larger and larger

522
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:20.820
and more and more powerful group after that.

523
00:35:22.929 --> 00:35:26.070
Right. So, uh, let's not talk a little bit

524
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.719
about medieval Europe. In France, particularly and under the

525
00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:34.679
rule of the rule of Clovis and Charlemagne, with

526
00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:39.629
different kinds of roles for unmarried and celibate people

527
00:35:39.629 --> 00:35:40.429
who were there?

528
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:46.000
Right. Charlemagne and Clovis and the Etonians and other

529
00:35:46.399 --> 00:35:50.669
holy holy Roman emperors. Did not fill their civil

530
00:35:50.669 --> 00:35:56.629
services with eunuchs. The eunuchs. WERE few and far

531
00:35:56.629 --> 00:35:59.360
between after Constantine moved to see the empire to

532
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:05.270
the east. Instead, they relied on celibate or unmarried

533
00:36:05.629 --> 00:36:11.070
men. Um, THOSE men or abbots and bishops and

534
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:16.030
archbishops or whatever, uh, were filled, filled all the

535
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.219
important spots in the civil service. And I had

536
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.820
a list of it on the other computer, but

537
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.899
I can't find it. Um, JUST, you know, all

538
00:36:23.899 --> 00:36:28.179
the usual job titles, um, Chamberlain, um, Head of

539
00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:33.459
the Chancery, uh, steward, uh, head of the stables,

540
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.179
all the major job titles were occupied by celibate,

541
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.959
unmarried men, um. And there were many, many with

542
00:36:43.959 --> 00:36:46.280
no job titles that went along with that.

543
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.479
Mhm And in the medieval period, why were there

544
00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:56.560
so many bastards and what happened to them?

545
00:36:58.129 --> 00:37:03.709
Yeah, um, in All societies I've been talking about,

546
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.959
monogamy was the rule. Monogamous marriage was the rule.

547
00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:15.530
Because marriage is about the inheritance of wealth, and

548
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:19.649
mating is about the inheritance of genes, and even

549
00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:25.649
in the most Promiscuous polygynous societies on earth. The

550
00:37:25.649 --> 00:37:31.290
rules tended to be concentrating wealth across generations, and

551
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.360
one of the ways you concentrate wealth is by

552
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.439
singling out the children of a single woman. Who

553
00:37:38.439 --> 00:37:42.959
is your wife or queen as the heirs to

554
00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:47.510
the bulk of your power and money. And everybody

555
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.959
else is by definition a bastard. So your secondary

556
00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:58.760
wives and your concubines and your slaves produce non-heirs

557
00:37:58.969 --> 00:38:05.780
or bastards. And so we had In Neolithic societies,

558
00:38:05.879 --> 00:38:09.340
the vast majority of people were bastards. Only a

559
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:15.310
minority of people were. Born to legitimate wives, the

560
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.739
the the primary consort and secondary consorts gave birth

561
00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:25.770
to bastards. Um, All of these slave women who

562
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.919
bore children to Roman emperors and other powerful Romans

563
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.010
gave birth to bastards. Some of those bastards did

564
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.370
extremely well. Many of them were freed very young

565
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:37.330
by their masters, and they were given seed money

566
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.629
to start. Companies or they were they had enough

567
00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:43.780
connections to enter the Senate or the knighthood or

568
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.189
not all of them did, but there were plenty

569
00:38:46.189 --> 00:38:49.189
plenty of them who did very well, and certainly

570
00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:50.909
that was true in the Middle Ages as well.

571
00:38:51.189 --> 00:38:55.179
Many bastards ended up with roles in the church.

572
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.889
And some of them ended up in the civil

573
00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:04.169
service. Mhm. They didn't end up with an inheritance.

574
00:39:05.979 --> 00:39:10.520
They were by definition disinherited or bastards. Mhm.

575
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.270
So tell us now about the women's rooms in

576
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.870
royal estates in medieval Europe or, I mean, I'm

577
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.189
not sure about the correct pronunciation of the word,

578
00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:25.669
but I think it's something like guke or something

579
00:39:25.669 --> 00:39:26.580
like that, so.

580
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.909
It's, it's pronounced in different ways. Most, most Greek

581
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:33.389
and Roman Latin words are pronounced in different ways

582
00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:39.439
in English, but uh Genesia, women's women's room, GYN

583
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:45.870
for dying for women. Um Uh, THERE are women

584
00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:51.560
women's rooms. On virtually every one of the country

585
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:57.399
estates owned and occasionally occupied by these medieval emperors

586
00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:01.500
and kings from Clovis's lineage to Charlemagne's lineage to

587
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.040
the Holy Roman Emperors. They've got women in the

588
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.879
palace when Louis the Pious, who was Charlemagne's son.

589
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.020
BECAME an emperor, inherited the empire from his father.

590
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.439
The first thing he did was to dismiss. The

591
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.659
enormous crowd of women from the palace, and they

592
00:40:18.659 --> 00:40:21.739
all came back. So obviously there are plenty of

593
00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:24.820
women in the palace, but there are lots and

594
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.060
lots of women. These guys own dozens of country

595
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.179
estates and all of them have very, very well,

596
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:36.929
very well for fortified women's rooms where very regious,

597
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.219
literally, children of the king are often born.

598
00:40:43.889 --> 00:40:47.629
And what were the different roles given to the

599
00:40:47.629 --> 00:40:51.300
king's children? I mean, since they had so many

600
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:56.310
children, so many, particularly illegitimate children, what roles they

601
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.419
were given to them?

602
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.350
Um, A, a lot of them, like I say,

603
00:41:00.469 --> 00:41:06.800
ended up in the church. Um, And Sometimes they

604
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.929
just got locked in the monasteries and and uh

605
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.040
many of these, many of these churches administered. The

606
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.899
estates of lords who had contributed to them. So

607
00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:25.040
they raised, they raised their children and educated their

608
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.399
children and and raised armies for them, and they

609
00:41:28.399 --> 00:41:32.149
were helpers. So, but they, but they occupied monasteries,

610
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:38.830
um, others became Landless knights, um, again, some of

611
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.060
them royal bastards ended up in the civil service.

612
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.860
And of course, if we're talking about medieval Europe,

613
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.989
we have also to talk about the church and

614
00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:52.270
its role because it have an immense role to

615
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.909
play there. Uh, WHAT was the role played by

616
00:41:54.909 --> 00:41:58.580
the church when it comes to dealing with celibate

617
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.540
and unmarried people?

618
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:07.469
The, the Middle Ages were the medieval millennium, to

619
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:10.330
me, the millennium of the Middle Ages starts with

620
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.620
um Constantine's. Conversion to Christianity and emancipation of the

621
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.500
Roman Church, and it ends pretty much with, with

622
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.020
the crusades and and the heresies and that that

623
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.699
incurred clerical celibacy and finally the Reformation. So the

624
00:42:28.699 --> 00:42:33.129
medieval millennium was a Catholic millennium and the core.

625
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.919
Uh, THE most important aspect of Catholicism was Commitment

626
00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:46.629
to celibacy. WAS was a commitment that these younger

627
00:42:46.629 --> 00:42:50.949
sons and daughters and bastard sons and daughters were

628
00:42:50.949 --> 00:42:56.629
not to inherit and uh had a place to

629
00:42:56.629 --> 00:42:59.760
live and work, and and that was in the

630
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.870
Catholic Church. Mhm.

631
00:43:03.719 --> 00:43:08.199
So would some of these people go, for example,

632
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.199
to monasteries as

633
00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:19.169
monks. Parents donated their younger sons and daughters, and

634
00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:23.439
sometimes they're bastards illegitimate, so not legitimate and ultimate

635
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.330
to monasteries at the age of weaning. They were

636
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.889
called oblates or gifts. They were taken to the

637
00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:35.530
monastery door and signed a contract and promised to

638
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.600
be celibate for the rest of. The lives and.

639
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.879
Uh, SO, apart from that in medieval Europe, what

640
00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:46.840
did the Crusades represent?

641
00:43:47.399 --> 00:43:50.679
All right. Um, THE crusades brought the whole thing

642
00:43:50.679 --> 00:43:59.899
down. Or started the process, um. Uh, In 1095,

643
00:44:00.669 --> 00:44:03.949
the Pope Urban the Second, who had been appealed

644
00:44:03.949 --> 00:44:07.659
to by the eastern emperor for help fighting off

645
00:44:07.659 --> 00:44:12.409
the infidel. Uh, GAVE a speech to an enormous

646
00:44:12.409 --> 00:44:15.449
crowd of people in a field outside of Claremont,

647
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:20.840
France. And he said, the land you inhabit is

648
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:26.540
overcrowded. You're fighting for everything. What you need to

649
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.860
do is head east toward the land of milk

650
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.010
and honey, the land of our ancestors in Jerusalem,

651
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:41.260
and fight off the infidel and settle there. And

652
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.050
that's what they did. Uh, ALL sorts of landless,

653
00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:49.500
uh, knights, uh, landless younger sons who are destined

654
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.300
for the church, and, and poor men got on

655
00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.060
their horses and put on their boots and marched

656
00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:01.810
off to the east and fought horrible, hideous, bloody

657
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.540
wars. And one enough of them that they took

658
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.250
over the Levant, they, they established a crusader state

659
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.459
in Jerusalem and in Odessa in Tripoli and and

660
00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:17.979
in Antioch, and they settled down for generations on

661
00:45:17.979 --> 00:45:20.550
plots of their own land with their own legitimate

662
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:25.310
wives and their own legitimate children and grandchildren. And

663
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.270
then the crusader states were lost, but eventually there

664
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.870
was also a Latin Empire and Constantinople, but by

665
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.100
then, there was an enormous network of trade across

666
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.830
the Mediterranean. People had found different ways to make

667
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.229
a living. They were, they were getting rich in

668
00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:47.429
movables as opposed to immovable goods that affected the

669
00:45:47.429 --> 00:45:51.790
growth of of parliaments of the House of Commons.

670
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:58.520
And it gave younger sons and daughters options. To

671
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.780
make a living. That they hadn't had. So, heresies

672
00:46:04.189 --> 00:46:07.909
came in as soon as the crusades began, all

673
00:46:07.909 --> 00:46:11.129
through the 12th century, there were heretics, one here

674
00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:15.050
one heresy after another, and many of them insisted

675
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.179
on an end to celibacy. And the more prominent

676
00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:23.459
heresy started in the 14th century with Wycliffe at

677
00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:28.149
Oxford, and then John Huss at Prague. Key features

678
00:46:28.149 --> 00:46:32.239
in their, in their arguments involved getting rid of

679
00:46:32.239 --> 00:46:37.830
clerical celibacy and then finally Martin Luther in 1517,

680
00:46:38.199 --> 00:46:42.639
exactly 25 years after we started moving to the

681
00:46:42.639 --> 00:46:45.149
west instead of the east and setting up colonies

682
00:46:45.149 --> 00:46:49.239
in, in the Americas. 25 years after Columbus made

683
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:53.560
landfall in the Bahamas, Martin Luther posted the 95

684
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.919
theses to the door of the Wittenberg Church and

685
00:46:55.919 --> 00:47:00.050
said, that's enough, Pope, and started writing essays on

686
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.919
the Pope had no more power to prohibit marriage

687
00:47:03.919 --> 00:47:08.669
than he had to prohibit. Indigestion or getting fat.

688
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:14.959
And Uh, the monastery started emptying out immediately. Luther

689
00:47:14.959 --> 00:47:17.360
got married and had 6 children, and his old

690
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.229
black monastery turned into his family manor. Um, OTHER,

691
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:28.159
other monks followed suit, and other reformers in Switzerland

692
00:47:28.159 --> 00:47:30.929
and Cal Calvin originally in France later in Switzerland.

693
00:47:31.959 --> 00:47:36.919
Insisted on clerical marriage and that became the rule

694
00:47:37.139 --> 00:47:38.100
in the Reformation.

695
00:47:38.959 --> 00:47:41.639
Mhm. Yeah, so we're going to talk a little

696
00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:45.239
bit more about the Reformation and also about migration

697
00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:48.899
and colonization in a bit, but just before that,

698
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.239
what does the Magna Carta in 1254 mark in

699
00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.850
history and particularly the history of England?

700
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:05.639
12:15. And um, The Magna Carta was an agreement

701
00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:08.989
between King John and 25 of his leading barons,

702
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:15.189
and it promised A number of guarantees of baronial

703
00:48:15.189 --> 00:48:21.189
rights. The most important was no taxation without representation.

704
00:48:22.179 --> 00:48:25.939
If you want dues from us, you've got to

705
00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:28.939
invite us to a council, and we will tell

706
00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:34.290
you what we want done with this money. Um,

707
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.620
UNDER John's son, Henry the 3rd, who succeeded at

708
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:43.439
the age of 9. The very, very first sets

709
00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:50.010
of. Uh, COMMERCE, knights and burgesses or, or uh

710
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.879
citizens were invited to come to Westminster as well,

711
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:58.840
and they too reissued Magna Carta and ordered that

712
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.669
there would be no taxation without being summoned to

713
00:49:03.669 --> 00:49:08.320
parliament without representation about and, and a voice in

714
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.820
how that money was to be spent. Uh, AS

715
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.790
the commons grew. Uh, IN wealth, as movable money

716
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:20.739
became more and more available, they grew in power

717
00:49:20.739 --> 00:49:25.399
and their voice. Their voice got louder. Eventually they

718
00:49:25.399 --> 00:49:28.489
started opposing the kings that they didn't like. They

719
00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:31.850
deposed Edward the 2nd in 1327, and then Richard

720
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.179
the 2nd in 1399, and Henry the Sixth in

721
00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:38.090
in the 15th century, and finally they cut off

722
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.199
the head of a king they really didn't like,

723
00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:42.489
and that was sort of the end of kings.

724
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:48.449
And how did the rise of parliament occur in

725
00:49:48.449 --> 00:49:48.790
England?

726
00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.959
Again, it was, it was about, it was mainly

727
00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:56.919
about mostly about the growth of movable wealth instead

728
00:49:56.919 --> 00:49:59.000
of just getting money for their wars and other

729
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.360
royal business from landed. Barons, the landed aristocracy, Kings

730
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.560
started to have to appeal to people who dealt

731
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:15.689
in mable goods, tradesmen. And uh Manufacturers to and

732
00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:19.139
and they became the House of Commons, and they

733
00:50:19.139 --> 00:50:22.739
got more and more power over royal decisions and

734
00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:26.500
over national decisions as they got wealthier and wealthier.

735
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.800
So let me ask you one more question about

736
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.879
England before we move on to other topics, uh,

737
00:50:33.919 --> 00:50:36.639
that is along the same lines of questions I

738
00:50:36.639 --> 00:50:39.830
asked you about the Roman Empire and medieval Europe.

739
00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:43.959
So tell us about how for centuries, well to

740
00:50:43.959 --> 00:50:48.000
do men uh in England filled their households with

741
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.879
unmarried women, had sex with them, and sometimes got

742
00:50:51.879 --> 00:50:55.709
them husbands and how they treated their husbands.

743
00:50:56.959 --> 00:51:00.500
Right. Well, like I said in, in Rome, most

744
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.540
of the action in, in reproduction was sex with

745
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:08.530
slaves. In the Middle Ages, sex with certs, in

746
00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:11.340
modern societies, sex with servants. They're all the same

747
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:16.909
people, but they're more and more emancipated. So, In

748
00:51:16.909 --> 00:51:20.560
England, they had what was called life cycle service.

749
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:25.399
As many as 60% of the population of adolescents

750
00:51:25.399 --> 00:51:29.689
aged 15 to 25. WERE working as servants in

751
00:51:29.689 --> 00:51:34.800
the houses of their superiors of richer people. And

752
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.179
the women. TENDED to be uh victims of sexual

753
00:51:40.179 --> 00:51:47.429
predators. They Like, like slave owners in Rome, um,

754
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.879
serving. Owners in in England tended to have sex

755
00:51:51.879 --> 00:51:54.760
with their young female servants, and when they got

756
00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:00.209
them pregnant, They would frequently find them a husband,

757
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.129
sometimes they would um hooked them up with another

758
00:52:04.129 --> 00:52:07.120
one of their servants, a male servants, sometimes someone

759
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.550
else they knew someone they did business with. Arrange

760
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.510
a marriage and and that bastard be would be

761
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.330
taken care of. Mhm.

762
00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:20.580
And sometimes they gave promotions to their husbands,

763
00:52:20.709 --> 00:52:25.639
correct? That is correct. Um. All this stuff got

764
00:52:25.639 --> 00:52:28.050
blown wide open in the literature in the in

765
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:34.010
in the literature of uh. 17th, 18th, 19th century

766
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:38.090
England and then on the continent, um. The confessional

767
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.810
literature, Samuel Pete's, I don't know if you've read

768
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.669
Pete's diaries, they're terrifically entertaining. He wrote just after

769
00:52:43.669 --> 00:52:48.229
the English Revolution. And peeps like most other men

770
00:52:48.229 --> 00:52:50.459
of his time, had trouble keeping his hands off

771
00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:53.590
his maids. When he got them pregnant, he tried

772
00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:57.340
to find them husbands. When he was interested in

773
00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:01.810
a woman whose husband was in his employ. He

774
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:05.459
would have sex with that woman and give the

775
00:53:05.459 --> 00:53:11.540
husband promotions. So they tried to get women husbands,

776
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:14.500
and they tried to get uh women who were

777
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.830
married, uh, they had tried to get the husband's

778
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.500
promotions. Peeps, Peeps is probably the best source cause

779
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.340
it's all in his very own words and he's

780
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.780
not lying, he's he's keeping this information in a

781
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:32.120
drawer. Um, Boswell, a century later, um, put it

782
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.340
all down in a series of journals and He

783
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.620
too was very guilty, but he, he, he made

784
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:42.100
the same sorts of arrangements. Uh, THE first English

785
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:46.550
novels were written by Dan Defoe, and they included

786
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:50.260
Roxanna and Moll Flanders. They're all about girls who

787
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.729
got knocked up by their masters, their master's sons,

788
00:53:53.739 --> 00:53:57.870
and pawned off on younger sons or on friends

789
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:03.129
and poor farmers and uh. The masters were relieved

790
00:54:03.129 --> 00:54:06.040
of the of the burden of raising their bastards.

791
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:12.949
Uh, THE same is true of opera. I I

792
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.280
um wanted to play. A little, oh God, do

793
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.989
I have here? Yes, I do. Do you mind

794
00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:22.780
if I play a little music for you? No,

795
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:23.719
yes, who is? I'm gonna play you a little

796
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:28.739
off. I'm, I know that because you are. Iberian,

797
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.469
you're gonna know right away what this is. Are

798
00:54:31.469 --> 00:54:34.030
you ready? I hope it comes through. It's on

799
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:50.699
my phone. Turn it up. It Good. I don't

800
00:54:50.699 --> 00:54:51.689
I didn't take them to any of them.

801
00:54:53.929 --> 00:54:57.530
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not hearing it very

802
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.739
well. It's not coming through very well,

803
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:07.739
so. You know what is. 10003. The number of

804
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:12.709
lovers Don Juan had in Spain. That's Mozartstone one,

805
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:18.449
the libretto by Du Pont. And it, it's, uh,

806
00:55:18.959 --> 00:55:23.110
that opera is all about a libertine who gets

807
00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:28.189
dragged into hell in the end, because his servant,

808
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.270
Leparrello, like servants of Don Juan since the early

809
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:35.760
17th century when Molina in Spain wrote the first

810
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.000
version, were fed up. Stop molesting every woman in

811
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.860
Europe. Stop molesting every woman in Spain. If you

812
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.290
continue to do that, we're going to drag you

813
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.070
into hell or make sure that you are dragged

814
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:54.449
into some kind of hell. The the audience that

815
00:55:54.449 --> 00:56:02.340
was Sitting in Molina's uh auditorium or reading uh

816
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.659
Moliere or listening to Mozart's opera was no longer

817
00:56:07.659 --> 00:56:12.209
just an a landed aristocracy. These were people who,

818
00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.409
who were making their living in in trade and

819
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.899
people who were sick and tired of the old

820
00:56:19.899 --> 00:56:24.750
aristocracy and the liberties they took with women. And

821
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.159
this, this motif was the most, it took over

822
00:56:28.159 --> 00:56:31.169
Europe. It was in everything from puppet shows to

823
00:56:31.199 --> 00:56:37.479
to plays to operas, um. So anyway, uh, attitudes

824
00:56:37.479 --> 00:56:43.629
changed, and at the same time, opportunities evaporated, um,

825
00:56:43.879 --> 00:56:52.350
household size collapsed. So people stopped living as servants

826
00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:57.570
during this critical period as adolescents, um. There's a

827
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.610
group called the Cambridge Group for the History of

828
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:03.409
Population and Social Structure. And when computers became available

829
00:57:03.409 --> 00:57:06.010
at the end of the last century, they digitized

830
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:09.219
all the old parish records, and they found that

831
00:57:10.159 --> 00:57:15.310
There are as many as 60 servants in England.

832
00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:22.199
Per 100 households in At the time of the

833
00:57:22.199 --> 00:57:26.479
English Revolution in 1650. Just normal, everybody's in service.

834
00:57:26.679 --> 00:57:30.000
All the young women are in the households of

835
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.239
their betters. 100 years later, that number had dropped

836
00:57:34.239 --> 00:57:39.159
to 45, and by 1947, it was down to

837
00:57:39.159 --> 00:57:44.479
2. It just, it just evaporated. So those men

838
00:57:44.479 --> 00:57:48.159
and those women had better things to do than

839
00:57:48.159 --> 00:57:54.590
to wait tables for the local baron. That those

840
00:57:54.590 --> 00:58:01.610
opportunities evaporated. And, and so reproductive differentials declined.

841
00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:07.050
So perhaps related to that we've been talking a

842
00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:14.399
lot about promiscuity among European aristocracy. So I mean,

843
00:58:14.409 --> 00:58:17.010
was that one of the ways that a decline

844
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:20.919
in promiscuity occurred in Europe over time?

845
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:27.030
Yes, households shrunk, households got smaller and the um

846
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.889
young women who waited on these wealthy men were

847
00:58:29.889 --> 00:58:36.610
gone. Um, And again, attitudes changed. Everybody loved the

848
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.899
on one places because people, people had low tolerance

849
00:58:40.899 --> 00:58:47.780
for those kinds of infidelities. It was OK once.

850
00:58:47.959 --> 00:58:52.219
It was taken for granted pretty much, but The

851
00:58:52.219 --> 00:58:55.699
citizens, members of the Household Commons wanted, don't want

852
00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:56.969
to be right into hell.

853
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.610
So, uh, but then let me ask you about

854
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:05.659
the celibacy. When and why did people eventually start

855
00:59:05.659 --> 00:59:08.770
writing and talking against celibacy?

856
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.310
Again, that the heresies grew with the crusades. As

857
00:59:14.399 --> 00:59:18.169
um people had options to emigrate more often younger

858
00:59:18.169 --> 00:59:20.840
sons had more options to emigrate and find lands

859
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.159
of their own, and more importantly, trade grew. So,

860
00:59:26.169 --> 00:59:30.379
um, younger sons had options to make a living

861
00:59:30.729 --> 00:59:34.050
that didn't involve inheriting parcels of land from their

862
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:40.260
parents, and If younger sons would make a living.

863
00:59:41.139 --> 00:59:45.969
And didn't have to depend on The resources of

864
00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:48.570
the church, then they could afford to support a

865
00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:51.479
wife, and they didn't have to be celibate anymore.

866
00:59:53.939 --> 00:59:54.610
Mhm.

867
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:58.530
And what, OK, then you've already mentioned a little

868
00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.729
bit the role played by the Reformation and what

869
01:00:01.729 --> 01:00:05.209
happened during the Reformation, but, uh, what was the

870
01:00:05.209 --> 01:00:09.649
role played by it and the the Protestants more

871
01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:12.040
generally against celibacy? The

872
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:12.489
Protestants,

873
01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:13.729
yeah, the Protestants,

874
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.530
yeah. Uh, THE Protestants were the last heretics, right?

875
01:00:18.169 --> 01:00:21.040
Like I said, as soon as the, as the,

876
01:00:21.149 --> 01:00:25.179
the crusades were preached in 1095. So at the

877
01:00:25.179 --> 01:00:29.080
very end of the 11th century. The 12th century

878
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.409
was the 1st century of. Massive numbers of heresies.

879
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.050
They, um, the, the crusaders went east and started

880
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.580
started occupying these crusader states and and Trade grew

881
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.860
and and all these heretics are saying, let's get,

882
01:00:47.979 --> 01:00:51.129
let's get rid of clerical celibacy. We shouldn't insist

883
01:00:51.129 --> 01:00:58.270
on celibacy anymore. And then Uh, more serious heretics

884
01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:01.489
like John Wycliffe at Oxford and John Husset in

885
01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:04.810
Prague, and then eventually Martin Luther started saying the

886
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:10.600
same thing. And Luther, again 25 years after Columbus,

887
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.689
posted the 95 theses to the door of the

888
01:01:13.689 --> 01:01:17.870
Wittenberg Church and said, that's it. We've broken with

889
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.550
the pope, and we're going to take wives, and

890
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.429
he took, took a wife and Zingly took a

891
01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:26.669
wife and Calvin took a wife, and the monasteries

892
01:01:26.669 --> 01:01:27.469
evaporated.

893
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.500
So, and uh this is also something you've alluded

894
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.659
to earlier. What happened after 1492 and what was

895
01:01:37.659 --> 01:01:41.340
the role played by colonization and migration?

896
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:49.939
Um, Again, For Homo sapiens, as for naked mole

897
01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:56.600
rats and communally living birds. Uh The way that

898
01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.050
you escape. Being a subject, the way that you

899
01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:07.760
get away from an overall overlord is by literally

900
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.389
Having freedom to move, if you can find a

901
01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:18.229
new territory and build your own nest. Uh, THEN

902
01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:21.879
you can, you can have your own family and

903
01:02:21.879 --> 01:02:25.600
not, not be, uh, exploited. Freedom depends on freedom

904
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.989
to move, so the crusades started the movement towards,

905
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:37.629
uh, politically, politically equality, economic equality, and religious equality.

906
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:45.370
And uh all of those. All of those collapsing

907
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:51.169
movements accelerated with the movement west towards the Americas

908
01:02:51.169 --> 01:02:54.860
where colonization took off. By the time of the

909
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:01.189
English revolution, or the American Revolution. There are millions

910
01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:04.889
of colonists, mostly of British descent, living in North

911
01:03:04.889 --> 01:03:09.030
America, and in the Crusader states it then. 10s

912
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:13.870
of thousands So, the opportunities to take off, to

913
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:19.149
literally run away from all of this political, economic,

914
01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:24.909
and religious unfairness, expanded, exploded. And the result was

915
01:03:24.909 --> 01:03:31.860
a collapse in kingdoms and empires. In 1649, the

916
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.699
House of Commons set up a high court of

917
01:03:34.699 --> 01:03:39.580
justice to Judge King Charles the First. And they

918
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:45.209
said they accused him of Looking after his own

919
01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:50.290
personal self-interest and the self-interest of his family members

920
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:54.030
at the expense of the good people of this

921
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.489
nation. That's that's the story of history. And they

922
01:03:59.489 --> 01:04:05.679
said, cancel it. All men were created equal. It,

923
01:04:05.689 --> 01:04:08.810
we just, we just flipped the script completely back

924
01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:12.409
to the beginning and started to look like forging

925
01:04:12.409 --> 01:04:16.409
societies, but we suddenly had millions of people, but

926
01:04:16.409 --> 01:04:19.810
we were hugely mobile. We were moving around like

927
01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:23.149
crazy and goods were moving. As long as people

928
01:04:23.149 --> 01:04:29.699
and goods are flowing freely. We are free.

929
01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:33.100
Uh, BY free, uh, I mean, does that also

930
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.810
entail that there's less inequality.

931
01:04:36.979 --> 01:04:39.300
That's what I mean, yeah, free to get away

932
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.580
from an overlord, free to get away from exploitation.

933
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.330
Mhm.

934
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.639
So those were the kinds of societal changes brought

935
01:04:49.639 --> 01:04:52.840
about by migration to the Americas,

936
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.679
right? Yes, it started again with there was a

937
01:04:55.679 --> 01:05:01.219
significant movement east with the Crusades, but Immigration exploded

938
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.620
with migration to the Americas. Mhm.

939
01:05:06.889 --> 01:05:10.520
So, uh, let me ask you then, what does

940
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.159
what you present in the book tell us about

941
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:17.659
the history of inequality? Why is it so common

942
01:05:17.659 --> 01:05:21.610
inequality, particularly in agricultural societies?

943
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.899
Um, INEQUALITY. Tends tends to be a feature of

944
01:05:29.899 --> 01:05:37.050
sedentary societies again across species, across and across human

945
01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:41.179
history and prehistory. When you are stuck in one

946
01:05:41.179 --> 01:05:45.219
place because of geographical barriers to flight or because

947
01:05:45.219 --> 01:05:48.580
the resources are so rich that it's too expensive

948
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:54.540
to leave. You you put up with inequality because

949
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:59.419
it's better than leaving a rich patch for dirt.

950
01:06:00.449 --> 01:06:03.320
Mm. Um, YOU don't want to starve on the

951
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.080
desert, you want to stay in the oasis, so

952
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.879
you, you put up with a smaller slice of

953
01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:11.370
the pie as long to the extent that barriers,

954
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.590
those barriers open up, um. There's there's going to

955
01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:21.500
be a more equal equal distribution of wealth, power,

956
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:25.189
and uh ultimately of reproduction.

957
01:06:25.929 --> 01:06:29.639
Right. So let me ask you one last question

958
01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:34.399
then, and it's about monogamy. Does monogamy play a

959
01:06:34.399 --> 01:06:37.520
role in the the history you present in your

960
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.389
book? Is it associated with, for example, more equal

961
01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:48.280
sexual access in society and with more general equality

962
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.639
in human societies?

963
01:06:51.429 --> 01:06:56.719
Um, I want to again. Emphasize that there's a

964
01:06:56.719 --> 01:07:01.479
difference between monogamous marriage and monogamous mating. Uh, MANY

965
01:07:01.479 --> 01:07:07.270
people confuse them, and they're very different, um. Uh,

966
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:15.110
EXTREMELY unequal societies practice monogamy. Kings are very concerned

967
01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:18.469
about leaving their emperor their kingdom to just one

968
01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:22.830
son, and lords leaving the castle to just one

969
01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:29.090
heir. So monogamous marriage is a feature of extremely

970
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:38.979
Promiscuous and polygynous societies. But monogamous mating. Everybody has

971
01:07:38.979 --> 01:07:42.100
an opportunity to have a parcel of land and

972
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:48.250
a vote in parliament and a legitimate family. That

973
01:07:48.659 --> 01:07:54.090
that coincides with Mobility. That's an effective mobility.

974
01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:02.330
Mhm. And so monogamy actually plays an important role

975
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:08.879
here, right in, uh, leading to more equal societies.

976
01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:18.779
Yes. Political Economic and reproductive equality coincide and in

977
01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:25.508
Darwinian terms. If you're, if the end you have

978
01:08:25.508 --> 01:08:30.337
evolved to strive for is genetic representation in later

979
01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:35.828
generations, the resources and the power are means to

980
01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:42.279
those ends. The reason men strive to accumulate resources,

981
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.729
and the reason they strive to accumulate power is

982
01:08:46.959 --> 01:08:51.990
ultimately in order to get access to breeding women

983
01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.790
who will raise large numbers of children. Mhm.

984
01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:00.850
Great. So, the book is again the Badge of

985
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:05.459
Lost innocence, a History of the West. Uh, APART

986
01:09:05.459 --> 01:09:09.299
from the book, Doctor Betsy, where can people find

987
01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:11.129
your work on the internet?

988
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:14.750
Um, I have a website and you can look

989
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.430
at Google Scholar. I've got lots of papers up

990
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.500
and be happy people read them.

991
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.430
Great. So thank you so much for taking the
