00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.860
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.880
today I'm here with a return guest, Doctor Jeff

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.840
McMahon, and in our previous conversations we've tackled topics

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.459
like the ethics of killing, the ethics of killing

6
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:23.200
in war. We also talked about veganism and academic

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.090
freedom, and today I thought it would be relevant

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.043
due to. Recent events and developments in the US

9
00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:36.044
but also elsewhere that we tackle the ethics of

10
00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:40.705
political violence which will also include political assassinations. So

11
00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:43.005
Jeff, welcome back to the show. It's always a

12
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.084
pleasure to talk with you.

13
00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:46.465
Thanks, Ricardo. Always a pleasure for me too.

14
00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.099
OK, so maybe before we get into the ethics

15
00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:55.330
itself, let's start by perhaps trying to arrive at

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.970
the definition of political violence here. So as a

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.450
philosopher, and of course I could ask the same

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.849
question to political scientists and other people, but as

19
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:11.489
a philosopher, what is your understanding of political violence?

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.010
How do you approach it?

21
00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:17.610
Well, it's a term that is being used a

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.250
lot now, and what one has to do is

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.029
try to understand how people are applying it. Um,

24
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.050
AS I say, it's a sort of new term

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.370
you won't find it in a dictionary, and normally

26
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.449
what people mean when they refer to political violence

27
00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:39.709
is violence by individuals or small groups of people.

28
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.959
FOR political reasons or the violence that is motivated

29
00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.279
by essentially a political aim, and one of the

30
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:56.199
paradigms of political violence is one that you mentioned

31
00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:00.290
assassination, which is normally defined as Uh, the killing

32
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.730
of a particularly prominent or important person for a

33
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.089
political reason. So a political assassination would come within

34
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.289
the scope of political violence. Um, POLITICAL violence is

35
00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:18.009
also substate violence, um, and it is a term

36
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.729
that I think in ordinary use excludes war, so

37
00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.490
people wouldn't consider war political violence, even though war

38
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.759
is almost always. Uh, THE use of violence by

39
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.600
military means, uh, for the achievement of aims that

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.639
are essentially political, but because it's done by the

41
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:48.199
state and externally rather than internally, um, war wouldn't

42
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:55.020
count as political violence, though violence by Government agents

43
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.199
internally or domestically could be considered political violence. So

44
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.259
what the members of ICEE are doing in the

45
00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.610
United States to people would be considered by many

46
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.729
to be political violence. Um, AGAIN, it's a, it's

47
00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:20.679
a, it's a vague notion, partly because The, the,

48
00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.259
the notion of the political is vague, and even

49
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.130
the notion of violence can can be vague, um,

50
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.139
and action that begins as political violence can end

51
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.619
up as something that wouldn't be considered political violence.

52
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.600
So for example, Uh, some forms of political violence,

53
00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:48.809
uh, could. Um, Lead to something that we might

54
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.100
think of as revolution, and a revolution would be

55
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.179
initially at least considered political violence or revolutionary violence

56
00:03:56.179 --> 00:04:00.389
would be considered political violence, but It could develop

57
00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.610
into civil war, and once there's a civil war

58
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.089
in progress, wouldn't, one wouldn't refer to the action

59
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.369
of either side as political violence because it would

60
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:15.580
then be war. Um, I think the notion of

61
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.059
political violence also encompasses virtually all instances of what

62
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.940
we think of as terrorism, which is typically defined

63
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.700
as the intentional harming of innocent people as a

64
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.519
means of achieving aims that are political in nature.

65
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:41.010
Um, AND terrorism is not always, of course, a,

66
00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.489
a, a domestic matter. There's international terrorism. Um, SO

67
00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:49.489
we might think of the destruction of the Twin

68
00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.390
Towers in 9/11 in the United States as political

69
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.089
violence, uh, consider the massacres of October 7th in

70
00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:03.329
Israel as political violence and, and, and so on.

71
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.040
Uh, SO you mentioned Israel. Uh, HOW about, uh,

72
00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.660
genocide? Would you also consider that a form of

73
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.510
political violence? I mean, notwithstanding the fact that, uh,

74
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.959
illegally genocide is considered, according to international law, a

75
00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.079
crime, uh, but I, I mean, would you also

76
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.859
consider it political violence?

77
00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:33.510
Well, again, I think the the notion of political

78
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.950
violence is too vague for there to be a

79
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.220
precise answer to that question. Um, IT'S just a

80
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.250
matter of how the term is used. Um, CERTAINLY

81
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.109
genocide can start off as political violence, I think

82
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:56.769
perhaps. Uh, Rwanda in the early 1990s, um, May

83
00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:01.250
have started off as, you know, one ethnic group

84
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.929
attacking members of another, uh, for reasons of revenge

85
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:12.320
and other, you know, politically motivated reasons, but once

86
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.690
it became kind of systematic and large scale, then

87
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.709
it becomes, then I think we would want to.

88
00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:25.000
Distinguish genocide from mere political violence. Political violence, I

89
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.480
think, is As the term is typically used, excludes

90
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:37.049
large scale and in particular, uh state sponsored violence.

91
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.790
Uh, BY the way, um, please tell me what

92
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.589
you think about this, but, uh, political violence doesn't

93
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:50.410
necessarily have to involve humans or human life as

94
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.500
targets, right? I mean, for example, if it's, uh,

95
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:58.950
organized groups of people, uh, causing property damage to

96
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.630
express themselves politically, that would also be considered a

97
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.570
form of political violence or not.

98
00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:10.250
Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, I was thinking

99
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.190
that usually violence is understood as Physical harm to

100
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.089
a person's body, but of course you're right, um,

101
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.829
destruction of property is also violence, yes. Uh, AND

102
00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:27.709
if, if the motivation is political, then, then it's

103
00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:33.440
political violence. On the other hand, um, When Russia

104
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.880
destroys residential buildings in Ukraine or Israeli forces destroy

105
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.959
residential buildings in Gaza, we wouldn't call that political

106
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:47.209
violence because it's part of war. It's, it's, it's

107
00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:50.600
terrorism in war, but um war very often involves

108
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.089
terrorism.

109
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.549
Yes, and a point that you touched on there

110
00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:59.989
that I think is very important, the motivations that

111
00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:04.410
the actors have for the violence that they perpetrate

112
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.589
are relevant in this case, right, because they have

113
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.989
to be political in order for their actions to

114
00:08:11.989 --> 00:08:14.450
be considered political violence,

115
00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:17.790
right, yeah, it has to be politically motivated to

116
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.970
count as political violence. Yeah, sure. Mhm,

117
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.880
YES, because I, I think that's, uh, an important

118
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.779
point to clarify because it will be relevant for,

119
00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:30.519
uh, later when we talk about political assassinations and

120
00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.799
I want to explore a particular recent case and

121
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.780
I think that will be relevant there.

122
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.039
So, but let me, let me, let me, um,

123
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.130
interrupt you and say that, uh. Um, THIS political

124
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.010
violence is not a topic on which I have

125
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:53.179
written or Uh, done any particular systematic study of

126
00:08:54.190 --> 00:09:02.440
and In particular, um. I am not deeply informed

127
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.280
about recent instances of political violence. I'm, I'm aware

128
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.419
of them, but, um, I, I, I don't know

129
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.460
the details, um, in any depth, so I just.

130
00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:17.859
Issue that disclaimer at the at the outset.

131
00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:20.210
No, of course, and thank you for that. And

132
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.559
as I said before we started the interview, uh,

133
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.169
I wanted to have you on the show because

134
00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:26.799
I also wanted to have on the show an

135
00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:30.729
ethical perspective on political violence, and I thought that

136
00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:33.969
it would link in a relevant way to your

137
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:36.919
other work on the ethics of. Killing for example,

138
00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:40.640
so that's the reason why we're having this conversation,

139
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.580
but let's get, let's get then into more of

140
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.750
the ethics of political violence. So do you think

141
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:53.429
that there are instances where political violence is justified?

142
00:09:55.479 --> 00:10:00.679
Uh, YES, um, there are instances, but what I'm

143
00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:05.000
going to be arguing as we continue is that

144
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.840
they are quite rare. Um. But let's take the

145
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:17.659
case of assassination. Uh, THERE was a plot involving

146
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.820
some, uh, even I believe some German military personnel

147
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.380
to assassinate Hitler. Um, IF they had been able

148
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.340
to carry out that plot and if they had

149
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.400
succeeded, I think that would have been justified political

150
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.450
assassination and therefore justified political violence. Um, SIMILARLY, if

151
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.140
someone had been able to assassinate Stalin. That may

152
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.840
well also have been uh something that would be

153
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.020
morally justified. I think it's an important condition of

154
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:59.020
justifiable political violence. THAT the targets of the political

155
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.409
violence be morally liable to be attacked. Uh, AND

156
00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:07.489
by that I mean they must have, they must

157
00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:13.280
be guilty of or responsible for some threat of

158
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.369
harm or some wrong to people of a sufficient

159
00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:24.090
level of gravity to justify violence. Now, um, I'm

160
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.929
gonna say something slightly technical here, and that is

161
00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:32.960
that. By liable, I, I mean something like this.

162
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.619
They, they have forfeited their right not to be

163
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.359
harmed. They would not be wronged by being harmed.

164
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.900
But I also think that certain conditions on the

165
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:50.539
justifiability of violence are internal to the concept of

166
00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:55.200
liability. Now there's disagreement about that, um, among philosophers.

167
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.460
Uh, MANY, many others disagree with me about this.

168
00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:02.239
I'm not sure how much difference this makes, but,

169
00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:07.809
uh, what I mean is that. A person is

170
00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:11.049
not liable to be harmed if harming that person

171
00:12:11.049 --> 00:12:14.010
would do no good whatsoever, or if it, you

172
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.679
know, if it would be ineffective. Um, I also

173
00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:26.039
think that we measure proportionality by reference to weighing

174
00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:30.400
the good that could be achieved by causing harm

175
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.200
against the magnitude of the harm and so on.

176
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.989
And so I think of necessity and proportionality as

177
00:12:38.989 --> 00:12:43.239
constraints that are internal to liability. So someone is

178
00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:45.960
not liable to a harm that would be disproportionate.

179
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.119
Nor is somebody morally liable to a harm that

180
00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:53.880
would be ineffective or counterproductive. And what I want

181
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.119
to say here is that in principle people can

182
00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:02.119
be morally liable to be harmed, even killed for

183
00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:05.559
political reasons. Like I say, good examples would be

184
00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:12.789
Hitler and Stalin, provided that Assassinating them would have

185
00:13:13.809 --> 00:13:19.289
Prevented Great harms within Europe, within the Soviet Union,

186
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.530
rather than exacerbated those problems that were being caused

187
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:29.039
by these leaders, these political leaders. And what I

188
00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:32.669
tend to think is that in most instances nowadays,

189
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.690
uh, political violence and political assassination in particular are

190
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:43.030
likely to be, um, not just ineffective, but counterproductive.

191
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:49.159
Um, THEY'RE going to, uh, lead to, and, and,

192
00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:54.260
and this is particularly true in democratic societies, um,

193
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.830
in which If a person has been elected to

194
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.950
an office, it's a, you know, it's a violation

195
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.190
of the principles of democracy and so on to

196
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.979
kill somebody who has been elected by the people,

197
00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:07.299
and the reaction of the people is likely to

198
00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:12.210
be one of great outrage and indignation, and, uh,

199
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.390
the, the person killed is going to become a

200
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.419
martyr in the, in the, in the eyes of

201
00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.390
the person's supporters, in which case, those who succeed

202
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.630
the assassinated leader. Um, ARE likely to do things

203
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.619
that are even worse, or at least as bad

204
00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.510
as those that the leader was going to do

205
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.849
anyway. So I tend to think that political violence

206
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.479
at all levels is Not just ineffective, but counterproductive.

207
00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:44.659
And for those reasons, you don't have a liability

208
00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.780
justification or any other kind of justification for doing

209
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:47.979
it.

210
00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:54.690
Right, and, and I mean, actually, uh, there's uh

211
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.090
work in sociology that supports what you're saying there

212
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.349
because there's a sociologist, an American sociologist, Erica Chenoweth.

213
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:12.340
And she studied violent and nonviolent revolutions, and the

214
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.820
ones that are nonviolent tend to last longer in

215
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.539
time and tend to have more support also of

216
00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:25.039
the general population, so they tend to lead to

217
00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:28.409
regimes that are more stable afterwards.

218
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.690
Yeah, well, I mean. One thing that's perfectly obvious

219
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:40.570
is that In conditions in which political violence is

220
00:15:40.989 --> 00:15:47.289
more likely, the population in which it Might occur

221
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.750
is going to be divided. They're going to be,

222
00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:55.809
as the people say nowadays, polarized, and violence by

223
00:15:55.809 --> 00:16:02.190
one side is never going to be. Convincing, persuasive,

224
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:04.070
or whatever to people on the other side, it

225
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.750
is going to, uh, produce a desire for vengeance,

226
00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:15.330
revenge, retribution, it's going to elicit hatred, um, and,

227
00:16:15.989 --> 00:16:20.900
Uh, so the use of political violence. Will very

228
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:27.270
often just provoke an escalation of violence and do

229
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:35.669
nothing to, uh, achieve peaceful reconciliation, compromise, enabling people

230
00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:40.030
to live together peacefully. Uh, IT, it, it's just

231
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.469
always going to be counterproductive in this way, self-defeating.

232
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.169
So I wrote here a few examples that came

233
00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:52.869
to my mind when I was thinking about uh

234
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.229
cases of uh political violence that I think would

235
00:16:57.229 --> 00:17:01.710
be justified and uh I want to hear your

236
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.989
thoughts about it. So I wrote here uh slave

237
00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:12.770
revolts. Revolutions against oppressive regimes resisting occupation by another

238
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.530
country, and I also included, and I can explain

239
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.760
why I included that in the 19th century, particularly

240
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.489
workers fighting for their rights like when for example

241
00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:28.635
they destroyed. Machinery in their factories and things like

242
00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:32.295
that. So, uh, I mean, uh, and I, I'm,

243
00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:35.295
I'm just going to say about that, that, uh,

244
00:17:35.314 --> 00:17:37.175
I think that for example in the case of

245
00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:41.194
revolutions against oppressive regimes and workers fighting for their

246
00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:45.510
rights, uh, in a violent form. I think it's

247
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:52.069
justified when there are no legal mechanisms that they

248
00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:57.089
can resort to or when the state doesn't listen

249
00:17:57.189 --> 00:18:00.949
to their demands because of its nature or it

250
00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:03.709
might be, as I said, an oppressive regime or

251
00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:06.770
something like that. So what do you think about

252
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.910
these examples that I came up with?

253
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.510
Uh, I think they're all different. They all raise

254
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.589
different questions. Let me see if I can think

255
00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:23.790
of some. Uh, CONSIDERATIONS that might be common to

256
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:30.859
all of them. You mentioned workers destroying machinery. That

257
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:36.459
is different from harming people. Um, YOU mentioned slave

258
00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:41.660
revolts. Um, IF slave revolts are directed against slave

259
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.449
owners, that's one thing because the slave owners, uh,

260
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:53.760
are arguably liable to be harmed. Um. Violent revolutions,

261
00:18:53.770 --> 00:19:01.469
um. Um, I, they may be directed towards military

262
00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:10.170
forces, whatever, similarly with Uh, resistance to occupation. But

263
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:16.089
I think a lot depends on what the conditions

264
00:19:16.089 --> 00:19:23.619
are now, so slavery. Um, WAS involve people who

265
00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:27.390
were dispersed over a huge area. Collective action was

266
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.339
difficult. It would have been very difficult for slaves

267
00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:38.290
to engage in Gandhian tactics of nonviolent resistance because

268
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.170
they were all spread out over different plantations and

269
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.579
so on throughout the south. So their slave revolts

270
00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:51.060
directed against slave owners might have been justified on

271
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.699
the assumption that they could somehow or other appeal

272
00:19:54.699 --> 00:19:58.099
to the consciences of people elsewhere. On the other

273
00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:00.979
hand, it's not clear that the actual slave revolts

274
00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:04.459
that involve killing people and so on had that

275
00:20:04.459 --> 00:20:06.739
effect. I just don't know. I'm not a historian

276
00:20:06.739 --> 00:20:10.010
of slavery, so I don't know. Um, I do

277
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.449
think, let me give you, uh, one example that

278
00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:19.040
I, that is particularly, uh, pressing right now, and

279
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.670
that is the occupation of Gaza and the West

280
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:29.020
Bank by Israel for many, many decades. Um, The

281
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.540
occupation of those areas by Israel, I think, is

282
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.180
a kind of paradigm of political injustice. This was

283
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:42.390
a uh a people. With a sense of their

284
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.010
own identity, with their own culture, with their own

285
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.750
norms and so on, who were systematically oppressed, dominated,

286
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:59.160
and denied freedom and rights of self-determination. I still

287
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:05.839
think every instance of violence that wasn't immediate self-defense

288
00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:10.319
by the Palestinians was self-defeating. I think, and I've

289
00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:15.650
said this for many decades, that If the Palestinians

290
00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:20.109
initially had been led by a Gandhi-like figure rather

291
00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:23.430
than Arafat and the PLO who engaged in terrorism,

292
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.900
I think the Palestinians would have had their own

293
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.800
state again decades ago. Because I think that's what

294
00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:37.699
Israel was much more vulnerable to the appeal to

295
00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:44.939
conscience, especially earlier when Israeli society consisted of refugees

296
00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:49.099
fleeing political persecution and oppression and domination and had

297
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:53.260
come to seek safety and to have the ability

298
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.380
to be self-determining. And if the Palestinians had made

299
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.040
the appeal to them by saying, What about us?

300
00:22:00.229 --> 00:22:02.910
Are, don't we also have rights to freedom and

301
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.739
self-determination and and so on. Um I think the

302
00:22:08.739 --> 00:22:11.819
Israelis would have been much more receptive to that

303
00:22:11.819 --> 00:22:14.089
than they would have been to the use of

304
00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:17.060
political violence and in particular terrorism, which again, as

305
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.180
I said earlier, simply inspires hatred and a desire

306
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.180
for revenge. So I think, for example, this unspeakably

307
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:30.180
immoral war that Israel has fought in Gaza, um,

308
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.270
will ultimately be self-defeating for Israel. And, uh, independently

309
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.349
of the, you know, the, the horrible beyond description

310
00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:45.739
consequences for Palestinian civilians. Um,

311
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.349
SO, uh, since you're mentioning that, since you're mentioning

312
00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:53.510
that, and since earlier you also referred to October

313
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.550
7th, let me ask you then, do you think

314
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:02.420
that if on October 7th, 2023, Hamas had only

315
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.790
targeted, uh, military, it would have been a form

316
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.949
of justified political violence?

317
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.589
No, because I think it would have been, again,

318
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.969
uh, ineffective and self-defeating. What they did was vastly

319
00:23:16.969 --> 00:23:22.550
worse, um, vastly more immoral and vastly more self-defeating,

320
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.900
um, uh, than, than. It would have been if

321
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:34.239
they had attacked only military installations. That would have

322
00:23:34.239 --> 00:23:40.040
been in a in a way discriminating, but Uh

323
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.400
It, it would not have done any good. What,

324
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.859
what, what the Palestinians. Need to do is to

325
00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:56.550
make their appeal nonviolently. Uh, THAT'S, that's my view.

326
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.150
Like, you know, one thing that they could do

327
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:04.030
would be to have mass sit-ins blocking roads to

328
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:11.030
settlements, um, or blocking the IDF in, in, in,

329
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.630
in Gaza, for example, but nonviolently.

330
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.270
Yes, the reason why

331
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.729
that Gandhi did,

332
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:20.469
yes, the reason why I ask you that, I

333
00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:23.069
mean, actually it's two reasons. The first one is

334
00:24:23.069 --> 00:24:28.069
that according to international law, people who are part

335
00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:32.790
of a population that is occupied by another country

336
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.810
have the right to resist, and that includes. Political

337
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.410
violence if it targets only military and also I've

338
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.369
heard from some people, some of them friends, others

339
00:24:45.369 --> 00:24:50.650
not who are pro-Palestinian, and they, they tell me

340
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:56.650
that they don't consider Hamas. WHAT they do as

341
00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.530
a form of terrorism, of course legally that's not

342
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.729
correct, but anyway, they don't consider them a terrorist

343
00:25:03.729 --> 00:25:08.530
group because they're, I mean the kinds of things

344
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.530
they do is that is that exactly that kind

345
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:17.050
of thing that they consider to be. Um, RESISTANCE

346
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.390
that uh that they consider to be, uh, justifiable,

347
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.329
uh, or, yeah, justifiable resistance, so.

348
00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:29.400
Well, look, I, I think there can be very

349
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.119
extreme circumstances in which what we call terrorism could

350
00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:37.959
be morally justified. That is, um, there could be

351
00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:43.760
very extreme circumstances and incredibly rare in which the

352
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.479
harm, the intentional harming of innocent people as a

353
00:25:46.479 --> 00:25:50.150
means of achieving a political aim could be, uh,

354
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.739
justified. But I think that's very rare and what

355
00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:02.000
Hamas does is terrorism, pure and simple. When it

356
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.119
fires rockets into Israel, it's trying to kill innocent

357
00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:08.699
people. It's trying to kill people in their homes.

358
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.119
And that's what Hamas did on October 7th. I

359
00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:21.310
think myself, uh, Everything that Hamas does is Unjustifiable

360
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.510
morally. It's not only totally immoral in the effects

361
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:31.489
that it has on the targets who are almost

362
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.709
always innocent people, innocent in the sense that they

363
00:26:34.709 --> 00:26:36.979
are not liable to be harmed or killed. They

364
00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:41.520
haven't done anything to justify this. But also because

365
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.400
what they do is totally ineffective. Are the Palestinians

366
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.760
in Gaza better off now for what Hamas did

367
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:59.630
on October 7th? AND um. Hamas could predict that,

368
00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:04.189
they could know that. They, every conflict between Hamas

369
00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:08.579
and Israel since Hamas came to power. Has taken

370
00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:12.459
the following form. Hamas shoots some rockets into Israel

371
00:27:12.459 --> 00:27:16.219
or some Hamas militants get into Israel through the

372
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:20.099
tunnels and innocent people are harmed or killed, and

373
00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:23.339
then Israel sends tanks and planes into Gaza and

374
00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:28.329
kills far more innocent Palestinians than Uh, Hamas was

375
00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:31.449
able to kill. And what's so they can they

376
00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:34.050
can predict that what they do is going to

377
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.489
cause far more suffering among their own people than

378
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:40.569
among Israelis. But also, it never does any good

379
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.650
at all, except, you know, the only thing it

380
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.890
does is makes Israelis think Palestinians can never be

381
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.739
trusted. They're all terrorists. I can't tell you how

382
00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:53.380
many times I've heard that kind of view expressed

383
00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:01.569
in Israel. Um And That's, it's because of what

384
00:28:01.569 --> 00:28:06.869
Hamas and before that, the PLO did. And, uh,

385
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.650
and again, another reason why violence by Palestinians has

386
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.369
been self-defeating is that Israel has dependence, particularly earlier,

387
00:28:14.449 --> 00:28:18.560
but even now, has depended very heavily on the

388
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.369
United States for economic and military support, military support

389
00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:26.170
in the form of bombs and that sort of

390
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:32.380
thing. And um It's been easier for Israel to

391
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:37.780
get this from the United States. Because people in

392
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.219
the United States think of Palestinians as terrorists rather

393
00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:45.819
than as victims of injustice, and that's because what

394
00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.060
you, what people in the US read about are,

395
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.219
you know, the instances of violence by the Palestinian

396
00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:55.489
groups against Israeli civilians. So again, I think it's

397
00:28:55.489 --> 00:28:59.300
just totally counterproductive in every way, in addition to

398
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.060
being immoral because the targets are not liable.

399
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.439
Mhm. OK, so,

400
00:29:05.189 --> 00:29:08.069
you know, you spoke of people being pro-Palestinian. I

401
00:29:08.069 --> 00:29:13.709
mean, the, what I wish is that people would

402
00:29:13.709 --> 00:29:18.310
stop thinking of themselves as essentially Palestinian or essentially

403
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.869
Israeli Jew, everybody waving their flags and being opposed

404
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:26.500
to members of the other group. What they need

405
00:29:26.709 --> 00:29:29.910
is for all of them to recognize that they

406
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.959
are human beings. That for the most part, they

407
00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:35.560
want the same things in life. They want to

408
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.119
live in peace. They want their children to grow

409
00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:41.640
up healthy and get an education and prosper. Things

410
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.959
that people everywhere want. Um, YOU know, maybe some

411
00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:50.089
Hamas militants are, uh, Different in that respect. Um,

412
00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:53.209
NO doubt the members of the current Israeli government

413
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.969
are, are, are different in that respect, but most

414
00:29:55.969 --> 00:30:00.180
people Can't can learn to live with each other

415
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.489
in peace without, uh, this, this dreadful kind of

416
00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:07.140
in-group outgroup, uh, uh, hatred on, on both sides.

417
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.140
So I'm supportive of those groups that try to

418
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.930
bring communities and peoples together. I'll just put in

419
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.020
a plug for Parents Circle, which is a group

420
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.060
of bereaved, uh, Israelis and bereaved Palestinians who've come

421
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.949
together to try to Show what I have just

422
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:29.390
said. We're all people and let's not kill each

423
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.369
other's children.

424
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.869
OK, so maybe you also would like to comment

425
00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:38.069
on the final example I gave about workers in

426
00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:42.469
the 19th century destroying machinery because, I mean, they

427
00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:47.150
were being exploited in that particular case by people

428
00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.869
who owned factories and stuff like that. So what

429
00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:53.109
do you think about that as a form of

430
00:30:53.109 --> 00:30:54.150
political violence?

431
00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:01.989
Uh, PROBABLY justifiable. Uh, AGAIN, it's just destruction of

432
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:05.969
property. And when one reads about the conditions in

433
00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:09.459
which people labored in the 19th century, I know

434
00:31:09.459 --> 00:31:14.410
mostly about England where, where I live. Um, THE

435
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:19.939
conditions were horrific. People, uh, uh, and, and involving

436
00:31:19.939 --> 00:31:25.439
small children as well, um, and people being, uh,

437
00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:30.569
maimed and killed in this machinery and, uh. Yeah,

438
00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:38.069
the conditions were. Appalling What the industrialists were doing

439
00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:43.069
was highly immoral. Just like what a lot of

440
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:48.510
billionaires today are doing is highly immoral, um. And

441
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:53.349
the destruction of machinery. I would be a way

442
00:31:53.349 --> 00:32:00.680
of Communicating to these people the anger, the getting

443
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.199
them to pay attention. You have to make them

444
00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:09.150
pay attention. Would these industrialists have responded to, uh,

445
00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:12.920
forms of later forms of industrial action like strikes

446
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.560
and sit-in strikes and that sort of thing? Who

447
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.199
knows, they may have just been able to call

448
00:32:18.199 --> 00:32:22.800
in the military and, and, uh, get everybody dispersed

449
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.219
and, uh, people elsewhere wouldn't even know about it.

450
00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:33.739
So, the possibilities for the effectiveness of nonviolent action

451
00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:39.959
have Developed greatly since the 19th century with mass

452
00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:44.050
communication and so on. And when newspapers can report

453
00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.410
these things and photographers can be there to take

454
00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:53.050
pictures or videos of, uh, uh, people beating up

455
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:59.869
nonviolent protesters and so on that. ENABLES nonviolent action

456
00:32:59.869 --> 00:33:02.630
to be much more effective because it makes the

457
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:09.069
moral appeal public. Uh, AND that was probably not

458
00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:13.670
possible to workers in, in industrial societies in the

459
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.660
19th century. So they had, they had to do

460
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.430
something else. And I do think, you know, destruction

461
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.550
of machinery is far More likely to be justified

462
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.349
than harming persons.

463
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:29.479
Mhm. Yes, and also because we have to keep

464
00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:31.770
in mind, and I think that I mentioned this

465
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.369
or at least alluded to it when presenting the

466
00:33:34.369 --> 00:33:37.390
example when I said that they didn't back in

467
00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:42.689
early industrialization, they didn't really have much legal resources

468
00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:46.369
and so strikes. Were not even uh something that

469
00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:49.930
was protected legally and so I mean they didn't

470
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:57.489
have many nonviolent resources to express their frustration against

471
00:33:57.489 --> 00:34:01.689
the exploit the exploitation they were victims of, right.

472
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.930
Yeah, I mean there were forms of public protests

473
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:11.159
that were possible, uh, you know, large gatherings of

474
00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:14.750
people and so on, and of the sort that

475
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.438
still go on that went on the other day

476
00:34:16.438 --> 00:34:20.570
in the US with the no kings protests. Um,

477
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.159
But It's difficult for workers in a particular town

478
00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:32.858
to organize this kind of thing. Uh, OR to

479
00:34:32.858 --> 00:34:34.819
get it publicized. I mean, there were in the

480
00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:40.779
19th century rallies by suffragettes and people in favor

481
00:34:40.779 --> 00:34:46.739
of expansion of the franchise to non-property owners and

482
00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.059
to women and so on. And, and uh these

483
00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:54.978
forms of appeal were generally nonviolent and eventually they

484
00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:58.719
became Successful, mhm,

485
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.770
yes, so let me ask you now about the

486
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.689
political assassination specifically which I think and as I

487
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:11.689
mentioned earlier I think is uh the aspect or

488
00:35:11.689 --> 00:35:15.290
one of the forms of political violence that perhaps

489
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.489
links more relevantly to the rest of your work

490
00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:23.429
because it. Involves uh taking the life of someone

491
00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:26.969
or several people so uh since you wrote, as

492
00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:29.270
I said, the book on the ethics of killing

493
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.270
and the ethics of killing you in war, do

494
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:36.429
you have anything to say specifically about political assassinations?

495
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.149
Do you think that sometimes they might be justified?

496
00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:46.449
I've, as I said earlier, I think the justification

497
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:56.850
would need to include. The the the the. Justified

498
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.290
claim that the victim of assassination. Um, WOULD not

499
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:06.969
be wronged by, uh, being killed. That would be

500
00:36:06.969 --> 00:36:10.489
because this person continues to pose a threat of

501
00:36:10.489 --> 00:36:15.889
unjustified harm to other people, and of course political

502
00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:21.729
leaders can pose threats of unjustifiable harm to vast

503
00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:25.250
numbers of innocent people as we see today and

504
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.959
Putin in Ukraine and Netanyahu and his Qatari in

505
00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:36.760
Gaza. And the Trump administration in the United States

506
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:43.179
causing vast harm to persons and institutions there. Um,

507
00:36:46.409 --> 00:36:50.739
22 points I think are important here. In most

508
00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:54.159
cases, as I said earlier, I think political assassination

509
00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:58.719
is unlikely to be effective in achieving the aim

510
00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:05.179
of eliminating the wrongdoing. Um, AND that's because, you

511
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:08.419
know, the leader will, will be replaced by somebody

512
00:37:08.419 --> 00:37:11.780
equally bad and political change will not occur. What

513
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.860
will, what will occur will be revenge against the

514
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.449
people who were in any way associated with the

515
00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:26.939
assassin or assassins. Um, I'm forgetting now what the

516
00:37:26.939 --> 00:37:34.229
other consideration was, but um So the, the, the

517
00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:42.780
likely ineffectiveness is, is a An important consideration. Uh

518
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.540
GOSH, I, I'm just forgetting what the other thought

519
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.080
was. I mean, if the person is morally liable

520
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:55.209
to be harmed or killed, um, Then the assassination

521
00:37:55.209 --> 00:37:57.570
would not be murder. Murder is the killing of

522
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:06.750
an innocent person. Um And uh. Very often political

523
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.989
assassination is against somebody who is guilty of great

524
00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:18.479
wrongdoing, though the In instances of political assassination that

525
00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:23.649
occurred to me just offhand, the successful ones, particularly

526
00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:26.649
in the United States, so John F. Kennedy, Martin

527
00:38:26.649 --> 00:38:30.949
Luther King, Robert Kennedy, uh, these were not wrongdoers.

528
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.409
These were not people who were morally liable to

529
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:38.850
be killed. Um. Nothing good was achieved by any

530
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.959
of this. Uh, AND, oh yeah, the other, that's

531
00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:44.000
the other thing I wanted to say, and that

532
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:50.189
that is that It's important legally and also morally

533
00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:59.260
to uphold a principled objection to assassination because It's

534
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.189
so often likely to be used against the wrong

535
00:39:03.189 --> 00:39:10.010
people, um. So if if we have, if somebody

536
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.850
says, oh yeah, political assassination, assassination can be morally

537
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:19.219
justified. And lots of people come to believe that,

538
00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:24.100
then the consequences are likely to be dreadful. So

539
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.689
we want to uphold a norm against Uh, assassination,

540
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:35.310
um. For, for that reason, if for no other.

541
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.409
And again, I think that coincides with my claim

542
00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:45.439
that normally there are far better ways of Removing

543
00:39:45.439 --> 00:39:50.879
from power some evil or tyrannical figure than assassination.

544
00:39:52.149 --> 00:39:55.270
So let me ask you, OK. Yeah, let, let

545
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.110
me ask you, because earlier you mentioned Stalin, if

546
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.350
someone had killed Stalin. So let me ask you,

547
00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:05.189
for example, when we're talking about uh people who

548
00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:08.709
are the leaders of oppressive regimes like Stalin was,

549
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:13.429
like Hitler was, like Mussolini was, I've heard from

550
00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:18.719
some philosophers that. Uh, PEOPLE, uh, in this case

551
00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:21.439
we're talking about political figures, but it could be

552
00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:26.199
any other person, people who act immorally like they

553
00:40:26.199 --> 00:40:30.280
did toward other people. Uh, ONE of the reasons

554
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.965
why it might be. Justifiable to kill them is

555
00:40:35.965 --> 00:40:41.004
that their life is worth less than the life

556
00:40:41.004 --> 00:40:44.165
of other people, that because they are immoral, their

557
00:40:44.165 --> 00:40:47.495
life is worth less. What do you think about

558
00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:49.245
that kind of argument?

559
00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:57.909
I, I, I think it's uh, uh, I, I'm,

560
00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:00.030
I'm trying to be polite here, but I don't

561
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.429
think I can be. I think it's a silly

562
00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:05.989
argument. Um, SUPPOSE someone's life is worth less. That's

563
00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:13.350
not a reason to kill that individual. Um You

564
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.550
might say these people deserve it. You, you, you

565
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.750
might say, uh, uh, as a, a philosopher I

566
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.959
know in Cambridge has said that sometimes It, it

567
00:41:26.959 --> 00:41:33.139
just, it, it's better if, if Such evil individuals

568
00:41:33.139 --> 00:41:35.979
don't coexist with us on the planet, that we

569
00:41:35.979 --> 00:41:38.739
have a better state of the world if it's

570
00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:44.050
not blighted by the existence of these awful people.

571
00:41:44.379 --> 00:41:47.290
These might be positive reasons for getting rid of

572
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:51.570
somebody. I don't myself think they are. Um, I,

573
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:57.939
I think, as I said, the justification that would

574
00:41:57.939 --> 00:42:05.510
be Uh, really, the only realistic and feasible justification

575
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:10.000
for assassination would be a liability justification, namely that

576
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:16.189
a person in a prominent person in a position

577
00:42:16.189 --> 00:42:24.030
of power. IS engaged in wrongdoing, threatens unjustifiable harm

578
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:29.989
to other people, and eliminating this person through assassination

579
00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:37.010
would be the most effective means of defending the

580
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:43.340
potential victims of this prominent person. Um, IN that

581
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.360
case, political assassination or assassination could be morally justified,

582
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.919
but I think the justification would have to be

583
00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:57.600
a liability justification. And I think That the, I

584
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.389
mean, you see this, uh, In the media now,

585
00:43:02.429 --> 00:43:05.790
people saying we have to, you know, it's really

586
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.489
important to achieve justice in the Middle East by

587
00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:13.250
making sure that Netanyahu is punished and so on.

588
00:43:13.649 --> 00:43:16.229
Yes, I think in a way it's important that

589
00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:19.669
Netanyahu should be punished, but only as a means

590
00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:22.870
of preventing him from engaging in further wrongdoing and

591
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.909
only as a means of preventing his action from

592
00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:29.969
Providing inspiration to others. If we punish people like

593
00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:34.330
Netanyahu, um, we may deter others like him in

594
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.590
the future. We shouldn't punish him because he deserves

595
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.449
it, though he's, in my view, about as evil

596
00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:42.629
as any human being could ever possibly be.

597
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.229
Mhm, YEAH, I, I understand that distinction and I

598
00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:49.270
think it's important to make it so, uh, but

599
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.709
uh I mean just putting aside using that type,

600
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.030
that kind of argument to justify political violence or

601
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.770
not, just putting that bit aside, do you agree

602
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:04.629
as a moral philosopher that people who practice immoral

603
00:44:04.629 --> 00:44:08.989
acts, people who are immoral, their lives are worth

604
00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:11.929
less than the lives of people who are immoral?

605
00:44:12.729 --> 00:44:14.169
I don't know. I, I, the problem is I

606
00:44:14.169 --> 00:44:15.889
don't know what that means. How much is my

607
00:44:15.889 --> 00:44:17.969
life worth? What is it? Is this some sort

608
00:44:17.969 --> 00:44:25.179
of monetary value or what? I mean, Um, Uh

609
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.280
Do we want there to be evil people on

610
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:36.959
the planet? No, um. Uh, IT would be better

611
00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:41.040
if people were good and nice and so on,

612
00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:48.750
but worth less. I. Well, in Let, let me,

613
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.449
let me put it this way. Um, IF, uh,

614
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:57.879
if I see a, uh, uh, Some 90 year

615
00:44:57.879 --> 00:45:02.739
old person about to drown. This person's only got

616
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:05.379
another year or so of life left to live,

617
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.860
the perfectly harmless person. And also in the water,

618
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.620
there's Donald Trump, who's about to drown, uh, and

619
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:19.080
I can save only one of them. Um, I'm

620
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.050
going to save the very elderly non-Donald Trump person.

621
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.919
So in that sense, yeah, I mean, I, I

622
00:45:25.919 --> 00:45:29.699
wouldn't, I, I, I, I've, would I even spend,

623
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.439
uh, uh, uh, 10% to save Donald Trump's life?

624
00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:36.280
No. So in that sense, it's worth less, but

625
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.679
that's because, you know, for the reasons I've given,

626
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.370
I just, The world would be a much better

627
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.389
place without Donald Trump in it.

628
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.879
Mhm. Yeah, I mean, the reason why I asked

629
00:45:46.879 --> 00:45:49.479
you that is that because uh one time I

630
00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:51.959
was having, uh, not for the channel, but in

631
00:45:51.959 --> 00:45:54.919
other, in another context, I was having a discussion

632
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.129
with a philosopher as well, because I was saying

633
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.360
that uh the lives of um the lives of

634
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.760
all people are worth the same. I mean, the

635
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.919
life of, for example, a billionaire is worth the

636
00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:12.409
same as the, the life of a common worker.

637
00:46:12.479 --> 00:46:15.324
I mean, something. Like that and then it was

638
00:46:15.324 --> 00:46:19.895
when the person said, oh no, that's not true,

639
00:46:20.364 --> 00:46:24.524
because the life of immoral people is worth less

640
00:46:24.524 --> 00:46:28.764
than the life of moral people and then they

641
00:46:28.764 --> 00:46:31.645
mentioned Hitler, for example, and said, oh, the life

642
00:46:31.645 --> 00:46:35.364
of Hitler was worth less than the life of

643
00:46:35.364 --> 00:46:39.284
the average German, and I mean I find it

644
00:46:39.284 --> 00:46:42.324
really hard to understand that argument honestly.

645
00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:45.590
Well, like I say, it's just, I, there are

646
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.790
different ways of interpreting such a claim, worth less.

647
00:46:49.909 --> 00:46:53.469
What does that mean? And some of, some of

648
00:46:53.469 --> 00:46:56.979
the ways of interpreting that claim, uh, are, are

649
00:46:56.979 --> 00:47:00.260
probably plausible. So again, if I could save the

650
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.510
life of Hitler or save the life of some

651
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.550
ordinary German, I would save the life of the

652
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.610
ordinary German. And part of the reason for that

653
00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:12.939
would be What each of these people was likely

654
00:47:12.939 --> 00:47:17.510
to do. Another reason would be how good is

655
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:22.840
that individual's life for that person. Um, SO for

656
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.399
example, Again, uh, Just take, take the life of

657
00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:33.030
somebody whose life is full of suffering and misery,

658
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.409
and they often contemplate suicide and they go on

659
00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:39.719
living just for the sake of others, uh, and

660
00:47:39.719 --> 00:47:41.350
so on, and there's nothing that can be done

661
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.620
to make that person's life better. It's just an

662
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.199
Intrinsically miserable life. There's nothing evil about this person,

663
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.239
but the person's life is miserable. And then there's

664
00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:54.860
another person whose life is very well worth living.

665
00:47:55.679 --> 00:47:58.699
This person is flourishing and happy and so on

666
00:47:58.699 --> 00:48:00.989
and so forth. Again, if I could save one

667
00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:03.510
or the other of them. I think I have

668
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:06.149
a reason to save the person whose life would

669
00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:09.149
be better rather than to save the life of

670
00:48:09.149 --> 00:48:11.510
the person whose life would be much, much less

671
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.110
good and barely good at all, or maybe not

672
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.389
good at all. Um, AND what I think about

673
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.909
Hitler, for example, is that his was not a

674
00:48:20.909 --> 00:48:23.250
life that was worth living for a human being.

675
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.489
He had a life that was terrible for him.

676
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.870
Even if he thought he was happy and so

677
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.310
on, this was still. In my view, a bad

678
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.750
life for a human being completely independently of the

679
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:40.379
effects his action had on other people. And and

680
00:48:40.379 --> 00:48:42.100
the way I always try to bring that out

681
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.090
is I ask people, I, I give people the

682
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:48.620
following sort of thought experiment. Suppose you're a parent

683
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.459
of a child and you get a phone call

684
00:48:50.459 --> 00:48:53.300
from the school and it says, um, we've had

685
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.139
a, we've had an incident here today. A child

686
00:48:57.139 --> 00:49:00.379
was badly beaten up by a bully, and then

687
00:49:00.379 --> 00:49:03.479
the person who's Saying this is, oh, excuse me

688
00:49:03.479 --> 00:49:05.790
a moment, I've got, and then goes off the

689
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.840
phone for a minute and the parent on the

690
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.919
phone doesn't know whether her child is the bully

691
00:49:11.919 --> 00:49:14.120
or the victim. And I think most of us

692
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.479
would want our child to be the victim rather

693
00:49:16.479 --> 00:49:18.879
than the bully. And, you know, the victim has

694
00:49:18.879 --> 00:49:25.719
been harmed, but we want our children. Um, WE

695
00:49:25.719 --> 00:49:29.879
would rather our children have less happiness. And not

696
00:49:29.879 --> 00:49:32.939
be immoral than be in one way happier but

697
00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:35.479
be immoral for their own sake, for their own

698
00:49:35.479 --> 00:49:38.050
good. And so that's another way in which Hitler's

699
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.139
life was worth less. It was a terrible life

700
00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:42.530
for a human being. So we can go on

701
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.060
and on and on. We can say that Hitler

702
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.340
was liable to be killed. Some people would say,

703
00:49:46.379 --> 00:49:49.189
many people would say he deserved to die. And

704
00:49:49.189 --> 00:49:50.350
so on and so forth. There are lots of

705
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.510
ways of interpreting this claim that his life was

706
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.389
worth less, but it's important, I think, to try

707
00:49:55.389 --> 00:49:59.469
to clarify which of these different interpretations we have

708
00:49:59.469 --> 00:50:00.080
in mind.

709
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:06.149
Mhm. Right, so let's talk more about the motives

710
00:50:06.149 --> 00:50:10.030
of people who assassinate other people. I mean, as

711
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.909
you, as you said earlier, for it to count

712
00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.669
as a form of political violence or a political

713
00:50:15.669 --> 00:50:19.310
assassination, the motives of the killer have to be

714
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.750
political, and I find this very interesting because, I

715
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.989
mean, one thing that happened recently and it was

716
00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:29.729
in fact one. Of the cases that motivated me

717
00:50:29.729 --> 00:50:32.179
to invite you on the show to talk about

718
00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:35.780
the ethics of political violence and political assassinations, more

719
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.340
specifically was the case of the assassination of Charlie

720
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:43.060
Kirk in the US. Why? Because I mean at

721
00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:47.000
this point in time it's still not clear whether

722
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.139
it was a political assassination or not. Why? Because

723
00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:54.139
we're not sure about the political motivations of the.

724
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.530
I mean, it seems that he didn't have any

725
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.330
form of coherent political belief system or something like

726
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:06.770
that, and then there are contradictory sort of evidence

727
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.010
like for example the fact that he inscribed in

728
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:15.370
these uh bullet casings, uh, things like Bella Choo

729
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:19.129
Bella Chow, which is an anti-fascist song, but on

730
00:51:19.129 --> 00:51:23.560
the other hand, uh. The police, the authorities spoke

731
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.199
with his roommate and with the friends that he

732
00:51:27.199 --> 00:51:30.919
spoke with via Discord on the internet, and they

733
00:51:30.919 --> 00:51:34.040
were all surprised that he had done such a

734
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.340
thing because with them he never spoke of politics.

735
00:51:38.479 --> 00:51:41.239
So I mean it's all over the place at

736
00:51:41.239 --> 00:51:44.000
this point in time. We're not sure if he

737
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.820
had really political motivations to do. What he did

738
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.149
or not and in its aftermath, even though we

739
00:51:53.149 --> 00:51:57.909
were not sure of his motives, there, there were

740
00:51:57.909 --> 00:52:02.340
people, right wingers in America, and Donald Trump himself,

741
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:06.429
who immediately, who immediately blamed the radical left, and

742
00:52:06.429 --> 00:52:09.550
there were conspiracy theories on the internet about oh

743
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:15.020
it was a radical trans group that. I mean

744
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.100
that was behind the assassination and then there were,

745
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.879
I, I, I mean the things that it is

746
00:52:22.699 --> 00:52:28.870
legitimate to call political persecution because for example on

747
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.939
Twitter, and I think this was really horrible, people

748
00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:37.979
tried to dox people who were just criticizing Charlie

749
00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:42.090
Kirk's views or for example celebrating and I also

750
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.229
have a question specifically about that celebrating his death

751
00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:49.330
and uh there were a few people who lost

752
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:53.729
their jobs because of it and I, I mean

753
00:52:53.729 --> 00:52:58.669
now there's this sort of discourse of going after

754
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.689
uh groups that are politicized and are and that

755
00:53:03.689 --> 00:53:07.209
are on the radical left in America in the

756
00:53:07.209 --> 00:53:11.600
aftermath of. The assassination. So I mean, what do

757
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.590
you think about all of that, because I mean

758
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.949
on the one hand, I would think myself that

759
00:53:17.949 --> 00:53:20.479
if at this point we're not sure if the

760
00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:25.719
killer had political motives, we can't really say that

761
00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:29.350
it was a political assassination. That's the first thing,

762
00:53:29.399 --> 00:53:33.080
even though Charlie Kirk was a political figure, he

763
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.919
was a political activist and so on. Uh, AND

764
00:53:36.919 --> 00:53:39.179
on the other hand, I think that it's been

765
00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:42.290
immoral, the sort of response that we've seen from

766
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:46.729
the Trump administration in response to something we're not

767
00:53:46.729 --> 00:53:50.889
even sure was a political assassination. So what is

768
00:53:50.889 --> 00:53:52.209
your opinion on that?

769
00:53:53.580 --> 00:54:01.000
Well, what you have just said. Supports my earlier

770
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:09.699
claim that assassinations are normally and are usually predictably,

771
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:15.020
totally counterproductive. Uh, ANYBODY should have known this, that

772
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.770
is to say, if anybody did want to promote

773
00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:24.580
some kind of left wing agenda. Assassinating Charlie Kirk

774
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:28.659
was about the most self-defeating way they could have

775
00:54:28.659 --> 00:54:34.000
gone about promoting that agenda. It was totally predictable

776
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.699
that the Trump administration would react the way that

777
00:54:36.699 --> 00:54:41.879
it has, that businesses and so on would defer

778
00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:47.439
to Trump by punishing those people who, uh, uh,

779
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:53.000
afterwards were critical of Charlie Kirk. And so on.

780
00:54:53.169 --> 00:54:57.360
So, um, and again, I would stress that, uh,

781
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.370
Charlie Kirk, I, I didn't even really know who

782
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.550
he was. I mean, I'm, I live in England

783
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.649
and I do get a lot of uh literature

784
00:55:05.649 --> 00:55:09.280
about right-wing activity in the United States, but I

785
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.550
had never really heard of him because I'm not

786
00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:18.159
that uh attentive. Um, HE certainly had not done

787
00:55:18.159 --> 00:55:21.149
anything to make him liable to be killed. He

788
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.840
was simply going around giving talks defending certain views.

789
00:55:27.149 --> 00:55:30.560
If you disagree with those views, you challenge the

790
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.919
views. You don't kill the person who is promoting

791
00:55:33.919 --> 00:55:39.620
those views. I mean, again, it was intrinsically immoral

792
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:44.159
act and a totally self-defeating one if it was

793
00:55:44.159 --> 00:55:48.350
politically motivated, and I suspect. That it had some

794
00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.870
political motivation. It wasn't just arbitrary. He didn't just

795
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.469
pick somebody, you know, he didn't pick somebody he,

796
00:55:56.070 --> 00:56:00.989
whose views he thought were, were, were, were really

797
00:56:00.989 --> 00:56:04.270
admirable. That, that wouldn't make any sense. I mean,

798
00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.669
unless the guy is just totally deranged. But again,

799
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:10.159
there's no reason to think that, particularly if he

800
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.850
Inscribed things on his bullets as these people tend

801
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:21.280
to do nowadays, which is just. Uh, uh. Yeah.

802
00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:24.800
Again, uh, would never occur to anybody in the

803
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.479
Trump administration to think that this kind of thing

804
00:56:27.479 --> 00:56:30.919
might, uh, suggest, uh, that it would be a

805
00:56:30.919 --> 00:56:37.070
good idea to have, um, Uh, much more restriction

806
00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:40.469
on people's access to guns in that lunatic society

807
00:56:40.469 --> 00:56:43.830
where all the right wingers at least are armed

808
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:46.750
to the teeth. Um, YOU know, they're the ones

809
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.540
who are going on about political violence and, well,

810
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:53.520
everybody goes on about political violence, but, uh, Uh,

811
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.760
you'd have, you'd have thought that, that, that, uh,

812
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:59.010
some of them might say something about, um, trying

813
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.649
to deprive people like this assassin of, of guns,

814
00:57:02.729 --> 00:57:07.189
but that would never occur to people there. Um,

815
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.909
BUT yeah, your, your general point is that Uh

816
00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:17.199
We don't know whether this was a political assassination,

817
00:57:17.239 --> 00:57:21.149
but it's automatically treated as one, and I would

818
00:57:21.149 --> 00:57:25.949
say exploited as one by Trump and Vance and

819
00:57:25.949 --> 00:57:28.260
the other members of the administration and other people

820
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.000
on the right in the United States. They exploiting

821
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.250
this to further polarize the society, to uh inflame

822
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:41.189
hatreds against uh people on the left and and

823
00:57:41.189 --> 00:57:45.689
so on. And again, I think it's um It's

824
00:57:45.689 --> 00:57:52.530
certainly unwise and I think also inappropriate for people

825
00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:56.610
to rejoice in the murder of Charlie Kirk, and

826
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:59.010
this was an assassination. It was a murder. I

827
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.770
mean, if the person is not liable to be

828
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:04.209
killed, it's, it's, it's legally and morally murder. And

829
00:58:04.209 --> 00:58:10.649
so this was clearly an instance of murder. To

830
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:18.729
uh. To celebrate a murder is wrong. To

831
00:58:19.969 --> 00:58:21.419
But, but let me ask

832
00:58:21.419 --> 00:58:25.429
criticize the views of the person is perfectly appropriate

833
00:58:25.929 --> 00:58:27.669
and people are being punished for that.

834
00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:31.530
But, but do you think that uh celebrating a

835
00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:35.810
murder is wrong? I, I mean, is it just

836
00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:40.169
simply, uh, breaking a social norm, or do you

837
00:58:40.169 --> 00:58:42.169
consider it morally wrong?

838
00:58:43.179 --> 00:58:46.090
If it's a murder, I consider it morally wrong.

839
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.070
Um, IF there were, I mean, now, look, if

840
00:58:51.929 --> 00:58:56.530
Stalin had been assassinated and that had led to

841
00:58:56.530 --> 00:59:02.649
some liberalization internal to the Soviet Union, then I

842
00:59:02.649 --> 00:59:09.729
think celebrations would have been. Uh, ENTIRELY appropriate. And

843
00:59:09.729 --> 00:59:14.689
that's because they're celebrating the elimination of someone who

844
00:59:14.689 --> 00:59:17.449
was liable to be killed, whose elimination is going

845
00:59:17.449 --> 00:59:23.439
to be better for innocent people. So it makes

846
00:59:23.439 --> 00:59:27.129
a lot of difference whether it's a justified assassination

847
00:59:27.129 --> 00:59:29.649
or a murder. If it's murder, the victim is

848
00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:32.449
not liable and the consequences are going to be

849
00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:35.129
bad, then it's, yeah, it is, it is wrong

850
00:59:35.129 --> 00:59:35.729
to celebrate.

851
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.989
OK, it is, it is morally wrong, but do

852
00:59:39.989 --> 00:59:46.830
you think that people who celebrate a murder, um,

853
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:51.110
should be deprived of work? I mean, that they

854
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:56.449
should be fired, that that is the proportionate punishment

855
00:59:56.709 --> 00:59:57.330
for them.

856
00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.489
No, I don't think that there should be any,

857
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:06.389
uh any legal restriction on celebrating. The death of

858
01:00:06.389 --> 01:00:11.060
anybody. Um, AND I also think the private forms

859
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:17.030
of punishment are generally also inappropriate. I mean, It

860
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.899
it all depends on the context. Suppose there's a

861
01:00:20.899 --> 01:00:24.830
small business. You know, there are 3 people who

862
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.310
run a, uh, let's say, you know, some sort

863
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:33.649
of little market. And one of them is found

864
01:00:33.649 --> 01:00:38.909
to be celebrating publicly a murder. No, that's going

865
01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:42.830
to be bad for the business. It's, it's wrong

866
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:46.050
to, to do that. Uh, IN those circumstances, it

867
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.530
might very well be, uh, right for the other

868
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:54.129
owners of the business to expel the one who

869
01:00:54.129 --> 01:00:58.889
has behaved badly, um, for for various reasons, both

870
01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:02.209
personal moral reasons and business reasons. But that's not

871
01:01:02.209 --> 01:01:05.149
what's going on in the, in the cases, uh,

872
01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:09.590
now. Uh, WHAT'S going on now is just that,

873
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.100
um, businesses are, are afraid of the Trump administration.

874
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.919
They're afraid of bad publicity and so on, and

875
01:01:16.919 --> 01:01:20.899
they sacrifice, uh, people who in the most part,

876
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.679
for the most part, haven't so much celebrated, but

877
01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:26.060
have just said, you know, he was a bad

878
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.040
person, Charlie Kirk, his views were iniquitous and, and

879
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:38.229
so on. Um. So again, it depends on whether,

880
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:42.209
whether you're just criticizing the person and criticizing the

881
01:01:42.209 --> 01:01:45.770
person's views or saying how wonderful it is that

882
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:50.560
he was killed. Those are completely different activities. Mhm.

883
01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:55.300
Right, and I mean, generally speaking, because now we're

884
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.620
getting also into the topic of free speech and

885
01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.820
what should be protected speech. I mean, generally speaking,

886
01:02:03.379 --> 01:02:07.080
do you think that there are any instances where

887
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:13.479
people should be fired because of them expressing particular

888
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.149
political opinions? I mean, I'm going to give you

889
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:21.310
an example. A few months ago, Media Sun, the

890
01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:25.870
left-wing journalist and political commentator from the US, had

891
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:30.050
a debate on a YouTube channel called Jubilee Against

892
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:34.510
20 right-wing conservatives. I mean, some of them were

893
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:39.004
even farther right than just a common right-wing. Conservative

894
01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:42.225
because one of them expressed openly that he was

895
01:02:42.445 --> 01:02:46.445
a fascist and they didn't care about the American,

896
01:02:46.784 --> 01:02:52.764
the US Constitution and the person who expressed openly

897
01:02:52.764 --> 01:02:56.324
admitted openly that he was a fascist after the

898
01:02:56.324 --> 01:03:00.939
debate ended up getting fired. Uh, I, I mean,

899
01:03:01.479 --> 01:03:04.979
do you think that there should be limits to

900
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.620
the sort of political opinions people can express publicly

901
01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:14.959
and then, uh, getting punished in that way of

902
01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:19.879
getting fired because I mean, I, I, I fall

903
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.639
more on the left wing of the political spectrum

904
01:03:22.639 --> 01:03:26.040
and I don't like fascists at all, but I

905
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.479
don't agree that that person should have been fired.

906
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:38.239
Yeah, I agree with you, um. I can, again,

907
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.879
I can imagine special circumstances. So suppose this is

908
01:03:42.879 --> 01:03:48.340
someone who's part of a very small business and

909
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.840
I'm I'm a, I'm somebody who works for this

910
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.270
business, and I've always thought that this person was,

911
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.969
you know, a decent person. And then I learn

912
01:04:01.189 --> 01:04:05.149
this person says he's a fascist or she, whatever,

913
01:04:05.229 --> 01:04:08.510
he's a fascist and, you know, has all these

914
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:12.040
views that I think are really abhorrent. I might

915
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.000
not want to work with this person. I might

916
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.760
want some distance from this person, and if everybody

917
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.239
else in the business is, is the same, then

918
01:04:20.239 --> 01:04:22.479
we might together decide we just don't want to

919
01:04:22.479 --> 01:04:26.699
be around this guy anymore. I can imagine that.

920
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:33.110
Uh, BEING justifiable, and, but by and large, I

921
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:38.709
agree with you. Um, SOMEBODY holds abhorrent views, particularly

922
01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.850
in a big business where this person is just

923
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:46.020
doing some job and Uh, his views are not

924
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.489
going to affect his effectiveness in the business or

925
01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:51.340
his relations with others in the business. So it's

926
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.379
sort of pure publicity purposes to get rid of

927
01:04:54.379 --> 01:04:58.219
this person because of his views, um, then I

928
01:04:58.219 --> 01:04:58.879
think that's wrong.

929
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.239
Yeah, I mean, I, I think exactly the same.

930
01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.719
I mean, I think that if a person's views

931
01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:10.120
does not, does not er affect directly their performance,

932
01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.120
the work they're doing, I mean, I don't think

933
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.320
it's justifiable. Let me give you another example, and

934
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.919
this is not a, a case of people having

935
01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:21.239
a particular kind of political view, but I think

936
01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:25.510
it, it was also uh Funny in a way.

937
01:05:25.639 --> 01:05:30.000
So, uh, there's a far right party here in

938
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.919
Portugal called SHG, and just, uh, over a week

939
01:05:34.919 --> 01:05:39.439
ago we had our municipal elections here and people

940
01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:42.750
found out that one of the candidates they put,

941
01:05:42.919 --> 01:05:47.870
they put forth, uh, in a particular. The municipality

942
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:51.949
was, was a woman who had an only fans

943
01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:56.949
account, so she was a creator, an only fans

944
01:05:56.949 --> 01:05:58.729
account. I mean it is basically

945
01:05:59.209 --> 01:05:59.419
I don't know site.

946
01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:03.209
OK, I'm going to explain it's a website where

947
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:08.110
women and men wherever can create adult content. So,

948
01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:11.510
that, that, that's it. They can create pornography, and

949
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.669
things like that, and they can sell it there

950
01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:16.709
or people can subscribe to their accounts to things

951
01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:21.229
like that, and there, there were people who were

952
01:06:21.229 --> 01:06:26.469
insinuating that because she had uh that account and

953
01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:30.629
she had that kind of activity that we should

954
01:06:30.629 --> 01:06:36.689
question. Uh, HER, uh, competence to be part or,

955
01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:39.290
or, or to or to be part of a

956
01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:43.340
municipality to be a politician, and, and I, and

957
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.219
I said, look, why she has that kind of

958
01:06:47.219 --> 01:06:51.100
activity, but what kind of direct implications does that

959
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:55.459
have for her work as a politician as long

960
01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:58.419
as she's competent, as long as she knows what

961
01:06:58.419 --> 01:07:03.250
she's doing. Why should we think she's less intelligent

962
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.290
or less competent or less capable than, for example,

963
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:11.070
a woman who's not a sex worker, you know,

964
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:13.889
so I mean, those are my thoughts. This is

965
01:07:13.889 --> 01:07:15.729
the way I think. I don't know if you

966
01:07:15.729 --> 01:07:16.449
agree or not.

967
01:07:17.989 --> 01:07:20.229
Well, I mean, I, I, I, I don't think

968
01:07:20.229 --> 01:07:23.820
I entirely agree. I see your view. The one

969
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:30.739
thing I would say is that if One should

970
01:07:31.199 --> 01:07:38.409
prefer to elect for to to responsible governmental positions,

971
01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:43.439
people who have good judgment. And in particular, if

972
01:07:43.439 --> 01:07:45.760
you're running for one of, if you're, if you

973
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.639
become a candidate for one of these things, and

974
01:07:48.639 --> 01:07:53.879
you maintain your own sort of pornography website or

975
01:07:53.879 --> 01:07:59.270
whatever it is, that's clearly not good judgment. And

976
01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:06.340
so that's evidence that this person, um, lacks a

977
01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:11.870
certain kind of competence. Uh, SO I do, I

978
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:14.149
do think it's relevant. If I found this out

979
01:08:14.149 --> 01:08:17.209
about a person, I mean, if the person otherwise

980
01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:22.180
had really good, strong, decent views about everything, I,

981
01:08:22.259 --> 01:08:25.790
you know, I agreed enthusiastically with everything she said

982
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.310
about local government, about international affairs, about politics, about

983
01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:31.770
morality, and so on. But there was this one.

984
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:36.520
Um, uh, INSTANCE of what I would consider a

985
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.180
poor judgment and questionable behavior, I would still go

986
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.299
ahead and vote for her. Um, BUT I do

987
01:08:44.299 --> 01:08:46.990
think it's a sort of mark against a candidate

988
01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:50.979
that the candidate would, um, behave in this way

989
01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:57.509
and in particular, While Being a candidate for political

990
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:57.930
office.

991
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.899
OK, so, uh, just to understand your position a

992
01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:06.180
little bit better, uh, in that particular case, do

993
01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.939
you think it's poor judgment to be a sex

994
01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:14.899
worker? Why specifically? Because you think that's a sort

995
01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:19.620
of, um, immoral activity or is it for another

996
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.060
reason?

997
01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:26.288
Uh, I honestly don't know what I think about

998
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:29.658
sex workers. I, as I understood what you were

999
01:09:29.658 --> 01:09:33.788
saying initially, I didn't understand this, that this woman

1000
01:09:33.788 --> 01:09:37.229
was a sex worker. I thought she and a

1001
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:43.279
man had some kind of Website where they sold

1002
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:47.330
or distributed videos of them having sex or something.

1003
01:09:47.419 --> 01:09:47.540
Uh uh

1004
01:09:47.629 --> 01:09:51.220
uh NO, I mean, it's an individual thing, it's

1005
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.459
individual women who can create accounts on that website

1006
01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:59.220
and then sell their, their, I mean, explicit content,

1007
01:09:59.339 --> 01:10:01.200
whatever it might be, so,

1008
01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:04.529
OK, well, that's not, well, is that. I don't,

1009
01:10:04.609 --> 01:10:06.169
I, I don't, I don't really know what the

1010
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.410
definition of a sex worker is, so she could

1011
01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.720
have all this explicit content without actually having sex

1012
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.549
with anybody. So she wouldn't, she wouldn't physically, well,

1013
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.959
even so, I do think that's, uh, it, it,

1014
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:24.540
it, it, it's, uh. Yeah, I think it's a

1015
01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:31.149
um. An unseemly way to earn money. It's You

1016
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:37.939
know, uh, To, to sell erotic videos of yourself,

1017
01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:41.399
um, I mean, I, I, this is something I

1018
01:10:41.399 --> 01:10:45.319
just don't have a view about, um. And sex

1019
01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:53.830
workers in general, uh. I just don't know. It's

1020
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:55.669
not, it's not something I've thought about. I, uh,

1021
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:56.169
um.

1022
01:10:56.859 --> 01:11:00.089
OK, that that's fair enough, that's fair enough. So

1023
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.410
let me just ask you then one last question

1024
01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:06.410
and since we were just talking about uh free

1025
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:10.700
speech, do you think that if there are instances

1026
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.930
where political violence might be justified, do you think

1027
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:20.890
that calling for political violence should be protected speech?

1028
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.290
Um, I assume that by protected speech, you mean

1029
01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:31.089
that there, that there should be no legal constraints

1030
01:11:31.089 --> 01:11:40.390
on this, and, uh, I'm inclined to think that

1031
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:48.319
there should be some legal constraints on Um, Speech

1032
01:11:49.779 --> 01:11:56.270
advocating political violence. And That's not because I think

1033
01:11:56.810 --> 01:12:01.490
advocacy of political violence is always wrong. It is

1034
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:07.270
that In order to try to constrain advocacy for

1035
01:12:07.529 --> 01:12:11.330
morally unjustified political violence, and as I have said

1036
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:16.009
before, I think most political violence is morally unjustified.

1037
01:12:16.129 --> 01:12:20.410
It, it, it either targets people who are not

1038
01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:24.450
liable to be harmed or it's going to be

1039
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.560
self-defeating if it does target people who are genuine

1040
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.529
wrongdoers. So political violence is very unlikely to be

1041
01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:38.089
justified. So, Um, It's wise and likely to have

1042
01:12:38.089 --> 01:12:42.770
the best consequences for society for there to be

1043
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:48.600
legal constraints on the advocacy of political violence, um,

1044
01:12:49.209 --> 01:12:54.000
though. There are instances in which the advocacy of

1045
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.080
political violence could be morally justified and possibly even

1046
01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.500
morally required. Sometimes we are morally required to break

1047
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.479
the law and to break a justified law.

1048
01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:13.279
Yeah. OK, so, uh, let's perhaps wrap up our

1049
01:13:13.279 --> 01:13:16.080
conversation here. I think we've already went through the

1050
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.839
most relevant aspects that I wanted to explore here.

1051
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.520
So, uh, Jeff, apart from your books, which we've

1052
01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.399
already explored, I mean, at least some of them

1053
01:13:27.399 --> 01:13:31.359
on the show, are there any places on the

1054
01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:33.319
internet where people can find your work?

1055
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:40.830
Um, HMM, yeah, the people could find papers that

1056
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:45.390
I've published on my, uh, University of Oxford web

1057
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.390
page, though it hasn't been updated in about 4

1058
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.109
or 5 years, so a lot of my recent

1059
01:13:51.109 --> 01:13:56.390
publications aren't there. Um, THERE'S also a website called

1060
01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:01.959
academia.edu. And you just type that in academia.edu and

1061
01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:03.930
then you put in my name and a lot

1062
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:07.370
of my uh articles and so on are posted

1063
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:08.520
there. Mhm.

1064
01:14:09.129 --> 01:14:12.049
Great. So, thank you so much for taking the

1065
01:14:12.049 --> 01:14:14.270
time to come on the show again. It's always

1066
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:16.229
a great pleasure to talk with you.

1067
01:14:16.649 --> 01:14:19.569
Well, thanks, Ricardo. Again, as I've said before, your,

1068
01:14:19.649 --> 01:14:23.060
your show is just magnificent. Uh, YOU, you. You

1069
01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.339
must be the most learned, uh, person in the

1070
01:14:26.339 --> 01:14:28.859
world because you have to, you have to read

1071
01:14:28.859 --> 01:14:30.779
books by all the people you interview and so

1072
01:14:30.779 --> 01:14:32.939
on. I mean, you must know infinitely more than

1073
01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:34.859
I do. It's a remarkable show.

1074
01:14:36.029 --> 01:14:39.720
