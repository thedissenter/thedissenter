00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.679
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.159
joined by Doctors Robin Gregory and Brooke Moore. Uh

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.949
Doctor Gregory is adjunct professor at the Institute for

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.629
Resources environment and sustainability at the University of British

6
00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.909
Columbia. And Dr Moore is a district principal in

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Delta Schools and also an adjunct professor at the

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.715
University of British Columbia. And today we we're talking

9
00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:31.495
about their book, sorting it out, supporting teenage decision

10
00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:35.095
making. So, Doctor Gregory, Doctor Moore, welcome to the

11
00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:36.174
show. It's a pleasure to have

12
00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:39.284
everyone. It's great to be here today. And um

13
00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.284
I'm coming in zooming in from the lands of

14
00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:46.360
the Chin and the Muslim on the west coast

15
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.099
of what is now known as Canada. And over

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.599
to you, Robin, where are you coming in from?

17
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.270
I'm coming in from near uh what's now the

18
00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:57.290
town of seashell? But the seashell nation and the

19
00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.470
Kalish peoples who've lived here for uh thousands and

20
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.019
thousands of years and have kept this environment very

21
00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.870
beautiful. So,

22
00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:09.230
yeah, and it's just important for us to, to

23
00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.980
do that because most of our province is um

24
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:17.290
on unseeded territory actually, and so just wanna raise

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.540
our hands and offer respect.

26
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.580
So tell us first, what is the premise of

27
00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:26.510
your book? And what rules did you have in

28
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.550
mind when writing it?

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.500
Oh, you go, you go, you go Brooke.

30
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.050
The premise of our book is um basically a

31
00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:41.250
model, a six phase model for decision making. And

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.139
it's um based in science and it's really aimed

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.849
at the everyday user. Um Primarily the book is

34
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.089
written for adults who live or work with youth.

35
00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.050
Anybody between 10 and 25 I'd say broadly speaking,

36
00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.849
um to help them make good decisions, thoughtful intentional

37
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.699
decisions in their lives.

38
00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.540
Since you're talking here in the book specifically about

39
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.860
teenagers, what would you say are perhaps the aspects

40
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.820
of decision making that are the most important to

41
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.979
understand and target in teenagers specifically?

42
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.350
So I think we picked teenagers well, partly because

43
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.160
of the work that Brooke and I have done

44
00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:25.559
with many fantastic teachers in schools which focuses on,

45
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.610
on kids uh sort of between 12 and 18

46
00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.199
and then also in the university. But um you

47
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.399
know, that's an age where you move from having

48
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.820
other people make decisions for you to where you

49
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.600
have to make decisions yourself. And there's basically nothing

50
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.130
much taught in schools about uh what does that

51
00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.169
mean to make a good decision? We learn about

52
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.410
math, we learn about social sciences, we learn about,

53
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.800
but we don't learn about decision making and yet

54
00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.449
I can't think of anything more important for, um,

55
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.690
for anyone to know teenagers, adults, um, than how

56
00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.369
to make good choices and what that, what that

57
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.539
means. So, I think by focusing on teenagers, they,

58
00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.210
they're at that point where there's still many teenagers

59
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.350
eager to learn their minds are open, their minds

60
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.210
are developing but they're making these choices, little choices

61
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.320
and big choices that will really shape their lives.

62
00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.119
And I think the best way to shape your

63
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.110
life is through, uh making good choices. So I

64
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:30.740
think we wanted to focus on that age and

65
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.130
write a book really for the adults who live

66
00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.910
or work with teens, as Brooke said, because many

67
00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.830
adults don't, they, they tell their kids well, make

68
00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.309
a good choice, make good choices, make good decisions.

69
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.550
They have no idea what that means. They don't

70
00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:48.589
really know. I essentially a good decision would be

71
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.809
what they want. And Brooke and I both really

72
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.229
feel strongly that a good decision should be what

73
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.520
the compatible with the teenagers values. Who is this

74
00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.309
person, they're finding out who they are. Um, IT

75
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.869
should be their values, their personality, their agency, which

76
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.929
really shapes it, their decisions, not some rules that

77
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.910
are developed from, from outside. And basically what kids

78
00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.108
get are, are rules for good behavior and we

79
00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:22.989
want a process for good decisions. It's quite different.

80
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.790
So a long winded answer.

81
00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:30.309
So in the book, you go through six different

82
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.970
decision maker moves, we're going to talk about them.

83
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.540
But uh just to introduce them and also to

84
00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:42.059
ask you how you got at these six decision

85
00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:46.065
maker moves specifically. So they are from the decision

86
00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:50.855
clarify the matters, generate options, explore consequences, wait Roff

87
00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:55.095
prioritize and choose. And the final ones take curious

88
00:04:55.184 --> 00:05:01.625
and learn. So why these six decision maker remove

89
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:02.505
specifically

90
00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:04.779
rock? You take this?

91
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.250
OK. Um Those six decision maker moves are based

92
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.489
in the decision sciences which um and it comes

93
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.570
from a model uh developed by Ralph Keeney and,

94
00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:19.230
and some others um called the Proact model. But

95
00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:23.890
we wanted something that was more um plain language,

96
00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.209
some words that would be really easily understood by,

97
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.040
by youth and by um people who aren't in

98
00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:34.109
the decision making sciences. Um And we developed them

99
00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:37.890
with um some colleagues of Robins uh Lee failing

100
00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.890
and Graham Long and um some teachers that I

101
00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.630
work with in Delta. And so through that collaboration

102
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.230
um and a lot of back and forth, we,

103
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:51.929
we landed on those sex moves. Um Did you

104
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.109
want us to describe what those sex moves are?

105
00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:56.609
Uh Yes, we're going to go through each of

106
00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.579
them. But what are the main goals with this

107
00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.570
decision maker moves? I mean, what effects do you

108
00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:07.880
expect them to have on teenager psychology?

109
00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.950
So, so the Behavioral sciences or Decision sciences, which

110
00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.529
kind of grew out of um uh part that

111
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.609
we're looking at a group out of Harvard and

112
00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.589
MIT. So Harvard, Ra Ralph Keeney, bunch of people.

113
00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:25.350
Um, AND we're very much following their, their lead

114
00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:29.660
that was really oriented towards either university students or

115
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.670
businesses. So it's not very friendly when it comes

116
00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:36.269
to your, you know, your parents or teachers or

117
00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.059
your, your more or, you know, ordinary citizen, uh,

118
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.269
who tends to be just as smart but hasn't

119
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.440
had the, the same training. Um, SO I, I

120
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.279
think, um, there's just, there's a couple of very

121
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.359
fundamental thing. One is that most people, when they

122
00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.290
make decisions, they focus on how the decision turned

123
00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:58.760
out. It was a good decision because I carried

124
00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:00.959
an umbrella and it rained. It was a bad

125
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.019
decision if I carried an umbrella and it didn't

126
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.720
rain and that has to do with outcomes, uh

127
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.260
that we can't control, you know, I can't control

128
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.480
whether it rains or not. So I might make

129
00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:15.329
a really good decision but it, it doesn't fit

130
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.019
with the outcome. So I think what Brooklyn I

131
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.459
wanted to do and again, this follows, um, a

132
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.149
lot of work and the values focus of behavioral

133
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.709
decision making. Um Let's start with what the problem

134
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.600
is and what, what matters in this context, what's

135
00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:34.980
important, what are the values rather than getting it

136
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:38.720
backwards and starting with the alternatives. Um, YOU know,

137
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.529
all of us have sat around a table and,

138
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.670
and somebody says, well, should we do A or

139
00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:45.640
B and it's like I don't know why, why

140
00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:47.829
would we do either one? What matters to us,

141
00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:50.500
what's important. So, we've got, we've got the cart

142
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.540
before the horse, we've got the whole thing backwards.

143
00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:55.570
And I think that was maybe the strongest message

144
00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.769
of what we're doing is you've got to start

145
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:03.450
by focusing on the right decision and really paying

146
00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:05.859
attention to your values, which is talk about it

147
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:07.519
later, I guess. But it's a lot harder than

148
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.200
it might seem.

149
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.200
And, and what do you think is the role

150
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:15.049
that adults can play here when I mean, people

151
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:18.299
are still teenagers when it comes to supporting them

152
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:21.489
and guiding them in their decisions with these decision

153
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.799
maker moves in mind.

154
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.239
One of the things that adults tend to do

155
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.739
if they don't have the decision maker moves in

156
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.250
mind is they will say we'll go with your

157
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.140
gut or um they'll offer advice as to what

158
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.409
they would do or they'll say, well, think about

159
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.419
it, you know, really think about it, think about

160
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.340
what you wanna do. Um And what the decision

161
00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:47.179
maker moves do is offer uh more uh mentorship,

162
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.190
kind of mindset and role so that the adult

163
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.979
in the youth life can ask questions and not

164
00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:56.979
lead them to a particular answer. But um help

165
00:08:56.989 --> 00:09:00.700
them develop those thinking skills. And that practice of

166
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:06.099
thinking deliberatively um from a values based beginning. And

167
00:09:06.109 --> 00:09:08.640
the thing that I really enjoy about it is

168
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.799
that, um you know, and I have a 10

169
00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:14.659
year old, she just turned 10 and a 13

170
00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:17.539
year old and, um, I can do it really

171
00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:19.659
slyly. Like, I don't have to make it a

172
00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:22.270
big event. I can just, yesterday we were literally

173
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.989
walking to, at the store and my daughter had

174
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.659
a couple dollars, she was allowed to buy some

175
00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:28.669
candy with and she was like, I've got to

176
00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:31.005
make the decision. Do I buy the, this candy

177
00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:34.325
or that candy? And I just for kicks, um

178
00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:37.164
use the decision maker moves with her and it

179
00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:40.325
was really enjoyable because I got to see her

180
00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:43.645
thinking and I got to support her thinking. Um

181
00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:45.794
AND I, you know, it was a pretty safe

182
00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:48.804
choice to let her have full ownership over. So

183
00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:51.054
she got to live with the consequences of her

184
00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.804
choice, which is also a really good learning opportunity.

185
00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:56.375
So as a parent and also as a teacher,

186
00:09:56.635 --> 00:09:59.380
um it's a really beautiful role to play when

187
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.830
you can, when you can just be asking questions

188
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.200
and not telling, you know, that there's space for

189
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.469
them to develop who they are and through how

190
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:10.090
they think. Um And that's a just a beautiful

191
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:12.409
space to be because I think the,

192
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.390
the curiosity asking questions um that, that was nice,

193
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.619
Brooke is um I think really key to what

194
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.859
we're doing because if you just, if you're a

195
00:10:21.869 --> 00:10:24.520
teenager and you're faced with a bunch of rules,

196
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.549
do this, do that um There's not much to

197
00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.109
be curious about you kind of grudgingly do something.

198
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.690
Um Whereas if you're in an environment that fosters

199
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.309
curiosity, that's also curiosity about other people. So if

200
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.390
you have a say, a small group of kids

201
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.020
who are 14 or 15, one thing we'd really

202
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.200
like to develop is having kids be curious about

203
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.169
why others might see the world differently than them.

204
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.679
You know, why Brook's child's friend might want different

205
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.059
candies than she wants, you know, like what's going

206
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.380
on. So you get this dialogue between people and

207
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.780
you know, I think um that dialogue, that kind

208
00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:11.729
of curiosity is so much missing among mu you

209
00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:13.270
know, much of the adult world if you look

210
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.460
at the world of politics and what's going on.

211
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.700
So I think if we can just little tiny

212
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:24.369
bit encourage that curiosity, compassion, better listening among teenagers,

213
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.679
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe the world will someday be

214
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.710
a better place. So I think that's, that's there

215
00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:33.309
too and it can start with something as simple

216
00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:36.369
as you know, take your $2 and go buy

217
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.070
candy. Uh YOU know, think about what you want

218
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.780
and realize that you'll deal with the consequences. I

219
00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:43.330
think that's, it's a great lesson.

220
00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:47.690
So I imagine that when it comes to the

221
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.780
bit about really having a good understanding that other

222
00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:56.039
people might think differently might have other values. One

223
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.890
goal here would also be to try to avoid

224
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.500
a naive realism,

225
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:07.609
right? Yes. Yes. And misinformation which goes along with,

226
00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:11.849
uh, right. So, a and in what way should

227
00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:16.169
teenagers be given a voice in their choices? Because

228
00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:19.119
of course, we shouldn't just let them do whatever

229
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.010
they want but to what extent and, uh, I

230
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.539
mean, uh, it, how much should we listen to

231
00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:30.289
them and in what particular circumstances, let's say

232
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.219
that's a, that's a question that goes beyond a,

233
00:12:35.229 --> 00:12:38.539
again. We, we wrote a book about decision making

234
00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:44.929
and part of your question touches on um uh

235
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.419
cultural backgrounds, religious views, all sorts of things on

236
00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:57.219
which we are not experts. Um So I, I'm

237
00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:58.960
got you,

238
00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:02.700
it will be different for every, every parent and

239
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.250
every teacher, the degree of autonomy that they want

240
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.159
to extend in space, they want to extend to

241
00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:08.960
the, to the youth in their lives or in

242
00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:13.059
their work. Um So that question aside, that'll be

243
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.700
a decision for every adult. But that question aside,

244
00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:18.299
once you do have some space where you decide,

245
00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:21.219
defined as, as safe to play or, or, um

246
00:13:21.229 --> 00:13:23.719
that you're going to encourage, this is sort of

247
00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:26.109
like a, like a map to help you through

248
00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:29.940
that space. Um Because even in classrooms, like often

249
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.669
teachers uh when they're having a class, make a

250
00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:35.869
decision, they'll resort to voting right. We'll have a

251
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.969
big vote. And what the decision maker moves do

252
00:13:39.979 --> 00:13:42.640
is create a space for thinking rather than taking

253
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.359
sides. And um and that has in the classrooms

254
00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:48.190
that we've been able to witness. It been a

255
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.880
really beautiful dialogue like Robin mentioned earlier where the

256
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.869
discussion is, OK. Well, if that really matters to

257
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.919
you and this really matters to me, and we

258
00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:58.130
can both agree that they matter to the large

259
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.000
group to some extent. Um How can we navigate

260
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.400
our way through this? And, and it does um

261
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.960
create a space for perspective seeking um rather than

262
00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:12.700
just perspective taking like in a voting situation. So

263
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.669
I think regardless of the space or the length

264
00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:18.059
of um of rope you want to extend to

265
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.929
the youth in your lives, this is a way

266
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.200
to help you do that in a, in a

267
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.309
really thoughtful way

268
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.570
length of rope probably isn't the analogy we want,

269
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:25.880
right?

270
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.369
No, it's not a good one.

271
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.719
Um Brooke mentioned thinking though and, and another basic

272
00:14:32.729 --> 00:14:36.030
thing is, and this goes back to um work

273
00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:38.650
in the nineties and the behavioral sciences and Danny

274
00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:42.219
Kahneman book Thinking Fast and Slow, the best seller

275
00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:46.479
around the world um is that there has been

276
00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:49.830
also an emphasis on thinking and reflection, pause and

277
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.349
reflect, you know, look before you leap. Um Actually

278
00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.729
many, many of the decisions we make are powered

279
00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:59.099
by our emotions or intuition and are made extremely

280
00:14:59.109 --> 00:15:03.099
quickly. So something we try our best throughout the

281
00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:05.619
book to pay attention to is that um there

282
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.919
are these two modes of thinking and one is

283
00:15:07.929 --> 00:15:11.340
very quick, very automatic very fast and the other

284
00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:13.320
one is much more reflective. So for a lot

285
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.609
of the daily decisions you, you go with, you

286
00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:18.989
go with your emotions, you go with your intuitions.

287
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.369
Uh YOU have to um but then for the

288
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.789
more consequential decisions, we want, we want that. OK,

289
00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:28.349
let's think about what the, what's, what's going on,

290
00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:31.390
what are values, et cetera. So it's not um

291
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.409
it's very different from, say much of the critical

292
00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:37.320
thinking literature or other words like that, that are

293
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.669
used in education and that we really do try

294
00:15:40.989 --> 00:15:42.789
to leave a, you know, a big place for

295
00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:46.179
that other, that other mode of thinking, the emotional,

296
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:46.989
the intuitive.

297
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.549
So you mentioned Daniel Kman there and he, of

298
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:54.969
course, did lots of work on biases and heuristics,

299
00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:58.280
for example. And in the book, you also talk

300
00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:02.520
about what you call decision traps. So what are

301
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.469
these? And could you tell us a little bit

302
00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:10.070
about things like anchoring, numbing availability and the sort

303
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.549
of effects they have on our decision making?

304
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.460
I start this one Robin and then maybe you

305
00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:16.940
can finish

306
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.200
it. Let's go for a couple hours here. This

307
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.809
is a great topic.

308
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.330
The decision traps is really what, um attracted me

309
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.099
to this line of, of learning. Um I certainly

310
00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:31.109
didn't know much about them beforehand before meeting with

311
00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:35.119
Robin and working together. Um And it appealed to

312
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.330
me because it's such a human way of moving

313
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.270
through the world that we, um, that fast thinking

314
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.210
brain trips us up all the time and we

315
00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:46.469
use the term decision traps. Um, uh, THERE'S a

316
00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:48.380
lot of other scientific words for it that RNA

317
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.840
is much more familiar with, but the decision traps

318
00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:52.900
because it's just this plain language way of thinking

319
00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:56.219
and our, uh, way of talking about it. But

320
00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:57.859
we see this all the time and what we

321
00:16:57.869 --> 00:16:59.270
do in the book is we list some of

322
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.169
the really common ones. What we do when we

323
00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:04.400
work in, with people with classrooms and with groups

324
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.598
of teachers is, um, I'll often put up a

325
00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:10.339
list of them and, uh, I'll say which one

326
00:17:10.348 --> 00:17:12.098
resonates the most with you, which one is most

327
00:17:12.108 --> 00:17:14.420
familiar in your life. And after a few seconds

328
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.128
and the people looking at the list, they'll start

329
00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:18.828
giggling because all of them are very familiar to

330
00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:21.989
us because, um, it's just how we're wired. And

331
00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:25.019
so, um, we can see them, you know, in

332
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:26.499
our own lives, but we can also see them

333
00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:29.739
in the headlines of media right now where and

334
00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:32.229
in our algorithms of social media where we've got,

335
00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:36.078
um, in our social media feeds, the algorithms push

336
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.380
people that think like us into our feeds. And

337
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.630
so we sort of seek out, um, to confirm

338
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.119
our bias, confirmation bias is one of those traps

339
00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:47.760
and don't, without even knowing it, we become much

340
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.520
more polarized in our, in our views and our

341
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.989
spaces and So the decision maker moves, offers us

342
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.839
a way of slowing down because it's not enough

343
00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.140
to say that somebody we'll just slow down and

344
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.400
think about it more. Um THE without any hand

345
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.920
holding as to what to think about and ways

346
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.170
of making that visible. And so the decision maker

347
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.150
moves, help you navigate through what could otherwise be

348
00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:12.119
um many, many traps waiting for you in that

349
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.069
fast thinking way.

350
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.209
Yeah. So I do a lot of work um

351
00:18:18.219 --> 00:18:23.390
helping governments make various decisions. Um The same stuff

352
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.930
comes up if I'm working with a senior government,

353
00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:30.589
you know, or elected officials. Um In that, yeah,

354
00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:34.430
these biases are just errors in decision making that

355
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:40.130
every human um is prone to uh and knowing

356
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.280
about them helps prevent them. So you mentioned like

357
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.650
anchoring, anchoring is where a first impression or your

358
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.239
sort of starting point, then conditions everything else you

359
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.119
think about something. Um uh So, so you anchor

360
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.670
on that first impression, which means you're closing off

361
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.920
to some later information that you get numbing is

362
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.020
a, is a big one. For, I think that

363
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.689
uh talking about social media in that, I think

364
00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:11.030
it's very easy if we hear news, like hear

365
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.920
news about the war in Ukraine, we hear day

366
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.660
after day after day and on the, you know,

367
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.290
78th day when you read about something, how do

368
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.839
you still contact that place in yourself to feel

369
00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:28.010
compassion for, for those people. Um, AND how do

370
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.670
you, how do you deal with, you know, large

371
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.410
numbers, um, if, uh, if 10,000 people have been

372
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.050
injured in an earthquake, well, it's actually, you know,

373
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.780
turns out to be 20,000, that's 10,000 more people

374
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.689
who are inconvenienced or hurt or in the hospital,

375
00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.689
or that's a huge number of people. So, I

376
00:19:46.699 --> 00:19:49.609
think it's very hard for us to give meaning

377
00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:55.880
to, um, meaning to larger numbers, meaning to ongoing

378
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.530
events and knowing that that's a tendency we have

379
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.900
to become to become none and numb and sort

380
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.829
of shut it off. I think we can work

381
00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:05.939
within ourselves. We can work with other people. We

382
00:20:05.949 --> 00:20:08.619
know to try to, you know, overcome that to

383
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.219
fight against that. Um But if you're not aware

384
00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:14.900
of it, then then just kind of takes you

385
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.280
over. So that's the way it is with a

386
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.310
lot of the more emotional intuitive um aspects of

387
00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.170
our thinking is that being aware of them as

388
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.599
a trap, as something that can lead you from

389
00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:29.310
making good decisions. Um Is it, it's not a

390
00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.729
cure? It's not that the, you know, not that

391
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:35.589
that possible bias or error goes away, but it,

392
00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:38.489
it helps, you know how to kind of keep

393
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.869
your humanity, keep who you are as you go

394
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.910
forward in the world.

395
00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:45.140
I guess we also have to be aware of

396
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.130
the bias blind spot, right? Because uh sometimes we

397
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.849
might have that tendency that because we learned about

398
00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:55.979
the biases, then we think that we are no

399
00:20:55.989 --> 00:21:00.660
longer susceptible to, to them. But that is probably

400
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.209
not the case right

401
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.229
now. There's a great interview with, with uh Dan

402
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.930
Koman who's, you know, certainly one of the world

403
00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:12.270
experts on decision making. He talks and laughs and

404
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.040
laughs about stupid decisions that he still makes, uh,

405
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.660
because of anchoring, because of numbing and so on.

406
00:21:18.829 --> 00:21:22.510
So, yeah, it's, um I think we all, we

407
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.140
all make, make those errors. Um WHICH is part

408
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.099
of again, why? It's, it's good to have we

409
00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:32.189
talk a lot about working with others if I'm

410
00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:34.439
making a decision with Brooke and I'm starting to,

411
00:21:34.449 --> 00:21:37.089
to anchor on something or, you know, be prone

412
00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:38.780
to numbing Brooke can remind me and say, hey,

413
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.849
Robin, you know, here's look at what's going on.

414
00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:46.869
So having that, that collaboration um is, is often

415
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.719
really helpful

416
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:51.109
that's really powerful with kids too. And when we

417
00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:53.630
say, well, who else is, who else's opinion? Might

418
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.089
you want to seek out on this or who's

419
00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:58.459
thinking isn't in the room right now? Um And

420
00:21:58.469 --> 00:22:02.910
that's important for adults as well. Um But also

421
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.979
when we're thinking about the health of our communities

422
00:22:04.989 --> 00:22:08.290
and we're making decisions as youth or as adults

423
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.569
to think about whose voice isn't at the table,

424
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.270
is, is a really key question. Um And the

425
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.630
diversity of perspectives is actually a pretty powerful place

426
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.479
to, to move to you know, move from when

427
00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:22.130
you're making that decision. And so having those questions

428
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.489
really readily available to you and, and the more

429
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.229
you practice, the decision maker moves, the more they

430
00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:28.709
are there um for you to draw from is

431
00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:30.849
a, is a pretty powerful way to move and

432
00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:32.989
avoid some of those traps um but move through

433
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.469
them as well,

434
00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:37.890
right? So let's go through each of the decision

435
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.560
maker moves, then the first one is framing the

436
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:45.750
decision. Could you perhaps give us uh an example

437
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.040
to illustrate it? And when it comes to framing

438
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.079
decisions, which kinds of questions should be asked?

439
00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:56.849
My favorite. It's a very simple example, but it

440
00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:58.880
seems to do the trick in sharing about the

441
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.920
importance of framing a decision is about um this

442
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.750
example, if I say, should I cut my hair

443
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.150
or not, you know, and people say, well, yes

444
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.739
or no. And then we, I say, well, how

445
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.030
many options are there? Like is that a very

446
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.829
small scope or, or a large scope? And people

447
00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.380
say, well, it's a pretty small like you, there's

448
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.819
really only two options, you cut it or you

449
00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:21.910
don't? And then I just ask them to hold

450
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.219
their hands there and say, OK, I'll give you

451
00:23:23.229 --> 00:23:25.699
another decision frame another way of framing that decision.

452
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.099
Um How should I style my hair and suddenly

453
00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:30.479
and you know, when everybody moves, oh, it's a

454
00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.640
bigger scope. And so what happens is you increase

455
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.819
the scope of your decision frame is that you

456
00:23:35.829 --> 00:23:39.540
increase the possibilities available to you. And sometimes that's

457
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.819
a great idea and sometimes it isn't. But the,

458
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.579
the cool thing about working with kids is having

459
00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.819
them realize that whoever frames the decision holds the

460
00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:51.689
power. And so when, when adults are framing all

461
00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:54.180
of the decisions for kids, they have very little

462
00:23:54.189 --> 00:23:57.000
agency. Um BUT if they have space to frame

463
00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.869
a decision, then that gives themselves some owner more

464
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.540
agency over their decision and as a result, more

465
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.310
um ownership over the consequences, which is a really

466
00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:08.619
good thing for kids to learn early on. So

467
00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:11.739
um the importance of choosing that scope really intentionally

468
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.890
is, is the first move because everything else will

469
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.469
come from that.

470
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.459
We, we use the analogy in the book of

471
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:22.989
um um using a camera. So you can either

472
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.699
zero in on just a small part of a

473
00:24:24.709 --> 00:24:26.599
picture or you can zoom out and get a

474
00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:30.439
much wider picture. And I think human beings tend

475
00:24:30.449 --> 00:24:34.150
to sort of zero in. But as a result,

476
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.390
you can miss a lot of consequences and particularly

477
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.040
consequences that may not be happening right now. But

478
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.589
what happened later on, I think it's part of

479
00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:45.750
the issue with climate change, for example, is it's,

480
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.859
it's hard to, it's hard to think in the

481
00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:50.010
future because it's not right in front of you.

482
00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:53.119
So enlarge the frame. What's the problem you're looking

483
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.150
at and think about long term consequences. It, it,

484
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.329
it can change, change our, our choices, change our

485
00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:00.670
decisions dramatically.

486
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.800
Oh, you, you just froze Robin. I'm sorry. Uh

487
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.260
I was just waiting to see if you would

488
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.699
come back. Oh, you're back now. Yeah. So, uh

489
00:25:11.709 --> 00:25:17.199
and the second movie is about clarifying what matters.

490
00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:20.000
So what does that mean exactly? What is the

491
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.000
process here?

492
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.520
So, in, in every decision, the, the reason why

493
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.260
we want to make a choice is because something

494
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.030
that we care about will be affected will be

495
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.500
impacted if um you know, I may care a

496
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.229
whole lot about whatever my hair as Brooke was

497
00:25:39.239 --> 00:25:41.400
just saying, but my hair isn't going to come

498
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.599
into every decision because it's not going to be

499
00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:49.510
impacted. Um But uh that process of thinking, what

500
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.530
is it that matters to me in this, in

501
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.089
this particular context? So again, in this context means

502
00:25:56.099 --> 00:26:00.560
you've, you've got that frame. Um It's, it's really

503
00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:02.670
important because the first things that come to mind

504
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.800
may be things about myself, but right behind that

505
00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:08.390
will be, oh, what, what about my family? What

506
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.359
about my friends? What about my neighborhood? So you,

507
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:14.189
you, you think about, OK, what really is at

508
00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:18.010
play here in this decision and, and what matters?

509
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.550
And there's um interestingly there's a lot of behavior

510
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.719
decision research showing that even, you know, professional decision

511
00:26:24.729 --> 00:26:27.199
makers, CEO S and companies, that kind of thing

512
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:33.380
usually um only are aware of about half of

513
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.890
their objectives. So if you, if you ask people

514
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.920
to go, you go around a room with adults

515
00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:40.859
or with teenagers and ask people to write down

516
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:43.339
what matters to you about. You know, where we

517
00:26:43.349 --> 00:26:47.239
go for a, a year end celebration of our

518
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.540
sixth grade class or what we want to care

519
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.939
about, you know, with Toyota in terms of designing

520
00:26:52.949 --> 00:26:56.479
a new car, um those professional decision makers who

521
00:26:56.489 --> 00:27:00.050
only think about maybe half of the things, 40%

522
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.329
of the things that are important. So you go

523
00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.630
around a room and different people think of different

524
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.969
things and it's like, oh yeah, that, that thing

525
00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:08.689
is also important to me. I didn't think about

526
00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:11.810
that. Oh yeah, that uh so the process of

527
00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:15.709
supporting teenage decision making, that's the subtitle of the

528
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:22.329
book um is really encouraging um that teenager to

529
00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:26.650
explore who he or she or they are. You

530
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.189
know, what is it that makes that teenager that

531
00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:32.780
uh that special person and what matters to them?

532
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.089
So it's, it's uh it's not just sort of

533
00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:38.630
looking forward to the decision and consequences, but it's

534
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.540
also very much uh looking internally. Um YOU know,

535
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.390
who am I? And at age 1415 or at

536
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.680
age 70 I think those are questions we should

537
00:27:49.689 --> 00:27:53.300
all be asking ourselves, who am I? So what

538
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.920
matters to me? It's kind of the same thing,

539
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.199
who am I, what matters to me?

540
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.530
And I guess this takes us back to the

541
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.410
fact that this is a values based approach because

542
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.849
uh I mean, to go through all of these

543
00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:09.310
decision maker moves, we have to uh keep in

544
00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:13.449
mind what uh our values are, what the teenagers

545
00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:16.630
values are and their goals, right? I mean, this

546
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.349
is, it, uh it has a very big element

547
00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:22.510
of subjectivity to it.

548
00:28:24.689 --> 00:28:27.010
Well, and, and, and there's a tension there too

549
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.449
which we talk about a little bit in the

550
00:28:28.459 --> 00:28:31.000
book. But you know what if you have a

551
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.550
14 year old uh as, as your child and

552
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.130
their values are quite different from your own uh

553
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.939
as, you know, as the parent or as a

554
00:28:39.949 --> 00:28:43.689
teacher. Um So how, how do you handle that?

555
00:28:43.699 --> 00:28:46.939
How do you work with that dynamic? And, you

556
00:28:46.949 --> 00:28:49.290
know, on what occasions is it OK, on what

557
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.170
occasions is it, is it not? Ok. Um It's

558
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.010
the same thing actually for people who work, say

559
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.089
for a large company and there's goals of the

560
00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:02.050
company and there's their own individual goals and how

561
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.599
do they, how do they adjust those two imbalance

562
00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:07.189
or people in a relationship? You know, the, the

563
00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:09.619
two people in a relationship may not always agree.

564
00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:13.699
So, um it, I think that's, it's that tension

565
00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:16.060
because, you know, I know if we go deeply

566
00:29:16.069 --> 00:29:18.540
enough, Ricardo, you and I would have some, you

567
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.880
know, some differences of opinion on things. But does

568
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.900
that affect our friendship? Does that our ability to

569
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.760
work together. So it's, I think that's, it's a

570
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.599
fascinating thing. It's not something, um, not something to

571
00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:34.369
be avoided, not something to pretend it isn't there.

572
00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:37.140
Uh, BUT we really feel like it's important for

573
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.709
those values to, to come forward and to be

574
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.530
discussed and if you do want to support your

575
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.359
teenage decision maker, um, it's important to help, help

576
00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:48.770
them clarify their values and who they are.

577
00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:54.770
And about the third move, how do we generate

578
00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:57.449
options? How do we go about it?

579
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.790
Well, well, one of the ways with kids is

580
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.449
is brainstorming and um there are a lot of

581
00:30:05.459 --> 00:30:08.109
strategy, like that's a pretty common strategy for teachers

582
00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:12.199
to use and brainstorm. Um But once you get

583
00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:15.290
beyond the obvious sort of choice uh options that

584
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.160
come to mind um to go a little bit

585
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.469
deeper and really probe that is important. So we

586
00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:22.520
offer a lot of different questions that can help

587
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.199
with that and some exercises in the book that

588
00:30:24.209 --> 00:30:27.079
can help with that. Um But perspective seeking is

589
00:30:27.089 --> 00:30:29.800
a really big part of that. So to avoid

590
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.400
those um confirmation by us and other other decision

591
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.770
making traps to say like, well, what would so

592
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.359
and so suggest or, or um whose voice are

593
00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:41.680
we missing here? What can they offer? Because tapping

594
00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:43.810
into that creative brain and this is a really

595
00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:46.859
creative thinking space, um It's so important to go

596
00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:49.900
beyond the obvious because um that is a trap

597
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.430
that our, our system, our fast thinking system will

598
00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:53.270
lead us into

599
00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:56.300
and, and, and once you, once you know your

600
00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.000
objectives, once you know what matters, it totally changes

601
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.239
that search for alternatives because then you're coming up

602
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.260
with, you're trying to come up with alternatives which

603
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.670
help achieve your objectives. If you don't know, there

604
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.719
are those objectives, you kind of don't have a

605
00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:13.719
road map. Why would one alternative be better than

606
00:31:13.729 --> 00:31:16.609
another? Who knows? But if you can link them

607
00:31:16.619 --> 00:31:19.060
back to achieving objectives, I think you've got a

608
00:31:19.069 --> 00:31:23.260
much more solid basis for, for, for choosing an

609
00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:23.680
action.

610
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.530
And why is it so important for us to

611
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.770
generate different options? What is the role that that

612
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.689
specific step plays in decision making?

613
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.900
Ha having um one of the common places where

614
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.530
people start a decision making process without the decision

615
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.609
maker moves is that they'll start with the options

616
00:31:44.949 --> 00:31:46.849
and they'll say like, you know, where are we

617
00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:48.719
going to go on vacation or what are we

618
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.189
who, you know, all sorts of things that come

619
00:31:51.199 --> 00:31:53.650
up? And we sort of often lock ourselves into

620
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.829
a binary or into a limited set of options.

621
00:31:56.109 --> 00:32:00.319
And so um having a more expansive approach beginning

622
00:32:00.329 --> 00:32:02.569
first with a, a frame and then thinking about

623
00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:05.089
what matters, make sure that our options are grounded

624
00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:06.829
in those two places. And that's a much more

625
00:32:06.839 --> 00:32:09.949
helpful starting place because um it gives us a

626
00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:14.000
much um more grounded beginning place. But also a

627
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.790
more meaningful one. So maybe the options that come

628
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.640
to mind before we've used, the decision maker moves

629
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.790
aren't even relevant in the end once we've gone

630
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.670
through it and having that uh lens of what

631
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.920
really matters in this context before we start imagining

632
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.390
what might be possible, make sure that we're moving

633
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.439
in the, in the right direction for, for this

634
00:32:33.449 --> 00:32:38.579
context. So generating options, um sometimes it goes really

635
00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:41.209
quickly and sometimes it's really tough because we're really

636
00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:44.500
locked into our initial thinking or, or we don't

637
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.670
have enough perspectives in the room. Um But it's

638
00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.270
so important because otherwise we've limited ourselves unnecessarily and

639
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.439
this and this really is the where creativity comes

640
00:32:56.449 --> 00:32:59.770
in big time. So you can, you can really,

641
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.369
um and it's fun, you can see groups, um

642
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.969
you know, groups of kids, groups of adults when

643
00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:08.890
they actually start thinking outside the box or when

644
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.640
they enlarge the size of the box gets so

645
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.280
excited and start sort of jumping up and down

646
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.979
and smiling and it's like, oh yeah, there's something

647
00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:19.579
we hadn't thought of before that would be a

648
00:33:19.589 --> 00:33:22.599
great thing to do. So let's do it. So

649
00:33:22.609 --> 00:33:24.699
it's, it's, it's, it's like sort of a payback

650
00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:25.680
part. It's very exciting

651
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.290
and about the move of exploring consequences. I mean,

652
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.459
what kinds of consequences should teenagers consider here? Because

653
00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:40.449
I, I mean, even for adults, many times, it

654
00:33:40.459 --> 00:33:43.979
is very hard for us to really figure out

655
00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:48.439
what are all the likely consequences and the ones

656
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:51.739
that are really hard to predict beforehand.

657
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.170
One of the nice ways about Sorry Robin, you

658
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:59.109
say quick here. But um the nice part about

659
00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:01.550
this for me is that it, it cuts down

660
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.839
on the overwhelmed because in the decision maker moves,

661
00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:06.209
you look at each option and the consequence on

662
00:34:06.219 --> 00:34:09.110
each of the values. And so I don't have

663
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.909
to think about the whole big picture. I can

664
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:14.385
just go very methodically uh how will this option

665
00:34:14.395 --> 00:34:16.905
impact this value and how will it impact another,

666
00:34:16.915 --> 00:34:19.603
the other value and so on. And so that

667
00:34:19.614 --> 00:34:23.594
really helps especially um with adults or kids, but

668
00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:25.004
it just helps to take a step back and,

669
00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:27.695
and think about it really deliberatively in pieces before

670
00:34:27.705 --> 00:34:28.793
we look at the whole

671
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.739
and you're also thinking here of in, in terms

672
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.320
of consequences, there's two other things that always come

673
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.110
up. One is that question of the frame. Am

674
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.219
I looking at consequences over the next day, over

675
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:43.090
the next week, over the next month? Uh And

676
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.208
I think that's a really big one for teenagers

677
00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.050
because some things that for a teenager that may

678
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.780
be very attractive in the moment for the next

679
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.570
couple hours, go to that party, you know, et

680
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.708
cetera, et cetera. Um If they think about the

681
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.360
longer term consequences, maybe, maybe that may maybe something

682
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:03.719
different will happen. So it's partly that side and

683
00:35:03.729 --> 00:35:06.610
the other side is uncertainty in that thinking forward

684
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.959
to consequences involves uncertainty and making predictions. And uh

685
00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:15.939
that's a, you know, that's not something that, that

686
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.620
anyone does hugely. Well. So I think it, it,

687
00:35:20.629 --> 00:35:23.530
it involves that element of uncertainty. Where do you

688
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.620
get your information and what do you do given

689
00:35:26.629 --> 00:35:30.800
that looking forward, um you know, you're making predictions

690
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:31.939
but they may or may not happen.

691
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.100
Uh And I mean, of course, as you mentioned,

692
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.409
there, there are different kinds of consequences. Some of

693
00:35:39.419 --> 00:35:43.219
them are perhaps more short term, others long term.

694
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:48.399
And maybe, I mean, in certain specific cases situations

695
00:35:48.409 --> 00:35:52.110
where maybe be we might be thinking about short

696
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:56.070
term consequences. If they are just short term, short

697
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.320
term and not a big deal, maybe we can

698
00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:03.860
just not uh give too much thought to uh

699
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.649
at least those ones, right?

700
00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:09.810
Yeah, I mean, obviously there's, there's certain consequences. I

701
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.379
mean, if you think about waiting or, or paying

702
00:36:12.389 --> 00:36:16.219
attention to consequences, some consequences are really minor. And

703
00:36:16.229 --> 00:36:18.010
so you don't have to put much attention on

704
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.919
that, but other consequences may have much, much more

705
00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:24.290
long lasting or maybe they affect other people, you

706
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.209
know, it's not just what affects me, but how

707
00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:31.840
can my decisions affect others? Um So yeah, that's,

708
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:37.199
that's part of where the individual um develops that

709
00:36:37.209 --> 00:36:40.780
subjective judgment about what is it that they're gonna

710
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.320
pay particular attention to and, and, and it may

711
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.979
be that they also want to go out and

712
00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:51.699
get more information, like, you know why, that's what's

713
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.679
an example, buying a used car and I wanna

714
00:36:54.689 --> 00:36:56.120
think about, oh, I don't want a car that's

715
00:36:56.129 --> 00:36:58.159
gonna take a lot of repair work on down

716
00:36:58.169 --> 00:37:00.600
the line. And so I have to compare two

717
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.570
or three or four different models of cars. II,

718
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.770
I need to go out and collect some information.

719
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.750
Where do I go to get that information? What's

720
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.459
a trusted source? Um And it may be that

721
00:37:11.469 --> 00:37:13.820
after hearing, you know, the repair bills from three

722
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.600
or four cars, I think, I don't, I'm not

723
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.250
actually gonna get a car, I'm just gonna stick

724
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.260
with the bus. Um But is that it's like,

725
00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:22.800
so there's a lot involved in that, in that

726
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.820
uh consequence step.

727
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.649
And part of, part of the neat thing about

728
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:28.760
seeing that in a classroom too is that it

729
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.389
becomes a research project, which is much more meaningful

730
00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:34.530
than like a book report because kids are posing

731
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.600
their own questions and then they have to seek

732
00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:41.719
that information and highlighting that uncertainty and then navigating

733
00:37:41.729 --> 00:37:44.439
through it is a pretty powerful practice for kids

734
00:37:44.449 --> 00:37:46.000
to be working on

735
00:37:47.159 --> 00:37:49.360
and they're, and they're following that line of thought

736
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.179
because something matters to them. So that, that's, that's

737
00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:55.820
pretty cool. It's kind of engages kids in a

738
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.179
different way. And like Brooke said right at the

739
00:37:58.189 --> 00:38:00.679
beginning, they don't have to know that they're working

740
00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:03.739
on decision maker. Move number four, I couldn't care

741
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.209
less about that. But, but they're, what they're doing

742
00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:09.770
is they're taking in, like, you know, eating a

743
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.739
food they're taking in this process and into their

744
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.219
body and if they use it on a couple

745
00:38:15.229 --> 00:38:18.169
of school projects, hopefully they'll use it on something

746
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.250
out of school as well.

747
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.060
How about weighing trade offs? I mean, what are

748
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:29.179
the reps, the aspects that are important to consider

749
00:38:29.189 --> 00:38:29.520
here?

750
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.610
I'll take a first shot that, that gets back

751
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.969
to thinking about consequences again in that, you know,

752
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:38.330
the different consequences of different actions. Um You, I

753
00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.429
have to think, well, if I do, if I

754
00:38:42.439 --> 00:38:45.020
do a, it's going to be great in the

755
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.969
short term, lousy in the long term. If I

756
00:38:46.979 --> 00:38:49.739
do b it's just the reverse. So then I

757
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.689
have to, I can't, I can't have the best

758
00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:53.729
of both. So what do I, what do I

759
00:38:53.739 --> 00:38:55.659
want to do? Maybe I can construct a new

760
00:38:55.669 --> 00:39:01.379
alternative. But um it's really thinking, uh that there's,

761
00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:04.860
there's nothing that's going to satisfy all of my

762
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:08.310
values, all of my objectives. Absolutely perfectly. So I

763
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.850
have to make a choice what's most important and

764
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.439
you know, what's, what do I have the most

765
00:39:14.489 --> 00:39:18.090
opportunity to actually follow up perhaps where, where is

766
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.469
the uncertainty the lowest? So, you know, you start,

767
00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:27.659
you start realizing that um there aren't binary choices,

768
00:39:27.669 --> 00:39:29.760
but even if you have like five or six

769
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.260
or seven different options, they all probably have some

770
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.909
sort of golden side, some really neat part, but

771
00:39:36.919 --> 00:39:38.929
then they have some downsides. So how do you,

772
00:39:38.939 --> 00:39:40.209
how do you live with that? How do you

773
00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:42.469
adjust to that? And most of the things that

774
00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:45.689
we wanna do, um, because we want to do

775
00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:47.959
them also have a downside. You wanna be on

776
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.310
a sports team because you love soccer. But that

777
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.379
means you have to exercise and work, you know,

778
00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:56.979
you wanna whatever, be a chef at a restaurant,

779
00:39:56.989 --> 00:39:58.550
but that means you're not gonna get much sleep

780
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.439
for your first couple of years. So it's that

781
00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:02.500
kind of thing. And how do you, how do

782
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.850
you make those trade offs and fe and feel

783
00:40:06.899 --> 00:40:08.979
ok with them, you know why you're doing it

784
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.379
because you want whatever that benefit is.

785
00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:14.409
And I would imagine that at a certain point

786
00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:18.120
because we have different values and maybe perhaps in

787
00:40:18.129 --> 00:40:24.250
different situations, we would prioritize different sets of values

788
00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.729
over others at a certain point, we just have

789
00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:32.600
to go and make a decision because otherwise we

790
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:38.139
could be here and infinite and considering possible consequences

791
00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:42.739
and trying to trade off between different values and

792
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.300
objectives. Uh Right. I mean, there, there it comes,

793
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.659
there comes a point where we just have to

794
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.780
go ahead with the decision, right?

795
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.959
You sound like a national government. There's, that's a

796
00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:57.959
real problem with a lot of big national government

797
00:40:57.969 --> 00:41:00.709
decisions is that they try so hard to get

798
00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:03.560
everybody's views that you know, six or seven or

799
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.750
eight years later, they're still working on the decision.

800
00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:10.149
Sorry, Brooke, I think, think I cut you off

801
00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:10.379
there.

802
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.580
No, you didn't. You didn't. I was just thinking

803
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.889
of a story about a grade 67 class, Joanne

804
00:41:14.899 --> 00:41:17.250
Calder's classroom. A teacher we work with quite often

805
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.879
here and, um, her students were trying to decide

806
00:41:20.959 --> 00:41:22.879
how they should organize the chairs in the room

807
00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:26.169
where the desk should all be. And if you're

808
00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:29.209
12, that seriously matters to you, like, you have

809
00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:30.929
a lot invested in where you're gonna be sitting

810
00:41:30.939 --> 00:41:33.860
for a few weeks in your classroom. So they

811
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.429
had come down to a couple of options and

812
00:41:36.439 --> 00:41:38.889
the class was super happy, kind of with either

813
00:41:38.899 --> 00:41:41.760
one, they would accept either one. NOBODY was opposing

814
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:45.229
it except for these two boys who did vociferously

815
00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:50.110
oppose both options and in a fit of frustration

816
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.110
after, you know, trying to come to cons to

817
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.629
consensus for so long, one of the kids said

818
00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:57.080
to the, to the boys, like, what is it

819
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.379
gonna take to get you to agree to one

820
00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:03.600
of these options? And the boys offered a tweak

821
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.909
on one of the options and that ended up

822
00:42:07.199 --> 00:42:09.550
satisfying the whole class and they all moved on

823
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.060
quite happily, um with full understanding about why they

824
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.719
were all sitting where they were sitting and they

825
00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:17.909
had ownership in that um piece of building their

826
00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:21.409
classroom community. And so it's a very simple example,

827
00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:23.929
but when you're 12, those stakes are really high

828
00:42:24.229 --> 00:42:27.889
and they were able to move through a dialogic

829
00:42:27.899 --> 00:42:31.060
process that in the end the tradeoffs were ones

830
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.129
that they could all deal with. Um, AND they

831
00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:35.090
could be in community with one another. And so

832
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.909
that's, that's a pretty big piece of it is

833
00:42:37.919 --> 00:42:40.330
knowing what tradeoffs are you willing to make and,

834
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.500
and which are like a nonstarter. And then if

835
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.530
you have some that are, you know, you can

836
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.989
accept both options, then it's, um, you go into

837
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.669
that with a sense of clarity that otherwise you

838
00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:51.290
might miss

839
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.459
whenever you say the word dialogic, I think, boy,

840
00:42:54.469 --> 00:42:55.840
this person is really smart.

841
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.330
I think that about you all the time,

842
00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:04.090
Brooke was just talking about ownership and, you know,

843
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.669
that's, I think we use the word agency but

844
00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:11.719
agency ownership, like how many teenagers have owners feel

845
00:43:11.729 --> 00:43:14.949
they have ownership over their lives? I think, you

846
00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:17.330
know, a lot, a smaller percentage than I would

847
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.070
than I would like to see. But can I

848
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.570
back up just for a moment because a couple,

849
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.300
a couple of things that have one is that

850
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.370
when we talk about tradeoffs, tradeoffs is, is kind

851
00:43:27.379 --> 00:43:30.300
of a nasty word, right? It's like, oh, I

852
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.419
have to face tradeoffs and you sort of get

853
00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:37.419
that depressed feeling. Um, BUT that actually is true

854
00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:39.820
of decision making generally. Like we have to make

855
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.750
a decision. It's like, you know, there's sort of

856
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.989
a tension involved with that. And I think one

857
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.879
of the messages that Brooke and I are really

858
00:43:47.889 --> 00:43:50.419
trying to emphasize through the whole book is that

859
00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:55.000
actually your decisions are opportunities, decisions are, are opportunities

860
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.419
to express who you are to change your little

861
00:43:58.429 --> 00:44:01.860
bit of the world. Um And, and so there's

862
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:07.449
sort of, there's an excitement about decision making that

863
00:44:07.459 --> 00:44:10.429
um that only comes if you see it as

864
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:13.229
opportunities rather than as solving a problem. And then

865
00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:15.320
there's another problem and they aren't problems, they are

866
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.610
opportunities. Um And I think that also comes very

867
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.889
strongly out of the negotiations literature. There's a lot

868
00:44:22.899 --> 00:44:25.909
of what we do that was codeveloped with people

869
00:44:25.919 --> 00:44:29.439
who do um negotiations work books, like getting DS

870
00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:33.330
uh in terms of getting people to work together

871
00:44:33.689 --> 00:44:37.229
to make decisions and to face, to face tradeoffs

872
00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:40.790
and to realize that by doing that um new,

873
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.649
new opportunities will open up. So it's an exciting

874
00:44:45.659 --> 00:44:48.540
thing. It's not a, it's not a dismal science.

875
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.810
It's an exciting thing. Economics can be the dismal

876
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.219
science. But I think decision decision making is an

877
00:44:54.229 --> 00:44:55.770
exciting science.

878
00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:59.229
A and I guess that with that idea in

879
00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:02.219
mind that it is an exciting thing to do,

880
00:45:02.229 --> 00:45:06.060
we get into the last decision maker move that

881
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.489
is about staying curious and adjusting. So what is

882
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.090
this really about? What does it mean to stay

883
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.540
curious and adjusting if necessary?

884
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:23.070
Ok. Um I often talk about this with, with

885
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:28.300
students in terms of, um, not getting too attached

886
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.300
to something or being stuck with the decision just

887
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:33.989
because you made it. And that is, uh, a

888
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.540
decision trap that we fall into quite naturally. Well,

889
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.600
I've already, you know, spent this much money on

890
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.760
the choice I made now I'm stuck with it.

891
00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.750
Um, AND that might be true sometimes but to

892
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.820
recognize when it isn't true and when you are

893
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.100
able to be flexible and adapt is, is really

894
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.820
crucial. I would really love kids leaving our school

895
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.409
system to go out into the world knowing that

896
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.139
sometimes they are going to need to change their

897
00:45:58.149 --> 00:46:02.719
mind. And that changing your mind is a uh

898
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.419
marker of intelligence and a active a activity. And

899
00:46:06.429 --> 00:46:09.669
those are not things to fear. It's when we

900
00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:13.100
become too entrenched in our thinking that that we

901
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.219
can run into trouble um as community and as

902
00:46:16.229 --> 00:46:21.209
individuals. So um circumstances are gonna change. And so

903
00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:23.050
the, the decision that you made might have been

904
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.689
right last year and now it's different and you

905
00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:28.439
need to make moves to adjust to that and

906
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.270
especially when they are leaving school and maybe thinking

907
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.020
about what they're gonna do after they graduate, um

908
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.239
kids are not forced into but sort of pressured

909
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.649
to make all these really big decisions. Like what

910
00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:43.310
post secondary education am I going to engage in

911
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.899
or program or not? And if I, you know,

912
00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:49.929
enroll in this program two years down the road,

913
00:46:49.939 --> 00:46:51.879
I realize I don't want to do that for

914
00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:53.919
the rest of my life. Am I able to

915
00:46:53.929 --> 00:46:57.100
change? And sometimes changing your mind is a privilege.

916
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.540
But to know when it is and when you

917
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.699
can take advantage of that is, is really important.

918
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.780
And I would imagine that is, has a lot

919
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.000
to do with the fact that there's a lot

920
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.020
of always a lot of uncertainty when it comes

921
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.580
to our decision making, right? Even when considering the

922
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:20.790
consequences and win the tradeoffs. I mean, if things

923
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.929
happen and I guess that in this particular point,

924
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:28.010
probably the strikes would be right when they told

925
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.270
us that we should care about what we can

926
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.590
control, but not about what we can't control because

927
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.729
there's a huge amount of stuff out there that

928
00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:40.350
we can't really control and sometimes even, uh what

929
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.389
appears to be a perfect plan just goes off

930
00:47:43.399 --> 00:47:47.429
the rails because of something that we couldn't, uh,

931
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.669
know of.

932
00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:52.360
Right. Yeah. And I, and if you're, I mean,

933
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.360
we all have constraints on us but Brooke and

934
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.780
I happen to live in a, in a place

935
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:01.290
where, where people, you know, most people generally have

936
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.340
a fair amount of freedom, not everybody in the

937
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:08.979
world does that. So, um, if you, uh black

938
00:48:08.989 --> 00:48:12.919
education, if you're poor, uh maybe the cultural environment

939
00:48:12.929 --> 00:48:16.229
in which you live, um, you, you're in terms

940
00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:19.370
of changing your mind doing something different. There, there's

941
00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:23.040
probably more constraints perhaps on you. And so we're,

942
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.389
we're realizing, you know, we, we are aware of

943
00:48:25.399 --> 00:48:28.229
the fact that the adjustments you make might be,

944
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:30.270
you know, might be smaller. You still have choices,

945
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.669
you still have decisions. But it's probably a more

946
00:48:32.679 --> 00:48:36.060
constrained world that you live in than what most

947
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.870
of the teenagers we work with live in.

948
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.060
But of course, it is one thing for things

949
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:47.330
to go unexpectedly wrong. But what about mistakes? How

950
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.020
should majors deal with mistakes?

951
00:48:50.419 --> 00:48:52.850
I was thinking about mistakes. I think that's one

952
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.459
of the roles we haven't specifically used this term,

953
00:48:55.469 --> 00:48:58.209
but the decision mentor, uh which we talk a

954
00:48:58.219 --> 00:49:00.290
lot about in the book, the person, the adult

955
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.129
who is working with the teenagers could be a

956
00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:09.129
parent, grandparent friend, aunt, uncle, uh teacher, cousin, coach.

957
00:49:09.719 --> 00:49:13.469
Um BUT I think that the adult is that

958
00:49:13.479 --> 00:49:15.669
is, I think in a, in a really special

959
00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:19.350
position here with respect to mistakes because um I

960
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.620
think we all learn from our mistakes. Uh BUT

961
00:49:23.629 --> 00:49:26.350
we don't wanna make, you know, horrible mistakes. We

962
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.389
don't wanna make mistakes that are life threatening. We

963
00:49:28.399 --> 00:49:31.909
don't wanna miss make mistakes that will carry the

964
00:49:31.919 --> 00:49:35.010
scars over the rest of our lives. And so

965
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.510
I think that that's a real important role for

966
00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.120
the adult, um you know, making choices about careers,

967
00:49:41.129 --> 00:49:45.030
but also things like, um you know, sports and,

968
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.060
and just kind of keeping, keeping track of what's

969
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.149
a safe zone so that uh a teenager can

970
00:49:51.159 --> 00:49:54.229
learn through their mistakes and realize, oh, I shouldn't

971
00:49:54.239 --> 00:49:56.550
have done that or I, you know, should have

972
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.100
warmed up first or, you know, whatever it is,

973
00:50:00.149 --> 00:50:02.969
but make those mistakes so that they are learning

974
00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:07.530
opportunities that then, um, the teenager can move forward

975
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.090
from those. Um, BUT I, I think seeing mistakes

976
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.050
as, I think it's good to make mistakes because

977
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.459
there are learning opportunities. Uh But we want to

978
00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:20.419
make sure that uh those mistakes happen within an

979
00:50:20.429 --> 00:50:25.219
environment where um you, you retain that flexibility and

980
00:50:25.229 --> 00:50:27.939
you can sort of move forward, having learned something,

981
00:50:27.949 --> 00:50:29.100
having him know something.

982
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.830
Yes, that makes perfect sense. And uh I mean,

983
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.419
ju just before we go, would you like to

984
00:50:38.429 --> 00:50:41.639
perhaps leave us with a final with some final

985
00:50:41.649 --> 00:50:46.300
thoughts, a final message particularly for teenagers that even

986
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:51.250
for us as adults, sometimes uncertainty when making decisions

987
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.375
is very scary and even more so for teenagers

988
00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:59.024
who even know less about the world than we

989
00:50:59.034 --> 00:51:02.554
do when they are very uncertain about everything and

990
00:51:02.564 --> 00:51:05.475
even their own values and so on. So what

991
00:51:05.485 --> 00:51:09.645
would be a positive final message here for the

992
00:51:09.655 --> 00:51:13.564
teenagers when dealing with things like uncertainty?

993
00:51:14.165 --> 00:51:16.114
I think one of the most powerful things for

994
00:51:16.125 --> 00:51:20.885
me in this work is seeing youth develop who

995
00:51:20.895 --> 00:51:25.050
they are through the questions that the decision maker

996
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.840
moves, ask of them and then taking that thinking

997
00:51:29.909 --> 00:51:33.860
and that knowledge and taking action with it so

998
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.250
that they begin to move through the world in

999
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.110
a way that, um, in a way that has

1000
00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:44.790
integrity for them, that's pretty, pretty powerful because I

1001
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.679
think kids, I mean, kids today are definitely dealing

1002
00:51:47.689 --> 00:51:54.100
with a lot of uncertainty and there is, you

1003
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.810
know, there's a lot of fear wrapped up in

1004
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.090
that for them. Like on the big global scale,

1005
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.159
there, there's a ton of uncertainty about our world

1006
00:52:01.169 --> 00:52:04.179
and, and certainly youth in North America are feeling

1007
00:52:04.189 --> 00:52:08.600
that um given the data. So in that place,

1008
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.360
it's nice to have a map and it doesn't

1009
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.340
reduce or eliminate the uncertainty, but it helps them

1010
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:20.780
feel um like they know a know a way

1011
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.790
to move through it and to navigate through that

1012
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.290
uncertainty as opposed to, you know, stopping to think

1013
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.080
or just what, what do I, what am I

1014
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.060
gonna do? Like here's some smaller piece, questions piece

1015
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:34.639
by piece that you can take as you move

1016
00:52:34.649 --> 00:52:36.669
through your those those choices.

1017
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.929
And so one of the things we do in

1018
00:52:39.939 --> 00:52:41.870
the book is for each of the moves, we

1019
00:52:41.879 --> 00:52:47.219
try to um provide some very practical tips um

1020
00:52:47.229 --> 00:52:52.310
that uh to kind of operationalize, be very practical

1021
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.070
so that we aren't just talking in theories but

1022
00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.370
very practical steps. The book also has a lot

1023
00:52:57.379 --> 00:53:00.010
of stories. Brooke and I both believe very strongly

1024
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.780
in the power of stories. Um But II, I

1025
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:05.830
think in terms, I think one of the things

1026
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.600
that teenagers I know many of the adults I

1027
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.830
know, um, they don't quite know how to engage

1028
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.760
in the world in this world of ours. Like,

1029
00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:17.699
how do they connect with the world? Um, AND

1030
00:53:17.709 --> 00:53:19.679
I think the, the way to engage is through

1031
00:53:19.689 --> 00:53:22.080
your choices. So if you get better at making

1032
00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:28.149
choices that gives you new opportunities for engagement and

1033
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:31.629
for finding out about yourself, because, um, I think

1034
00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:34.199
adults tend to know more about the world than

1035
00:53:34.209 --> 00:53:37.850
teenagers, but the teenagers know more about themselves. The

1036
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.040
teenagers are the one that, that who know about

1037
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:44.030
themselves. So if we can activate that, um you

1038
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.239
know, we, we need their input, we need, we,

1039
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.040
we need the input. My generation hasn't done a

1040
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.750
fantastic job at, at uh you know, being in

1041
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.909
the world and being on our planet. I think

1042
00:53:54.919 --> 00:53:59.310
we need the input, creative input of those, those

1043
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.330
uh kids between, you know, 12 and 25. Um

1044
00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:07.090
AND their values and s and see what kind

1045
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.409
of world they can shape. So I think anything

1046
00:54:09.419 --> 00:54:13.280
we can do to encourage that will have the

1047
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.320
side benefit as they get engaged. I think that

1048
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.060
fear the depression, the feeling of being a little

1049
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.560
bit overwhelmed with the world is likely to, to

1050
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.560
go down because they're engaged because they're seeing that

1051
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:28.239
ownership that uh that we talked about earlier. So

1052
00:54:28.419 --> 00:54:32.560
very simple thing, making good choices, but supporting the

1053
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.929
choices that uh that teens make based on their

1054
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:36.479
values

1055
00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.360
great. So the book is again sorting it out,

1056
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.399
supporting teenage decision making. I'm leaving a link to

1057
00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:49.010
it in the description box of the interview. And

1058
00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.449
uh Doctor Gregory and Moore. Uh WOULD you also

1059
00:54:51.459 --> 00:54:53.939
like to tell the audience where they can find

1060
00:54:53.949 --> 00:54:56.179
your work on the internet?

1061
00:55:01.429 --> 00:55:07.010
It's published by Cambridge Cambridge University Press. Um And

1062
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.489
it's also, I think it's available through many of,

1063
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.330
of the big, the big outlets uh and through

1064
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.870
uh you know, a lot of people have bookstores

1065
00:55:16.879 --> 00:55:19.360
in their neighborhood and I think, and it should

1066
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.570
be available through those bookstores as well.

1067
00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:25.540
Uh Yes, but I was also asking about your

1068
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:28.580
other work. I mean, where people can find you

1069
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.979
and your other work on the internet.

1070
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.320
We uh we both have websites that we're linking,

1071
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:36.969
things like that too. So you can look up

1072
00:55:36.979 --> 00:55:39.719
Brooke Moore dot C A or Robin Gregory dot

1073
00:55:39.729 --> 00:55:42.820
Ca, I believe Robin and uh and go about

1074
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.879
it that way pretty easy to find. I think.

1075
00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:49.629
So. Uh And maybe, and go through us to

1076
00:55:49.639 --> 00:55:51.330
the sort of network, we both have a lot

1077
00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.780
of collaborators like Brooke has mentioned some of these

1078
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.780
amazing teachers in Delta. You know, we both have

1079
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:00.360
amazing colleagues. Uh There's a group at University of

1080
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:04.459
British Columbia, we work with um Judy Halbert Linda

1081
00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:08.060
Ker. So, you know, we're, we're, we're embedded in

1082
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.179
a really great group of people. So it's, it's

1083
00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:12.469
not just us, it's, it's uh it's quite a,

1084
00:56:12.479 --> 00:56:14.689
quite a bunch of really cool collaborators.
