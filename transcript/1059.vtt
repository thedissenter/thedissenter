00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.719
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.409
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lopez, and today I'm

3
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.969
joined by Doctor Christopher Hoyt. He's an associate professor

4
00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.119
in the Department of Philosophy and religion at Western

5
00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:38.240
Carolina University. His research interests include Wittgenstein and the

6
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.970
philosophy of film, and today we're going to talk

7
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.549
about uh some of the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein,

8
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.380
uh, how it relates to some Uh, topics that

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.380
people explore in the philosophy of mind and also

10
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.860
the cognitive science of religion. So Doctor Hoyt, welcome

11
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.349
to the show. It's a pleasure to have you

12
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.459
on.

13
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.430
Thank you very much, Ricardo. I, I appreciate the

14
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.950
invitation.

15
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.260
So, uh, I mean, of course, this is also

16
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.300
a question for my audience who doesn't know about

17
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.419
Wittgenstein very much or are not uh familiar with

18
00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:20.220
his philosophy. Uh, WHAT aspects of Wittgenstein's philosophy interest

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.339
you the most? And perhaps then we can talk

20
00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:25.779
about the ones that apply to the topics we're

21
00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:27.660
going to explore here today.

22
00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:32.690
Sure, um, I mean, like most people who study

23
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.099
Wittgenstein as long and intensively as I have, my

24
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.819
interests move around through so many different themes that

25
00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.379
he covers. Um, I can say that, you know,

26
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.489
most recently in the last few years. There are

27
00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.519
probably 3 big themes that that interest me. I

28
00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.360
mean, the philosophy of mind and what it really

29
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.319
means for psychology and for understanding people is on

30
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.849
my mind all the time. Um, HE'S there there's

31
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:06.959
sort of a message there about How it's so

32
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.639
difficult to understand ourselves and others that I find

33
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.759
really fascinating, and how that difficulty is then confused

34
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.000
in psychology and philosophy of mind. People go about

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.470
it incorrectly and so we end up with these

36
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.830
false kinds of answers. So that's led to my

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.690
my recent essentially returned interest in. The applications of

38
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.809
Wittgenstein to psychology, academic psychology, um, neuroscience have been

39
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.330
thinking more about what how Wittgenstein's work might relate

40
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.009
to the study of autism. Um, AND so I

41
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.649
find that right now I'm working on problems like

42
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.570
that. Um, THERE are a couple other themes that

43
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.330
are that are really on my mind. Partly because

44
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.809
of my teaching, um, teaching a class on film,

45
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.839
and then right now I'm doing an upper level

46
00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.110
seminar with undergraduate students on Wittgenstein. And so that

47
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.610
that forces me to try to really boil things

48
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.210
down to what they can absorb. So a second

49
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.690
theme in Wikenstein that I'm really thinking about a

50
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.509
lot lately is. The implications of what he's saying

51
00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.960
about meaning, the, the fact that Possibly the most

52
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.410
essential lesson from Wittgenstein is that meanings don't stand

53
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.410
apart from things. The, the meaning of a word

54
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.889
is not separate from the word. The meaning is

55
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.570
the use. The meaning of a gesture is not

56
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.449
something separate from the gesture. The meaning of the

57
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.690
things that are happening in film are not separate

58
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.919
from what we're seeing in the films themselves, and

59
00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.470
That's, that's a very useful useful point in understanding

60
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.300
our everyday lives. Um, IT'S hard to get it,

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.389
I think. It's relatively easy to say it, but

62
00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.149
it takes people time to really absorb what's going

63
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.020
on. And then I would say that the last

64
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.820
thing that's on my mind quite a bit, it's

65
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.509
come and gone and my thinking isstein's relatively casual

66
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:09.050
remarks about how he thinks his philosophy stands outside

67
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.860
of our current cultural trends, the trends that he

68
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.220
was living through in the early 20th century, but

69
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.298
that I think only accelerated since then. So that,

70
00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.260
that would be the the trends of trying to

71
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.640
see meaning as something hidden. In systems that can

72
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.519
be analyzed through logic and philosophy and how that

73
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.329
really gets in the way of understanding things and

74
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.799
I've been thinking about that as part of academic

75
00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:40.089
culture that it's I think it's sometimes hard to

76
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.089
publish the things or talk about the things that

77
00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:45.140
are most helpful, and people get caught up talking

78
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.940
about imaginary hidden systems. So, those are 3 things

79
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.850
that are really on my mind.

80
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.839
But by the way, since later on in our

81
00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.440
conversation, we're going to get a little bit into

82
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.040
the cognitive science of religion, and just for the

83
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.600
audience to, I mean, understand a little bit better.

84
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.089
Uh, HOW you would place Wittgenstein as, uh, an

85
00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.880
intellectual here. Because we tend to think of him,

86
00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:15.450
uh, I guess, more as, uh, more as of

87
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.649
a, a philosopher. But, uh, of course, he was

88
00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:23.269
very multidisciplinary in a way. I mean, He worked

89
00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:27.109
on logics, mathematics, and then I guess that we

90
00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:30.809
can also say symbiotics in a sense, and then

91
00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:35.739
linguistics, but then he also theorized about psychological phenomena,

92
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.160
etc. So, would you classify him as, I don't

93
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.829
know, a philosopher or what kind of intellectual, really?

94
00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:50.940
I, I would say he's quite strictly a philosopher.

95
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.649
Uh, HIS, I, I think there's other things that

96
00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:59.869
you mentioned, all those different areas to different degrees.

97
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.290
He's, he has things to say they're important in

98
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.609
those fields, and that's true in psychology, but they're

99
00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:10.570
true philosophically. So he was a philosopher whose work

100
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.529
has real practical import, but he wasn't theorizing in

101
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.269
those domains. He wasn't doing research in those areas.

102
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.970
He was essentially commenting on the conceptual framework within

103
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.450
which people operate in those areas and saying, in

104
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.959
many cases there's some really deep mistakes. That are

105
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.119
in the way of gaining real understanding, and I

106
00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.040
think that's true. Everything that he has to say

107
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.079
about psychology, I think that that's where how to

108
00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:41.679
understand him is essentially as a critic. There are

109
00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:43.929
positive lessons, but they're not the kinds that you

110
00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:45.450
get within those fields.

111
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.170
Mhm. I, I guess it's important to really drive

112
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.440
this point home, I guess, because, of course, when

113
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.640
we're talking about something like the cognitive science of

114
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.940
religion. It's not that, uh, what comes from philosophers

115
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.700
just because they are not scientists doesn't matter, but

116
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.369
the inputs we usually get from scientists and philosophers

117
00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.089
tend to be a little bit different.

118
00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.260
Right. Yes, I think that's right. And, and, you

119
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.100
know, the comment I made at the beginning about

120
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.820
meaning tells you a lot, which is about culture

121
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.140
and meaning, um. I mean, one of Wittgenstein's great

122
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.899
worries was that we were becoming a civilization that

123
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.980
thinks of science and causal explanation as the only

124
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.220
forms of explanation, and he was driven to remind

125
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.059
us that there are many ways of understanding the

126
00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:47.649
world, and they're legitimate ways. They're not poetic, pretty,

127
00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:51.450
they're they're truly meaningful. They, they lead to real

128
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.200
understanding. And he, he talks about them as in

129
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.809
culture and value there's a remark where he says

130
00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:59.000
we need to, something along the lines if we

131
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.600
need to resurrect those other modes of understanding the

132
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.679
neglected modes of understanding and and that's true in

133
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:12.790
psychology. So that he's not competing with psychologists, he's

134
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.540
really trying to Lay the groundwork for understanding each

135
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.250
other well.

136
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.579
Mhm. And this is also very, I mean, these

137
00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.980
are very important insights, the ones we're going to

138
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.589
talk about because also some of them inform actual

139
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:34.260
scientific work and scientific research that people conduct in

140
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.450
the cognitive science and of religion and, and elsewhere,

141
00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:38.000
right?

142
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.710
They should. I don't, I don't see having uh

143
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.539
the impacts on science that I think he deserves

144
00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:49.159
to have. But, um, he, he could.

145
00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:52.799
Yeah. I, I, I mean, I was also, uh,

146
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.400
of course, not only about Wittgenstein, but I was

147
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.280
also making a broader, uh, commentary on how many

148
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.669
times insights from philosophers do that.

149
00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:07.479
Oh yes, and, and from within the fields too,

150
00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:11.510
I mean, when people are constructing new theories and

151
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.159
they they get into the, the competition between schools

152
00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:18.530
of of psychology and Uh, yeah, then they're doing

153
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.880
philosophy themselves, and they often incorporate the ideas of

154
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.250
philosophers, absolutely.

155
00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:27.340
And so talking about philosophy of mind, in what

156
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.260
ways would you say Wittgenstein's philosophy connect to wit

157
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.369
and what are perhaps some of the most relevant

158
00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:39.020
insights coming from him that you would say apply

159
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.979
not only to philosophy of mind, but also to

160
00:09:41.979 --> 00:09:46.539
religion more specifically or to the phenomenon of religion

161
00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:47.419
more specifically?

162
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.609
OK, well, let's let's start with philosophy of mind

163
00:09:51.609 --> 00:09:56.780
and psychology. Um, I mean the There's a a

164
00:09:56.929 --> 00:10:01.080
a core insight there that It is definitely the

165
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.609
place to start, which is that the mind is

166
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:07.479
not an interior realm. The very idea that minds

167
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:12.109
are things inside of people, is that is the

168
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.159
the false picture that Wittgenstein works so hard to

169
00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:20.479
liberate us from. And One of the great ironies

170
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:24.080
is that, you know, within psychology, psychologists always say,

171
00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:29.080
well, I'm a hardcore materialist, and yet they end

172
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.239
up describing people and their work as though they

173
00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:36.760
were working out the system where the private mind.

174
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.030
Constructed a theory or an image, some kind of

175
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.469
representation of all of the external world. As soon

176
00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:46.630
as you have that duality of of mind and

177
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.549
world, you've made the big mistake that the constraint

178
00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:55.030
is trying to liberate us from. And It's incredibly

179
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.340
difficult not to think about human beings that way,

180
00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:01.549
and I, and I would say in my experience

181
00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:04.250
personally with people, it's really only people that have

182
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.750
worked with Beckenstein for years that seem to have

183
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.659
worked their way out of that in a genuine

184
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:12.250
way. And um, so that has everything to do

185
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.280
with psychology because you know, uh so much psychology

186
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.159
it concerns theories of how the inner mechanism works,

187
00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:25.599
how it's building images, representations of the external world,

188
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.090
and if you're if you're doing that, you are

189
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.280
making the big mistake that I would say. I

190
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.640
shouldn't exaggerate. Wittstein is is all over the place

191
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.599
with many things, but that is a very big

192
00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:41.359
part of Wittgenstein's later philosophy. It's a really big

193
00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:44.280
part. Um, SO that's on the critical side, that

194
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.840
would be what not to do. If, if there's

195
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.830
a positive lesson it has to do with if

196
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.390
you stop imagining that people are made up of

197
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.059
this inner and outer realm. Then you really have

198
00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:58.729
to rethink what are we talking about when we're

199
00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:02.900
we're talking about people. What is psychological language actually

200
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.580
doing and what is the work of understanding each

201
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.489
other and A lot of what he's saying, this

202
00:12:10.489 --> 00:12:12.239
is a lot of what I've been trying to

203
00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:17.239
find ways to express recently, is that human life

204
00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:22.010
is really, really complex, and our psychological concepts deal

205
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:28.559
with especially complex dimensions of life. And so understanding

206
00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:32.250
ourselves and understanding each other means looking at those

207
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.919
aspects of life and all of their complexity, and

208
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.109
If, if you take that perspective correctly, there, there

209
00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:43.190
are corners to bring science in that are extremely

210
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.869
useful, but it's no longer the grand project of

211
00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:49.710
describing how the private mind constructs a theory of

212
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.909
the external world, that disappears as fantasy.

213
00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.989
So there's an element of uh embeddedness there, right?

214
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.429
I mean, the human mind being embedded in a

215
00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:06.590
larger, uh, I don't know, uh context. I, I'm

216
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.619
not sure if in this particular case, it would

217
00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:12.789
be a, a social context, but uh at least

218
00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:16.590
a broader context outside of the, uh, I, I

219
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.299
mean, the skull, let's say, right?

220
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.950
It's, you have to be careful with that kind

221
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.909
of talk, um. It's not that that that's correct

222
00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:30.979
in a way, but, but that you, it's still

223
00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:32.780
a way of talking that some people would think

224
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.450
of it as minds are things and Wienstein is,

225
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.400
is trying to get us to, to understand that

226
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.460
our mental concepts are not talking about things at

227
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.770
all. They're dealing with complex. Domains of life or

228
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.030
aspects of life that To say the mind is

229
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.750
embedded leads might lead someone to think we're talking

230
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.989
about a thing that has a a particular context,

231
00:13:58.109 --> 00:14:01.349
so it's really an aspect of life. OK.

232
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:06.539
And in what ways would that apply then to

233
00:14:06.789 --> 00:14:10.179
religious phenomenon or religion itself?

234
00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:18.400
Well, um, I mean, starting off generally, the philosophy

235
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.830
of religion. WAS for a long time, probably still

236
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.580
is dominated by discussions of The theories of the

237
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.950
world. So there, there's an idea, it's very common

238
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.070
in popular thought, as well as academic research, to

239
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.630
imagine that a religion is a theory of the

240
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.809
world, and it has to compete against science and

241
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.590
and a secular theory of the world. We're back

242
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.909
to that picture. The very picture that there's a

243
00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:47.429
private mind that constructs a theory of the external

244
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:51.830
world, and religions are these theories of the external

245
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:58.419
world. Um. When we really abandon that as Fikenstein

246
00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:02.659
wants us to do. Then what's left is looking

247
00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:06.700
at people and how they live and the, the

248
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.820
lessons that come out of Wienstein's remarks in my

249
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.289
view, um, about religion come down to the idea

250
00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:17.510
that It is remarkable that people can live in

251
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.859
so many different ways. Um, DC Phillips has a,

252
00:15:21.869 --> 00:15:24.739
a lovely expression where it talks about ways of

253
00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:29.500
being human and That really captures something deep in

254
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.130
what Wittgenstein was trying to say about religions that

255
00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:37.130
these are These are deeply important complex ways of

256
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.650
being human, and to understand them has nothing to

257
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.479
do with understanding a theory of the world. It's

258
00:15:45.849 --> 00:15:48.250
the work is mostly about, there are there are

259
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.559
a lot of things that can help us understand

260
00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:54.570
other people's religions, but it's trying to imagine your

261
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.940
way into the life of another person. And the

262
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.380
ways that things become meaningful in the context of

263
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.140
that life, the rituals, the act of prayer, the

264
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.140
sentences someone speaks, they take on meaning from a

265
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.500
particular way of life or forms of life, to

266
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.349
use Wittgenstein's expression. And very different orientation.

267
00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:22.929
Mhm. And since you mentioned rituals there, uh, I

268
00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:25.250
mean, I guess that there would be two sides

269
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.929
to this question. So, um, first of all, what

270
00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:36.299
does meaning mean to Wittgenstein and then what makes

271
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:38.919
rituals meaningful then?

272
00:16:40.349 --> 00:16:48.390
Yeah, those, those are good hard questions, um. Things,

273
00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:55.659
words, rituals, gestures are meaningful to humans simply because

274
00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:59.390
they're they're used in ways that are important to

275
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.700
us. The the meaning is the use, Bechtenstein says,

276
00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:07.678
and One of the things about being the kind

277
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:10.718
of creature that that we are, that that you

278
00:17:10.718 --> 00:17:14.229
are being a human being, a homo sapien. Is

279
00:17:14.229 --> 00:17:19.048
that We have the capacity to acquire this, this

280
00:17:19.048 --> 00:17:23.729
repertoire of behaviors that is speech, or a repertoire

281
00:17:23.729 --> 00:17:28.118
of behaviors that is a religious pattern of ritual.

282
00:17:28.489 --> 00:17:30.999
We have the capacity to evolve a way of

283
00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.568
of being in the world, to develop a life

284
00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:38.280
where praying seems natural and important to us. And

285
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.920
that's what it is to have meaning is to

286
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.359
live a life where those things are important, and

287
00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:46.959
the meaning is not separate from the things at

288
00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:50.520
all. It's not shown by those things or defined

289
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.719
by those things or proved by those things that

290
00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:55.270
that's all that is the whole story of meaning

291
00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:02.130
that They're valuable in human life. Um, YEAH. And

292
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.619
did you want to ask a follow-up question?

293
00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:06.369
Uh, NO, I, I mean, did you have anything

294
00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:09.540
to add there or otherwise I would ask you

295
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.369
another question.

296
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.939
Uh, SURE, well, I, I mean, in, in understanding

297
00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:18.380
rituals, there, there is some, I should acknowledge that

298
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.930
Dickenstein scholars are not all in agreement about this.

299
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.650
So Dickens made a couple of remarks that Have

300
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.329
led people to take seriously this idea they had

301
00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:31.170
an expressivist theory of ritual that rituals are a

302
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.719
way of expressing certain things that a person is

303
00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:38.579
thinking or feeling. I think that is. Uh, A

304
00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:41.540
red herring. He doesn't. In this and every other

305
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.609
case, Wittgenstein doesn't have theories, and I think that

306
00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:46.939
that's really important. I think that what's really important

307
00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:49.650
is Wittgenstein is trying to get us in touch

308
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.939
with all of the possible ways that rituals can

309
00:18:51.939 --> 00:18:53.819
be meaningful, all of the ways that they can

310
00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:56.699
be woven into human lives in a way that

311
00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:00.300
they become important. And I think that that is

312
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.420
the right perspective to take and trying to make

313
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.390
sense of Vigentra on ritual.

314
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.270
OK. And I mean, as far as I've read

315
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.949
in your work about his takes on rituals, it

316
00:19:13.949 --> 00:19:18.709
seems that many times uh they get easily misinterpreted

317
00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:24.729
and related to that. There's this scapegoat remark. Uh,

318
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.300
COULD you tell us about it? I mean, what

319
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.770
is the scapegoat remark and what relationship does it

320
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.579
have or might have with his takes on rituals

321
00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:37.089
being easily misinterpreted?

322
00:19:37.699 --> 00:19:43.959
Sure. OK, so the, the scapegoat remark, um, Vienstein

323
00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:48.390
made it several times in his manuscripts, and, um,

324
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.280
he, he There's a way of reading it. It

325
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.119
says uh of the, the ancient Jewish ritual of

326
00:19:56.119 --> 00:20:01.280
a scapegoat. So ritual asked people to cast their

327
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.189
sins onto a goat and to send the goat

328
00:20:03.189 --> 00:20:08.020
out into the desert to die, and There's a

329
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.939
way of looking at the remark um that that

330
00:20:10.939 --> 00:20:13.219
people took where Wittgenstein seems to be saying that

331
00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:18.000
the ritual itself is incoherent. And that was important

332
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.130
to scholars of Wittgenstein and scholars of religion, because

333
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.130
there were people there were Wittgenstein scholars essentially defending

334
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.569
their reading of Wittgenstein, saying that it proved that

335
00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:35.689
Wittgenstein could see that religious rituals could be criticized

336
00:20:35.689 --> 00:20:39.170
or religious beliefs could be criticized. So that there

337
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.099
was A reading, there was a complaint about Wittgenstein

338
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:47.739
and Wittgensteinians in philosophy of religion, saying, They're telling

339
00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:51.859
us no religious beliefs can be criticized, no rituals

340
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:54.619
can be criticized. There's everything here is just we

341
00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.910
have to take it at face value. And so

342
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.140
there's some Fitgensteinians, uh, starting with DC Phillips said,

343
00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:04.949
no, no, Fitgenstein does admit that we can sometimes

344
00:21:04.949 --> 00:21:07.989
criticize religions, look at what he says about the

345
00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:11.760
scapegoat for month. Uh, NO, I think, I think

346
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.520
what Vickenstein was saying in that scapegoat remark was

347
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.170
that the ritual was easily misunderstood. So it's misunderstood

348
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.449
the same way that language, especially psychological language, is

349
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:29.170
so easily misunderstood. It leads to philosophical errors. And

350
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.969
so the the debate there I think got off

351
00:21:31.969 --> 00:21:35.329
track, um, and I was that remark that I

352
00:21:35.329 --> 00:21:39.099
wrote was mainly of interest to academics and Philosophers

353
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.239
of Wittgenstein, but I do think there's an important

354
00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:46.689
lesson here that It's a red herring to worry

355
00:21:46.689 --> 00:21:50.609
that Wittgenstein's philosophy is a philosophy of religion is

356
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:55.479
a type of fideism. He. He's not, he's not

357
00:21:55.479 --> 00:22:01.750
saying that. All beliefs, all religious beliefs are necessarily

358
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:07.119
meaningful, it's The point is that whether or not

359
00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:09.689
a belief or a ritual, a word, a gesture

360
00:22:09.689 --> 00:22:11.930
is meaningful, depends on how it's woven into a

361
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.890
life. If it's woven into a life in a

362
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.119
way that it becomes substantial, significant in that life,

363
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.130
then we want to acknowledge that it's meaningful, that

364
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.969
is the meaning, and there's not much more to

365
00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:26.969
say about it. And so much of the debate

366
00:22:26.969 --> 00:22:30.329
about whether Wittgenstein was or wasn't the fides has

367
00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:33.780
to do with again that same old picture. Is

368
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.819
he saying that any theory of the world is

369
00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:39.900
an equally valid theory of the world, and he

370
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.010
wasn't worried, he was trying to get us away

371
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.380
from that picture of theories of the world. So

372
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.300
I, I feel that that discussion sort of took

373
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.989
Wittgenstein's scholarship someone off track. Mhm.

374
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.339
And sort of related to the work he did

375
00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:58.699
on language. There are many scholars that take him

376
00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:03.430
to work with language games with belief systems, and

377
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.680
then when applied to religion, a certain That these

378
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.520
belief systems are really about logical schemes founded on

379
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.180
their own basic beliefs and principles of inference. Uh,

380
00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:20.890
WHAT do you think about this from a Wittgensteinian

381
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.550
perspective?

382
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.880
Uh, CLOSELY related with what I was just saying.

383
00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:32.969
Yeah. The It's a, it's a difficult topic, but

384
00:23:32.969 --> 00:23:40.699
it essentially. My understanding of Wittgenstein is that Belief

385
00:23:40.699 --> 00:23:43.739
systems, to the extent that they exist, there there

386
00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:46.729
are ways that exist in our lives. We can

387
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.729
talk about the systems of belief that frame a

388
00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:54.979
culture, a community, possibly an individual life, but they're

389
00:23:54.979 --> 00:23:58.199
not theories that are in the head. And once

390
00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:00.359
you get away from that idea that we're talking

391
00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:03.079
about a theory inside the private mind about the

392
00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:07.000
external world, the whole way of understanding what a

393
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.150
belief system is shifts dramatically. The same way that

394
00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.680
that what we're talking about when we're doing psychology

395
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.010
and talking about other people's thoughts and beliefs and

396
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.640
feelings, hope and despair, all the meaning of all

397
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.040
of those things shifts dramatically when we get rid

398
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.760
of that in or outer picture. And I think

399
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.520
that that's also true for belief systems and And

400
00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:34.829
uh I'm not sure that That the victims and

401
00:24:34.829 --> 00:24:39.430
scholars as a community have done enough to to

402
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.349
absorb what happens to belief systems if they're not

403
00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:46.609
things inside the private mind. Um, I think there's

404
00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:49.199
still work to be done there. Mhm.

405
00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:56.000
And how does Wittgenstein in your view, understand, understand

406
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.800
religious?

407
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.319
Dogma. Uh, YEAH, I've got that just that one

408
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:08.349
essay that I wrote about, about dogma, um. I

409
00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:11.030
think I'll, I'll talk about the, the critical and

410
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.040
the and the positive. Um, AGAIN, it's sort of

411
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.739
we're on a theme here, um, the, the critical

412
00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:23.660
side is that when Philosophers of religion or even

413
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.089
laymen thinking about religions, think about dogmas in religion,

414
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.939
they do tend to think about belief systems. And

415
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.219
if we get rid of that, and we're not

416
00:25:34.219 --> 00:25:38.280
worried about a private mental construct of the world,

417
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.290
we're worried about how people live. Then what's interesting

418
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.290
about religious dogma and what I think Wickenste is

419
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.599
really driving at is that this is a way

420
00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:52.130
of being human, so to speak. It's It's a

421
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.869
pretty fascinating fact that people can, you know, a

422
00:25:56.869 --> 00:26:02.020
Catholic can accept certain dogmas from the church authorities

423
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.560
and commit himself to living by those dogmas. And

424
00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:14.619
have to resist his or her own possible Doubts

425
00:26:14.619 --> 00:26:17.550
about those dogmas say, and, and you, you're forced

426
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.630
in a sense to work those into your life

427
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.310
and that's an interesting thing and the significance of

428
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.989
that in a life and what we want to

429
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:29.089
say about someone's spirituality is well worth tracing, but

430
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.979
At that point we're doing a kind of Anthropology

431
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.900
of how people live with dogmas. And it's descriptive,

432
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.189
this is a trend in Wittgenstein's thought generally, where

433
00:26:43.189 --> 00:26:45.989
we thought we needed theory, we really end up

434
00:26:45.989 --> 00:26:48.069
with a kind of something we might talk about

435
00:26:48.069 --> 00:26:51.589
as a descriptive anthropology, and I think that's true

436
00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:54.829
about religious dogma. It's an interesting thing that people

437
00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:55.510
can do this.

438
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.540
So to get into the cognitive science of religion,

439
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.630
uh, I've actually already had several cognitive scientists of

440
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.339
religion on the show, and they come from, uh,

441
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.619
a, a, a non-Wittgensteinian perspective, let's call it like

442
00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:16.819
that. So it's, uh, it would be very interesting.

443
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.119
So to have your uh Wittgensteinian perspective on it.

444
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.020
So uh before we get into a very specific

445
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.630
uh question topic that people explore there, what do

446
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.430
you think Wittgenstein would have made of the cognitive

447
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.300
science of religion as it is today?

448
00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:41.380
OK, right here, I, I'm gonna choose to just

449
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.420
be blunt. Um, I think he would have hated

450
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.300
almost all of it. Um, THERE'S, there is room

451
00:27:49.469 --> 00:27:54.030
to do legitimate science of religion. Whether it could

452
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.790
be done in in a way that would fit

453
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.439
the label of cognitive science or religion as it's

454
00:27:59.439 --> 00:28:03.859
being done now, I'm skeptical of, although. We could

455
00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:07.150
get there in details, but the cognitive science of

456
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.089
religion that I've read, um, and I, you know,

457
00:28:10.619 --> 00:28:13.939
I'm not that widely read, but all of the

458
00:28:13.939 --> 00:28:18.170
things that I have read, they are exactly doing

459
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.819
theories of how the inner mental mechanism constructs a

460
00:28:21.819 --> 00:28:25.380
theory of the external world, and then they try

461
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.920
to talk about how There are particular mechanisms that

462
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.400
construct religious beliefs about the external world, so it's

463
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.180
the private mind external world problem yet again. And

464
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.530
because that picture is the central picture that Wittgenstein

465
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.290
is trying to liberate us from in his later

466
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.430
philosophy. He's really at odds with the project of

467
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.180
cognitive science of religion as as I've encountered it,

468
00:28:50.189 --> 00:28:52.250
and I, I think it can be reasonably well

469
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:57.250
defined. Um, So yeah, they're they're really at odds

470
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.319
with each other, I'm afraid.

471
00:28:59.579 --> 00:29:05.540
And one particular aspect of uh contemporary cognitive sense

472
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.060
of religion has to do with it, uh, being

473
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:14.540
based a lot on evolutionary approaches to the human

474
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.020
mind. Do you think that Wittgenstein would have problems

475
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.300
with that aspect specifically?

476
00:29:23.439 --> 00:29:27.829
Well, this is a really important complex topic here.

477
00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:31.250
So this, this is where I think psychology, maybe

478
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.180
not cognitive science, but psychology could be aligned with

479
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.349
Wittgenstein in a way to be profoundly informative and

480
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:42.569
and really interesting. He, there there is in this

481
00:29:42.569 --> 00:29:46.280
philosophy a very clear tendency to regard us as

482
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.099
parts of nature and to think, especially about language

483
00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:53.880
is natural. So if we think about the evolution

484
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.229
of our bodies, and we think about how our

485
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.599
our The organism evolved to be capable of these

486
00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:04.189
complex forms of life that we are capable of.

487
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.680
That's very interesting and and cognitive or excuse me,

488
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.589
evolutionary psychology, evolutionary theory generally might have a lot

489
00:30:12.589 --> 00:30:16.339
to say about that that's really helpful, really very,

490
00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:21.660
very interesting, um. I, I think, for example, evolutionary

491
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.239
psychology. I can help us understand quite a bit

492
00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.599
about how How it is that people are so

493
00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:35.430
difficult. To understand why it is that humans deceive

494
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.229
each other, hide things from each other, have to

495
00:30:38.229 --> 00:30:41.619
interpret each other. The the fact that we evolved

496
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.540
to compete more with other human beings, more with,

497
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.829
I mean, going all the way back in hominid

498
00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:52.589
evolution, hominids had to compete with other hominids, more

499
00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:56.060
than they had to compete at work. Navigate the

500
00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:01.020
environment, most likely the strongest factor influencing whether or

501
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.199
not you could reproduce, was your ability to compete

502
00:31:05.199 --> 00:31:09.050
with and cooperate with other human beings. So those

503
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.089
tensions of competition and cooperation with other human beings,

504
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.300
I think that's a very deep part of what

505
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.719
it is to be human. And I think that

506
00:31:17.719 --> 00:31:22.520
it's reflected in Wittgenstein's philosophy when he's trying to

507
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.920
work out the incredible complexity of reading each other

508
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.439
and playing what he calls the language games and

509
00:31:30.439 --> 00:31:33.319
participating in the forms of life that are social,

510
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.680
and the intricacies of those games. So I think

511
00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.979
there's a lot of work to be done. Where

512
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.300
we can look at how those two fields overlap,

513
00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:47.630
but it does require thinking about how we evolved

514
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.989
to do what we do rather than thinking about

515
00:31:49.989 --> 00:31:52.310
the evolution of a private mental mechanism.

516
00:31:53.189 --> 00:31:56.949
And still on the topic of evolutionary approaches to

517
00:31:56.949 --> 00:32:01.050
religion or to the cognitive science of religion. Uh,

518
00:32:01.229 --> 00:32:03.069
uh, I, I, I know, I'm well aware of

519
00:32:03.069 --> 00:32:06.030
this because I've talked about this topic on the

520
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.189
show with several different cognitive scientists of religion, but

521
00:32:10.189 --> 00:32:13.510
one of the most debated topics there has to

522
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:19.469
do with whether, um, religion is the result of

523
00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:24.410
evolved mental fact. Faculties evolved adaptations or if it

524
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.849
is the byproduct of other evolved adaptations of adaptations

525
00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:33.839
of the mind that evolved for other purposes. So,

526
00:32:34.209 --> 00:32:37.900
um, would, do you think that a Wittgensteinian approach

527
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.479
would have anything to say specifically about this topic?

528
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:50.170
No, I mean, be very, very careful that the

529
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:54.339
What evolved, what evolved in human beings are brains,

530
00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:00.189
so to speak, not. Not mental mechanisms, there's nothing

531
00:33:00.189 --> 00:33:03.400
inside a human being that traffics in ideas or

532
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.920
images in the ways that psychologists too often fall

533
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.479
into the trap of imagining them. What's going on

534
00:33:11.479 --> 00:33:17.239
inside the brain is physical, physiological, neurological. And to

535
00:33:17.239 --> 00:33:19.439
the extent that we can really talk about those

536
00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:23.030
things and talk about how people evolved to do

537
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.719
the things that they do. We might have a

538
00:33:26.719 --> 00:33:30.250
really interesting discussion, but the cognitive science of religion

539
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.780
that I've read, and I think cognitive science generally

540
00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:38.459
is all about trying to name. Hidden mental mechanisms

541
00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:41.569
that they, the psychologists always say, well, this must

542
00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:44.660
be in the brain, but they're not usually talking

543
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.819
about the brain very much at all. They're guessing

544
00:33:46.819 --> 00:33:50.060
about the brain. They're guessing that the brain has

545
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:56.979
a mechanism that makes us feel. Disgusted by corpses

546
00:33:57.069 --> 00:34:01.569
or Perceptive of movement or things like that, and

547
00:34:01.569 --> 00:34:04.810
they know very, very little about how the brains

548
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.189
lead to those kinds of behavior, and they start

549
00:34:07.189 --> 00:34:13.129
inventing a mechanism that supposedly produces images and words

550
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:16.129
or ideas or emotions. Those are, those are all

551
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:19.449
things that are descriptive at the level of human

552
00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:23.370
life. Those are not descriptive of brain processes. If

553
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.489
you want to talk about brains. A good starting

554
00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.928
point is to be literal. And if you want

555
00:34:28.928 --> 00:34:30.768
to talk about life, talk about life, and I

556
00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:35.679
think Far too often, and that debate about that

557
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.040
you brought up cognitive science or religion, far too

558
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.120
often what's happening is people are are inventing these

559
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.550
mechanisms. They're saying, well somehow it's in the brain,

560
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.879
but they don't have much of an idea of

561
00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:50.469
how it is. So the question, did mental mechanisms

562
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.978
evolve? To produce religious beliefs primarily, or was it

563
00:34:55.978 --> 00:35:00.540
a uh an accidental byproduct. I think that debate

564
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:06.469
is largely a confusion from the outset because it's,

565
00:35:06.479 --> 00:35:10.820
it's all about these. Mechanisms that don't exist anywhere.

566
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:16.320
They're Their imaginary mechanisms that misunderstand the grammar of

567
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.360
language, the grammar of psychological language. They're they're confusing

568
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.320
a grammatical domain of life, or a metaphysical domain

569
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.469
of life, a hidden mental mechanism that isn't there.

570
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.159
They are hidden brain mechanisms, but Not mental in

571
00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:36.250
the way that they're used in this discussion. I

572
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.790
don't know if that's clear enough. It's a, it's

573
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.830
a very hard point to explain. Uh,

574
00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:42.270
NO, yeah, it is, and let me just ask

575
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.070
you a follow up to that then. Do you

576
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.669
think that in disagreeing with uh cognitive scientists of

577
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:55.169
religion who Have evolutionary approaches to it, uh, do

578
00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:59.409
you think that Wittgenstein would also be interested in

579
00:35:59.689 --> 00:36:06.389
pointing perhaps to how, um, they are conditioned, conditioned,

580
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.540
I, I mean, I'm not, I'm not sure if

581
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.409
conditioned in this particular context is the best word

582
00:36:11.409 --> 00:36:14.860
to use, but conditioned. In their, in the way

583
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.370
they think about religion uh by their own uh

584
00:36:19.459 --> 00:36:23.060
frame, by their own intellectual framework, the framework that

585
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.139
they bring into analyzing religion here.

586
00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:31.060
Yes, absolutely. I think this is very important. So

587
00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:36.199
when the cognitive scientists of religion, the, the works

588
00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:40.489
that I've read. Quite consistently approached this from the

589
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:45.629
idea that That Each private mind constructs a theory

590
00:36:45.629 --> 00:36:49.679
of the external world, and there are religious theories

591
00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:51.459
of the world, and there are scientific theories of

592
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.760
the world, and they bring with them the attitude

593
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.270
that the scientific theory of the world is superior,

594
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.790
and then they they weave that sense of superiority

595
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.679
into theories, and it's easy to weave them in

596
00:37:06.679 --> 00:37:14.310
because the the theories are In effect, They're they're

597
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.669
made up. They, they claim that it's based on

598
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:21.310
the evolution of the human body, but it's the

599
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.590
evidence isn't there, that you have to look at

600
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.310
how bodies evolved to understand how bodies evolved.

601
00:37:29.149 --> 00:37:31.870
Uh, BUT one of the, of the things that

602
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.909
the cognitive scientists of religion do through science, of

603
00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:40.379
course, is that they try to naturalize religion. They

604
00:37:40.379 --> 00:37:42.830
think of religion as a natural phenomenon. Do you

605
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:48.419
think that at least that Wittgenstein would tend to

606
00:37:48.949 --> 00:37:51.860
agree with, I mean, with the process of naturalizing

607
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.629
religion, even if not through the same sort of

608
00:37:55.629 --> 00:37:57.100
theoretical framework.

609
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.510
Yes, um, so, It it it's a complicated answer

610
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.949
again, but the There is a way, I mean,

611
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:13.280
Vickenstein is most certainly saying that. Human beings are

612
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.209
a kind of animal, and all of our capacities

613
00:38:17.209 --> 00:38:20.020
and all of our ways of life. ARE part

614
00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.899
of these animal capacities. They're they're built on top

615
00:38:22.899 --> 00:38:26.699
of them. So it's perfectly legitimate to say that

616
00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:30.020
our religious ways of life are built on top

617
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:35.709
of animal capacities that evolved or, you know, millions,

618
00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:39.060
hundreds of millions of years. And in that sense,

619
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.800
there there's a lot to be said about. How

620
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.120
they, how religions can be understood naturalistically, how they

621
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.250
can be understood as something animal. What's not to

622
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:55.489
be done here, what what the naturalizing of Wittgenstein

623
00:38:55.489 --> 00:38:59.290
doesn't lead to is a naturalistic theory of the

624
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:04.300
internal mental mechanism. That is specifically the mistake that

625
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.100
happens over and over and over and over. That's

626
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.969
why I keep saying it. That's the big mistake

627
00:39:08.969 --> 00:39:11.739
and it causes enormous trouble in philosophy and in

628
00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:12.459
psychology.

629
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.000
So, um, as a last question, I would like

630
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.790
to quote you here. This comes from, I think,

631
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.850
one of your papers on Wittgensteinian approaches to religion,

632
00:39:25.879 --> 00:39:28.770
and I would like to hear your, uh, comments

633
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:32.965
or explanation of it. So. You say real understanding

634
00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:38.445
of religious beliefs mainly comes out of perspicuous representations

635
00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:44.004
of religious phenomena, not instrumental accounts of their underlying

636
00:39:44.004 --> 00:39:47.364
causes. So could you explain that uh quote?

637
00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:53.189
Sure, um, I mean, first, the, the phrase perspicuous

638
00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:56.639
representation is is Wittgenstein's own, and it's a very

639
00:39:56.639 --> 00:40:02.010
important idea in Wittgenstein's later philosophy, um. What he

640
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:06.479
was trying to say is that When we see

641
00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:09.830
things from a a certain angle when we make

642
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.280
different connections between the facts of the world that

643
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.560
we're trying to understand, those connections themselves are a

644
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.679
form of understanding. Seeing things in the relationship with

645
00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:25.320
each other is that does count as understanding. Things

646
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.510
become significant to us and make sense to us,

647
00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:32.649
and that we should. Respect that there are certain

648
00:40:32.649 --> 00:40:35.899
domains of life where that kind of understanding is

649
00:40:35.899 --> 00:40:38.899
really the more useful kind, rather than a a

650
00:40:38.899 --> 00:40:41.820
causal explanation. And I think that's often true in

651
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.389
religion. So when I said earlier that understanding religious

652
00:40:47.389 --> 00:40:50.899
phenomena often comes down to doing your best to

653
00:40:50.899 --> 00:40:53.699
imagine your way into the life of a believer.

654
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.800
What do things mean to that person? Why are

655
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.250
they inspired to make a gesture when they do,

656
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.399
to pray when they do, to say the things

657
00:41:03.399 --> 00:41:06.080
they do, um, or if you're looking at really

658
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.360
exotic rituals to cannibalize when they do. What's it

659
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.560
to to understand those things is to see from

660
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.889
that person's point of view, and that would be.

661
00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:21.100
To develop a perspicuous representation that describes what things

662
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.159
look like from the believer's perspective. Things come into

663
00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:28.199
view where you, you see the relationships between things

664
00:41:28.489 --> 00:41:31.530
from their perspective, and that provides a really deep

665
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.689
kind of understanding.

666
00:41:33.439 --> 00:41:36.120
Mhm. Uh, BY the way, let me just ask

667
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.120
you one more question then. When it comes to

668
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.750
the cognitive science of religion and your more Wittgensteinian

669
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.959
approach to religion, do you think that there would

670
00:41:47.959 --> 00:41:53.639
be any room here for Wittgensteinians and the cognitive

671
00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:58.405
scientists or Religion to collaborate with one another in

672
00:41:58.405 --> 00:42:03.554
studying religion, there would be room for, uh, both,

673
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:07.125
uh, for the, uh, the two approaches to complement

674
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:11.514
each other or even to perhaps have a pluralistic

675
00:42:11.514 --> 00:42:14.495
approach to religion here? Or do you see them

676
00:42:14.804 --> 00:42:18.854
as, I don't know, if one is the dominant,

677
00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:22.604
then it just excludes the other. There's no room

678
00:42:22.604 --> 00:42:26.879
for Collaboration here at all, uh, intellectually speaking.

679
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.669
No, I, I, I think that there is some

680
00:42:31.669 --> 00:42:36.320
room for collaboration. There's, as I tried to explain,

681
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:38.070
I feel like I wasn't as clear as I

682
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.310
would like to be on a couple of points,

683
00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:46.429
but. There is real room to think about. Wittgenstein's

684
00:42:46.429 --> 00:42:52.550
insights and evolutionary psychology. OK. Cognitive science of religion.

685
00:42:54.209 --> 00:42:57.669
I think it would be difficult given what cognitive

686
00:42:57.669 --> 00:43:01.739
science, how it's understood currently. I think it would

687
00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:07.790
be difficult to make that relationship work. However, if

688
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:13.209
the cognitive scientists were to start to approach Understanding

689
00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:18.179
the nature of psychological language from a point of

690
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.620
view. Then they might put themselves in a position

691
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.820
to really start doing science and the kinds of

692
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.300
experiments that they sometimes run. The experiments sometimes turn

693
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.570
up things that are interesting. And it would be

694
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.429
a question of interpreting those experiments in a different

695
00:43:33.429 --> 00:43:35.780
light, and I think that could be done, and

696
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.520
I think that could be very interesting and productive,

697
00:43:38.939 --> 00:43:42.060
but it would, to agree with what Wienstein is

698
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:47.780
saying, would generally speaking require a pretty radical reorientation

699
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:53.139
in how to interpret research and results, and yeah,

700
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.540
I, I think it would be, it would be

701
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.629
difficult but possible with that.

702
00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:01.489
So do you think that it would also imply

703
00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:07.439
more broadly a different approach to science or not

704
00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:07.860
necessarily?

705
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.760
All of science? Like,

706
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.389
yeah, I mean, basically to the scient of course,

707
00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:15.570
I know that this is more of a uh

708
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.370
philosophical question within the philosophy of science and it's

709
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:24.560
multi-layered and multifaceted, but uh um basically the way

710
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.179
we approach the scientific method in general.

711
00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:38.310
Oh, No, the, the Science is is Is doing

712
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.820
just fine. Um, AND Wittgenstein is definitely not saying

713
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.879
anything that I think would require that. I think

714
00:44:44.879 --> 00:44:47.530
what what Wittgenstein is is saying about science is

715
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.500
that it's one method of understanding, and we might

716
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.979
say it should be respected and kept in its

717
00:44:55.979 --> 00:44:58.459
in its channel. And at the same time, we

718
00:44:58.459 --> 00:45:01.739
have many other ways of understanding the world that

719
00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:04.780
are equally valid and important for human beings, and

720
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.459
sometimes they're more appropriate for a given topic. And

721
00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:10.610
a lot of the things we've been talking about

722
00:45:10.979 --> 00:45:14.810
are those topics. There, there are aspects of psychology,

723
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.500
of understanding human beings, understanding ourselves that are better

724
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.659
approached with other methods and religion. There are, there

725
00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:26.260
are topics in religion that are better approached with

726
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:31.000
other methods, um. They overlap with science. Wienstein is

727
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.800
not dogmatic in this way. Science has It's always

728
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.520
valid. In its in its proper places. So there

729
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.360
could be corners of religion, lots and lots of

730
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.840
things about psychology where science is perfect. It's exactly

731
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.189
what you need and you want to do it.

732
00:45:47.889 --> 00:45:50.540
And of course science is broad. Science covers lots

733
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.429
and lots of things.

734
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.770
Great. So, uh, just before we go, would you

735
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.260
like to tell people where they can find you

736
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.120
and your work on the internet?

737
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.090
Sure, uh, well, I'm, I'm in the process of

738
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.929
uh revising my the web page on my Western

739
00:46:08.929 --> 00:46:12.020
Carolina University account, but I think the best place

740
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.540
to go as soon as I have all that

741
00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.860
updated would be Western Carolina University. I they can

742
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.250
search for my name and find my work there.

743
00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:23.489
Great. So, Doctor Hoyt, uh thank you so much

744
00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:25.489
