9
00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.149
Thank you for having me.

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.170
So let's start reps uh uh talking a little

11
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.529
bit about yourself. So what kind of content do

12
00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:38.009
you create and how did you get into it?

13
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.869
Um, WELL, I've actually been a sex worker, um,

14
00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.919
all of my adult life, so I didn't exactly

15
00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:49.380
start doing content, uh, creation to, uh, I did

16
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.919
like phone sex right before that, and I did

17
00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.279
do, uh, it was Snapchat. I, I did do

18
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:57.950
the OnlyFans before the pandemic, but then during the

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.299
pandemic. I heavily focused on it, but I originally

20
00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.199
started, um, exotic dancing when I first was 18,

21
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:09.779
you know, and, and, uh, done other stuff, yeah,

22
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
so it wasn't, uh, I've been a sex worker

23
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.419
my entire adult life.

24
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.910
OK, uh, OK, but what got you then into

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.769
sex work and then perhaps you can tell us

26
00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:22.790
about the different kinds of sex work you've done.

27
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.230
Um, I had a child at a young age,

28
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.889
and so, uh, I had to support her. The

29
00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:32.690
father abandoned me, and it was very, you know,

30
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.989
the father just, he refused to help me whatsoever,

31
00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:39.449
and I'm he didn't, yeah, he didn't take responsibility,

32
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.930
so the responsibility was put on me. I did

33
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.339
work. Um, IN the US, uh, I lived in

34
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.500
the state of Florida, and Florida does not help

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.730
you. Every state in the United States is different,

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.339
um, when it comes to welfare, and Florida is

37
00:01:54.339 --> 00:02:00.339
a very, um, Christian, uh, conservative state where, uh,

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.860
they don't really, they want you to have the

39
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.819
baby. They don't really like, uh, want, you know,

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.080
so I had my child. But they don't really

41
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.070
help you, uh, financially with like the welfare so

42
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.729
much. So it's pretty much on the woman's own.

43
00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.270
So I had to do something and where I

44
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.029
lived in Tampa, Florida, they had exotic dancing, and

45
00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.229
I knew that, um, because I did have a

46
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.199
regular job, I, um, right after 16, I was

47
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.429
going to school and I was working a waitressing

48
00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.479
job, but it wasn't enough money. So I turned

49
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.520
to exotic dancing because I could make cash and

50
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.119
that could support me and my child. So that's

51
00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.039
how I turned to, yeah, sex work.

52
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.190
And and then how did you get then, uh,

53
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.729
tell us more about how you got into OnlyFans

54
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.199
and the kind of content you create

55
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.320
there. OK, so during the pandemic, you know, everybody,

56
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.770
like they had to do something because it just,

57
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.440
that, that was just the way, but before it

58
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.279
ran before it transitioned, um, because I had always

59
00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.389
done some form. Of sex work. It was, you

60
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.779
know, whether it was domination, whether it was dancing

61
00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.229
or whatever. And um at that point, the pandemic

62
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.029
happened and I had to do something to pay

63
00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.149
the rent at the time I was living in

64
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.990
New York. The rent was very, very expensive and

65
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.830
uh I think my rent was like 3500 and

66
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.190
I was living right in Manhattan and uh I

67
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.550
was already doing it. And so, and then my

68
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.309
daughter was in uh Uh, college at the time

69
00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.990
and, uh, so I just, I had to jump

70
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.830
and work even harder and get on only, you

71
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.229
know, got on OnlyFans and it took advantage at

72
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.070
the time when everybody was out so. And because

73
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.229
I already was, had the experience of dealing with

74
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.589
sex work, that's when I got on it. And

75
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.910
it was, I gave more of a personal experience

76
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.289
by doing um more video calls than anything else,

77
00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.229
where it was one on one. And that's, I

78
00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.589
sold mostly video calls or custom videos to individual

79
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.309
men. Yeah, so that was my favorite thing to

80
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.149
do, um, then then, uh, then I started doing

81
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:09.929
more collabs with other creators.

82
00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.669
OK, so let me ask you because this is

83
00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.269
something that many times when for example, people are

84
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.910
debating with sex workers, I know that different sex

85
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.390
workers have different kinds of experiences in sex work

86
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.850
and doing different kinds of sex work, of course,

87
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:31.540
but it's very easily the case that people accuse.

88
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.200
Sex workers are not really liking what they do,

89
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.839
that they only do it because of the money,

90
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.589
because of this and that, but I mean, uh,

91
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.799
in your specific case, is it just because of

92
00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:49.760
financial necessities, just because of the money or do

93
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.190
you also like what you do?

94
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.230
You know what I did, I did do it

95
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.399
because that's what it brought me there, you know,

96
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.630
it, it honestly did bring me there because of

97
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.470
the financial circumstance, but I do enjoy it. There's

98
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.350
many years of when I dance, I honestly can

99
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.350
say I enjoyed it, but there's different aspects where

100
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.230
I don't enjoy it. What I didn't enjoy about

101
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.910
dancing was the way the management treated me, but

102
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.940
I enjoyed it. I really, really enjoy. Talking to

103
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.700
different customers, clients, fans, um, I enjoy that interaction

104
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.140
with my fans. When I was in the clubs,

105
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.619
I did enjoy the management, the way they treated

106
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.660
us. Um, THE thing with OnlyFans is, again, I

107
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.459
enjoy doing the video calls. I enjoy the interaction

108
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:38.320
with the fans. What I don't enjoy is the,

109
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.339
how it got so sensationalized and it got to

110
00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.920
be too, you know, everybody's doing it and now.

111
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.920
You know, you've got too many people jumping in

112
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.649
and not, you know, taking it and changing it

113
00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:53.329
up, and then too many people when too many

114
00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:55.809
hands are in there doing things that are hurting

115
00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:58.089
other sex workers. So, and that's where it gets

116
00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.269
kind of complicated.

117
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.540
But by it getting more sensationalized, what do you

118
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.350
mean by that? Um,

119
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.649
YOU get people that never were in sex work

120
00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:10.130
and all of a sudden, you know, manage people

121
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.769
are becoming managers, AKA pimps, and they're running management

122
00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:18.309
companies and They're doing different practices and, and just

123
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:22.309
taking advantage of sex workers and trying to profit

124
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:24.660
off off sex workers. So that's the part that

125
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.489
I don't like. And it's, and again, it goes

126
00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:29.019
back to when people, when I work like in

127
00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:31.019
the strip clubs and you have managers where all

128
00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:33.429
of a sudden they start fining girls or they

129
00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:37.209
start, you know, trying to Somehow like pimp them,

130
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.649
manage it, manage them, and take advantage of that.

131
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.440
That's the part that I don't enjoy, you know,

132
00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:44.450
or anybody where they're trying to take advantage of

133
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.769
the sex workers, and that's what happens. But overall,

134
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.369
like, you know, I did love, I, I did

135
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:52.130
love the freedom that I had when I did

136
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.480
dance because I was able to raise my daughter.

137
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.850
I was able to provide for her. She went

138
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.570
to college, she finished, um, that was the part

139
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.130
that was good. I, you know, I have two

140
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.970
children and I was able to provide, I. I

141
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.970
went to college myself. I don't have any debt.

142
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.890
I don't have any loans. Um, YOU know, a

143
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.690
lot of people in America have, uh, loans and

144
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.410
debts, and I was able to take very good

145
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.970
care of my children. Um, I, I did it

146
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.250
when my second child. I didn't get any child

147
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.529
support, so I raised her without having any child

148
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.769
support whatsoever. Um, SO that, that was the good

149
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:30.910
thing, but it, it, sex work is not for

150
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.760
everyone. And, and, um, I think in the mainstream

151
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.600
media, you see these articles where, oh, this person

152
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.429
made this amount of money, but they're not telling

153
00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:41.790
you the full truth in the full scope. And

154
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.359
I think that could be bad for society because

155
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.119
it, it's really for the strong. You have to

156
00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:50.559
go in not having addictions also, and that's a

157
00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:51.440
whole different ballgame.

158
00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:57.160
Uh, WHAT kind of addictions, addictions to alcohol, drugs,

159
00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:00.070
or are you talking about other kinds of addictions?

160
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.730
Um, I think honestly, like you have, um, the

161
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.170
more sober I am, the better I was like

162
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.160
when I dance, um, you know, and same thing,

163
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:13.760
I feel like it, I, I just feel like,

164
00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:16.850
um, you, your mind has to be really straight

165
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.450
and you have to be comfortable doing sex work.

166
00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:23.200
That is how I feel personally, um. And I

167
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.940
always was sober because I was raising a child.

168
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.200
And um it didn't bother me. Mentally, it did

169
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.359
not, you know, nothing bothered me, and I feel

170
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:34.058
like that's what's important. Some people that I did

171
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:38.320
um dance with earlier, it mentally bothered them. And

172
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.359
I feel like if, if, if something is gonna

173
00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.640
bother you, and you're gonna do it, whether you're

174
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.880
gonna be doing OnlyFans, whether you're gonna be dancing,

175
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960
whether you're gonna be doing in-person work, you shouldn't,

176
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.390
you shouldn't go into it. You shouldn't go into.

177
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.330
I know I could never be a nurse or

178
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.770
a doctor, and I know I, I can't go

179
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.010
there, you know, mentally I could not handle that.

180
00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.789
So it's, it's not for the weak.

181
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.250
And, and so what kinds of traits do you

182
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.210
think that women particularly should have, uh, to be

183
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.250
successful doing sex work and uh for them to

184
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.729
like doing it?

185
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.630
Um, I have a girlfriend, and to me she's

186
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.809
the best porn star ever. Her name's Ava Devine,

187
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.869
and, um, she is, you know who she is,

188
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.150
like he's, yeah, yeah, so she is absolutely, I

189
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.270
mean,

190
00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:32.429
I also follow your podcast, so I

191
00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:32.630
know

192
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.669
that.

193
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.070
Oh, OK. I always talk about my best friend

194
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.710
because to me in my eyes she's the best

195
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.030
porn star in the world, and, um, she is

196
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.489
absolutely the most sexual woman alive. And if I

197
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:46.349
was gonna give the award for the best porn

198
00:09:46.349 --> 00:09:48.700
star, it would be her. And she is the

199
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.979
ideal woman that should be a porn star, and

200
00:09:51.979 --> 00:09:56.250
she's a very beautiful woman to know. And She

201
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.710
is You have to be naturally sexy and want

202
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.510
the sex and enjoy the sex, and that is

203
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.789
the model of a true porn star. So to

204
00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:09.929
me, if anybody knows her personally, she is the,

205
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.349
the, the model star of the porn star, and

206
00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:16.429
that is. That's how you have to be, you

207
00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:18.669
know, and it's too many people, it, it, it's,

208
00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:21.380
it's for her, it's definitely not about the money,

209
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.289
you know, um, it, that is the true model

210
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:27.030
of it. Me, I know that, um, I am

211
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.950
not as comfortable as she is, so therefore, you

212
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.950
know, you can't get your ass out of the

213
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.549
kitchen if you can't take the heat. So that's

214
00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:37.070
why I never worked for a production company, but

215
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.929
somebody like her, you know what I'm saying, that

216
00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:45.020
deserves the Avian. Of the century, that's what Ava

217
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.640
Devine deserves. Um, BUT she, uh, that's the type

218
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.359
of person that should go into, you know, because

219
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.859
they enjoy sex so much.

220
00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:57.380
Yeah, I mean, I was uh thinking when preparing

221
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.659
our conversation and also because of other talks I

222
00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:04.820
have on the show, not with sex workers necessarily,

223
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.929
but people who have done work on pornography, psychologists,

224
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.099
and so on, people like that, and I was

225
00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:14.260
thinking about perhaps some traits that would be,

226
00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:17.119
well, everybody's different, yeah, well, for porn star, I

227
00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:20.539
always say give her for dominatrix it's different. You

228
00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:23.510
have to be like a dominant woman. Every form

229
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.510
of sex work is so different. I, I enjoy,

230
00:11:26.609 --> 00:11:29.869
I love, I, I always identify as a, an

231
00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:33.359
ex, uh, stripper. So I love being a stripper.

232
00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:35.510
And, and, um, I wish I could have been

233
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.510
a stripper forever. So I, I identify as an

234
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.650
ex-stripper for life, you know, give me that award.

235
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.159
Yeah,

236
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.760
yeah, but I mean I was thinking since you

237
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.239
mentioned, of course, the sex part which uh I

238
00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:52.840
mean, is part of the job, right? I mean,

239
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.559
I guess

240
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:54.770
not for all sex work,

241
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.400
yeah, not, not yeah, yeah, no, that that's totally

242
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.440
right, but uh let me just say that at

243
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.020
least for people who do pornography, for example, or

244
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.000
escorts and people like that, I mean, I guess

245
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.729
that it's. Easier if they are if they score

246
00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:16.239
high on sociosexuality because it's easier for people who

247
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.150
score high on that trait to have sex that

248
00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:24.340
that it doesn't involve necessarily any attachment or emotion

249
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.059
or something like that,

250
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.539
right, right, and that's something they have, they, you

251
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.460
have to be a, I have that though where

252
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.340
I can have sex and not be attached. I

253
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.979
do have that, but the thing is with the

254
00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:41.799
pornography, I just feel like it's a special. THE

255
00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:46.859
porn is just so, um, it's, it's, it's like

256
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.500
um the Meryl Meryl Streak. Of, you have to

257
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.380
be such a good performer, you know what I'm

258
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.369
saying? You know, you have Meryl Streep, who's a

259
00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:59.380
wonderful actress, and when it comes to porn, it

260
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.650
has to be that true gift of being that

261
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.859
true performer. I've interviewed so many porn stars that

262
00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:08.979
I know, I just know, like I can see

263
00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:11.400
it, and I, I could feel it. There's um,

264
00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:15.219
uh, uh, a, a new girl that's out. She's

265
00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:18.119
right, I think she, she's, maybe she's out, Cherie.

266
00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:19.909
I have to look her up, but there's a,

267
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.340
a new performer out that I think is, she's

268
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.820
got it in her too. Um, BUT I could

269
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.979
just, I know that when I see that foreign

270
00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:29.299
performer, like, I'm like, she's got it, she's got

271
00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:29.700
it.

272
00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:33.000
Yeah, I mean, let me, let me ask you

273
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.299
just out of of curiosity, you mentioned Ava Devine.

274
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:40.320
Um, BEFORE getting into sex work, I mean, were

275
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.679
you influenced by anyone or did you look up

276
00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:46.479
to anyone? I mean, do you have any role

277
00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:48.820
models in sex work or

278
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.159
pornography? Yeah, um, well, for Dom, dominatrix, Miss Tara

279
00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:56.539
Indiana, um, I look up to her very much,

280
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.830
uh, for Dom. Um, MY good friend Brittany Andrews,

281
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.320
to me, she's the smartest. Um, SEX worker, one

282
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.520
of the smartest, this woman is just a genius.

283
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.239
You need to have her on your show. She's,

284
00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:13.599
she's a genius. Um, SO she's somebody I look

285
00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.429
up to, and I'm very, and she's,

286
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.760
she's been doing it for a while

287
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.760
now. Oh yeah, yeah, she, she's probably longer than

288
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.280
I, probably a couple of years longer than I

289
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.280
have. She's this, to know this woman, she's a

290
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.969
pure genius. Um, Genius, you know, some of the

291
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:35.090
smartest women I know are sex workers. Um Yeah,

292
00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:38.679
no, I totally believe that. Look, just, uh, uh,

293
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.729
just to tell you a story here from Portugal,

294
00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:45.799
I mean, back in October we had our, uh,

295
00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:49.409
local municipal elections and maybe you're thinking, oh, where

296
00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:51.969
are you going with this because that has nothing

297
00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:54.890
to do with sex work, but actually it, it

298
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.903
has something to do with it because uh. In

299
00:14:57.903 --> 00:15:02.182
one of the municipalities there was a woman who

300
00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:05.862
was a candidate for president, for president or at

301
00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:10.603
least for assembly, and she had an OnlyFans account

302
00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:15.583
and people started making fun of that and assuming

303
00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:19.182
that just because she was an adult content creator

304
00:15:19.182 --> 00:15:23.435
she wouldn't be. Intelligent enough or competent enough or

305
00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:26.036
something like that and, and I was just like,

306
00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:29.236
really, I mean, you're assuming that I mean you

307
00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:30.036
don't know enough.

308
00:15:30.106 --> 00:15:32.356
Yeah, people get very ignorant, but it's a lot

309
00:15:32.356 --> 00:15:35.356
of work to maintain those pages. It's not very,

310
00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.515
it's, it's a lot, you know how it is

311
00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:41.145
if you have a podcast. It's to, to, to

312
00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:44.849
get back and forth and, and. Booking the guests

313
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:46.489
and uh because you booked the guests just like

314
00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.330
I booked the guests and it's it's detailed and

315
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:48.739
then you have to do

316
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.599
I I do I do it all alone so

317
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.929
yeah yeah I find it's better when you do

318
00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:56.820
book the guests. By yourself because I dealt with

319
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.580
a producer for a short period of time and,

320
00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.130
and I was like, oh no, I need to

321
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.020
do this myself because it's, it's, it's, it's intense,

322
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.229
you know, yeah.

323
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.940
Yeah, but, but, but I mean, Ava Devine, Brittany

324
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.299
Andrews, anyone else you went there,

325
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.340
um, Tara Indiana, and then there was another woman,

326
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.440
and she's out of the business, and this woman

327
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.770
is top of the chain, um, Mercedes Ashley. That

328
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.359
woman, she's Puerto Rican, like I'm half Puerto Rican,

329
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.440
half Cuban, but she, I used to do bachelor

330
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.010
parties with her. This woman was ahead of her

331
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:35.010
time monetizing content, um, and just, she now does,

332
00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:38.979
um, she works with computers. She was just genius,

333
00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:43.750
like. She was so smart, where before OnlyFans come

334
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.229
out, she already had a website going on and

335
00:16:46.229 --> 00:16:50.750
was monetizing content and she was just, oh my

336
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.750
gosh. So that those are the women that I

337
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.690
have to give it to that are all um

338
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.150
very, very smart. Brittany Andrews is, is just a

339
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.510
genius with business and everything she gets her hands

340
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.430
into, you know what I'm saying, uh, yeah, yeah.

341
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.959
Yeah, I, I, I mean, uh, maybe we'll come

342
00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:13.569
back to that when we, when I ask you

343
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:18.890
about your podcast, but let me just, um, run

344
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.010
through you some of the arguments that people who

345
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.020
are against pornography or sex work more generally. Uh,

346
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.089
USE, uh, against sex workers. I mean, uh, uh,

347
00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:34.589
first of all, people who are against pornography assume

348
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.599
that women, women work in it must have or

349
00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:42.349
must all have psychological issues, like for example, past

350
00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:46.369
trauma or have been the victims of sexual violence

351
00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:49.594
or having grown in a father. Less home or

352
00:17:49.594 --> 00:17:53.714
being addicted to substances like alcohol or drugs. I

353
00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:56.785
mean, where do you think those assumptions come from,

354
00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:59.035
and do you think they have any basis in

355
00:17:59.035 --> 00:17:59.125
reality

356
00:17:59.125 --> 00:18:01.474
it's pure ignorance because I grew up with a

357
00:18:01.474 --> 00:18:03.755
father and my father was very involved with my

358
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:06.354
life, you know, my father passed away in 2019.

359
00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:10.930
He was always like involved. In my life, he

360
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.750
knew what my father knew what I, um, and

361
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.319
part of the reason I never got into work

362
00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:19.170
with a porn production company was because of my

363
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.630
father, um, and I, you know, um. And I,

364
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.810
that's the one, the one that really irks me.

365
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.239
People are like, oh, you, you don't know your

366
00:18:29.239 --> 00:18:31.770
father or whatever. No, my dad was involved and

367
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.819
I had a very masculine father, um. So that

368
00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:40.170
one I don't get. That's just pure ignorance, um,

369
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:42.699
in itself. I just was in a circumstance that

370
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:44.180
I was young, that I had a child at

371
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.380
a young age, and I needed to provide, and

372
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.979
I was in a state that did not really

373
00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:54.780
support things. And right now with the way the

374
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.739
economy is in the United States, there's a lot

375
00:18:56.739 --> 00:18:59.500
of people that are struggling, not making ends meet,

376
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.979
and this is why in the US the birth

377
00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:04.680
rate is declining. So people can't afford to have

378
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.750
children. And, you know, that in my, my generation,

379
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.339
there was a lot of teen pregnancies. So what

380
00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:15.420
did a woman, so a lot of women do

381
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.900
during that time is they turned to exotic dancing

382
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.319
in my era. Yeah

383
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.390
Yeah, uh, but and I mean when it comes

384
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.489
to the bit about people assuming that, uh, porn

385
00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:33.209
stars or sex workers in general must have been

386
00:19:33.209 --> 00:19:36.329
the victims of sexual violence of some kind, it's

387
00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:40.770
interesting because there's a study from 2012. I mean,

388
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.355
I read it indirectly because it was. A post

389
00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:48.615
on psychology today written by Gata, he's an evolutionary

390
00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:52.235
psychologist, and in that study, in that study, they

391
00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:57.456
studied 177 porn stars and compared them to the

392
00:19:57.456 --> 00:20:00.395
same number of women from the general population. And

393
00:20:00.395 --> 00:20:04.056
when it comes to a past of sexual violence,

394
00:20:04.176 --> 00:20:09.222
actually it's not. Statistically, the difference is not statistically

395
00:20:09.222 --> 00:20:13.862
significant because the numbers they came to were 29%

396
00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:17.411
of women from the general population had been the

397
00:20:17.411 --> 00:20:20.901
victims of sexual violence and the porn stars was

398
00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:22.862
around 36%.

399
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:25.261
So I wonder where they're getting their data. I

400
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.102
wonder where they're getting their data because I've noticed

401
00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.880
that um. I don't know, I just wonder where

402
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.239
they get their data cause I can't really, yeah.

403
00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:34.920
Uh, uh, I mean, it's just, of course, I'm

404
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.160
not sure to what extent those 177 porn stars

405
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.560
were really representative or not. I mean, you know,

406
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.239
it always depends a little bit on the kind

407
00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:49.439
of, uh, sample of people you have,

408
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.089
right, yeah. Yeah, I could just, I can only

409
00:20:53.089 --> 00:20:54.800
speak for myself, like, you know.

410
00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:58.329
Mhm. I, I mean, uh, and you don't have,

411
00:20:58.439 --> 00:21:00.750
uh, any of that, or, or do you?

412
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.579
Um, SO you said I, my father was in

413
00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:07.630
my life, um. You know, what else was it

414
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.170
they said, uh,

415
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.089
uh, they, they talk about things like trauma, sexual

416
00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:16.449
violence, being addicted to alcohol or

417
00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:19.810
drugs. No, um, I've done drugs, but I never

418
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.219
was. I don't have an addictive personality, so I

419
00:21:23.219 --> 00:21:25.449
could, I've been, anything I've ever done, I've been

420
00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:27.449
able to put down. So I've never had, and

421
00:21:27.449 --> 00:21:28.680
because I had a child at a young age,

422
00:21:28.729 --> 00:21:31.890
I didn't even drink or really drive because my

423
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.510
responsibility was with my child.

424
00:21:33.729 --> 00:21:34.869
So yeah,

425
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:35.660
yeah.

426
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:38.369
No, I, I mean, in that sense, in that

427
00:21:38.369 --> 00:21:41.170
sense, I'm like you, I can never get addicted

428
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.410
to it.

429
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:44.180
Yeah, I've never been addicted. I, I, I'm fortunate,

430
00:21:44.329 --> 00:21:47.069
you know, fortunate that I don't have that addictive.

431
00:21:48.469 --> 00:21:50.170
Gene, you know, I

432
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.069
do know of psychology, yeah,

433
00:21:52.189 --> 00:21:54.609
I don't have that. Some people have it, um,

434
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.569
but I personally didn't, you know what I'm saying.

435
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.910
But I also, I had to grow up, so

436
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.229
my circumstance was different. So, you know, like I

437
00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:06.949
said, I can only speak for myself. Each, each

438
00:22:06.949 --> 00:22:09.239
individual sex worker is different the way they've handled

439
00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:11.239
things. So that's, yeah,

440
00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:14.479
it's a matter of people. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

441
00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:17.359
yeah, sure, uh, I mean, uh, for example, last

442
00:22:17.359 --> 00:22:20.670
year I interviewed Gerald Mosley. He's, he was a,

443
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.119
or he's a former general attorney from California and

444
00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:27.359
he wrote a very interesting book, Sex Workers and

445
00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:29.920
The Clients in Their Own Words, and he took

446
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.359
the time to really interview sex workers and so

447
00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:36.640
on. And I mean, the point of his book

448
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.755
was really to show. People that not all sex

449
00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:44.765
workers approach their work or think about their work

450
00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:47.364
the same way, you know, so some of them

451
00:22:47.364 --> 00:22:51.324
might have more negative experiences, others might have more

452
00:22:51.324 --> 00:22:55.045
positive experiences, so it, it was really to show

453
00:22:55.045 --> 00:22:59.045
people that the kinds of generalizations that they make

454
00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:02.185
about sex workers don't really stick.

455
00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:05.484
Right, yeah, no, exactly, and a lot of sex

456
00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:06.925
work can benefit and help people.

457
00:23:08.209 --> 00:23:10.770
Yeah, in what ways? Tell us a little about,

458
00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:11.050
um,

459
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.569
you know, a lot of society seems to forget

460
00:23:13.569 --> 00:23:18.569
about people that are, um, disabled, um, or people

461
00:23:18.569 --> 00:23:21.949
that are like mentally challenged, and that's a whole

462
00:23:21.949 --> 00:23:26.000
society that, you know, all that just gets neglected,

463
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.530
and they have, you know, needs too, sexual needs,

464
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.609
or just they want to have, you know, conversation

465
00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:35.739
with people. You know what I mean, in sex

466
00:23:35.739 --> 00:23:38.979
work, it doesn't mean it's penetrative sex, you, you

467
00:23:38.979 --> 00:23:40.930
know what I'm saying? Like it, it, it, it

468
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.500
could be, um, I, for instance, I do a

469
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.180
lot of phone, phone sex, and I do, and

470
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.150
it doesn't mean that they're jerking off the whole

471
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.829
time. It, a lot of times it's just simple

472
00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:52.479
conversations and it's the intimacy of talking to somebody.

473
00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:57.489
And people, you know, are needing that intimacy of,

474
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.300
you know, just talking to people in, in society,

475
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.300
you know, it's hard. It's hard for men to

476
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.680
date and relate to other people. And that's where

477
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.939
sex work can be beneficial for people, you know,

478
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.020
when men get divorced and instead of dating right

479
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.020
away, there comes that stage where they're kind of

480
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.800
confused, and they're just not really ready to date

481
00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:18.939
that moment, and that's where sex work can be

482
00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:19.680
beneficial for men.

483
00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:24.079
OK, so let me ask you this then, because

484
00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:27.810
interestingly, just recently I did an interview and it's

485
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.130
already on the channel with Olivia Bentley, you had

486
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.729
her on your show as well, and, and, and

487
00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:36.290
I mean, one of the comments I got on

488
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.270
the video was someone saying, OK, I'm not going

489
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.250
to go through all of his arguments here, but

490
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.270
it was a guy uh accusing sex workers of

491
00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:51.165
only being able to. Make so much money because

492
00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:55.564
they are taking advantage of vulnerable men. I mean

493
00:24:55.564 --> 00:24:58.525
men that have emotional needs, sexual needs, and so

494
00:24:58.525 --> 00:24:58.885
on. Yeah,

495
00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:02.324
but this is the, you know, you know what's

496
00:25:02.324 --> 00:25:05.155
taking advantage of women is when men go on

497
00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:08.405
dating apps and they're not really ready to commit,

498
00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:11.505
but they will use women for their own validation

499
00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:14.045
and they will lie just so they could sleep

500
00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:16.765
with them and pretend and instead of them going

501
00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.319
to therapy. You get what I'm saying? So I'd

502
00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:23.000
rather, um, to me, a man is more emotionally

503
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.319
available when he knows, hey, I'm not ready to

504
00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:27.760
commit. So why don't I go see a sex

505
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.079
worker so that way, you know, I know I'm

506
00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:33.760
not ready mentally, right? This is a man that's

507
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.760
emotionally available. Let me see a sex worker. Let

508
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.520
me just, I have needs, sexual needs, or I

509
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.680
need the validation, see the sex worker, pay for

510
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.359
it rather than waste a woman's time. Yeah, Think

511
00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:51.280
about that, OK, because we've got men out here

512
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.140
that will go on apps, waste a woman's time.

513
00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:58.469
And what about that? Nobody talks about that. But

514
00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:00.709
they've got an issue when a woman gets paid.

515
00:26:01.069 --> 00:26:01.849
It doesn't make sense.

516
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.589
And sometimes guys even trick women on those kinds

517
00:26:06.589 --> 00:26:09.270
of apps. And I mean there's, for example, there

518
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:13.670
are, for example, cases of men taking money from

519
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.670
women, tricking them into giving them money, and then

520
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.530
just Uh,

521
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.510
so we deal with men that are narcissists. We

522
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.359
deal with men that have avoidance. We deal with

523
00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:25.079
men with different things that they're trying, you know,

524
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.760
they go on these apps and women are going

525
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.719
to apps thinking they're ready for a relationship where

526
00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:32.079
these men have these issues. And meanwhile, these men

527
00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:34.400
go, Oh, I don't hire sex worker. I don't

528
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.959
hire, you know, I, I don't pay for escorts.

529
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.880
I don't pay. Those are the men that have

530
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.660
issues. You know what I'm saying, uh, and I've

531
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.020
noticed through the years, the men that do pay

532
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.380
are more, they got stuff to do during the

533
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.410
week. They don't have time. They're too busy focused

534
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.939
in on their job. They're too busy focusing on

535
00:26:53.939 --> 00:26:57.219
their kids. These men that are seeking validation because

536
00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:00.699
they want to feel like they got issues, you

537
00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:03.520
understand? Like, because they just need that high for

538
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.699
themselves, you know, and meanwhile, they're wasting women's time.

539
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.770
Yeah, Think about it. So the woman thinks she's

540
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.089
gonna get into a relationship. Meanwhile, the guy is

541
00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:15.520
just He, you know what I'm saying? And then

542
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.670
meanwhile, we also have men that are going to

543
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.719
other countries like Colombia, because they're like, oh, this

544
00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:23.520
is US men that do it, by the way.

545
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.520
US men that will go, oh, the American women

546
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.439
are so terrible. Oh, they won't settle down, they

547
00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:31.359
won't think. So they go to other countries like

548
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.000
Colombia, and then they get robbed. And they're wondering,

549
00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:37.040
oh, why am I getting robbed? Well, you didn't

550
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.310
get therapy. You didn't get. You know what I'm

551
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.349
saying? But meanwhile, if you just would have hired

552
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:43.949
a sex worker, you would have saved money on

553
00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:47.530
your trip, getting robbed, and everything else.

554
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.920
Yeah, right, yeah, I mean, do you, to what,

555
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.040
to what extent do you know your fans? I

556
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.319
mean, do you know their lives? I mean, what

557
00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:02.000
kind of fans do you have?

558
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.359
I have a lot of loyal people, um, that

559
00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:07.560
have been coming to me for years. I have,

560
00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:11.959
there's one person that I've, that, um, I've been

561
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:18.469
dealing with since 2012. Um, Yeah, so I've, I've,

562
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.199
uh, there's a lot of people very loyal to

563
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:22.520
me. Very loyal, yeah,

564
00:28:23.069 --> 00:28:25.119
yeah, but, but I mean, do, do you get

565
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:28.719
the sense that, um, I, I mean, what is

566
00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:30.839
the type of fan that you tend to have?

567
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.300
Do you have, for example, um, married men, couples,

568
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.380
single men,

569
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.040
believe it or not, um, I get a lot

570
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.449
of single guys, majority single guys, OK, um, over

571
00:28:46.449 --> 00:28:49.479
married men. I have had married men through the

572
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:53.160
years. They, um, I've noticed this trend. A lot

573
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.119
of guys are very faithful. Believe it or not,

574
00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:58.280
I've noticed this because when I've dealt with single

575
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.189
guys, they'll disappear and then they'll come back and

576
00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:02.640
I'll be like, hey, where'd you go? And they'll

577
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.479
tell, they'll tell me the guy had a girlfriend

578
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.709
and I didn't, I didn't want to cheat. And

579
00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:09.380
they feel like even though they were seeing me,

580
00:29:09.469 --> 00:29:11.719
they were, you know, and, and these are guys

581
00:29:11.719 --> 00:29:14.189
online. This was crazy. We're, we're doing video calls

582
00:29:14.189 --> 00:29:16.219
or we're doing phone sex, and they'll be like,

583
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.109
I, I felt like I was cheating. And I'm

584
00:29:18.109 --> 00:29:19.780
like, but we're not even seeing each other in

585
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.310
person. So, um, I do get a lot of,

586
00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:27.560
you know, I have a very loyal, um, and

587
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.790
I get a lot of gifts from fans. Um,

588
00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:34.839
I currently have, um, an online sub, submissive, that

589
00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:38.800
helps me out. Um, HE, he runs, uh, like

590
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.079
an IG for me that's dedicated to me, so

591
00:29:42.079 --> 00:29:44.760
I have a, a submissive that's like full time,

592
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.319
um, online sub that takes care of stuff for

593
00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:50.949
me, um, with my Facebook and everything. So, um,

594
00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:55.180
yeah, predominantly everybody I that I deal with is,

595
00:29:55.719 --> 00:29:58.449
and of course because I'm. I've gotten older now.

596
00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:02.489
Most majority are younger. My guys have been younger,

597
00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:04.959
except for the one guy from 2012, he's older.

598
00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:09.770
Of course that's that I've known since and what

599
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.949
you also. Uh,

600
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.229
I, I also asked you about that because interestingly,

601
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.579
there's been research on the kinds of men that

602
00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:22.229
tend to use OnlyFans. I mean, research by people

603
00:30:22.229 --> 00:30:26.189
like, for example, Stacy Lipton and Mary Lipman, and,

604
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.500
uh, interestingly, people tend to have this idea that

605
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:34.150
this very common idea that it's a men, it's

606
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:39.234
men who are uh vulnerable and Employed in cells

607
00:30:39.234 --> 00:30:42.354
and so on that use only fans, but no,

608
00:30:42.435 --> 00:30:46.175
actually a very big proportion of men who use

609
00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:51.275
only fans are in relationships and they have good

610
00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:53.354
jobs and so on. So I mean in a

611
00:30:53.354 --> 00:30:56.074
sense, it makes sense because I mean those are

612
00:30:56.074 --> 00:30:59.194
the men who have money to pay for OnlyFans.

613
00:30:59.305 --> 00:31:01.275
I don't just use OnlyFans. I also use a

614
00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:03.655
site named Sex Panther, and I'll be honest, like.

615
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:09.050
Um There's a couple guys that are like fans

616
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.069
of mine that have came back that look better

617
00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:14.300
than like, cause like it was one guy I

618
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.660
dated, like, that looked better than guys that I've

619
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.839
dated in person. There was like a couple of

620
00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:21.680
guys that I'm like, whoa, they're hot, they look

621
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.459
better than guys that I've dated. And I'm like,

622
00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:27.060
So I've like, I have some fans that look

623
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.689
like really, really hot, that I like get nervous

624
00:31:29.689 --> 00:31:32.650
I'm, yeah, like one guy I was like, whoa,

625
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.250
you are like, yeah, so I, I have some

626
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:36.890
hot ones.

627
00:31:37.719 --> 00:31:41.640
Yeah, good. So, yeah, uh, let, let me, let

628
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.099
me ask you then. I mean, do you identify

629
00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:47.130
or do you have anything to do at all,

630
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.000
or, or are you interested in feminism? Do you

631
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.579
identify as a feminist at all or not?

632
00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:57.880
Um, I, I do, um, for for because I

633
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.400
do have daughters, you know, and I want them

634
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.939
to, I want. You know, I want us to

635
00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:06.430
keep our rights, of course, yeah, sure, yeah, sure,

636
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.069
I don't want him took it away in America.

637
00:32:08.109 --> 00:32:09.650
It's getting kind of scary over here.

638
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.119
No, you know, I'm asking you that because, uh,

639
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.069
sex work actually is an issue that many times

640
00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:22.839
divides feminists. There are feminist, sex positive feminists in

641
00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.060
favor of sex work and sex negative,

642
00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:29.369
yeah, yeah, yeah, the swerves, yeah, yeah, yeah,

643
00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:33.589
yeah, and so I mean some of these um.

644
00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:38.780
Assumptions and accusations people make of sex workers that

645
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.189
we've talked about and are going, and I'm going

646
00:32:41.189 --> 00:32:44.239
to run through you some more in a bit,

647
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.199
uh, I mean, are the same things that um

648
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.939
feminists who are against sex work say, but then

649
00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:55.920
you also have sex workers who are feminists themselves,

650
00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:59.479
so. Mhm. Yeah, so I, I mean, one of

651
00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:01.479
the things they say, one of the things that

652
00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:05.439
feminists that are against sex work say is that

653
00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:11.439
sex work is never a choice, that that, yeah,

654
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.319
that women only do it under coercion or under

655
00:33:15.319 --> 00:33:18.560
or if they are financially destitute or something like

656
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.280
that. I mean, what, what do you make of

657
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:20.680
that?

658
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:25.119
Oh, that's false, that's false. But society, I will

659
00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:28.260
say this though. More people need to give former

660
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.349
sex workers a chance for employment though, because sometimes

661
00:33:31.349 --> 00:33:34.339
it's other people, it's those people that are, it's

662
00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:37.579
the feminate, the swerves that don't give us opportunity

663
00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:41.099
sometimes that they will judge. You know, instead of

664
00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:43.540
it won't give us chances. There's people that will

665
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.489
like uh discriminate. I'm very open to who I

666
00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:49.369
am and what I've done, and I'm not ashamed,

667
00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:53.699
but I have encountered people that will. Judge, you

668
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:57.260
know, um, and, and, you know, it, it, it

669
00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:00.410
give us opportunity to. You don't like it, but

670
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.380
don't discriminate.

671
00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:02.859
You

672
00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:03.020
know,

673
00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:06.849
I get this idea that because of what I

674
00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:10.300
hear from women in general who are against sex

675
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.139
work, but also sometimes from some of those feminists,

676
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.679
I get this, the idea or the impression that

677
00:34:16.938 --> 00:34:21.438
many of these women only are against sex work,

678
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.458
uh I mean they are specifically against sex work

679
00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:29.260
for females because there are also, even though in.

680
00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:33.850
Smaller numbers also male sex workers, but they are

681
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.370
against sex work for females because they look at

682
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:42.668
sex workers being them porn stars or escorts or

683
00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:47.208
others because they look at them as a competition.

684
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.850
I mean if they have a partner

685
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:48.879
they're

686
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:48.889
married

687
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:53.330
it's competition, but also, yes, it's competition I've noticed,

688
00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:55.728
but also because they feel like they can't do

689
00:34:55.728 --> 00:34:58.219
it. And there's a difference.

690
00:34:58.739 --> 00:34:59.919
What do you mean by that?

691
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.489
Um, YOU know what, the best, the best compliment

692
00:35:03.489 --> 00:35:05.929
I ever got from somebody that was not a

693
00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:08.939
sex worker, they go. I wish I could do

694
00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:10.620
it, but the only reason I don't do it

695
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.620
is my mother would get up from a wheelchair

696
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.739
and beat my, you know, it would beat me

697
00:35:14.739 --> 00:35:17.459
silly. And I thought that was the best compliment

698
00:35:17.459 --> 00:35:19.659
because the woman, she, she gave me props for

699
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:21.250
doing it, but she said, I wouldn't do it.

700
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.889
I'm scared to do it because my mother would

701
00:35:22.889 --> 00:35:24.540
come out of the way, and I, uh, and

702
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.489
I, and, and I appreciated her saying the truth.

703
00:35:27.899 --> 00:35:31.409
But honestly, it, like I told you, I, I,

704
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.060
I personally would never feel comfortable doing porn, but

705
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.350
I am not gonna discriminate. To a porn star

706
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.149
and be like, oh, I don't do it. I

707
00:35:39.149 --> 00:35:42.070
just know that I, I, I wouldn't be as

708
00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.189
good as my friend, so I'm not gonna get

709
00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:45.909
my ass in the kitchen, you know what I'm

710
00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:49.629
saying? And you know, so I don't discriminate. I

711
00:35:49.629 --> 00:35:52.290
just know that about myself, but I'm not gonna

712
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.310
put the person down. So that this is what

713
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.830
a lot of women do, and you're right, they,

714
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.409
they're worried about the sex worker because they're so,

715
00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:05.550
um. They feel like we're gonna take their husband

716
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.790
or their man or something. And when you become

717
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.949
a sex worker, you, you do become very open-minded

718
00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:16.070
sexually because you know, we don't want nobody's husband

719
00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.070
or boyfriend at the end of the day. We

720
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:21.469
just want their wallet, you know. Yeah,

721
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.959
that's funny, you know, but, but I, I've had

722
00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:28.520
an interview on the show with, um, I think

723
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.750
it was with Francesca Luberti, if I'm not mistaken.

724
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.040
I mean, we talked about how sometimes people's views

725
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.120
of sex and relationships even have a. Influence their

726
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.479
own politics and for example people who are more

727
00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:48.760
conservative who tend to prefer monogamous relationships and perhaps

728
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.000
don't like to have, uh, don't like promiscuity, the

729
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.760
idea of having sex with with several people and

730
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.610
so on. Uh, I mean, they, they tend to

731
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.929
not like, uh, sex workers and tend to not

732
00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:08.449
like people who promote casual sex and so on

733
00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:11.729
because they see that as a social threat because

734
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.889
they think, OK, so if I live in a

735
00:37:13.889 --> 00:37:18.510
society where promiscuity and casual sex and so on

736
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.419
is allowed, then it's harder for me to get

737
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.169
a husband or a partner who is loyal or

738
00:37:26.169 --> 00:37:28.429
faithful, you know. So,

739
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.169
oh, they could be ignorance because that's ignorance.

740
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.550
It's ignorance.

741
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:40.399
It's ignorance because it. It, it Difference, there's, you

742
00:37:40.399 --> 00:37:42.939
know, that's a whole different discussion with the polyamory

743
00:37:42.939 --> 00:37:45.169
and the swinger lifestyle, you know what I'm saying,

744
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.310
because with relationship, it's more about communication.

745
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.449
Mhm. Yeah, and yeah, and another thing that uh

746
00:37:53.449 --> 00:37:56.629
feminists who are against sex work say is that,

747
00:37:56.969 --> 00:38:02.209
uh, sex workers are always objectified by their fans

748
00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:04.219
or clients. I mean, do you feel

749
00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:08.090
objectified? Oh, no, no, I don't allow, I don't,

750
00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:11.310
I would not allow a fan to objectify me.

751
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.989
Yeah, but but. Yeah, but, but, but I mean,

752
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:21.389
for, uh, do you feel, um, comfortable with the

753
00:38:21.389 --> 00:38:26.250
fact that perhaps, uh, men approach you because they

754
00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:30.590
like you physically? I mean, is that, is that

755
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:31.590
OK for you,

756
00:38:31.629 --> 00:38:34.229
or if I date somebody, I'm gonna have to

757
00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:37.689
like them physically, yeah, you know what I'm saying,

758
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.879
so it's vice versa. If I'm not gonna like,

759
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.959
you know, like I have to like them physically,

760
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.320
same, same thing. So, you know, of course, I,

761
00:38:46.439 --> 00:38:48.459
uh, but, you know, when you talk to and,

762
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.649
usually, The way I personally have kept any of

763
00:38:52.649 --> 00:38:58.770
my fans, clients is my personality. And they usually

764
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.610
know me and the way I've kept them through

765
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.649
the years is by them knowing who I am.

766
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.560
You know, it's, it's, yes, it's initially the beauty

767
00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:10.139
and how I look, but it's also how when

768
00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:13.020
I open my mouth and how I talk, and

769
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.060
that's the name of the game, you know, so

770
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.020
it's how good, yeah, you, you connect and you

771
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.540
communicate after. You know, once you open your mouth.

772
00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:27.250
Yeah, because people have this idea that men only

773
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.489
approach sex workers or pay for sex with them

774
00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:35.409
or pay for OnlyFans or whatever, because they only

775
00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:38.290
care about their looks or their bodies. Yeah,

776
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.969
but if I date, I'm going to have to,

777
00:39:39.979 --> 00:39:42.840
like, like, again, if I personally date a guy,

778
00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:45.090
I don't want to like approach a guy that's

779
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.760
not, you know what I'm saying, like, uh, because

780
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.310
the time I let like. The time I went

781
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.770
and, and wasn't so picky, it wasn't good. So

782
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.209
it, it's, that's just the nature of any type

783
00:39:57.209 --> 00:39:59.090
of business, you know, if I'm gonna go buy

784
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.090
an outfit, I want the outfit to look good.

785
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.090
Yeah, sure, you know, I mean, that's what everything,

786
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.679
what, what are they, they're being ridiculous. Oh, let,

787
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.689
let me go buy some ugly clothes to put

788
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:11.689
it on. You know what the hell? Let me

789
00:40:11.689 --> 00:40:13.689
buy ugly clothes. Put the ugly clothes on now.

790
00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:16.290
Are they getting too much with this? You know,

791
00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:16.850
of course,

792
00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:19.290
yeah, and and as you said, and I also

793
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.649
heard that from other sex workers, I mean, clients

794
00:40:22.649 --> 00:40:26.330
and fans are not there only because of the

795
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.520
looks. That's not the only thing they care about.

796
00:40:30.419 --> 00:40:33.570
One with anything, it's going to be a number

797
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.610
one, the looks, but then to keep them is

798
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.929
going to be the personality. But also, you know,

799
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.969
you gotta think again, like I said, the clo

800
00:40:40.969 --> 00:40:43.810
the think about it like the clothes, you all

801
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:46.530
what looks good on me and then what's comfortable

802
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:50.600
fit, OK, but of course it's the look you're

803
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.560
gonna go to, it's like a strip club. I

804
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.290
wanna go to the strip club with the ugly

805
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.250
girls. You know, like, with no teeth, I take

806
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.770
me to where that she has no teeth at

807
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:05.169
all, you know, like. Well, that might be some

808
00:41:05.169 --> 00:41:07.370
people might be into the Notif brothel. I don't

809
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.510
know. That might be a fetish.

810
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:13.610
No, you, you know, definitely some feminists must have

811
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:14.100
some,

812
00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:16.489
they, they got some now that feminists have got

813
00:41:16.489 --> 00:41:19.889
some issues there though, OK, because they're dating. Let

814
00:41:19.889 --> 00:41:22.510
me see who they're dating and what they're wearing.

815
00:41:23.129 --> 00:41:25.570
I was going to say that they must have

816
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.889
some. Issues with I don't know, past relationships or

817
00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:33.070
with men because they are some of them also

818
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.739
talk about all the male gays, I mean women,

819
00:41:37.909 --> 00:41:39.350
I hate to say, you know, I am a

820
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:44.179
feminist, but sometimes with some feminists. And, and, and,

821
00:41:44.229 --> 00:41:45.459
and, and I had a cousin that used to

822
00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:49.550
say this. Yeah, sometimes in the pussy there's cobwebs.

823
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.199
And they just need a dick to go in

824
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:56.000
there to get the cobwebs out because I hate

825
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.959
to be so crude and rude, but it's like

826
00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:01.110
get over it, you know what I'm saying? Like

827
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.830
and just enjoy life. Like, of course it's for

828
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.879
the looks, but you know, in, in, in sex

829
00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:07.639
work you do have to look good. You have

830
00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:09.550
to look good. I, beauty is in the eye

831
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.560
of the beholder though, and men do like all

832
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.629
shapes, all sizes, and there's something for everyone. You

833
00:42:16.629 --> 00:42:18.820
know what I'm saying. There's something for everyone. You

834
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.350
could be all, all men do like curves. Men

835
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:26.669
do like blondes, brunettes, all different ethnicities, all different,

836
00:42:26.949 --> 00:42:29.310
all different women are beautiful at all different sizes.

837
00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:32.590
But for these women to be that critical, get

838
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:37.159
the cobwebs out, OK. And if you don't like,

839
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.139
if you don't like a, a male in there,

840
00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:41.510
they have choice. You could just stick in there

841
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.260
and get the cobwebs out, so enjoy yourself.

842
00:42:43.739 --> 00:42:48.060
No, no, no, you know, it's, it's like, it's

843
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.070
really funny. It's really funny because a few years

844
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.330
ago, uh, last decade, there was a feminist group,

845
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:58.500
and again, I'm not, uh, criticizing all feminists because

846
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.580
there are different types of feminists.

847
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.919
Those are the extreme.

848
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.639
Yeah, but there, there,

849
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.850
there was too much,

850
00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:07.679
yeah, there, there was a feminist group here in

851
00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:12.530
Portugal, and one of them wrote a post saying

852
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.770
that women shouldn't have sex with men with the

853
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.719
lights on because men shouldn't look at their bodies,

854
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:21.080
and I

855
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.260
was

856
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:27.310
like, what the heck are you talking about? Because,

857
00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:30.209
uh, because otherwise they are being objectified.

858
00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:36.489
They need the cobwebs out. They need to come

859
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:38.699
up with. This sounds like my sister. My sister

860
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:40.459
must be part of this group. That's something my

861
00:43:40.459 --> 00:43:43.780
sister would say. She gets like that and I'm

862
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.649
just like, Yeah,

863
00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.629
do, do, do you get support from your family,

864
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:51.149
or,

865
00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:53.709
uh, my mother, my sister's a weird one like

866
00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:55.669
that. That's something my sister would say. She's got

867
00:43:55.669 --> 00:43:58.389
the cobwebs. That's, that's the case of the cobwebs.

868
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.090
Just a case of the cobwebs, you know what

869
00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.820
I'm saying? Yeah, we, you know what, in society

870
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.219
we do need men. I say we need men

871
00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:11.919
for sex and money. And I have kids. And

872
00:44:11.919 --> 00:44:13.600
sometimes we need to shut you guys up and

873
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.919
put a tag on you and throw you in

874
00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:16.360
the closet for a bit. You know what I'm

875
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.760
saying? But You might enjoy it, but you know

876
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.639
what I mean? Men are very much needed in

877
00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:25.760
society. I feel like. I, I'm, I, I love

878
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.219
men. I love men, you know, but it, it,

879
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.149
and, and, but I like my rights as a

880
00:44:30.149 --> 00:44:32.949
female, you know what I'm saying? But I'm not

881
00:44:32.949 --> 00:44:35.080
gonna shit on men. I'm not gonna, you know,

882
00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:38.120
hate on men and I like the lights on.

883
00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:40.560
I like maybe some fluorescent lights on when I

884
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.120
have sex, but not shut the lights off 100%.

885
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:45.719
I gotta find something, you know.

886
00:44:46.729 --> 00:44:49.189
Yeah, I, I mean, do, do you think that

887
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.889
the sex work can be empowering?

888
00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:54.929
It can be, and it was empowering for me

889
00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:57.330
to raise my children and survive. You know what

890
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:01.439
I'm saying, um. When I hear conservative men put

891
00:45:01.439 --> 00:45:04.510
down and oh women don't want to be married,

892
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.679
or I would have loved to be married, you

893
00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:09.580
know what I'm saying? I would have loved to,

894
00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:12.120
you know, be home with my children every day

895
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.360
if a man would have supported me and paid

896
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.040
my bills and let me stay home and be

897
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.520
a mother, but that wasn't the case. So it

898
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.600
was empowering for me to be able to work

899
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.919
3 or 4 days and make enough money to

900
00:45:24.919 --> 00:45:28.270
support my children. So that was empowering because I

901
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.310
didn't have a man that could take care of

902
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:34.310
me, you know what I'm saying, um, and empowering

903
00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.389
that I could provide and make sure my child

904
00:45:37.389 --> 00:45:39.330
was well educated. Yeah,

905
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.270
yeah, I mean that that's the reason why I

906
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.510
think feminism is so important because feminism is what

907
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.550
gives you choices. I mean, you can choose to

908
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.159
be a sex. Sex worker and be an independent

909
00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:57.120
woman, you can choose to be a housewife and

910
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.600
I mean just take care of the kids and

911
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.580
cook food and so on and that's I mean

912
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:03.629
I was able to do,

913
00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:07.360
yeah, I was able to work like enough and

914
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.570
then support my child and and. You know, because

915
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.929
the father like abandoned, you know, abandoned me. But

916
00:46:13.929 --> 00:46:16.810
what was I supposed to do? And, you know,

917
00:46:16.929 --> 00:46:19.489
that's, that's the thing. He didn't wanna help, he

918
00:46:19.489 --> 00:46:22.409
didn't wanna pay, he didn't wanna, you know, do

919
00:46:22.409 --> 00:46:26.189
nothing, you know, that was his child, and She's

920
00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:28.729
successful and it really gets me. There's a lot

921
00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:30.439
of men out there that say, oh, the women

922
00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:31.889
don't want to do this. We don't wanna do

923
00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:34.889
that. I wanted to, you know, to this day,

924
00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:37.169
I would love to be married to one person

925
00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:39.719
and sit home and cook or whatever, and I,

926
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.530
it gets me that, uh, a lot of men

927
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.729
say that we don't wanna do that, you know,

928
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.350
and I know I wanted to do it, but

929
00:46:47.689 --> 00:46:49.729
I find, you know, the last time I was

930
00:46:49.729 --> 00:46:53.500
married, the guy. He didn't want to pay you

931
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.969
everything, he still wanted me to work, you know.

932
00:46:56.909 --> 00:46:58.750
So, you know, yeah,

933
00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.310
so yeah, so let me ask you then, because

934
00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.909
I think this is one of the early episodes

935
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:07.350
you did on your podcast. There was an episode

936
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.429
where you talked about how you approach, uh, love

937
00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:14.084
in your life. So, how, uh, how do you

938
00:47:14.084 --> 00:47:17.465
approach relationships and love in your life?

939
00:47:17.804 --> 00:47:20.364
Well, I, I keep it like 100% with what

940
00:47:20.364 --> 00:47:23.084
I do, um, and who I am as a

941
00:47:23.084 --> 00:47:25.844
person. So it's hard cause it's, there's not many

942
00:47:25.844 --> 00:47:29.560
men that can handle me. They can,

943
00:47:29.709 --> 00:47:32.989
but, but handling in what sense?

944
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.330
Um, I just, I always tell guys the truth,

945
00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:38.969
but I find a lot of females don't tell

946
00:47:38.969 --> 00:47:43.090
them. So a lot of, because I'm 100% like

947
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.570
I tell people from the day I met, I

948
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.449
was an exotic dancer. And I noticed a lot

949
00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:49.699
of women, they play this game with men that

950
00:47:49.699 --> 00:47:52.250
they're, they play Miss Innocent, and I just tell

951
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.050
everybody the worst of the worst of the worst

952
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.969
upfront, so the guys get scared of me, but

953
00:47:57.969 --> 00:48:00.610
they don't know like the true, you know, cause

954
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.639
I'm really not a drinker. I'm really not a

955
00:48:02.639 --> 00:48:04.729
crazy person, but when they meet me, they hear

956
00:48:04.729 --> 00:48:08.649
the craziest stuff. So they, it's just whoever chooses

957
00:48:08.649 --> 00:48:11.250
to stay, chooses to stay. So I just, you,

958
00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.209
you're gonna hear the The craziest thing, but I

959
00:48:14.209 --> 00:48:15.800
think a lot of men are afraid that they're

960
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.909
gonna end up on my podcast or something.

961
00:48:19.739 --> 00:48:21.540
But, but I mean, do you, do you think

962
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:26.219
that the issue is that many men, uh, wouldn't

963
00:48:26.219 --> 00:48:29.699
like to date or be in a relationship with,

964
00:48:29.709 --> 00:48:32.739
uh, sex workers specifically, or is it some other,

965
00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:33.179
you,

966
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.419
you know what, a lot of, uh, I get

967
00:48:36.419 --> 00:48:38.330
all kinds of guys. I do get a lot

968
00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.020
of very good looking guys. I get a lot

969
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.139
of young, a lot of young guys, um, and

970
00:48:43.139 --> 00:48:48.159
it's just so many different guys, but they. You

971
00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:52.239
know, they, it, it's who's strong enough to handle

972
00:48:52.239 --> 00:48:54.360
it, appreciate it, you know what I'm saying? And

973
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.800
then who do I want to put up with

974
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.040
too.

975
00:48:57.459 --> 00:49:00.379
Mm, OK, but uh but but but I mean,

976
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:03.179
do, do you think that many men have a

977
00:49:03.179 --> 00:49:06.929
particular issue with having a partner that is a

978
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:08.510
sex worker, or

979
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.219
yeah, or what um. Yeah, they do, they do.

980
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.639
Yeah, because they want, they want a lot of

981
00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:22.110
men want this real innocent type, um. And Not

982
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.270
so many anyone. I, I'm starting to find out

983
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.810
that like a lot of men are not so

984
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.399
sexually advanced as me, of course. That's another thing,

985
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.760
a whole another issue. Uh,

986
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.229
uh, WHAT, what, uh, you think that many men,

987
00:49:37.459 --> 00:49:42.250
uh, I mean, are not good at pleasing women

988
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.340
sexually or?

989
00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:46.659
Well, it's not that they're not, they're just not,

990
00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:51.149
um. When I say sexually advanced, I guess because

991
00:49:51.149 --> 00:49:53.270
I have the podcast, I know so much sexually

992
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.860
things, and, you know, uh, all day long, I'm

993
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.909
talking about sex, sex, sex, sex, sex all the

994
00:49:58.909 --> 00:50:01.330
time, you know what I'm saying, and different things.

995
00:50:01.379 --> 00:50:04.350
And after a while, so I'm just so accustomed

996
00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.580
to it. But it's a very, I'm just upfront

997
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.189
when I date, so they know the, the moment.

998
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.610
So there's no surprises.

999
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.350
No. OK, so let, let me, let me ask

1000
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.989
you this. If you have a boyfriend or a

1001
00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:21.709
husband, would you mind at all if he consumed

1002
00:50:21.709 --> 00:50:22.469
pornography?

1003
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.100
Oh, I, I have my last partner. He did,

1004
00:50:26.679 --> 00:50:28.719
um, but I think that, I think that was

1005
00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:31.479
an issue because he didn't, um, and I didn't

1006
00:50:31.479 --> 00:50:35.159
realize till now, um, that was an issue because

1007
00:50:35.159 --> 00:50:37.800
he, that was, at first I didn't, when I

1008
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.000
was in the relationship, it didn't really bother me,

1009
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:44.879
but now I realize there needs to be structure

1010
00:50:44.879 --> 00:50:47.879
on the conception of, of how much you watch.

1011
00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:50.100
He was daily in the morning all the time.

1012
00:50:50.729 --> 00:50:53.469
So he got accustomed to it. And I think

1013
00:50:53.469 --> 00:50:56.830
that's a problem that now I am aware of

1014
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.989
that a guy that watches too much, you know,

1015
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.870
that, that tends to be a problem. Like you

1016
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.739
need to be, um, sort of, uh, What's the

1017
00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:08.739
word, like not so addictive to it.

1018
00:51:09.469 --> 00:51:11.899
Yeah, you know, you know, it's interesting because that

1019
00:51:11.899 --> 00:51:16.139
really goes along what I, what Doctor Nicole Prosi,

1020
00:51:16.219 --> 00:51:19.500
I mean, she's a psychologist and a neuroscientist and

1021
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.379
she works on pornography, sex work, and so on.

1022
00:51:23.419 --> 00:51:25.860
I've had her on the show twice and in

1023
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.840
our first conversation, or was a. The second, perhaps

1024
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.199
it was the 1st, she uh she said that

1025
00:51:32.209 --> 00:51:35.969
the issue with people who are in relationships consuming

1026
00:51:35.969 --> 00:51:39.919
pornography is not the consumption of pornography per se,

1027
00:51:39.969 --> 00:51:44.209
it's, uh, if there's a big discrepancy between the

1028
00:51:44.209 --> 00:51:47.050
man and the woman in terms of how much

1029
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:47.889
pornography

1030
00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:50.209
they consume, because he, he used to all the

1031
00:51:50.209 --> 00:51:53.129
time, and when I was in the relationship, I

1032
00:51:53.129 --> 00:51:55.600
just thought, oh, this is no issue, he. He's

1033
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.919
doing his thing, he's doing his thing. And then

1034
00:51:57.919 --> 00:52:01.879
now after I've left the relationship, because we never

1035
00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:06.199
even slept in the bed together. And yeah, and

1036
00:52:06.199 --> 00:52:08.360
now I realized it was easy for me. I

1037
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.590
watched, I chased out of that relationship so easily.

1038
00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:15.379
It was very easy separation because of it. And

1039
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.909
because we ended up not having sex, and I

1040
00:52:17.909 --> 00:52:21.320
realized, because I was so OK with it, that

1041
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.169
was the way. I wasn't satisfied, but he was

1042
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.540
taking care of himself so much that that was

1043
00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.260
our issue. Like I, I never really said anything

1044
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.760
cause I was like, oh, OK, whatever, he's just

1045
00:52:34.939 --> 00:52:38.300
doing his thing. But now I realize that, you

1046
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.110
know, he should have. You know, I should have

1047
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.949
said something a long time. Now I know that's

1048
00:52:43.949 --> 00:52:46.310
like a red flag for any guy that's too

1049
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:47.350
much, yeah.

1050
00:52:48.419 --> 00:52:51.510
Yeah, I mean, because it's really about the discrepancy,

1051
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:55.270
I think for, for example, the man watches porn

1052
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.629
once or twice a week and the woman does

1053
00:52:57.629 --> 00:52:59.939
the same, or even if they sometimes yeah, once

1054
00:52:59.939 --> 00:53:00.469
or twice

1055
00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:02.629
as good, yeah, once or once a, once a

1056
00:53:02.629 --> 00:53:04.030
week, twice a week is good, but this he

1057
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:09.750
was like, yeah, daily, yeah, it, it, yeah, yeah,

1058
00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:12.370
like at least 4 to 5 times, yeah.

1059
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.389
Yeah, or if, for example, or if for example,

1060
00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:18.239
there are couples who watch porn together, I mean,

1061
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.870
that's perfectly OK, I

1062
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.229
think. Oh, I think couples together, that's fine, yeah,

1063
00:53:22.389 --> 00:53:22.790
yeah, yeah,

1064
00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:25.820
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh tell us then

1065
00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.000
about your get schooled podcast. I mean, what kind

1066
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.620
of goals do you have with it and what

1067
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.969
kind of things do you do there?

1068
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.570
OK, so with Get School, I created it, um,

1069
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:44.500
because Foster Cesa, which happened in 2019, we lost

1070
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.340
a lot of platforms that educated people about sex

1071
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.120
work. And I noticed with podcasting, you could have

1072
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.399
any type of, you know, you could have all

1073
00:53:53.399 --> 00:53:55.949
sorts of people on talking. And I felt like

1074
00:53:55.949 --> 00:53:58.120
there was a need to have a platform where

1075
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.520
you would have sex workers or different type of

1076
00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.239
people talking about sex. So, I don't have just

1077
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:05.429
sex workers, I also have therapists. I have, um,

1078
00:54:05.439 --> 00:54:08.760
educators or different people that can contribute to sex

1079
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.919
work on. And I've done now over 100 and

1080
00:54:12.919 --> 00:54:17.060
probably over 150 episodes. And each episode I try

1081
00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.030
keeping very different. I've also had people to talk

1082
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.629
about like polyamory, um, swinging, because that's important to

1083
00:54:24.629 --> 00:54:29.030
me to discuss because it's, there's so much misconception

1084
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:32.270
about different and every, every guest I try keeping

1085
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:35.909
different and it's people talking from their own experience,

1086
00:54:35.989 --> 00:54:39.479
their own word educating people. Um, I, I try

1087
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:42.600
my best getting guests that have been in, if

1088
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.919
they were sex workers, I try my hardest getting

1089
00:54:44.919 --> 00:54:47.100
people that have been in at least 10 years.

1090
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.879
Um, SOMETIMES I can't always get people in that

1091
00:54:49.879 --> 00:54:51.560
have been over 10 years, and I think it's

1092
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.080
important because I noticed during the pandemic, a lot

1093
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.840
of people jumped into sex work and they got

1094
00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.399
on OnlyFans, but they didn't, they, they're not even

1095
00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:05.320
running their OnlyFans page. They're having chatters on. So

1096
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.449
they, I feel like they're not really. Giving the

1097
00:55:08.449 --> 00:55:11.570
best experience for sex work. So it's just really

1098
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.969
important for me to get people that have, you

1099
00:55:13.969 --> 00:55:17.209
know, done different forms of sex work, um, so

1100
00:55:17.209 --> 00:55:19.929
that way to educate people and they're, you know,

1101
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.120
and share experiences, whether, you know, they've been a

1102
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:27.209
dominatrix, they've been an escort, they've been, um, You

1103
00:55:27.209 --> 00:55:30.090
know, I've had everything on a cam model. They,

1104
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:33.510
you know, um, you know, just just different things.

1105
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.030
Yeah, I, I, yeah, I know that you have

1106
00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:38.649
a, I, I have listened to several episodes, and

1107
00:55:38.649 --> 00:55:41.050
I know that you have a sort of a

1108
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:45.120
series of episodes which was something like, Uh, sex

1109
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.699
workers are humans too, something like that, right? And

1110
00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:50.760
I mean, uh, what do you think are the

1111
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.510
best ways of, uh, humanizing sex workers to fight

1112
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:59.919
against the typical social stigma and discrimination that they

1113
00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:00.760
tend to get?

1114
00:56:01.629 --> 00:56:03.969
Um, I did that series and I brought in,

1115
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.429
um, some well-known porn stars, and I wanted them

1116
00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.790
to just talk about like their like stuff that

1117
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.550
I wanted them to just talk normal and not

1118
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.110
about like, uh, and it was, that was a

1119
00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.629
very good series. We talk about stuff they enjoyed.

1120
00:56:16.709 --> 00:56:19.350
I think Jill Blue, she talked about how she

1121
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.330
liked going to, uh, what was it, the, the

1122
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:27.510
raves. And, uh, Violet Meyers talked about Japan and

1123
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:33.159
her love for, uh, Anime. She loves anime. So

1124
00:56:33.159 --> 00:56:35.149
she, and I like Hello Kitty, so I love

1125
00:56:35.149 --> 00:56:37.709
talking to her about that. And it was a

1126
00:56:37.709 --> 00:56:41.679
very good series, uh, uh, so I, I just

1127
00:56:41.679 --> 00:56:43.939
think that, you know, hearing for them and, and

1128
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.219
even enjoying their aesthetics and listening to their, um,

1129
00:56:47.719 --> 00:56:50.719
their lives, it, it's good we, we listen to

1130
00:56:50.719 --> 00:56:53.840
them because it, it's, you know, there's more to

1131
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.949
them than, than, than that filming. You know, it,

1132
00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.120
it, it's just, uh, right now it's her name

1133
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.620
is, uh, Jasmine Sher Shene Sherning, she's, um, uh.

1134
00:57:06.409 --> 00:57:08.770
I interviewed her. I did a good episode with

1135
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:12.659
her. She used to be. An ER, uh, ER

1136
00:57:12.659 --> 00:57:16.530
nurse. And um I used to be really against

1137
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.159
sex workers that would just jump into sex work

1138
00:57:19.159 --> 00:57:22.770
from another career. After I had that interview, I

1139
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.689
had an appreciation for people that like our first

1140
00:57:25.689 --> 00:57:28.649
responders, because she worked in the ER as a

1141
00:57:28.649 --> 00:57:31.350
nurse, and I, I realized like, you know, like,

1142
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:36.649
firefighters, ER nurses, stuff like her, they're watching people

1143
00:57:36.649 --> 00:57:41.429
die. And, and, and that interview was very important

1144
00:57:41.429 --> 00:57:44.370
for me and she's somebody to watch, but we

1145
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.120
don't. You know, we don't, a lot of jobs

1146
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.959
like, they're getting PTSD. You know, it, it's going

1147
00:57:51.959 --> 00:57:55.159
through a lot. So when she had her career

1148
00:57:55.159 --> 00:57:57.879
change, and she, she's somebody to very much watch

1149
00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.189
in her career changing, um, it made me really

1150
00:58:02.189 --> 00:58:04.159
appreciate her as the individual. It was a very

1151
00:58:04.159 --> 00:58:07.239
good episode because I was like, whoa, um, you

1152
00:58:07.239 --> 00:58:10.679
know, she did this career change, but she, you

1153
00:58:10.679 --> 00:58:13.479
know, what she encountered, it was such a human

1154
00:58:13.479 --> 00:58:16.139
experience interviewing her. You know, so that's a very

1155
00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:18.139
good episode because I, it's, uh, I felt like

1156
00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:20.300
it's a very human experience of that interview with

1157
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.540
her. So she's somebody that's a very good episode

1158
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.580
to listen to with Jasmine Cherie,

1159
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.699
yeah, OK. The, the one who loves Japan and

1160
00:58:27.699 --> 00:58:29.090
anime is Jules.

1161
00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.820
Well, that's, no, uh, no, Jules Blue is the

1162
00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:37.340
one that did, um, she is the raver. Violet

1163
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.300
Meyers like all of, um, and, but the other

1164
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.679
person is. That I think she's up and coming

1165
00:58:44.679 --> 00:58:47.270
right now. She's um nominated for a lot of

1166
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:53.820
AVN is Jasminehrney, and um I can connect you

1167
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.250
with her PR person. She's somebody very good, um.

1168
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:02.479
Because she was an ER, uh, nurse, and I

1169
00:59:02.479 --> 00:59:06.120
did that interview and that was a, it was

1170
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:10.800
very human experience interviewing her because I realized like

1171
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.129
what she witnessed as an ER doctor and then

1172
00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:17.340
going into porn, it was just a that interview

1173
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.199
to me, it kind of shook me up because

1174
00:59:19.199 --> 00:59:22.479
I didn't, I had a whole new appreciation for

1175
00:59:22.479 --> 00:59:23.860
uh first responders.

1176
00:59:24.669 --> 00:59:27.870
Mhm, YEAH, yeah, no, no, you, you, you have

1177
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:31.310
to help me get, uh, the one whoever it

1178
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.600
was who likes, uh, Japan and anime on

1179
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:34.860
the show

1180
00:59:35.909 --> 00:59:38.510
because I'm, I'm also, I'm also into anime, so

1181
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.560
probably, OK,

1182
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:43.929
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you're into anime too.

1183
00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:47.070
Oh, she, she loves it, yeah, she loves, loves

1184
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:49.989
it, yeah, Violet Meyers loves it, and I love

1185
00:59:49.989 --> 00:59:51.979
talking to her about it, anime too, because I

1186
00:59:51.979 --> 00:59:56.810
love Hello Kitty. They have a like a uh

1187
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:59.139
a Hawaii restaurant here in New York. It's so

1188
00:59:59.139 --> 01:00:00.449
nice. I want to go to and I have

1189
01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:01.239
nobody to go to.

1190
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:06.750
Yeah, that's nice. OK, so look, just to finish,

1191
01:00:07.209 --> 01:00:09.530
just to wrap this up with a bit of

1192
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.750
fun, uh, because I, I mean, I'm about to

1193
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.290
try to get more sex workers on the show,

1194
01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:15.860
so I,

1195
01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:17.830
I have somebody I'll introduce you to, yes.

1196
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:21.709
OK, so, uh, I will make this a series,

1197
01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:24.590
I guess, hopefully if it goes well, and so

1198
01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:27.409
I guess that I will introduce this question here

1199
01:00:27.409 --> 01:00:29.610
and I will. Make it uh, the, uh, I

1200
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.969
will make it the, uh, final question of every

1201
01:00:32.969 --> 01:00:35.090
episode, I guess. I, it just came to my

1202
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:40.280
mind. So you mentioned earlier Brittany Andrews, Eva Devine,

1203
01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:43.489
so the, the other lady, I'm sorry, I can't

1204
01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:45.649
remember her name because I never heard of her,

1205
01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:51.389
uh, but what is your Mount Rushmore of, uh,

1206
01:00:51.449 --> 01:00:53.550
porn stars, female porn stars?

1207
01:00:54.929 --> 01:01:01.489
The Mount Rushmore. Ava Devine, Brittany Andrews, and right

1208
01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:04.760
now for the young, I feel like Jasmine Shereen

1209
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.229
seems to be up there. She's like the Obama.

1210
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:11.229
She's like the Obama right now. I want to

1211
01:01:11.229 --> 01:01:17.000
say, um, definitely Mercedes Ashley. Uh, YEAH, so that

1212
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.270
would be the Mount Rushmore. Definitely Mercedes Ashley. She's,

1213
01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:25.469
she's old school, uh, but I know her personally

1214
01:01:25.469 --> 01:01:28.909
and I've worked with her, and she's just genius.

1215
01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.189
Oh my gosh, she's old school. She's kind of

1216
01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.989
disappeared, but she is genius.

1217
01:01:36.199 --> 01:01:38.300
You, yeah, do you want me to tell you

1218
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:38.719
mine,

1219
01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:40.639
or yes, tell me yours.

1220
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:46.860
OK. Uh, NUMBER 1 for me, the goat, Nina

1221
01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.500
Hartley.

1222
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.620
Oh, OK, Nina Hartley.

1223
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:55.580
Yeah, uh, number 2, let, let me just think

1224
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.659
for a second. Number 20, Lisa Han, Lisa

1225
01:01:58.659 --> 01:01:59.709
Han. Oh, OK,

1226
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.679
OK. Number 2, number 3. Uh, I guess that

1227
01:02:04.969 --> 01:02:08.439
I'm going to consider also the longevity and the,

1228
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.120
the number, the huge number of scenes she's done,

1229
01:02:12.449 --> 01:02:13.010
Phoenix

1230
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:17.100
Marie. Oh, OK, yeah, I've met her briefly, but

1231
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.409
I just don't know her, you know what it

1232
01:02:18.409 --> 01:02:20.280
is? I don't, if I don't know them personally

1233
01:02:20.739 --> 01:02:23.020
and I haven't interviewed them, I can't really talk.

1234
01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.149
Yeah, but I know I've met her briefly, so

1235
01:02:25.149 --> 01:02:26.060
yeah, yeah,

1236
01:02:26.169 --> 01:02:28.110
I, I, I think she also worked in healthcare,

1237
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.090
I guess, I, I, if I'm not mistaken,

1238
01:02:32.179 --> 01:02:34.060
I, I have, I have an inter if I

1239
01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.139
don't interview them and I don't know them, I

1240
01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:38.100
can't really speak. I know Lisa Ann, yeah.

1241
01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:41.909
Yeah. Yeah, uh, OK, yeah, and then the final

1242
01:02:41.909 --> 01:02:44.750
one, yeah, Mount Rushmore is for people, right? So

1243
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.229
the final one, I, I mean, it has to

1244
01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:50.389
be my favorite. I mean, I don't think that

1245
01:02:50.389 --> 01:02:53.629
she's better than others who I would put below

1246
01:02:53.629 --> 01:02:56.379
her, but she's just my favorite, so she's a

1247
01:02:56.379 --> 01:02:56.790
writer.

1248
01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.300
Oh, OK, OK. All right,

1249
01:03:00.879 --> 01:03:03.719
so there you go, and then, and then honorable

1250
01:03:03.719 --> 01:03:10.330
mentions, uh, Janet Mason, Ryan Connor, uh, Kinder list.

1251
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.560
Yeah, OK. All right. Oh, I forgot Jenna James,

1252
01:03:14.919 --> 01:03:18.560
uh, sweet, I forgot about her, um, she's, yeah,

1253
01:03:18.679 --> 01:03:20.090
she should have been up there. I forgot about

1254
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:20.360
her.

1255
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.399
Yeah, Jenna Jameson is old school as well.

1256
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.459
Yes, old school. Yeah, bless her heart. So, yeah,
