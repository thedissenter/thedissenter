00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.329
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:06.210
Center. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.130
today I'm joined by Doctor Dina Mira. She's an

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.640
evolutionary biologist, author, and teacher. She's a senior scientist

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.649
and writer in residence in the Center for Reproductive.

6
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.545
Longevity and equality at the Buck Institute. And today

7
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.344
we're going to talk about her book, A Brief

8
00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:26.905
History of the Female Body, an evolutionary look at

9
00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.534
how and why the female form came to be.

10
00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.145
So, Doctor Ramiro, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.615
huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:35.944
Thank you so much for the invitation. I look

13
00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:37.034
forward to our conversation.

14
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.169
So, before we get into the different physical bodily

15
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:45.939
traits of the female body that you explore in

16
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.580
the book, let me start by asking you, from

17
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.939
a biological standpoint, how do you define a female?

18
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.610
What is a female

19
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.720
exactly? Great question. So, In biology, um, you know,

20
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.160
we study animals that reproduce in different ways, and

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.860
one of those ways is sexual reproduction. Um, AND

22
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.980
so in sexually reproducing species, um, there are usually

23
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.860
two types of gametes. There, there is always two

24
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.709
types of gametes or or sex cells. So there's

25
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.580
usually a big one, we call those eggs and

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.849
a small one we call those sperm. And so,

27
00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:34.410
The definition is simple. Females are the individuals in

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.059
a species that develop to make eggs, and males

29
00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:40.620
are the individuals that develop to make sperm.

30
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.080
And I mean, uh, are there any aspects of

31
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.080
evolution by natural selection that you think it's important

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.360
for people to have a good understanding of uh

33
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.680
to then get a good grasp of the framework

34
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.750
you bring into your book and understand what, where

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.279
or how each trait evolved or not?

36
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:08.820
Yeah, so I'm sure everyone remembers natural selection from

37
00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
their high school biology class or their college biology

38
00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.880
class. So, you know, it's simply that, you know,

39
00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.199
individuals with traits that are better suited. Um, TO

40
00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.789
their environment, they're more likely to survive and reproduce.

41
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.039
Um, AND, you know, over time, that leads to

42
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.960
gradual genetic change in a population. So, you know,

43
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.270
that's something that everyone learns. But I think there's,

44
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.880
um, you know, aspects of natural selection, um, that

45
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.559
people are less familiar with. Um, SO one of

46
00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.429
them is kin selection. So I talk a lot

47
00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.110
about kin selection in the book. This is really,

48
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.070
uh, It is natural selection, but it, it's used

49
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.869
to explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, behavior like

50
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.190
parenting as an example, and I talk a lot

51
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.429
about parenting in the book. Um, ANOTHER concept that

52
00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.869
people may or may not have learned, it's this

53
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:14.410
idea of conflict, evolutionary conflict, um, which, you know,

54
00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.089
You know sometimes natural selection can act in diff

55
00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:23.970
sort of opposite directions, um, in, you know, on

56
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.169
different genes that are involved in in an interaction.

57
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220
And these interactions can happen between species, they can

58
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.460
happen between individuals in a species, they can actually

59
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.059
happen within an individual itself. Um, USUALLY, these conflicts

60
00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:45.419
are, are over resources. So, um, You know, conflict,

61
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.089
um, features heavily in my book, um, because, um,

62
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.649
you know, we have these intimate relationships with our

63
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.729
children as an example, but we're not genetically identical

64
00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.210
to our children. And so, you know, the, the

65
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.809
opportunity for conflict, you know, is there, especially in

66
00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:09.119
during pregnancy and early childhood. Um. I also talk

67
00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.360
about sexual selection, which is really natural selection that

68
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.149
specifically um describes the evolution of traits that help.

69
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.269
Individuals get mates for reproduction and um this operates

70
00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:28.410
um a little bit differently than um And or

71
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.730
it's, it's some of, some of the traits are

72
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.890
sort of counterintuitive. Like they're not necessarily traits that

73
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.609
help an individual survive. Um, YOU know, the famous

74
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:41.609
example is the peacock's tail, and Darwin himself actually

75
00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:44.529
really puzzled over the peacock's tail. You know, how

76
00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.970
could that huge cumbersome, you know, bright tail possibly

77
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.010
be good for the peacock's survival. Um, BUT, you

78
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.529
know, as he first outlined, Darwin. Um, IF that

79
00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.929
train, if that, you know, huge set of feathers

80
00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:05.609
helps the male get mates for reproduction, um, then

81
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:09.890
it's worth making it, um, and lots of birds

82
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.690
do it, and it's, this is not just, um,

83
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.730
restricted to birds. I mean, we see the same

84
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.190
thing in mammals and humans.

85
00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:21.049
So, yeah, we'll probably also come back to some

86
00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:24.709
of these evolutionary mechanisms when later in our conversation,

87
00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:29.250
we talk about motherhood and mother offspring conflict and

88
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.609
things like that. So, uh let me ask you

89
00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.649
about the breasts now and before we get into

90
00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.529
the sort of evolutionary biology of breasts, let me

91
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.970
ask you first, how do breasts develop?

92
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.440
Yeah, that's a great question, not something that you

93
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.390
typically think about. So it actually starts in utero.

94
00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.519
Um, SO, all mammals develop, you know, we call

95
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.950
them breasts, we call them breasts in humans. Um,

96
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.279
BUT in mammals, we call them mammary glands, and

97
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.829
they serve a very specific function, which is to,

98
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.790
um, make milk and feed that milk to developing,

99
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.540
um, infants. Um, AND so development starts in utero.

100
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.859
And actually it's the same for males and females.

101
00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.549
Um, AND so basically, I don't know, maybe a

102
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:24.390
month in to develop it in humans. Obviously, the

103
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.750
timing is different in different species. Um, WE form

104
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.535
these buds, and the buds are like Rudimentary mammary

105
00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:36.135
glands, basically. So, you know, uh, a mammary gland

106
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:40.054
or a breast has a few components. Um, IT

107
00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:45.045
has the glandular cells that are gonna eventually make

108
00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:49.375
the milk. Um, IT'S got the ducts that are

109
00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.625
gonna carry the milk that's getting made by the

110
00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:55.375
gland to the outside of the female's body. Usually,

111
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.579
that's through a nipple. And of course the nipple

112
00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:05.480
is formed in humans um during um Development. And

113
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.200
um and then there's some fat. So there's also

114
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.640
some fat in the area. And so that all

115
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.519
happens in utero, then breast development pauses, um, so

116
00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:18.359
the baby is born and nothing really happens until

117
00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:24.869
puberty. So, um, during puberty, everything, um, And the

118
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.429
female body is sort of, you know, development starts

119
00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:34.549
again. It basically started in utero, it's pauses um

120
00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:38.109
during infancy and childhood, and then everything starts up

121
00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:42.549
again during puberty. Um, AND you just have growth

122
00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:45.820
of what's already there, development of what's already there.

123
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:51.179
And do other animals have breasts or is this

124
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.929
something exclusive to human females?

125
00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:59.970
Yes, so absolutely other all mammals, actually a defining

126
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.850
feature of mammals is that they have these mammary

127
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:09.130
glands and um This is, um, this was a

128
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.850
game changer for mammals. So it, you know, mammals

129
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.100
became very successful, um. You know, because of this

130
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.899
quality, um, so no, we're not alone.

131
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.649
And what are the evolutionary origins of breasts?

132
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.500
Very good question. And, um, you know, with a

133
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.900
lot of these questions, I would, I would say

134
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.820
we don't have a solid answer, but people think

135
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.820
about it and, you know, do experiments or, or

136
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.929
do comparative analysis to try and answer the questions.

137
00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.049
So I would say the best answer that we

138
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:53.580
have now is, but, but certainly not conclusive, um,

139
00:08:53.859 --> 00:09:01.479
is that The breast started well before mammals even

140
00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:04.130
existed, and this is often what we see um

141
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.640
when we look at the evolution of traits. So

142
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.890
we think that in the very first animals that

143
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:17.489
moved onto land, and Laid eggs on land. So

144
00:09:17.489 --> 00:09:24.169
I'm talking about amnios. Amnios include reptiles, mammals, and

145
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:28.210
birds. So the very first amnios, um, they weren't

146
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.250
living in the water anymore. They weren't reproducing in

147
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.250
the water anymore. So this was a huge shift,

148
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.090
you know, from dependency on water to living on

149
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.450
land. And so they had all these adaptations to

150
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.140
be able to survive out of the water. And,

151
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.020
you know, so, for example, adaptations to their eggs.

152
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.729
So if you, if you think about a, a

153
00:09:52.289 --> 00:09:55.859
salamander egg, you know, salamanders are amphibians that also

154
00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:58.380
live on land, but they're dependent on the water.

155
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.630
So I'm not talking about amphibians, I'm talking about

156
00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:05.729
true land mammals that were able to Live on

157
00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:09.250
land completely independent of water. So they had all

158
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.900
these adaptations, these first amnios, um, adaptations to their

159
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.049
eggs, they were much, um, they're called amnios because

160
00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.369
their eggs had all these extra layers. It's called

161
00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:21.630
the amniotic egg. Um, SO that was sort of

162
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.590
a defining feature of these, um, animals. They also

163
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:31.390
had, um, these glands on their body that secreted

164
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.539
sort of oily substances. So why would they do

165
00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:37.799
that? Well, the oily substances helped waterproof their skin.

166
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.059
And, you know, this was solving a really important

167
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.809
problem with these animals, which is how do we

168
00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:46.979
live on land and have our skin not dry

169
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.679
out. I mean, this is a big problem when

170
00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:51.140
you're out of the water. And so they have

171
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.349
these oil glands. They're really sweat glands, but they

172
00:10:55.349 --> 00:10:58.940
secreted sort of an oilier substance that helped waterproof

173
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.659
the skin. And so what we think happened over

174
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:07.000
time is that These animals were secreting this oily

175
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.250
substance. The oily substance was good for their skin.

176
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.289
It was good for the eggs as they were

177
00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:13.330
incubating their eggs so that the eggs didn't dry

178
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.010
out. And then over time, we think that some

179
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.919
of the nutritive aspects of milk started to get

180
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:25.179
produced and secreted from these glands. So, you know,

181
00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:28.169
imagine you've got this animal, it's secreting the substance

182
00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:31.969
to waterproof itself and waterproof its eggs. And then

183
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.539
slowly some new, you know, um certain um enzymes

184
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:40.979
are are getting produced for the first time that

185
00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:44.739
helps to make milk, different components of milk, the

186
00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:49.330
sort of machinery to make them evolve, and they

187
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.539
get excreted from those glands. And so you can

188
00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:58.130
imagine at some point after these babies are hatching,

189
00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:01.570
they start licking up this sweat from the mother.

190
00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:06.739
And um You know, this is kind of a

191
00:12:06.739 --> 00:12:10.460
huge idea, but scientists have worked out some of

192
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.369
the steps. Like we know in certain genes duplicated

193
00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:17.859
when, you know, some of these milk components first

194
00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:22.260
emerged during evolution, we have sort of the um

195
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.419
comparative evidence on these glands and when they first

196
00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:29.830
evolved, um. And so we think that it was

197
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.780
sort of a gradual process over time, you know,

198
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.239
first we it started out as a sweat gland

199
00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:38.710
that was producing some oily substance, then some nutritive

200
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.789
components get added to it. Um, AND then, I

201
00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:44.109
mean, much more needs to happen. You need to

202
00:12:44.109 --> 00:12:48.099
really elaborate this little sweat gland into a whole

203
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.789
system of ducts and glands that are really pumping

204
00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:54.309
out milk. Um, A nipple, of course, but the

205
00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:58.150
nipple comes later. So, you know, the very first

206
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.210
mammals produced milk, but, um, not all mammals have

207
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.190
a nipple. Like the most, um, the earliest branching

208
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.989
group of mammals includes the platypus and the echidna.

209
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.090
Um, THEY make milk, but they lay eggs, um,

210
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.049
and they don't have nipples. So the babies just

211
00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:19.039
sort of lick the milk off of the bellies

212
00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:21.289
of the mom. So nipples came a little bit

213
00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:21.679
later.

214
00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:26.109
But in the case of human females, I mean,

215
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.530
breasts are a bit different from what we find

216
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.030
in other even closely related species, right? Because they

217
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.710
have these sort of bigger, more prominent fat deposits

218
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.830
and they are a per a permanent body trait

219
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:47.190
in women. So I, I mean, what's the explanation

220
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.669
for that?

221
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.969
Yes. So, uh, and I think many of your

222
00:13:50.969 --> 00:13:54.809
listeners may not realize this. Um, HUMAN breasts are

223
00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:58.010
unique, not in their function at all, but, you

224
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.489
know, in what they look like. So in most

225
00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:04.809
other animals, the breast is only visible while the

226
00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:07.690
animal is pregnant or nursing, and then it completely

227
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.049
disappears. So they really don't deposit the same amount

228
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:14.450
of fat that humans do. And so of course,

229
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.419
many people have, you know, tried to come up

230
00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:20.349
with an explanation for why humans put so much

231
00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:25.299
fat on their breasts. It's not necessary. Um, HUMANS,

232
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.500
you know, humans make milk make great milk, but

233
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.260
so do all other mammals, um, so. Again, we

234
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.020
don't have a solid answer. I would say that

235
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.530
there are sort of two big ideas out there,

236
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.570
um. One is, and I, I think this is

237
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.520
the weaker one, there's not a lot of support.

238
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.289
The idea is that the bigger breast, the fatty

239
00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:56.719
breast, evolved to advertise the quality of the female.

240
00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:00.309
Um, IN terms of, in terms of her reproductive

241
00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:06.190
ability, um, to males. So the logic, according to

242
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.619
people who sort of adhere to this idea is

243
00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:14.460
Women who have larger breasts, this, this has a

244
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.460
lot to do with estrogen. So, um, the thought

245
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.460
is women who have larger breasts have higher estrogen

246
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.739
levels or are more responsive to the estrogen in

247
00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:28.700
their bodies. And, um, those same women with higher

248
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.409
estrogen or who are more sensitive to estrogen, also,

249
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.630
um, are more fertile. And so this is, um,

250
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.289
people have tried to support this idea with evidence.

251
00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:44.159
Um, I would say the evidence is very weak,

252
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.659
and this is not, this hypothesis is not just

253
00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:49.179
restricted to breast. This is a huge sort of

254
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:54.200
branch of evolutionary biology. Um, ON why certain traits

255
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.719
like the peacock's feathers, like breasts in women. I

256
00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:00.320
mean, they're not traits necessarily tied to males or

257
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.280
females, but there are these traits that are, um,

258
00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:07.559
considered very attractive, um, sometimes very elaborate, and the

259
00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:10.000
question is why did they evolve? And there are

260
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.400
people who argue, oh, well, they evolved as signals

261
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.609
of quality of The individual who possesses that trait.

262
00:16:18.989 --> 00:16:22.150
Um, AND then the other idea is, in a

263
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.340
way much more simple and this actually goes back

264
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.580
to Darwin's ideas on sexual selection. Um, THE idea

265
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.619
is That animals, including humans, but all animals have

266
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:40.979
these arbitrary preferences, um, for beauty. Um, AND so

267
00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:44.219
at some point, you know, there was, there were

268
00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:48.940
some human females, our ancestors, who had slightly bigger

269
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.460
breasts, and males in that population thought that they

270
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.289
looked good. And this whole evolutionary process went into

271
00:16:58.289 --> 00:17:01.900
effect where more and more males find the fattier

272
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.709
breast attractive and um You know, there's this process

273
00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:10.270
called runaway selection, which basically results in sort of

274
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.189
this permanent body traits in women. Um, I wouldn't

275
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:16.989
say there's a lot of evidence for this idea

276
00:17:16.989 --> 00:17:19.339
either, um, but these are sort of the two

277
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.829
ideas that are being kicked around. And if you're

278
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.900
interested in the second idea that I mentioned, um,

279
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.829
there is an excellent book called The Evolution of

280
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.430
Beauty. I don't know if you've talked to Rick

281
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.750
Prum. Um, I worked with him briefly when I

282
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.300
was a graduate student. Um, BUT anyway, he wrote

283
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.969
an excellent book that, um, He's very passionate about

284
00:17:38.969 --> 00:17:41.099
this topic, so it's called the evolution of beauty,

285
00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:45.920
and he's really trying to revive Darwin's original ideas

286
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.219
on um sexual selection. Yeah.

287
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.689
So, and how about menstruation? How does it work

288
00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:58.020
and why is it that it first appears around

289
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.880
puberty in females?

290
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:05.609
OK, so how does it work? Um, Well, we

291
00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:09.290
know that the cycle's controlled by hormones, um, and

292
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.479
these are hormones produced both in the brain and

293
00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:17.020
hormones produced in the ovaries. And so, you know,

294
00:18:17.189 --> 00:18:19.270
we kind of split the cycle into two parts.

295
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.150
The first part of the cycle, um, is dominated

296
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:27.030
by estrogen. Estrogen is produced in the ovaries by

297
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.550
basically these things called follicles that are, um, that

298
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.790
contain our eggs. And so these follicles start producing

299
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.910
estrogen. And this estrogen is really important. It signals

300
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.829
all over the body, um, important places, it signals

301
00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:45.729
is to the brain. Um, AND then it also

302
00:18:45.729 --> 00:18:48.130
signals to the uterus. And so what it's telling

303
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.069
the uterus to do is Um, plump up, you

304
00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:57.930
know, make more cells so that in the event

305
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.229
that the female gets pregnant, you know, the, the

306
00:19:01.229 --> 00:19:04.300
uterus is ready for the baby. So estrogens telling,

307
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:09.969
telling the uterus, you know, make yourself thicker. Um,

308
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.089
IT'S a proliferative signal. It's basically telling cells in

309
00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:15.939
the uterus to divide. And then at some point,

310
00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:18.380
estrogen in this first half of the cycle reaches

311
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.739
this threshold, um, and it tells the brain, OK,

312
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.459
these eggs are ready, let's ovulate one. AND so

313
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.579
the brain sends messages to the ovaries to ovulate

314
00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:35.750
an egg. And what's left of that follicle, the,

315
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.449
the, that structure that houses the egg, that the

316
00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:42.050
cells that are left start producing progesterone. And so

317
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.729
the second half of the cycle is really dominated

318
00:19:44.729 --> 00:19:50.209
by progesterone. And progesterone is also sending signals, you

319
00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:54.369
know, to the body. Um, ONE of the important

320
00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:56.770
things that's telling the uterus to do, cause we're

321
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.609
talking here about menstruation, is Not to make more,

322
00:20:01.689 --> 00:20:05.410
it's not a proliferative signal, it's a transformative signal.

323
00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:07.729
So it's telling the cells of the uterus of

324
00:20:07.729 --> 00:20:11.719
the endometrium, the lining of the uterus, really to

325
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.630
um Get, get, get ready, you know, the cells

326
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.060
that are dividing, they would not be able to

327
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.579
support a pregnancy. You need those cells, but what

328
00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:24.260
you really need right before pregnancy is for those

329
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.780
cells to transform into a completely different state, you

330
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.969
know, they're called decidual cells. The term is unimportant.

331
00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:36.550
Um. And so, and those cells, once they transform,

332
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.410
they're dependent on progesterone. Um, AND progesterone is the

333
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.010
pregnancy hormone. So if you get pregnant, um, your

334
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.489
body keeps making progesterone. Ultimately in humans, this isn't

335
00:20:48.489 --> 00:20:50.939
true for all species, in humans, the plus the

336
00:20:51.739 --> 00:20:55.739
placenta, which is part of the baby, um, takes

337
00:20:55.739 --> 00:21:01.540
over the uh production of progesterone, but, um, Progesterone

338
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.750
is critical for pregnancy, and if you don't get

339
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.630
pregnant, then progesterone levels drop. So your body stops

340
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.709
making it. The signals from the baby aren't coming

341
00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:15.229
because there is no baby. Progesterone drops. And when

342
00:21:15.229 --> 00:21:19.430
you don't have progesterone, those cells of the endometrium

343
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:25.069
that have transformed, they self-destruct. Basically, those cells to

344
00:21:25.069 --> 00:21:30.030
stay alive, they require progesterone. And so that self-destruction

345
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.869
is really what starts menstruation. So you menstruate, you're

346
00:21:33.869 --> 00:21:37.229
back to day one, and then you sort of

347
00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.489
need to grow up your uterus again after menstruation

348
00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:43.750
because you've lost all of that tissue. And so,

349
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.949
we're back to estrogen in the first half of

350
00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:50.849
the cycle. Why does this start happening at puberty?

351
00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:58.530
Um, WELL, It isn't until puberty that the ovaries

352
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.969
start developing again. So they kind of paused their

353
00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:06.689
development in utero. They stopped making, you know, they

354
00:22:06.689 --> 00:22:09.969
were making hormones in utero. They stopped, the baby

355
00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:16.069
is born, pause development. And then Um, we don't

356
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:19.349
know exactly what the triggers of puberty are, but

357
00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:23.469
I, it's probably a combination of things, genetics, environmental

358
00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:27.469
signals, but at some point the body realizes, OK,

359
00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:31.430
I'm big enough, I'm fat enough, you know, you

360
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.469
need certain energy stores to be able to sustain

361
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:36.699
a pregnancy, and that's really what puberty is about.

362
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.589
It's the body thinks it's now ready to support

363
00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:43.359
a pregnancy. Um, AND so once it's getting this

364
00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:45.800
combination of signals, the pelvis, by the way, in

365
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.119
humans needs to be large enough to let a

366
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:51.920
baby pass through, so your bone development has to

367
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.920
reach a certain stage. Anyway, so once the brain

368
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.880
basically tells the rest of the body, we're ready,

369
00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:04.569
let's, let's, you know, kickstart puberty. Um, THE ovaries

370
00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:07.520
start to develop again and so then they start

371
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.479
producing the estrogen and all of the hormones needed

372
00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:14.119
to um get the cycles going.

373
00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:19.530
Uh, BUT why has menstruation evolved? I mean, what

374
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.689
is the point of uh females, women particularly uh

375
00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:29.089
experiencing this kind of bleeding? I mean, apart from

376
00:23:29.089 --> 00:23:33.050
it just simply being a consequence of uh getting

377
00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.810
rid of the cells that were in the uterus

378
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.810
prepared to receive a baby.

379
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.569
Yeah, that's a great question. I've thought a lot

380
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:45.729
about this professionally. Um, I mean, I think, first,

381
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.380
it's important to say that we're not the only

382
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.930
species to menstruate. So there are a few other

383
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.130
mamm, not a few, there are, I would say

384
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.329
about 80 species of mammals, and, you know, there

385
00:24:00.329 --> 00:24:02.770
are over 5000 species of mammals. So it's a

386
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.729
small percentage, say 1 to 2% of mammals menstruate.

387
00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:09.569
They're not all related to each other, so yes,

388
00:24:09.829 --> 00:24:13.140
the higher primates, so the monkeys and the apes

389
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.339
and obviously humans, all menstruate, which is, you know,

390
00:24:17.979 --> 00:24:20.699
not surprising because we're all closely related. So clearly

391
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:24.310
menstruation evolved in our ancestor. Um, BUT then there's

392
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.829
some other species, a few species of bats, one

393
00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:31.189
rodents, um, the elephant shrew, which is related to

394
00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:34.589
elephants. So this is really puzzling. Usually when you

395
00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:37.420
see a trait pop up in multiple sort of

396
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.709
places in our family tree of mammals, um, you

397
00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:47.130
wonder about traits like that. And so, To answer

398
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.689
the question, why do we menstruate? Well, the honest

399
00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:52.520
answer is we don't know, um, but I do

400
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.089
think that we have some really good leads on

401
00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:58.729
why. Um, AND so the first thing I will

402
00:24:58.729 --> 00:25:03.130
say is Me and my colleagues, we wrote about

403
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.089
this. We don't believe that the trait that needs

404
00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:10.069
explaining is menstruation. So that's not the trait that

405
00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:14.250
actually evolved. The trait that evolved, so menstruation, like

406
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:20.030
I described, is tied directly to the state of

407
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.150
those cells of the endometrium. So I, I described

408
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.410
those cells of the endometrium. In the first part

409
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.630
of the cycle, they make more of themselves and

410
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.859
then they transform. And once they transform their dependence

411
00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:36.500
on progesterone. All mammals have these cells, OK? All

412
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.199
mammals. With invasive placentas, we don't need to get

413
00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:42.640
into that. Let's say most mammals have these cells,

414
00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:47.670
these cells that basically build up, transform, and then

415
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.000
support a pregnancy if the female's pregnant. But most

416
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.160
mammals don't transform that tissue until a pregnancy. So

417
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.270
this is really a critical distinction between menstruating species

418
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.119
and non-menstruating species. In non-menstruating species, the cells of

419
00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:11.170
the uterus, they build up. And then nothing happens

420
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:16.569
until there's an actual fertilized egg that's traveling down

421
00:26:16.569 --> 00:26:20.930
the reproductive tract, and that and that developing embryo

422
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.599
starts to implant in the uterus. So for all,

423
00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:28.329
most, most mammals, it's the implantation that sends the

424
00:26:28.329 --> 00:26:33.209
signal to those cells to transform. In menstruating species,

425
00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:36.810
that's not what happens. What happens is every single

426
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:44.130
cycle, those cells become Um, ready for pregnancy. And

427
00:26:44.689 --> 00:26:47.810
once those cells become ready for pregnancy, whether it's

428
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.589
in a menstruating or non-menstruating species, once those cells

429
00:26:50.589 --> 00:26:54.079
transform, if you take away progesterone, they're gonna die.

430
00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.079
And so the trait that we think needs explaining

431
00:26:57.079 --> 00:27:03.140
is this trait of cyclical transformation of the endometrium

432
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.650
into that pregnancy state. That's, that's really what's the

433
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.849
puzzle, but why did that emerge? And I would

434
00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:14.170
say this this first part of this hypothesis is

435
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.880
pretty solid. Like there's a very tight correlation between

436
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.849
the species that menstruate and the species that transform

437
00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:24.000
their uterus, every cycle versus just when they're pregnant.

438
00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.800
And we also do lots of experiments in the

439
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.650
lab that show that those two traits are totally

440
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:35.479
tied. And so the sort of hypothesis really is

441
00:27:35.849 --> 00:27:39.599
why the cells transform in humans and other menstruating

442
00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:41.569
species. And I would say the best answer we

443
00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:46.290
have for that is we think, so those cells,

444
00:27:46.329 --> 00:27:53.050
once they transform, they become Like gatekeepers, so they

445
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:57.010
transform and they have this amazing ability once they

446
00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:04.119
transform to um Test the quality of the embryo.

447
00:28:04.609 --> 00:28:07.420
If the embryo has a lot of problems with

448
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.290
it, the those cells of the endometrium that have

449
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:16.260
transformed, they reject implantation. They don't let that developing

450
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.290
embryo implant into the uterus. And if the baby

451
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.770
is seems to be healthy and it's doing everything

452
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.390
it's supposed to be doing, then it will actually

453
00:28:26.689 --> 00:28:32.130
encapsulate that developing embryo and support its implantation. And

454
00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:36.920
One last piece of this, humans and potentially this

455
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.959
is the one part of the hypothesis that I

456
00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:43.079
think needs more support. Humans for certain, have much

457
00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:47.780
higher rates of unhealthy embryos than other species. For

458
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.400
a reason for reasons that we don't totally understand.

459
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.400
Humans make a lot of Developmentally abnormal embryos. And

460
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.959
so this mechanism of screening through embryos may have

461
00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:05.790
been really important for the reproductive success of females

462
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.520
of menstruating species. So that's, I'll leave it there,

463
00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:11.959
but, but I point out that it's still a

464
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:15.640
hypothesis. I would say to really prove this, or

465
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.310
to get more support for it, we would need

466
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:22.449
to Better understand the rate of chromosomal problems and

467
00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:25.849
developmental problems in other species that menstruate. And actually

468
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:29.250
we do have that data for rhesus monkeys. Rhesus

469
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.170
monkeys are like humans, because people, a lot of

470
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.729
people study monkeys um in laboratories and primate centers

471
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:42.680
and and Monkey, that species of monkey, um, also

472
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.000
has a comparable rate of of chromosomal problems, but

473
00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:51.000
I think we'd need to, um, we'd need that

474
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.479
data from other species to really support this idea

475
00:29:54.479 --> 00:30:00.930
that This cyclical transformation of the endometrium evolved, um.

476
00:30:02.089 --> 00:30:05.109
To, so that the uterus could be a better

477
00:30:05.109 --> 00:30:07.469
biosensor of embryo quality.

478
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.709
That is really fascinating. So let me ask you

479
00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:16.760
now about the female orgasm. Why is it considered

480
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.310
an evolutionary puzzle and the male orgasm is not?

481
00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:27.280
Yeah, great question. Um, The male orgasm is not

482
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.040
a puzzle, because it's directly tied to the reproductive

483
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.199
success of the male. So the male needs to

484
00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:37.910
have an orgasm to release sperm from his body.

485
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.839
So there's this direct connection between reproductive success and

486
00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:46.869
this traits of male orgasm. That is completely not

487
00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:50.239
the case in females, in human females at least.

488
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.479
And most of the work here has been done

489
00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:57.719
on humans. So in humans, There is no evidence

490
00:30:57.719 --> 00:31:00.489
that women, this is as a as an example,

491
00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:04.089
there's no evidence that women who have more orgasms

492
00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:07.119
have more babies. I mean, there's no connection there

493
00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:09.770
at all that we've been able to find. So

494
00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:14.359
that's the puzzle. Why does this complicated trait exist

495
00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:21.089
in um Women, if It has no bearing on

496
00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:22.359
their reproductive success.

497
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.380
OK, and so why does it exist?

498
00:31:26.619 --> 00:31:27.829
Is the is

499
00:31:27.829 --> 00:31:31.459
the female orgasm and an evolved adaptation?

500
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:40.849
Another very contentious topic, um, so I would say

501
00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:45.520
there are some people who argue, OK, yes, maybe

502
00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:49.849
the female orgasm isn't required, but maybe it helps

503
00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:55.540
reproductive success. So there are still people who Believe

504
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.270
this idea that female orgasm is tied to reproductive

505
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:04.410
success. Those people are, um, you know, in science,

506
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.829
we sometimes find this we're all human beings, like

507
00:32:06.829 --> 00:32:10.670
you get really attached to your idea, even though

508
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.270
all the evidence suggests that you're wrong. And I

509
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.349
would say that for this idea on the female

510
00:32:16.349 --> 00:32:20.239
orgasm, there really is no evidence that Women who

511
00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:24.560
orgasm easier or women who have more orgasms are

512
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.439
more successful reproductively. They don't have more babies, so

513
00:32:27.439 --> 00:32:29.760
there's really no evidence there. And then there's some

514
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.829
other people who argue. That it's just an accident.

515
00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:39.410
So, you know, females have orgasms really because males

516
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.530
and females develop very similarly when, you know, they're

517
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.180
in the womb. Um, AND so we develop all

518
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.260
the machinery to have an orgasm because very early

519
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.270
on males and females in development look the same.

520
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.859
So we have all of the machinery and the

521
00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:59.140
wiring to have an orgasm, really because males need

522
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.410
it. Um, BECAUSE it is so tied to males

523
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.119
reproductive. So that's one idea, and I think it

524
00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:07.130
makes a lot of sense. Um, AND then the

525
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.589
last idea, which is kind of newer, and actually

526
00:33:09.589 --> 00:33:13.180
it was put forth by my PhD advisor, so

527
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:19.109
I'm familiar with this hypothesis is The female orgasm

528
00:33:19.109 --> 00:33:24.180
in women now has no purpose, but they argue

529
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.869
that earlier in our mammalian history, and I would,

530
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.150
I think even earlier than that, like in the

531
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.500
very first those ammiots that I was talking about,

532
00:33:33.589 --> 00:33:38.489
the very first land animals, um. And I should

533
00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:41.089
say, cause we didn't get to this, other animals

534
00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:45.170
do have or orgasms. Um, THEY might not look

535
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.569
the same as a human orgasm, but, but, you

536
00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:49.609
know, a lot of the physical things that happen

537
00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:53.040
to a human during an orgasm also happen to

538
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.369
other animals, both males and females. So, um, that's

539
00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:00.239
sort of an important part of this story. Um,

540
00:34:00.489 --> 00:34:04.680
SO this Um, hypothesis put out by my PhD

541
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.050
adviser, and he actually has some support for it,

542
00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:10.958
is that Let's say stick with mammals. In the

543
00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:16.540
very first mammals. They didn't ovulate like humans. So

544
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.540
humans ovulate every cycle, you know, it's, it's sort

545
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.260
of like what happens in our uterus. Every cycle

546
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.139
our uterus gets ready for pregnancy. Every cycle, we're

547
00:34:27.458 --> 00:34:30.860
putting out an egg. There's no external signal needed

548
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.219
for that. Our bodies take care of ovulation all

549
00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.228
on their own. But in the very first mammals,

550
00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:39.540
and in a lot of mammals still today. The

551
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.050
way that they, the female ovulated is when she

552
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.820
was copulating with a male, so she only released

553
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.989
an egg during copulation. Um, AND this totally makes

554
00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.349
sense, right? You, you release an egg when it's

555
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:56.498
needed, right? And it's needed if there's sperm around

556
00:34:56.498 --> 00:34:59.469
to fertilize the egg. And so, I won't go

557
00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:01.709
into all the details of this hypothesis, but the

558
00:35:01.709 --> 00:35:06.979
idea is that in those in those um species

559
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.790
that were ovulating that way, the orgasm had a

560
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.870
very specific function, which was to signal to the

561
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:20.270
brain that copulation was happening. And um then the

562
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.860
brain tells the ovaries to release an egg. So

563
00:35:25.149 --> 00:35:30.520
really the function. Original function of the orgasm, according

564
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.280
to this hypothesis, was to ovulate. Um, IT was

565
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.110
like a way for the brain to know that

566
00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:43.959
copulation was happening and it's time to release an

567
00:35:43.959 --> 00:35:46.040
egg. And the, you know, there's a lot of

568
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.639
support for this. I think it's interesting. In humans,

569
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:52.330
we don't ovulate that way anymore, so it's just

570
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.610
a relic of this sort of past um history.

571
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.870
Anyway, so 3 ideas, I would say, um, and

572
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.179
we don't have the answer.

573
00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:05.949
Yeah, fair enough. And, and, but do we know

574
00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:09.989
if the female orgasm serves any functions apart from

575
00:36:09.989 --> 00:36:14.149
just uh allowing women to experience a particular kind

576
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:17.159
of uh women or females. Experience a particular kind

577
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:20.239
of pleasure. I mean, you said that women who

578
00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:25.280
orgasm are not more reproductively successful than women or

579
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.639
females who don't orgasm, but are there any other

580
00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:31.560
functions that the orgasm might serve or not?

581
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.850
I, I don't believe there to be other functions,

582
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.100
um, which is kind of wonderful for women, that

583
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:45.139
it's purely a, a trait for pleasure, um, but

584
00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.340
that's not to say that it didn't have a

585
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.739
function like I just said, in our historical, you

586
00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:54.379
know, prehistorical past. So I think it may have

587
00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.179
had a very important function, and I think it

588
00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:59.510
still has that function in some mammals. So rabbits,

589
00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:04.699
for example, and, and my adviser who put this

590
00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:07.100
idea out there has actually done an experiments on

591
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.610
rabbits to kind of find support for this idea.

592
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:15.129
They ovulate during copulation. Um, SO I think This

593
00:37:15.129 --> 00:37:18.570
is, this is true of many traits. Um, SOME

594
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.850
of these traits are so old, and, um, you

595
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.649
know, like the human appendix, you know, that's a

596
00:37:25.649 --> 00:37:27.570
trait that had some function a long time ago,

597
00:37:27.649 --> 00:37:30.129
but it doesn't anymore. And so, you know, you

598
00:37:30.129 --> 00:37:33.489
see sometimes these traits that are sort of relics

599
00:37:33.489 --> 00:37:36.280
of something that was important a long time ago,

600
00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:39.530
like millions, hundreds of millions of years ago. And

601
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.300
so, I think if the orgasm had a function,

602
00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:47.300
you know, it could have been tied to ovulation.

603
00:37:47.709 --> 00:37:50.469
Um, DOES it still have a function in women

604
00:37:50.469 --> 00:37:53.030
other than bringing pleasure, I don't believe so. I,

605
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.139
I don't, I haven't seen any data to suggest

606
00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:58.149
that it has another function.

607
00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:02.229
Another thing that you talk about in the book

608
00:38:02.229 --> 00:38:05.590
is love. So how do you approach love from

609
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.590
an evolutionary perspective?

610
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.679
Yes, um, this is actually one of my favorite

611
00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:15.899
chapters to write because I knew the least about

612
00:38:15.899 --> 00:38:19.020
this topic. Some of the topics I knew I

613
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.709
was very intimately familiar with like pregnancy and um.

614
00:38:25.379 --> 00:38:28.320
Menstruation, you know, uh, some of the things that

615
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.120
we're, we've already discussed, um, Yes. I didn't know

616
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.159
much about this branch of evolutionary biology, which really

617
00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:40.709
is, I would say, the branch that studies mate

618
00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:45.870
choices. So, love in humans is thought to be

619
00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:51.489
an elaboration of All of the systems in the

620
00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:54.300
brain that are involved in mate choices and other

621
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.209
animals. And so we know from studying other animals

622
00:38:57.209 --> 00:39:01.449
that they're evaluating mates. I mean, birds are a

623
00:39:01.449 --> 00:39:07.090
great um group to really understand mate choice because

624
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.669
um they're doing some just really amazing things like

625
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.679
The elaborate plumage, some of the dancing that, you

626
00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:19.129
know, some males will do to attract females. Um,

627
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.479
THE choices that females are making while she's evaluating

628
00:39:22.479 --> 00:39:29.520
males, so it's this whole, um, Sort of area

629
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.040
in evolutionary biology that is trying to understand what

630
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.639
mate choices are being made, why are they they

631
00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:40.639
being made. And love, I would describe as sort

632
00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:45.199
of an elaboration of um mate choices in other

633
00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:46.000
animals.

634
00:39:47.149 --> 00:39:51.270
And is there anything particular about female love?

635
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:58.969
Yes, that's a great question. So, We'll make it

636
00:39:58.969 --> 00:40:03.770
more general and say female mate choices, um, and

637
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:08.590
I would say that If you look across animals.

638
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.679
It's usually the females that are making the choices.

639
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.879
It's not always true, but it's usually the females

640
00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:24.010
that are evaluating and making the choice. It's usually

641
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:28.969
not the male. The male is showing off, showing

642
00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:33.860
off his feathers, doing his dance, um, bringing Um,

643
00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:37.219
presence, you know, maybe food items or whatever it

644
00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:41.489
might be. Again, I'm talking generally across animals. It's

645
00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:44.500
usually the females who are making the choices. And

646
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.459
the reason for that, we think, is that it

647
00:40:47.459 --> 00:40:52.979
is usually the females who invest very heavily in

648
00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:56.500
reproduction. So if you think about a female monkey

649
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.870
or really any female mammal. The female is going

650
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.919
to spend a long time being pregnant. The female

651
00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:07.250
is gonna spend a long time nursing. If it's

652
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:11.719
a primate, you know, there's additional work involved, especially,

653
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.360
you know, the human primates. So it's a huge

654
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.540
investment. And so the thought is and You know,

655
00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:24.659
part of this hypothesis is supported by cases where

656
00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:27.290
the situation is reversed, where males are doing most

657
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:32.820
of the um caregiving and investing more care. Um,

658
00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.110
The thought is, when you're making such a huge

659
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.909
investment in reproduction, Who you choose, who you fall

660
00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:45.159
in love with, quote unquote, is really important because

661
00:41:45.159 --> 00:41:48.949
it that's the only place where you have a

662
00:41:48.949 --> 00:41:54.439
chance to um Decide the quality of that offspring,

663
00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:57.750
you know, you wanna choose a male who is

664
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.000
very attractive because maybe those babies then will be

665
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.500
very attractive, and they will be able to be

666
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.719
successful reproductively and have more offspring. Um, YOU want

667
00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:11.189
a male who brings you food and helps you,

668
00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:14.449
um, reproduce better, you know, helps your pregnancy go

669
00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:19.669
smoother, whatever it is, um. There are cases where

670
00:42:19.669 --> 00:42:22.189
the situation is reversed, males do most of the

671
00:42:22.189 --> 00:42:26.070
caregiving, and in those cases, it's the males who

672
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:31.389
are evaluating and choosing and um quote unquote, falling

673
00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:36.139
in love. Um, SO, I, I think a lot

674
00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:44.739
of These decisions have to do with um Reproductive

675
00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:47.939
investment. Who's doing the investing? And in some species,

676
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.750
both male and female are are investing heavily. Like

677
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.790
I would argue in our species, both male and

678
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.870
female. Obviously the female, she's going through pregnancy, she's

679
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:02.629
nursing her baby. That is an incredibly long commitment,

680
00:43:02.939 --> 00:43:04.830
and she can only have one or two babies

681
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.830
at a time, whereas a male can go off

682
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.659
and have, you know, an infinite number of children,

683
00:43:09.669 --> 00:43:13.159
really. Like, he's only limited by sperm production. But

684
00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:15.639
humans are different, human males are different from other

685
00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:19.159
primates. They do invest a lot more in caregiving,

686
00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:21.040
and this is a trait we see across all

687
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.909
human populations. It's not just a modern trait. It's,

688
00:43:24.919 --> 00:43:29.310
it's really something that's widespread. So, um, that's why

689
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.439
in humans, you know, there are choices being made

690
00:43:33.439 --> 00:43:35.320
both by males and females, and you could say

691
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.310
that we're both, we both can fall in love,

692
00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:45.139
um. You know, because we're Uh, I would argue

693
00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:50.060
it's because, you know, it really stems from, um,

694
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.500
both male and female really investing heavily in reproduction.

695
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.530
Mhm. Uh, EARLIER you mentioned pregnancy, so let's talk

696
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.399
a little bit about that now. How has pregnancy

697
00:44:02.399 --> 00:44:04.729
evolved in human females?

698
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.939
So, pregnancy is a fascinating trait. It's probably not

699
00:44:12.939 --> 00:44:16.090
one that a lot of people think about. Um,

700
00:44:16.949 --> 00:44:20.780
I would say. The first thing that it's important

701
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.050
to realize is that not All mammals get pregnant.

702
00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:27.860
I think I mentioned this before, the very first

703
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:33.939
mammals laid eggs, and so something happens. In our

704
00:44:33.939 --> 00:44:38.419
evolutionary history, where we went from laying eggs to

705
00:44:38.419 --> 00:44:43.340
actually developing our very young um offspring inside our

706
00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.419
bodies, and mammals weren't the only animals to do

707
00:44:46.419 --> 00:44:50.750
this. So this, this transition to pregnancy from laying

708
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.179
eggs has happened over 100 times, believe it or

709
00:44:54.179 --> 00:44:58.110
not. Um, SO it's happened in reptiles, it's happened,

710
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.899
um, it has not happened in birds, um, but

711
00:45:00.899 --> 00:45:05.250
it's happened many, many times in reptiles, interestingly. And

712
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.370
what's really interesting about that is that it usually

713
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:14.010
happens in places that um are very cold and

714
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.489
the altitude is very high. And so I think

715
00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:20.010
that tells you something about what the advantages of

716
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.969
pregnancy are. Um. You know, imagine you're laying your

717
00:45:23.969 --> 00:45:26.709
eggs, you're a mammal, and imagine it's a freezing

718
00:45:26.709 --> 00:45:31.379
day and all your eggs die. Um, SO I

719
00:45:31.379 --> 00:45:34.199
think in certain environments, it makes a lot more

720
00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:38.290
sense to rather than leaving your offspring to develop

721
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:42.020
out in the open, you're, you know, you're taking

722
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.139
some control over that development by keeping retaining those

723
00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:48.590
babies in your body. Um, AND this was a

724
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.590
game changer for mammals. I mean, I said mammals

725
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.030
were very successful as a group because of mammary

726
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.189
glands, but really, they're really successful mammals, the ones

727
00:45:58.189 --> 00:46:01.419
that just went all over the planet, and they're

728
00:46:01.419 --> 00:46:05.669
so, most species of mammals, except for the few

729
00:46:05.669 --> 00:46:08.750
that we've been talking about, the platypus, the echidna,

730
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.229
there are some marsupials that don't have a full

731
00:46:11.229 --> 00:46:14.870
fledged placenta, but the really successful group of mammals

732
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.820
are the ones that have a placenta. So, anyway,

733
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:21.780
um, humans, you know, are part of this story,

734
00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:24.229
but they're not the beginning of the story. The

735
00:46:24.229 --> 00:46:27.060
beginning of the story is how that transition from

736
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.149
egg laying to Um, growing your babies inside your

737
00:46:31.149 --> 00:46:34.030
body, how that transition happened. I've been very interested

738
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:38.139
in that transition from a mechanistic standpoint, like, how

739
00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:41.139
did it happen? And it really needed changes both

740
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.020
in the baby and the mother. So the mother

741
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.270
needed to change her uterus, um, in order to

742
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:53.659
accept this foreign half foreign object. Um, SHE needed

743
00:46:53.659 --> 00:46:55.580
lots of changes to her immune system, to the

744
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.179
uterus itself, um, and then the baby, of course,

745
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.979
needed to develop tissues that are able to invade

746
00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.419
the mother and get what it needs from the

747
00:47:05.419 --> 00:47:08.629
mother. And we don't need to get into the

748
00:47:08.629 --> 00:47:11.389
mechanisms here, but, um, a lot of my work

749
00:47:11.389 --> 00:47:16.169
has focused on a certain type of element, genetic

750
00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:18.429
element. It's, it's, it's a, it's almost like a

751
00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:20.719
genetic virus. You can think of it as this

752
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.500
entity that spreads all across genomes, and over half

753
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.989
the human genome really originates from these genomic parasites,

754
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.979
these like viruses that spread all around. And so

755
00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:35.929
we think that pregnancy and mammals at least evolved

756
00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:39.659
by the spreading of these parasites all around the

757
00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:44.250
genome, and that enabled this huge change to happen.

758
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.620
I mean, it's a really remarkable um set of

759
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.070
change, not just one change, this whole set of

760
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.419
changes that needed to happen.

761
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:56.219
But in the case of women, what are the

762
00:47:56.219 --> 00:48:00.060
most common complications associated with pregnancy?

763
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:12.360
Women, complications, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia? Miscarriage, and I touched

764
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.199
on the miscarriage earlier, that is likely tied to

765
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:22.239
This, this huge number of, you know, developmentally abnormal

766
00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:27.250
embryos that humans make. Um, PRETERM labor certainly is

767
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:32.939
one, infection, so, um, There are a lot of

768
00:48:32.939 --> 00:48:37.330
complications, unfortunately, um. I would say those are the

769
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:37.959
most common.

770
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.189
Um, ARE some of those complications related to the

771
00:48:43.189 --> 00:48:45.469
fact that we are bipedal?

772
00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:56.270
Yes, well, I think the We have a difficult

773
00:48:56.270 --> 00:49:00.790
time giving birth and You know, the reason for

774
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.919
that has to do with us being bipedal. Um,

775
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.510
YOU know, we have certain constraints on our pelvis,

776
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:10.870
the shape of our pelvis, um, when we You

777
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:14.709
know, our ancestors started to stand up right? And

778
00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:17.830
we also make babies with very large heads. But

779
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:22.469
I would, honestly, I would say that those obstetric

780
00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:25.949
issues are less of an issue than some of

781
00:49:25.949 --> 00:49:31.459
those other diseases I mentioned, like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,

782
00:49:31.909 --> 00:49:37.090
um. I think You know, it makes childbirth very

783
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:43.270
difficult for us, but it's, it's not, um, you

784
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:46.570
know, in places where there isn't, um, there aren't

785
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:52.050
hospitals, um, it is not the obstetrical issues are

786
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.489
not a major problem. I mean, they are a

787
00:49:54.489 --> 00:49:57.810
problem, but I think these other cases, you know,

788
00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:02.909
of diabetes and preeclampsia are probably bigger issues. Mhm.

789
00:50:03.469 --> 00:50:07.820
And what characterizes motherhood in humans specifically?

790
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:17.320
Oh my gosh, that's a big question. Um, I

791
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.030
would say that. I mean, I'm a biologist, so

792
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.870
I focus on the biology. I would say that

793
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.689
some of The way that we think about motherhood

794
00:50:27.689 --> 00:50:29.330
and the way we mother. Some of it is

795
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.360
certainly influenced by the cultures in which we live.

796
00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:36.449
Absolutely. But I would also argue, and again, I,

797
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.729
I can't help it. I'm a biologist. I would

798
00:50:38.729 --> 00:50:42.270
also argue that biology plays a major role in

799
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:46.040
how we mother and You know, so one thing

800
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.399
that we know is when we're pregnant and when

801
00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:54.080
we give birth, that Affects the hormones that we're

802
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:59.750
making. Um, THAT affects our brains. It affects, it,

803
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.679
it actually affects the structure of our brains. So

804
00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:07.500
there are some major changes, physiological and even anatomical

805
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.360
changes that are happening in our bodies as we

806
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:19.070
engage in motherhood. And so, Um, I think You

807
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:25.620
know, it's this complex interplay between, you know, cultural

808
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:29.669
um influences, but also biological influences. And one thing

809
00:51:29.669 --> 00:51:35.909
I would say is From the evolutionary biological perspective,

810
00:51:36.239 --> 00:51:39.879
mothers evolved to be very flexible, human mothers, but

811
00:51:39.879 --> 00:51:43.600
also other animal mothers. So there is no one

812
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.250
way to do anything. Um, WE actually evolved to

813
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:50.409
be very flexible in how much care we give

814
00:51:50.409 --> 00:51:54.290
our offspring, um, who we're investing in at any

815
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.929
one given time. So, you know, the most successful

816
00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:00.209
mothers in the past were the ones who are

817
00:52:00.209 --> 00:52:07.899
very flexible and considering all their options. Um, And

818
00:52:07.899 --> 00:52:11.179
then a whole other sort of area that we

819
00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:14.899
haven't touched on too much is this idea of

820
00:52:14.899 --> 00:52:18.860
conflicts. So, you know, maybe we can touch on

821
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:31.280
that now, um. Certainly. Mothers evolved. Certain behaviors and

822
00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:36.959
um. You know, hormonal thing, you know, the evolution

823
00:52:36.959 --> 00:52:39.639
of hormones and their responses and, you know, all

824
00:52:39.639 --> 00:52:47.520
of that affects. Maternal behaviors with our children and

825
00:52:48.189 --> 00:52:52.229
To a certain extent for sure, we want our

826
00:52:52.229 --> 00:52:56.679
children to succeed. We want them to um You

827
00:52:56.679 --> 00:52:58.879
know, we want them to, again, in an evolutionary

828
00:52:58.879 --> 00:53:01.639
bio biological sense, we, we, we want them to

829
00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:06.250
succeed and reproduce themselves. Those, you know, that's ultimately,

830
00:53:06.679 --> 00:53:10.399
um, what makes us as mothers successful. Again, not,

831
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.750
uh, not, I'm not speaking as a human mother.

832
00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:16.439
Um, I'm speaking from, you know, the perspective of,

833
00:53:16.469 --> 00:53:21.639
of biology. Um, AND so there has to be

834
00:53:21.639 --> 00:53:24.649
a cooperative nature to that relationship. The mom and

835
00:53:24.649 --> 00:53:28.770
the baby need to cooperate for, um, that baby

836
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.330
to grow up successfully and then go on and

837
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.209
have their own kids. But there is an element

838
00:53:34.209 --> 00:53:37.649
of conflict in this relationship between moms and their

839
00:53:37.649 --> 00:53:42.050
children. And the ultimate reason for that is that

840
00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:45.169
moms and each child that they have, they're not

841
00:53:45.169 --> 00:53:51.870
genetically identical. And That sets up a situation where

842
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:55.239
what's best for the genes and the mom might

843
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:57.800
not be what's best for the genes in any

844
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.479
one child. The mom is thinking evolved to be

845
00:54:02.479 --> 00:54:07.239
thinking about um her reproductive success overall. And this

846
00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:10.080
is this isn't conscious. I don't mean she's actively

847
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.689
thinking about this, but You know, the decisions that

848
00:54:12.689 --> 00:54:17.919
moms make, um, they're, they're considering the whole package,

849
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.169
like, how successful am I gonna be as a

850
00:54:20.169 --> 00:54:23.689
mother over my whole life. The moms who raised

851
00:54:23.689 --> 00:54:27.010
more babies successfully did better, and the traits that

852
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:29.290
she had that allowed her to do better, those

853
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.000
are the ones that get propagated over time. It's

854
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.689
a very different story for the babies. The babies.

855
00:54:37.389 --> 00:54:43.020
Again, this is because of genetics. They are really

856
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:47.239
thinking about themselves, right? The babies that extracted as

857
00:54:47.239 --> 00:54:49.959
much as possible from their mothers, potentially at the

858
00:54:49.959 --> 00:54:53.040
expense of a sibling, or potentially at the expense

859
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.360
of the mother, those babies did better. And so

860
00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:02.010
there's this Underlying tension and, you know, you really

861
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:08.350
see that tension during pregnancy, um. Babies, because pregnancy

862
00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:12.459
in humans and other species with invasive placentas, because

863
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.149
these, the mom and the baby are so intimately

864
00:55:16.149 --> 00:55:21.060
connected physically, so the baby is like directly bathed

865
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.790
in the mother's blood. I mean, it's a very

866
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:28.070
intimate connection that interface, the placenta really is where

867
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:31.550
it all happens. The baby is dumping all of

868
00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:35.040
these hormones into the mother that are essentially manipulating

869
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.520
her to do things that the baby wants, like,

870
00:55:37.639 --> 00:55:40.879
give me more food. The baby wants it all.

871
00:55:41.439 --> 00:55:46.000
The mother wants that any one baby to make

872
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.919
it through pregnancy and, you know, survive and, you

873
00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:52.679
know, be successful, but not at the expense of

874
00:55:52.679 --> 00:55:55.679
her own health, not at the expense of potentially

875
00:55:55.679 --> 00:55:59.919
future offspring. So, um, we see a lot of

876
00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:04.709
evidence of this where, um, You know, babies have

877
00:56:04.709 --> 00:56:08.669
certain there during pregnancy, they're producing certain molecules. Once

878
00:56:08.669 --> 00:56:10.870
the babies are born, they have certain behaviors that

879
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:15.189
are really manipulative behaviors like give me more, and

880
00:56:15.189 --> 00:56:20.229
this really all stems from dad's genes, uh, whereas

881
00:56:20.229 --> 00:56:23.629
moms, you see lots of evidence of restraint, like,

882
00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:26.590
yes, I wanna give you this, but not too

883
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:31.629
much, um, and so, you know, you've got this.

884
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.239
Cooperative, but also this underlying tension that underlies sort

885
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:41.080
of the relationship between mom and child.

886
00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:47.040
So that covers the topic of mother offspring conflict.

887
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.879
Let me get into the last trait I would

888
00:56:50.879 --> 00:56:53.679
like to ask you about today. So, what is

889
00:56:53.679 --> 00:56:56.629
menopause and how has it evolved?

890
00:56:58.739 --> 00:57:05.179
Right, so menopause is obviously the end of reproductive

891
00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:08.219
function. So in humans, it's the end of menstrual

892
00:57:08.219 --> 00:57:13.689
periods. It happens about 50 in our species. Um,

893
00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:16.659
THERE are a lot of theories on why it

894
00:57:16.659 --> 00:57:24.770
evolved. I don't think menopause itself is what's so

895
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.120
interesting. Because, you know, just a tiny bit of

896
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:34.719
background. All mammals and all birds. They make all

897
00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:39.229
their eggs up front, so they're born with all

898
00:57:39.229 --> 00:57:42.159
the eggs they will ever have. And so if

899
00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:45.560
you're a mammal or if you're a bird, if

900
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.719
you live long enough, you will go through menopause.

901
00:57:47.879 --> 00:57:50.479
So really the trait that's unusual in humans and

902
00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:52.760
a few other species because we're not the only

903
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.080
animals to go through menopause. What's really interesting is

904
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.479
this extended period of life that we have after

905
00:57:59.479 --> 00:58:05.419
menopause. Um, And there are many ideas on why

906
00:58:05.419 --> 00:58:10.820
that postmenopausal life stage exists. Some of those ideas

907
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:17.879
are adaptive ideas, like, they suggest that There was

908
00:58:17.879 --> 00:58:24.469
some purpose that menopause and this postmenopausal life stage,

909
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.189
um, It it evolved for a purpose, right? And

910
00:58:29.189 --> 00:58:33.110
then other folks will say, well, it's there's no

911
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.709
reason for it, it's just, it just happened like.

912
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.229
You know, our eggs don't last, can't last long

913
00:58:40.229 --> 00:58:44.149
enough. So, and but we started living longer. So,

914
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:47.149
you know, there are sort of two, there's a

915
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:50.909
big debate on, you know, whether it served a

916
00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:54.389
purpose, sort of this stopping reproduction and living for

917
00:58:54.389 --> 00:58:57.199
so long afterwards, um, or if it's just an

918
00:58:57.199 --> 00:59:00.260
artifact um that has no function.

919
00:59:01.969 --> 00:59:05.489
And I, I mean, what is the relationship between

920
00:59:05.489 --> 00:59:07.810
menopause and longevity?

921
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.030
Yeah, that's a great question, because, so I mentioned

922
00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:17.020
the other species that have menopause. It's 4 or

923
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.500
5 species of toothed whales, so beluga whales, narwhals,

924
00:59:21.729 --> 00:59:29.280
killer whales, and short-finned pilot whales. And they all

925
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.379
live a long time. Um, AND it's not just

926
00:59:32.379 --> 00:59:34.300
that they live a long time. If you compare

927
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:39.889
them to closely related species, they live longer than

928
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.979
animals they're closely related to of about the same

929
00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:48.409
size. So it's certainly related to longevity. That said,

930
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.770
there are some animals that have extreme longevity that

931
00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:57.100
don't appear to go through menopause. So, Uh, another

932
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:03.060
land mammal, the African elephants, has a lifespan that's

933
01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.340
similar to humans, but they reproduce over a decade

934
01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.699
longer than humans. So just because you live a

935
01:00:09.699 --> 01:00:12.219
long time does not mean you must go through

936
01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:14.699
menopause, if that makes sense. I'm really interested in

937
01:00:14.699 --> 01:00:18.780
a species of whale, not the menopausal whales, but

938
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.020
a species of baleen whale that Has a very

939
01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.899
long, it's like the longest lived mammal, it's the

940
01:00:24.899 --> 01:00:27.939
bowhead whale, and it doesn't appear to go through

941
01:00:27.939 --> 01:00:32.810
menopause. So there's evidence of these whales reproducing um

942
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.610
in into, you know, over over 100 years old.

943
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.250
Um, SO, tied to longevity, yes, but that's not,

944
01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:45.129
that can't explain it all.

945
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.520
OK, so one last question then and still on

946
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.399
the topic of menopause or at least related to

947
01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:56.469
it. What do you make of the grandmother hypothesis?

948
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.879
Oh, I think there are different, so there are

949
01:01:02.879 --> 01:01:06.969
different versions of it first of all. One version

950
01:01:06.969 --> 01:01:13.159
of it. Just describes the longevity piece. So that

951
01:01:13.159 --> 01:01:18.959
version says, well, we inherited menopause at 50, because

952
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:22.610
chimps, our closest primate relatives, go through menopause at

953
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.610
50. So, we inherited menopause. And then we, but

954
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.489
so the real difference that needs to, um, that

955
01:01:30.489 --> 01:01:33.159
we need to understand is why do humans live

956
01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:38.189
so much longer than chimps. And so one Um,

957
01:01:39.149 --> 01:01:42.520
Version of the grandmother hypothesis tries to explain that

958
01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:47.850
why humans started living longer and it really Centers

959
01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:54.050
around maternal grandmothers and sort of this new behavior

960
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.770
that evolved in humans on the part of maternal

961
01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:02.310
grandmothers, which is that they started um Breeding more

962
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.459
cooperatively. All that means is they started to play

963
01:02:05.459 --> 01:02:08.820
a much bigger role in family life. So, this

964
01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:12.379
idea was really mainly developed by um an anthropologist

965
01:02:12.379 --> 01:02:16.300
who studied the Hadza tribe in Tanzania, and she

966
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.209
noticed that in this tribe, the grandmothers have a

967
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:24.010
Very important role, which is digging up these very

968
01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:27.939
hard tubers from the ground and processing them and

969
01:02:27.939 --> 01:02:31.280
feeding it to the grandchildren. So the idea is

970
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.629
in human populations where grandmothers were engaging in these,

971
01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:41.449
these behaviors, that Helps The descendants of that grandmother,

972
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:44.739
there were more of them because she was helping

973
01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:49.840
her daughter reproduce and helping her grandchildren eat, and

974
01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:55.969
Again, this idea really suggests that because of that

975
01:02:55.969 --> 01:02:59.340
new behavior, this grandmothering behavior, that extended the human

976
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.520
lifespan longer and longer. I think there's some weaknesses

977
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.879
to that hypothesis. The other version of the hypothesis

978
01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:10.500
is not just that that behavior extended the human

979
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.939
lifespan, but also that it The women who were

980
01:03:14.939 --> 01:03:19.620
grandmothering. They had to stop reproducing in order to

981
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:24.370
do that effectively. Um, SO there's also a version

982
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:28.239
of it, like I said, that explains why menopause

983
01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:31.159
has to happen at 50 in our species, because,

984
01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.979
you know, the age of menopause can evolve. I

985
01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:38.050
mean, You know, it doesn't, you know, there are

986
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:41.010
animals with very different lifespans, and they have very

987
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:44.330
different reproductive life spans. So, you know, menopause is

988
01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.770
not something that has to be fixed at a

989
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:51.129
certain time. Um, FOR whatever reason in humans, it

990
01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:55.169
did not move since um our last common ancestor

991
01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:57.770
with chimps. I think there's a lot more to

992
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.489
this story. We don't, I don't know that we

993
01:03:59.489 --> 01:04:03.360
have time to get into it, but um, I

994
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.120
think so, in summary of my thoughts on the

995
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.919
grandmother hypo hypothesis, I think it might be part

996
01:04:08.919 --> 01:04:12.639
of the story. We certainly, the human lineage certainly

997
01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:17.820
evolved new behaviors like grandmothering, um. But I think

998
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.570
in general, we became a much more cooperative species,

999
01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:24.820
so I don't know that grandmothering itself was like

1000
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.179
the critical behavior. I think it was, you know,

1001
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.979
a more general behavior that evolved in humans that

1002
01:04:29.979 --> 01:04:33.060
I do, excuse me, I do think contributed to

1003
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.239
human longevity, um. I don't know that we have

1004
01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:42.659
a good understanding of why. Our reproductive lifespan didn't

1005
01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:44.939
also extend. I mean, I think that's an open

1006
01:04:44.939 --> 01:04:45.409
question.

1007
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.459
Uh, I mean, uh, by the way, related to

1008
01:04:49.459 --> 01:04:52.610
that, let me just ask you one more question.

1009
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.489
So, do we know if children who have grandmothers

1010
01:04:57.699 --> 01:05:00.330
have higher fitness in any way?

1011
01:05:01.479 --> 01:05:04.449
So that's when I said the evidence is mixed,

1012
01:05:04.649 --> 01:05:07.320
that's really what I'm talking about. So in some

1013
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.570
populations that have been studied, the presence of a

1014
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:17.189
grandmother. Helps survival, but in others it does nothing,

1015
01:05:17.479 --> 01:05:20.959
and in others it actually might detract from your

1016
01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:29.459
success. So I think the demographic conditions. In which

1017
01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:32.510
these traits were evolving were really critical. And so

1018
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:36.250
when we're studying modern populations, it's hard to capture

1019
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:40.790
exactly what the situation was in ancestral humans. Um

1020
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.860
But certainly there are some populations where the presence

1021
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.689
of the maternal grandmother or even a paternal grandmother,

1022
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:52.489
um, It is a good thing for grandchildren. It

1023
01:05:52.489 --> 01:05:56.570
helps them, more of them survive, absolutely. It's just

1024
01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.169
not across the board in all populations that have

1025
01:05:59.169 --> 01:06:00.810
been studied. Mhm.

1026
01:06:01.489 --> 01:06:04.689
OK, great. So the book is again a brief

1027
01:06:04.689 --> 01:06:07.770
history of the female body, an evolutionary look at

1028
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:10.010
how and why the female form came to be.

1029
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.199
I'm leaving the link to it in the description

1030
01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:15.629
of the interview. And Doctor Amir, uh, apart from

1031
01:06:15.629 --> 01:06:18.219
the book, would you like to tell people where

1032
01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:20.699
they can find you and your work on the

1033
01:06:20.699 --> 01:06:20.989
internet?

1034
01:06:21.919 --> 01:06:24.600
Yes, um, I have a website that's probably the

1035
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:29.000
easiest place to go, Dina Amera.com. Um, I'm also

1036
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.199
on Instagram and LinkedIn and all those places, um,

1037
01:06:32.399 --> 01:06:34.229
so yeah, you can just type in my name

1038
01:06:34.229 --> 01:06:34.919
and look me up.

1039
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.780
Great. So thank you so much for taking the

1040
01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.620

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.739
real pleasure and very fun to talk with you.

1042
01:06:43.679 --> 01:06:45.100
Thank you so much. I had a lot of

1043
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.649
fun as well.
