00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.299
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.989
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops and

3
00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:09.260
to the agenda I'm joined by Doctor Wade Ellison.

4
00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.350
He is Emeritus Professor in the Department of Physics

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.909
at the University of Oxford. He is the author

6
00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.790
of several books including Nuclear is for Life, a

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.985
Cultural Revolution. And radiation and reason, the impact of

8
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:25.204
science on the culture of fear. And today we're,

9
00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.125
we're going to start by talking about energy in

10
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:32.465
general, but then we'll move to talking about nuclear

11
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.264
energy in particular. So Doctor Ellison, welcome to the

12
00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:38.145
show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.680
Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.

14
00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:46.630
OK, so, uh, let's start by talking about energy

15
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.430
in general, as I mentioned. What is the connection

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.590
between energy and life?

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810
Well, I think this goes right the way back,

18
00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:02.779
uh. Life is about making choices, it's about being

19
00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:06.480
able to do this or that, moving to have

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.970
control of your environment. And you need energy to

21
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.349
do anything. And in a, a world which is

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.180
increasingly seems to be chaotic, uh, the power of

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.480
natural science and its predictability is very comforting and

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.959
useful, uh, and that is what I have built

25
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.940
my uh my uh career on. Teaching and lecturing

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.180
and doing experiments at CERN places er and understanding

27
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.569
about energy and then teaching people in schools and

28
00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.959
occasions like this, I hope. Mhm.

29
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.839
So, so in your work, I read about 4

30
00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.260
energy revolutions that have occurred since life began on

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.269
Earth. Could you tell us about those 4 energy

32
00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:05.559
revolutions and would there also be a 5th? And

33
00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.400
if so, what would it be?

34
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.199
Well, I found it rather rewarding to think back

35
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.210
that when life began on Earth, of course, there

36
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.410
was only the sunlight and wind and rain, uh,

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.970
and they were weak and unreliable, uh, but that

38
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.220
is the only thing available, and in the winter.

39
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.949
Life had to stop, the plants dropped seeds, uh,

40
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.720
and they were ready for the next year or

41
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.889
they lost their leaves and uh so. At the

42
00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:52.809
very beginning, possibly between 3 and 1000 million years

43
00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:57.649
ago, uh it was uh sunlight and wind and

44
00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:02.490
rain, uh, with all their seasonal and daily uh

45
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.750
uh variations and, um. That of course continues today,

46
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.429
and those are what we call renewables. And then,

47
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.639
The next revolution came not by anything that we

48
00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.960
did, but what nature found by evolution, and that

49
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.360
is the amazing ability to carry energy around with

50
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.220
you. In your own body, that is to say,

51
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.779
the whole food and digestive system, and this was

52
00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:40.130
the animal period, and animals and fish and birds,

53
00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.399
um, and, and this was a a a a

54
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.699
a huge step forward because uh the animals could

55
00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.220
move from one place to another, according to the

56
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.210
season, uh and uh they learnt to survive. Um,

57
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.889
BUT still, each animal, each individual was limited in

58
00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.130
its energy to what it could get from its

59
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.360
own food and digestive system, um. And so the

60
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.579
3rd revolution came with the ability to use energy

61
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.450
outside from outside your body. And this, well there

62
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.540
were two parts to this. The most important part,

63
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.239
I think, was communication. Individuals managed learned to communicate

64
00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:40.350
with one another, to organize, uh, to, uh, to,

65
00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:45.049
to, to, to make teams of oxygen, oxen and

66
00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:50.279
slaves and horses, uh, and so on to. To

67
00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:56.339
get energy beyond what one individual can do. Uh,

68
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.100
AND this was immensely, uh, powerful, and only humans

69
00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.950
managed to do this. Now fire was an important

70
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.130
part of that, uh. That Turk revolution, but only

71
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.809
part. And then came the industrial revolution. Uh, AND

72
00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:22.769
in the industrial revolution. We learnt to turn. Uh,

73
00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:27.000
TO make energy work, it was the invention of

74
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.049
the engine. Uh, AND this was, um, this was

75
00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:37.890
an extra extraordinary advance and as we know this

76
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:44.609
happened about 250 years ago, uh, it's, it was.

77
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.140
Uh, uh, uh, A revolution not only of engines,

78
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.019
but of fossil fuels which provided the energy for

79
00:05:54.299 --> 00:06:00.200
uh those engines. Answers a question. A scientific question

80
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.100
is where is the energy. In the lump of

81
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.239
coal. Now, the official answer is chemistry, but that,

82
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.089
that's just giving it a name. Uh, THERE are

83
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.109
no springs and weights, uh, and so on in

84
00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:20.010
a lump of coal. You can't, you can't see

85
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.109
where the energy is. Uh, AND it wasn't until

86
00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:31.320
1924, exactly 101 years ago now, that a young

87
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.920
French er er er student, uh, who got the

88
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.390
Nobel Prize for it, uh, showed that in fact

89
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.054
it was the. The motion of electrons inside atoms

90
00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:47.535
and molecules, which was responsible for the energy of

91
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:51.565
fossil fuels and incidentally, for the energy of food

92
00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:55.855
uh and uh much uh much else beside, and

93
00:06:55.855 --> 00:07:00.364
electronics and so on. And the physics of this

94
00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:03.885
is quantum mechanics, but we learned to use it,

95
00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:07.815
we learnt to use it before we knew what

96
00:07:07.815 --> 00:07:11.279
was in fact going on. But quantum mechanists like

97
00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:17.570
A musical instrument, an electron trapped inside an atom

98
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.100
is like a, a wind instrument. The smaller the

99
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.250
instrument, the higher the pitch. And it's because atoms

100
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.989
are very small that the energies are very high,

101
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:41.299
uh, like a small musical instrument. Uh, AND. This

102
00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:44.829
development of this went on and gave us electronics

103
00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:47.160
and so on, and that is what I call

104
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.799
er the industrial revolution and the modern economy. But

105
00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:56.089
were in trouble Because we're in trouble because of

106
00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.799
fossil fuels and their possible connection with climate change,

107
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.970
it certainly didn't make things better, er er they

108
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.579
certainly cause pollution, er and smogs and disease and

109
00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:15.329
so on. So we are on the threshold of

110
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:20.549
the 5th revolution. And actually this isn't isn't anything

111
00:08:20.549 --> 00:08:25.980
new, it's the same quantum argument. But this time

112
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:29.980
with a much smaller resonant cavity, a much smaller

113
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.789
musical instrument, where the what's in the waves inside

114
00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.510
the musical instrument are not electrons in atoms, but

115
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.429
protons and neutrons inside the nucleus. And because the

116
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:49.750
nucleus of an atom is 100,000 times smaller than

117
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.250
the atom. Its energy is 2 million times greater.

118
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:03.400
And The marvel. Well, one marvel of quantum of

119
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.169
uh nuclear is that it is so energetic, er

120
00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:11.190
and the other is that it is incredibly safe,

121
00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:13.609
but we'll get to that in a moment. Uh,

122
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:18.840
IT'S. Uh, THIS has been going on for some

123
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.349
time. It's interesting to read that in 1931. Uh,

124
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:31.440
Churchill, Winston Churchill, writing in the Strand Magazine wrote,

125
00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:34.440
the coal a man can get in a day

126
00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:38.250
can easily do 500 times as much work as

127
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.489
the man himself. Nuclear energy, as at least 1

128
00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:49.250
million times more powerful still. The discovery and control

129
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.580
of such sources of power would cause changes in

130
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.340
human affairs incomparably greater than those produced by the

131
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.700
steam engine 4 generations ago. Now that is the

132
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.729
threshold that he saw then and we are still

133
00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:11.380
looking at it because we're frightened by it. Uh,

134
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.599
SO that is the 5th revolution. In fact, the

135
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.590
industrial revolution, if you like it, was, uh, the,

136
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.000
uh, where the analog effort was provided by engines

137
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.869
with energy from fossil fuels, and the nuclear revolution

138
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.159
is a digital, uh, the digital effort is provided

139
00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:38.849
by AI powered by nuclear fission. That's where we're

140
00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:43.280
going, dare we go there? Uh, MANY people don't.

141
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.780
I'm disappointed to see that Portugal hasn't er made

142
00:10:47.969 --> 00:10:50.530
this jump yet, but we've all got to.

143
00:10:52.349 --> 00:10:55.450
And so just to make perhaps this point a

144
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.179
little bit clearer, how important is energy for human

145
00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:00.770
society?

146
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.849
Well, it's not the only thing I think. The

147
00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:09.770
other thing we, as we all know, is trust

148
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.690
and confidence. This business being able to talk to

149
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.289
one another is only part of the problem. We've

150
00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:19.929
got to trust one another, and we've only got

151
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.690
to look at what's going on in the States

152
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.450
at the moment to realize that that's not a

153
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:31.520
very easy problem, um, uh, so. Trust, trust and

154
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.989
confidence and energy are what is needed to power

155
00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:41.000
a society, and then you can have activity, economic

156
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.159
productivity, growth, er and today, Here's another problem with

157
00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:51.219
a rapidly falling birth rate around the world. Everybody

158
00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:55.890
getting older, you need the new energy to do

159
00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:59.820
more, not only to do the mechanical work with

160
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.659
the industrial revolution engines, but also to do the

161
00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:05.429
digital work with AI.

162
00:12:07.979 --> 00:12:11.359
And how do the kinds of energy that we

163
00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:13.950
use relate to climate change?

164
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.119
Well, the quick answer to that is we don't

165
00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:23.390
know. Uh, The climate is affected by so many

166
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.469
things. It is certainly true that the composition of

167
00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:33.030
the atmosphere is changing, and it's changing every year

168
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.580
as we put more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

169
00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:43.020
Um, ON the other hand, uh, There are many

170
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:49.340
things that affect the climate, and a few volcanoes,

171
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.940
which are certainly nothing to do with our what

172
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.340
we do on Earth, uh, can throw a few

173
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.219
cubic miles of, of, uh, Of material into the

174
00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:06.299
atmosphere and we can have a uh a freeze

175
00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:09.500
up for a couple of years with no harvests

176
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.650
and so on, like, in fact, happened in 1816

177
00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.700
and in fact happens on a lesser scale, uh

178
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.210
so it's not, it's not only what we do,

179
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.940
but what we do is probably doesn't uh necessarily

180
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.770
help. What is important is that we look after

181
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.570
our environment for not only for ourselves but for

182
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:38.450
the other animals uh in on on Earth, because

183
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.549
by the time we know all about this, it'll

184
00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:43.250
probably be too late to go back er and

185
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.409
uh rerun it all. The climate is unstable, it.

186
00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:51.909
Changes anyway, and it has been changing with or

187
00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:55.929
without us, without us, without us, and we should

188
00:13:55.929 --> 00:14:00.359
prepare for change, as I said, they, uh, in

189
00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:04.750
the first revolution, when life depended simply on sunshine

190
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.820
uh and wind and rain, uh, The animals wanted

191
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.890
to get shelter, they wanted to get out of

192
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.219
the weather, they wanted the squirrels wanted a store

193
00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:19.780
of nuts, they wanted to be able to get

194
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.700
energy and life, which did not depend on the

195
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.260
weather. So uh we need to be prepared to

196
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.570
avoid the weather.

197
00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:32.650
Mhm. So I would like to get now into

198
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.570
the topic of nuclear energy specifically and also to

199
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.690
probably address some common misconceptions that people have about

200
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.559
it. So, what is nuclear energy? What does it

201
00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.179
involve?

202
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:54.890
Well, It involves the nuclei of atoms. Now, unfortunately,

203
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.640
it's very difficult to draw a picture of an

204
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.280
atom. The problem is that the nucleus is 100,000

205
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.640
times smaller than the atom itself, and the electrons,

206
00:15:06.669 --> 00:15:10.530
which are the rest of the atom, are. Well

207
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.729
they get drawn as little circles going, but that

208
00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:15.650
isn't what they look like at all. Uh, THEY

209
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.369
look like a fog of uh what the these

210
00:15:19.369 --> 00:15:23.289
waves, in fact, the of, uh, uh, in the

211
00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:27.719
atom. So the question is, where does nuclear get

212
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:32.609
the energy from? Well, 3 kinds of things can

213
00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:38.880
happen, which could release energy from different states of

214
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.039
of protons and neutrons inside nuclei. First of all,

215
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.359
nuclei could hit one another. Now that's what happens

216
00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:50.179
if you look at a candle flame, uh, the,

217
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.669
uh, in the region where the gasses are hot.

218
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.580
The oxygen and the fuel from the candle uh.

219
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.559
Collide with one another and they relax and relax

220
00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.859
uh they release the energy and you get light

221
00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:13.030
and heat and so on. Now that doesn't happen,

222
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:16.739
it cannot happen with nuclei because they are so

223
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.979
so small. And so highly charged that they're prevented

224
00:16:21.979 --> 00:16:25.900
from ever getting near one another, so no two

225
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.340
nuclei ever hit one another, except in the center

226
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.489
of the sun once every billion years, uh, and

227
00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:38.299
of course you can do it in uh in

228
00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:41.619
uh uh uh one by one in experiments at

229
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.599
in laboratories like at CERN. So we know all

230
00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:47.919
about it, but it just doesn't happen, so nuclei

231
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:53.640
are celibate, they do not release energy by er

232
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.049
hitting one another. So that is the makes it

233
00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:01.530
incredibly safe, and that is why, in spite of

234
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.900
the fact that nuclear energy is so powerful, we

235
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.209
didn't know about it at all until uh uh

236
00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:14.640
uh uh the late 1890s. The next thing that

237
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.650
can happen. Which does release energy, is that neutrons,

238
00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:25.439
which are particles, which were only discovered in 1932,

239
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.719
um, because they're neutral, they can get through this

240
00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:35.130
electric field and they can, they can hit the

241
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.849
nuclei of atoms, uh, and with. Certain kinds of

242
00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:45.520
fuel, uranium and thorium, but not much else, uh,

243
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.319
with a neutron, you can uh have a reaction

244
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:55.099
and release energy. Now neutrons are unstable, they're rapidly

245
00:17:55.099 --> 00:18:00.290
absorbed by almost all materials, so that's easily controlled.

246
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.839
For instance, everybody talks about Fukushima, well, for instance,

247
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:10.439
all the nuclear reactors in Japan shut down immediately

248
00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:14.780
the earthquake happened. And there were no more neutrons

249
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.859
and no more new nuclear energy, the moment the

250
00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:22.619
earthquake happened, long, long before the the tsunami arrived.

251
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.050
Well, about 20 minutes before the tuna you arrived,

252
00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:34.339
so. That is again an extremely safe uh um.

253
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:42.930
Uh, uh, SITUATION. The only problem is that nuclear

254
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:48.869
reactor, nuclear reactions with, with neutrons fission leaves embers.

255
00:18:49.089 --> 00:18:52.329
They're, they're like, uh, the glowing embers of a

256
00:18:52.329 --> 00:18:58.010
fire. Uh, THIS is what we call radioactivity, and

257
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:04.949
these remnants emit radiation. And as Mary Curie discovered

258
00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:08.140
when she first did experiments on these in 1900.

259
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:13.780
They're not affected by this, this decay, it's not

260
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.680
affected by anything. No, not by temperature, you can't

261
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.959
put it out, you can't start it, you can't

262
00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:24.869
do anything. So uh what you have to do

263
00:19:24.869 --> 00:19:29.030
is cool these embers to prevent them uh melting

264
00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:34.709
uh things and uh uh releasing, but er so

265
00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:40.989
radioactivity and radiation is. A problem that we have

266
00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:45.030
to describe what happens, uh, it actually has only

267
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.579
about 10% of the energy of the nuclear fission,

268
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:55.119
so it's not so powerful, but uh, Nuclear radioactivity

269
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.280
is present in rocks, in our own body, uh,

270
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.209
in your own body, in the in every second,

271
00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:13.680
about 7000 radioactive atoms decay. Now, uh. Life has

272
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.400
always been like that. If biology hadn't uh found

273
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.959
a way of protecting against that, we wouldn't be

274
00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:25.949
here. So small amounts of radioactivity do no harm,

275
00:20:26.199 --> 00:20:31.329
um, and uh they're all all around us. The

276
00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:35.260
important thing about radioactivity and radiation is it's not

277
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.930
contagious. It's not like a disease. You can't catch

278
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.010
it. Uh, YOU can't spread it like a flame.

279
00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:48.790
Um, Uh, AND this is very important, for instance,

280
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.109
after, uh, uh, uh, an accident like at Fukushima,

281
00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:59.349
where some people have been, uh, uh, had, uh,

282
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:06.890
contact with radiation. Hospitals and uh people, doctors. Uh,

283
00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:12.310
Wouldn't treat people. They ran away from people who

284
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.900
had been radioactive. The first thing you should know

285
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.650
about radi radiation safety is you can't catch it,

286
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.209
so you can treat people, anybody who has been

287
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:27.310
affected and you won't get, you won't catch it.

288
00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.630
It doesn't spread.

289
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.880
So yeah, uh just before we get more into

290
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.630
what you're mentioning there, let me ask you because

291
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.819
this is something that sometimes people establish a link

292
00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:45.229
in their heads. Is there any link at all

293
00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:48.989
between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons?

294
00:21:51.569 --> 00:21:56.050
Uh, WELL, people like to, people like to run

295
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.839
away from this and say there isn't any connection.

296
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.119
Of course there is, it's, uh, the same energy,

297
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.589
but it's not the energy of the radioactivity and

298
00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:13.209
the radiation. It's the energy of, of, uh, of

299
00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:17.449
neutrons splitting atoms or in the case of the

300
00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:21.369
sun, uh um in the center of the sun.

301
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:26.619
Nuclei hitting one another, and this doesn't, this doesn't

302
00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:31.260
uh normally happen. What I mean is that what

303
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.849
happens in a nuclear, if you have a nuclear

304
00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:37.900
explosion from a bomb, and there haven't been very

305
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.520
many with people involved, thank goodness, but uh at

306
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.510
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there was a very high 100,000

307
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.790
who died. About the same number who died from

308
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:58.209
uh the bombing, uh with 1000 planes, um from

309
00:22:58.209 --> 00:23:02.760
1000 planes with conventional bombs in Tokyo uh earlier

310
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.319
in 1945. In fact, the blast and the fire

311
00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:10.530
of a nuclear weapon are just like the blast

312
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:16.000
and the fire of, TNT or other high explosive,

313
00:23:16.209 --> 00:23:19.920
are very destructive, not at all good for life,

314
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.400
er er and they kill people, but by hitting

315
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.640
them or burning them, not by the radiation. In

316
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.890
fact, we know that the survivors of Hiroshima and

317
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:37.260
Nagasaki, uh, their health has been followed for, Uh,

318
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:41.520
ever since for 70 years, and we know how

319
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.719
many died of cancer and how many died of

320
00:23:45.719 --> 00:23:48.959
cancer who were in other towns in Japan who

321
00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:51.920
were similar and so on, and a comparison can

322
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.920
be made. How many extra people died of the

323
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.640
radiation from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the answer is

324
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.479
about 0.5%, slightly less than 0.5%. So the radiation,

325
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.119
in spite of all the, the fear mongering, the

326
00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:13.030
radiation is not the problem with the nuclear weapon,

327
00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:17.010
it's the blast and the fire. And uh I

328
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.400
I blot on fire in Gaza or uh or

329
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.760
um. Uh, Ukraine, uh, now we know how destructive,

330
00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:28.890
uh, that can be.

331
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.160
So you mentioned briefly Fukushima and Chernobyl there. What

332
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.119
would you tell people who still worry about those

333
00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:42.640
two incidents? Uh, I mean, what, what would be

334
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.920
your response to their anxiety about them?

335
00:24:46.729 --> 00:24:49.969
Well, it goes back to, one of the things

336
00:24:49.969 --> 00:24:53.290
it goes back to is what I said on

337
00:24:53.290 --> 00:25:00.530
discussing the energy revolutions is when man discovered how

338
00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:08.910
to. Uh, USE energy. He communicated, he taught his

339
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.109
children the dangers of fire. Don't touch that, it's

340
00:25:13.109 --> 00:25:18.180
hot. It'll burn you. Every child learns that, usually

341
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.430
they, they do hurt themselves and they er and

342
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.589
their mother says, now you won't do that again,

343
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.619
will you? Uh. The problem with nuclear energy is

344
00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:33.540
we have not been teaching the children about it

345
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.739
for the last 70 years, so if you go

346
00:25:35.739 --> 00:25:39.760
into a school, you will not get told uh

347
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.060
the safety of nuclear energy and radiation, which I

348
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.939
have been talking about and which will say more

349
00:25:46.939 --> 00:25:52.890
about. So ignorance and fear are very serious problems,

350
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:59.209
um. So in the case of Fukushima, nobody died

351
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:05.209
of radiation at all. Although it brought the world

352
00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:08.689
almost to a stop for many years as far

353
00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:14.719
as energy available concerned, at Chernobyl 28 people died

354
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.180
or who went in uh in a few weeks

355
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.660
after they, not of cancer, but they, uh, their

356
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.839
biology broke down uh and uh. There was, there

357
00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:29.599
was no firm evidence of uh of cancer and

358
00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:31.400
that all happened in a few weeks. Those are

359
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.199
the people who went in and fought the fire.

360
00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:39.209
Uh NOW there have been intense study of whether

361
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:48.170
people died. What cancer at. Chernobyl, uh, and some

362
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.430
people have said maybe, and as time has gone

363
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.069
on, and there have been more and more studies,

364
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:59.119
it's clear that if you look, If you test

365
00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:02.729
everybody for something, then you will find a few

366
00:27:02.729 --> 00:27:07.290
people who you wouldn't have found anyway, and that

367
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:12.050
the mere fact of testing them uh causes uh

368
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.650
them to think that maybe they uh uh were

369
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.849
affected by the radiation and maybe they have have

370
00:27:19.849 --> 00:27:24.540
uh. Uh, AN operation to cure it when maybe

371
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.609
there wasn't anything to cure. So it's very difficult,

372
00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:34.060
uh, but, uh, we think that, in fact, it's

373
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.300
interesting there's a study, you know what I mean

374
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.750
by the placebo effect. The placebo effect is when

375
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:46.369
somebody is treated, sorry, someone's not treated, but they

376
00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:49.849
think they have been treated and they get better.

377
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.420
I mean they really get better. Now, since the

378
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.420
reverse of that, if you tell somebody, you have

379
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.410
been irradiated, and they say, what does that mean?

380
00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:04.540
And it says, well, don't worry, you don't have

381
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.579
to worry about that. There's a bus outside, pack

382
00:28:07.579 --> 00:28:09.939
your case, uh and we're going to take you

383
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:15.140
away and you'll be paid compensation. Those people get

384
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.459
very frightened and it causes mental ill illness, uh,

385
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:23.380
that happened at Fukushima, er and at other accidents

386
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:30.339
too. People fear actually can make people sufferer and

387
00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:36.189
think. They have symptoms, rather like the placebo effect

388
00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:40.699
actually uh cures people when they haven't been told.

389
00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.150
It's the philosophy of a medieval er er a

390
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:49.910
curse, um, but again, education is probably the best

391
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.329
way of getting over this sort of thing. So

392
00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:58.609
the important thing about that to say to people

393
00:28:58.609 --> 00:29:04.650
about Chernobyl and or Chernobyl, Chernobyl is the, the

394
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.719
uh uh Ukrainian. Um, SPELLING of the word incidentally,

395
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.569
uh, and it's in Ukraine, so nowadays I think

396
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:17.719
rather like we, we, we, we talk about Kiev

397
00:29:17.959 --> 00:29:21.189
and not Kiev, uh, we should use the, the,

398
00:29:21.209 --> 00:29:27.640
uh, Ukrainian word, um. We should tell people, look,

399
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.800
you are already protected against low levels of radiation,

400
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:38.020
er because that is the environment in which, Biology

401
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:44.890
evolved, so stop worrying. Uh, IF you read. Don't

402
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.089
read murder mysteries if they upset you. You don't

403
00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:50.800
need the murder mysteries.

404
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.819
OK, and I think that you've already partly answered

405
00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:59.380
this question, but what would you tell people about

406
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.219
the risks of ionizing radiation?

407
00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:08.589
Well, as I say, for, for the, you're naturally

408
00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:13.619
protected. Uh, BY quite high exposures to radiation and

409
00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:20.150
Already in 1934. So, uh, this is before World

410
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.800
War 2, after Churchill, just after Churchill, just after

411
00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:30.359
the discovery of the neutron, uh, There was an

412
00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:38.199
international uh meeting of world authorities on radiation, and

413
00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:44.219
they agreed what was safe. And there is nothing,

414
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.579
there there's a lot more data now, uh, but.

415
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.239
The the the they got it right. The number

416
00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:58.040
that they gave got it right. Unfortunately, for political

417
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.959
reasons, that has been exaggerated by a factor of

418
00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:05.520
between 500 and 1000 now in order to frighten

419
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.920
people, cos cos if you're in the war, if

420
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.239
you're in the military business, it's beneficial if you

421
00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:17.319
can frighten the enemy about your weapons without actually

422
00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:20.670
using them or even without making them. Uh, I

423
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:25.910
mean, Reagan, uh, uh, um, had a whole campaign

424
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:30.670
called Star Wars. Well, scientifically that was based, that

425
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.790
was not, uh, that was not based on good

426
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.550
science, but the Russians were terrified of it, and

427
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.790
it was, it was part of the collapse of

428
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:45.109
the, of the Soviet Union. So politically, there is

429
00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:50.290
reason. To make people frightened of nuclear even when

430
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:57.430
it uh when it isn't, um. So Uh, people

431
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.270
should understand that. One of what has happened since

432
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:07.150
1934, and every year, amongst the Nobel Prizes for

433
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.979
uh uh medicine and physics and chemistry and so

434
00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:16.180
on, is somebody who's, Unscrambled one of the mechanisms

435
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.270
for protecting life from the effects of radiation, and

436
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.349
what happens is because our life is made, we're

437
00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:27.709
made up lots and lots of cells, many of

438
00:32:27.709 --> 00:32:30.790
which are interchangeable. So if one of them goes

439
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.699
out of action, uh, you've got the other ones,

440
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:38.359
uh, they come up the biology comes along and

441
00:32:38.359 --> 00:32:46.060
either repairs or. Or the uh the places that

442
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.000
the cells and the DNA uh and so on,

443
00:32:50.209 --> 00:32:54.770
and it's brilliant, um, it's it's not physics, it's

444
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.680
uh, It's, it's biology, and I, I started a,

445
00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.800
a course on on uh on medical physics at

446
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.849
at Oxford, which was very successful, got the students,

447
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.930
physics students going up to the uh hospitals to

448
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.930
do uh experiments and see how uh uh mathematics

449
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.290
is really useful in helping people in bedroom uh

450
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.329
slippers. But um the uh the things that people

451
00:33:21.329 --> 00:33:27.719
should see are the uh. Wildlife videos of, of

452
00:33:27.719 --> 00:33:34.739
uh of the animals in the, Chernobyl evacuation zone,

453
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.500
which are now thriving. Uh, IT'S a wildlife park.

454
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.150
Uh, THEY'RE just so glad that they've got rid

455
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:47.790
of those humans that are, were, uh, occupying their

456
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.060
space, and now they have the place to themselves.

457
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:56.430
So, uh, I would recommend looking at the BBC

458
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.300
National Geographic, there are lot lots of of them

459
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.180
uh which show uh beautiful of uh.

460
00:34:06.579 --> 00:34:09.489
So let me ask you now then, how does

461
00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:14.500
renewable energy compared to nuclear energy? What are the

462
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.860
pros and cons of each of them?

463
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:22.739
Well, renewable energy. You don't have to know anything.

464
00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:26.918
You can see it, you can feel it, and

465
00:34:26.918 --> 00:34:31.398
so everybody likes it, and there's no denying that.

466
00:34:31.678 --> 00:34:34.518
And as I say you, even with a lump

467
00:34:34.518 --> 00:34:37.518
of coal, you can't see the energy and you

468
00:34:37.518 --> 00:34:40.228
certainly can't see it from a lump of uranium.

469
00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:43.799
It's it's it's invisible. So the fact that it's

470
00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:46.089
visible and you can see it and feel it

471
00:34:46.428 --> 00:34:50.000
er is. A very strong argument in favor of

472
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.610
it. Uh, AGAINST nuclear, uh. Its benefits are not

473
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.020
It doesn't get taught in schools or jolly well

474
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.620
ought to be. The media, people who go into

475
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:11.340
the media and politicians are not included in the

476
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.510
small number of people who do understand a little

477
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.939
bit about it, uh, and the net result is

478
00:35:18.939 --> 00:35:23.010
that you open the newspaper and everybody's afraid, uh,

479
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.729
and they don't want to know, and I mean,

480
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:32.110
Fukushima provided wonderful. Uh, MATERIAL for the media for

481
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:37.889
exciting, uh, uh, uh, pictures, um, of, uh, of,

482
00:35:37.939 --> 00:35:42.040
of tsunami waves and hydrogen explosions and so on,

483
00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:47.250
which weren't nuclear, they were chemical, um, uh. And

484
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.129
they didn't want to go give up on those

485
00:35:49.129 --> 00:35:53.370
and uh last year I was out in South

486
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:58.169
Korea uh lecturing because people are still frightened of

487
00:35:58.169 --> 00:36:03.469
the cooling water from Fukushima 1011 years after the,

488
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:10.219
um, after the accident, um, so. That's what's against

489
00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:17.080
nuclear, uh. What's against renewable is that is very

490
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.159
low energy density, uh, there's very little energy there,

491
00:36:22.489 --> 00:36:28.270
uh. Nuclear is a million times more powerful than

492
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:33.590
coal, but coal is 1000 times more powerful than

493
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.750
uh than than wind. I mean, if I had

494
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.070
a blackboard torn out and a couple of lines,

495
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:45.050
I'll show you with uh student, student uh physics,

496
00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:50.929
just why the energy is so low in uh

497
00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:55.870
in um. In renewables and so much higher in.

498
00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:01.560
Fossil fuels and so much, much higher in uh

499
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.179
so this is not, this is not technology, this

500
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:12.330
is fundamental physics. Uh, So But there are other

501
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.610
problems with renewables, and that is that they are

502
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:20.770
unreliable and intermittent, it's the weather problem again, uh,

503
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:28.020
they're vulnerable. Uh, Extremes of weather and terrorists can

504
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.219
easily knock out er renewables in the way that

505
00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:39.830
they can't knock out nuclear, um. Very often Renewable

506
00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:44.290
sources of energy are hundreds of miles away from

507
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.909
where people live, so you have very expensive, uh,

508
00:37:50.379 --> 00:37:55.449
Grid lines to carry the energy, uh, and that's

509
00:37:55.449 --> 00:38:00.010
all unnecessary. You want sources of energy which are

510
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:05.530
available where people live and where the industry is

511
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:14.300
and when it's wanted. Uh, Renewable plants, farms. It's

512
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.820
a bit awful the way they're called farms, that's

513
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.500
just salesmanship by the, uh, that they should be

514
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:28.010
called industries, um, uh, solar, solar farms is a,

515
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.020
it's not, it's not a farm, uh, it's the

516
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.979
opposite of a farm. But they only last for

517
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:40.699
20 years at best, whereas nuclear lasts for 60

518
00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:44.239
and 80 years, so there's a. When it comes

519
00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:47.310
to cost, uh, and I'm not gonna talk about

520
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.520
that at length, but that's a whole subject in

521
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.800
itself, full of misunderstandings, er, which, uh, and the

522
00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:03.780
misunderstandings are expensive, um. So Uh, Renewables are large.

523
00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:12.590
Uh, AND. Uh, There's a lot of stuff. That

524
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.669
has to would have to be decommissioned every 20

525
00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:19.229
years, and nobody can tell you what they're going

526
00:39:19.229 --> 00:39:25.159
to do with it. Then there's nuclear. What is

527
00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:30.729
pro about nuclear is the energy density uh and

528
00:39:30.729 --> 00:39:35.020
the reliability. And the fact that it's in principle

529
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.580
available all the time, it's only available for a

530
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.649
few weeks in the year when the fuel has

531
00:39:41.649 --> 00:39:46.860
to be changed, but actually that is getting better.

532
00:39:46.939 --> 00:39:49.500
I mean, for instance, when the, even when the

533
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.000
first nuclear submarine was launched in 1955. Think how

534
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.750
long time that ago that was, it had enough

535
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.879
fuel in it to power it for uh the

536
00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:11.050
lifetime of the submarine. So the, the ships that

537
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.969
are being designed now, which are nuclear powered, will

538
00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:19.350
never have to be fueled refueled because uh they'll

539
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.409
be able to go at 30 knots of speed

540
00:40:22.409 --> 00:40:27.090
for 30 years without any change of fuel. Um,

541
00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:36.629
The what the waste. The waste, so-called waste, first

542
00:40:36.629 --> 00:40:38.989
of all, a lot of it is not burnt,

543
00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:43.469
only about 2 or 3% of the fuel has

544
00:40:43.469 --> 00:40:49.669
been used. And the rest includes uh um elements,

545
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.169
medical isotopes, which can be used, for instance, in

546
00:40:53.169 --> 00:40:58.879
every fire, smoke alarm, uh probably uh above your

547
00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.530
head. Now I don't know if you've got a

548
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:06.219
smoke alarm there, that's got an americium 241 uh

549
00:41:06.449 --> 00:41:11.120
radioactive source in it. And interestingly enough, it signals,

550
00:41:11.159 --> 00:41:15.439
it goes off and signals fire when the radiation

551
00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:20.709
from the uh americium 241 is not detected by

552
00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:24.639
the uh because it's absorbed by the smoke. So

553
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.040
uh we've got radioactivity all around us, but people

554
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.040
don't like to talk about it cos then they

555
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:39.360
wouldn't buy it. Uh, SO, um. Also for nuclear

556
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:46.060
er. The enormous amount of heat that is also

557
00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.340
generated can be used for uh district heating, for

558
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.500
heating homes, as this is in addition to creating

559
00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:00.080
electricity. um, AND in China now and also in

560
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.590
the, in Scandinavia where they er have uh such

561
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.909
district heating already um there is uh. The uh

562
00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:14.760
piping, uh, waste heat, hot water, uh, around from

563
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.870
the plant. You don't get that from a windmill.

564
00:42:18.479 --> 00:42:22.590
Um, YOU can have process heat, you can make

565
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:27.310
hydrogen and chemical feedstuffs, uh, and so on for,

566
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.320
uh, for, for industry, so the whole industry could

567
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.989
be built round, uh, and even. Uh, CAN grow

568
00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:42.080
food based on the energy from a, a nuclear

569
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.149
plant, but I won't go into that. I've probably

570
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.229
been long enough I answered this question already.

571
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.969
So, uh, you've talked a little bit about waste

572
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:56.879
there. People, of course, sometimes also worry about how

573
00:42:56.879 --> 00:43:00.399
nuclear waste is handled. Could you tell us about

574
00:43:00.399 --> 00:43:03.600
how we deal with it and whether it is

575
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.149
risky in any way?

576
00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:14.100
Well, It is emitting radiation. It is not going

577
00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:20.250
to explode. But it it is emitting radiation and

578
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.409
you can't stop it emitting radiation until it's died

579
00:43:23.409 --> 00:43:27.679
down, uh, so that's the problem. First thing is

580
00:43:28.169 --> 00:43:33.989
because, Nuclear fuel, you need so little fuel nuclear

581
00:43:33.989 --> 00:43:36.550
fuel because of the factor of a million. You

582
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.629
need a millionth of the amount of fuel compared

583
00:43:39.629 --> 00:43:43.709
with coal, and you need um get a millionth

584
00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:49.959
of the waste. So, uh, if you, for the

585
00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:52.879
whole, all the energy for the whole of your

586
00:43:52.879 --> 00:43:56.969
life. Uh, FOR one person, for their heating, their

587
00:43:56.969 --> 00:44:02.379
transport, their food, uh, everything would be, could come

588
00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:10.739
from 1 kg of uranium. Fully used Uh, and

589
00:44:10.739 --> 00:44:16.800
so that. Will create 1 kg of nuclear waste.

590
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:21.000
Well, that's not very much. Um, SO you need

591
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.330
to put it behind a bit of concrete, bury

592
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.719
it in water, uh, uh, put it under water

593
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:28.780
for 5 to 10 years to cool it, because

594
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:33.729
when it's radioactive, it gets hot, uh, and it's

595
00:44:33.729 --> 00:44:37.199
the heat, the byproduct of the heat, but it.

596
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.899
I mean a, a melt, a meltdown is people

597
00:44:40.899 --> 00:44:45.040
talk about meltdown as if it was something catastrophic,

598
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:48.659
it's not, it's just uh uh it just, it

599
00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:51.729
just melts and becomes rather difficult to deal with,

600
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.850
but it's not gonna do anything, um. For storing,

601
00:44:57.139 --> 00:45:00.729
it can be vitrified, so it can be encased

602
00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:06.219
in in er er in. In uh in glass,

603
00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:10.229
uh stored on the surface, it can be buried,

604
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.969
but that's a bit of a silly thing to

605
00:45:12.969 --> 00:45:15.090
do when you can think of all the things

606
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:19.439
you can do with the waste. Um, THE fission

607
00:45:19.439 --> 00:45:23.790
products, there are two kinds of radioactivity in nuclear

608
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:30.010
waste. One are the. Where they uh. Nucleus is

609
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.850
all ready fission, and that's called fission products, and

610
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:37.050
they have a 30 year half life, which means

611
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.070
that the radiation has dropped by a factor of

612
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.409
a million of 600 years. So that, that's not

613
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:48.379
difficult to deal with. The longer products are like

614
00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:52.350
the Mliium 241, uh, uh, they, they have a

615
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.350
longer, uh, or many of them have a much

616
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.850
longer lifetime of plutonium, it's a much longer lifetime,

617
00:45:59.169 --> 00:46:04.310
um, and they do need to be uh uh

618
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:08.719
burnt up, um, but, uh. When I say they

619
00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:11.800
have a much longer lifetime, it means they're much

620
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.389
less radioactive for longer, rather than being very radioactive

621
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.520
for a shorter time. Uh, SO, uh, there's what

622
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.800
there's a question of what happens to fishing products

623
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.350
and what happens to the um. Uh, TO the,

624
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.100
uh, uh, actinides as they're, they're called, like, like

625
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.679
plutonium, but none of those is a problem, they've

626
00:46:34.679 --> 00:46:36.969
all been dealt with there's more than one kind

627
00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:42.040
of solution, exactly which one will be preferred by

628
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.159
the marketplace uh is a is a matter of

629
00:46:45.159 --> 00:46:48.879
uh economics, um, uh, and where you get the

630
00:46:48.879 --> 00:46:54.070
fuel for the next reactors from. So, uh, nuclear

631
00:46:54.070 --> 00:47:00.350
waste is. An educational problem like um uh many

632
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.379
things in this uh business.

633
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.800
So as we went through these topics surrounding nuclear

634
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.850
energy, we've also addressed some misconceptions about it, but

635
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.290
what do you think are the most common mis

636
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.800
misconceptions surrounding nuclear energy?

637
00:47:20.169 --> 00:47:24.219
Well, one of the first things is To think

638
00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:28.929
that this is something which is beyond your educational

639
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:32.889
pay grade, that it's something that's too difficult to

640
00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:38.360
understand, that only experts can tell you. That's rubbish.

641
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.510
It's not difficult to understand, uh. If you don't

642
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.350
understand it, it might seem hard, but people should

643
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.739
study it. It's not difficult. It's no more difficult

644
00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:55.270
than fire, which is a lot more dangerous. Second

645
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:59.870
thing is, there are a lot of bogus arguments

646
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.959
that have been introduced. For instance, E equals MC2

647
00:48:04.909 --> 00:48:08.989
is nothing to do with nuclear energy. All energy.

648
00:48:09.379 --> 00:48:12.439
Has a relationship between energy and mass which says

649
00:48:12.439 --> 00:48:15.820
E equals MC2. If you take, if you take

650
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.860
a a ball and you drop it onto the

651
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.060
floor, when it's on the floor, it has less

652
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.290
energy than it had when you held it up

653
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.889
uh at shoulder height, and its mass will be

654
00:48:28.889 --> 00:48:36.560
less. Because equals mc2 applies to everything. So it

655
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.709
just means that energy and mass go go together

656
00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:46.280
uh in at CERN doing experiments in partic particle

657
00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:51.040
physics, uh, doing this all the time, gosh, nothing

658
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.639
would work if, if uh if E equals MC2

659
00:48:55.639 --> 00:49:01.070
was uh uh what the problem's about. So, uh,

660
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.070
that's bogus, um. The next thing is the idea

661
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:11.379
that. Something that is a little bit dangerous. If

662
00:49:11.379 --> 00:49:14.540
you have more of it, it then it builds

663
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.139
up. Now, biology, because of the biology side of

664
00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:25.370
it. Radiation and nuclear only become dangerous when it

665
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:29.120
goes above a certain level. When there is enough

666
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.399
uh biological agency to, to put the fire out,

667
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:38.129
to apply the corrections to, to manage it, there's

668
00:49:38.129 --> 00:49:42.209
no, no uh risk at all. But unfortunately, a

669
00:49:42.209 --> 00:49:46.000
radiation protection industry has built up and lots of

670
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.840
jobs and so on associated with it, where, where

671
00:49:50.649 --> 00:49:52.330
she says well if you have a little bit

672
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.760
of energy, uh, have a 10% of the energy,

673
00:49:55.969 --> 00:49:59.050
that's 11th of the of the risk. That's not

674
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:03.510
true. So it's a question of, it's like a

675
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:07.530
speed limit. Below the speed limit, uh, you may

676
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.679
have to look after old people crossing the road,

677
00:50:10.929 --> 00:50:16.169
er um, and children, but it's generally safe. But

678
00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:19.010
when the speed goes up, er, you shouldn't be

679
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.929
in the road, er, and they shouldn't be driving

680
00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:26.330
that fast. So it's a matter of tolerances, good

681
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:32.189
old fashioned speed limits. As they found in 1934,

682
00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:35.280
so we know we know what that is. So,

683
00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:41.540
uh, Yeah, that, that's, so people should learn. And

684
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.919
we should be teaching our children. As we did

685
00:50:44.919 --> 00:50:49.290
about fire, uh, uh, when we first brought fire

686
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:52.280
into the home a million years ago, that wouldn't

687
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.830
have worked if we didn't have the power to

688
00:50:55.830 --> 00:51:00.949
educate people. Animals don't educate one another uh in

689
00:51:00.949 --> 00:51:04.379
the way that humans do. And in the case

690
00:51:04.379 --> 00:51:06.620
of nuclear, humans don't either.

691
00:51:08.209 --> 00:51:12.669
And why do you think that so many environmentalists

692
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:15.070
seem to be against nuclear energy?

693
00:51:15.949 --> 00:51:22.090
Well, Those A psychology of group membership, if somebody's

694
00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:25.560
going to build a a a a a a

695
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:29.439
road near your house, uh, then you may join

696
00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:34.570
other people er who sim have a uh a

697
00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:40.610
similar thing and you. May get uh satisfaction from

698
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:44.649
being membership of a group who are have a

699
00:51:44.649 --> 00:51:48.830
uh uh a particular concern, maybe it's a uh

700
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:52.770
a religious concern or it's a belief in a

701
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:56.250
particular, the importance of a particular kind of music

702
00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:01.770
or something, so that's a group, Uh, psychology of

703
00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:06.669
that goes into, of environmentalists looking at nuclear energy,

704
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.209
uh, you know, we're all against it, so, uh,

705
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:15.330
that's not them, each of them, uh, thinking about

706
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:21.310
it, that's groupthink, and groupthink doesn't, it's not logical.

707
00:52:22.899 --> 00:52:31.639
Uh, SO, groups. Which have a certain remit. Don't

708
00:52:31.639 --> 00:52:35.879
change their minds until the funds run out, er

709
00:52:35.879 --> 00:52:38.879
and then they stopped, so Greenpeace of course by

710
00:52:38.879 --> 00:52:41.889
now has a lot of money and they're not

711
00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:45.120
going to change their mind, but many members of

712
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:50.280
Greenpeace have changed their minds and have made videos

713
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.000
and so on explaining why they've changed their minds,

714
00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:02.159
but er still they. The Greenpeace corporate group uh

715
00:53:02.159 --> 00:53:11.320
think uh carries on anyway, so. Um, Again, When

716
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.080
I wrote my first book, I er did get

717
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.520
a review from a, I think it was called

718
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:25.489
Peace News uh about anti-nuclear there. And To give

719
00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:30.090
them their due, this review said, well, you, you

720
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.939
may not like where he ends up. But we

721
00:53:32.939 --> 00:53:37.949
think you ought to read this book. Uh, AND,

722
00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:42.070
uh, uh. So it can be done, and it's

723
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.870
about education and getting the message out.

724
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.639
So, and what would you say are the consequences

725
00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:54.479
of not using nuclear energy or moving away from

726
00:53:54.479 --> 00:53:57.800
it like uh Germany did, for example?

727
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.459
Well, Leaving nuclear energy out of it for a

728
00:54:06.459 --> 00:54:12.350
moment. I think we've got, we're in trouble. All

729
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:18.080
politicians talk about growth. But the growth can either

730
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.530
come from more people doing the same amount of

731
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:29.330
work or er. Um, Or smaller number of people

732
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:33.449
doing more work, but if the number of people

733
00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:37.260
is going down and they're getting older, there are

734
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.889
going to be less people doing less work and

735
00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.530
uh more people on social security and more people

736
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:49.810
drawing pensions and so on, so uh. The reason,

737
00:54:50.169 --> 00:54:55.669
and then there is the, the um. The the

738
00:54:55.669 --> 00:55:02.899
climate change concern, so. Everything's coming together to suggest

739
00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:08.379
that and AI is appearing, so everything's coming together

740
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.229
to suggest that we are pressing, we are on

741
00:55:12.229 --> 00:55:16.350
the edge of a of a a revolution and

742
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:21.030
it's coming from many directions. Now, er, Germany, of

743
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:26.550
course. Decided against nuclear and it would go back.

744
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.899
To renewables, which are weather dependent. Now the whole

745
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:35.699
of this story can be described as how to

746
00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:40.280
get away from the weather. Um, GOING right, right

747
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.080
back to the plants who were forced to, to,

748
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.360
uh, uh, drop their existence as seeds for the

749
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:56.830
following, um. Uh, SEASON. Um, Now, France and Norway

750
00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:03.679
and uh and uh Canada and others. Not often

751
00:56:03.679 --> 00:56:09.939
enough, UK, never Portugal, er um have not uh

752
00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:16.000
grasped this um problem properly, so it's not just

753
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.699
about electricity, it's about much more than that, and

754
00:56:19.699 --> 00:56:24.330
in particular it's about supplying the electricity, the energy.

755
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:30.530
Where people live, not putting nuclear plants uh out

756
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:33.159
of sight, out of mind, hundreds of miles away.

757
00:56:33.729 --> 00:56:36.929
That was done in the UK and in America,

758
00:56:36.969 --> 00:56:40.969
so for defense reasons, because people thought it was

759
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.770
dangerous and secret and all the rest of it.

760
00:56:43.889 --> 00:56:49.010
There's nothing secret about about uh nuclear, um, that's

761
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:59.000
part of people's uh dramatic thinking. Um, So I

762
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.360
think we are heading for an economic implosion, an

763
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:10.959
industrial collapse, high energy prices, political friction with neighbors,

764
00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:19.659
uh. Um, THE problems between Germany, er, and Norway,

765
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:23.949
er, and Denmark and Sweden, they're not prepared to

766
00:57:23.949 --> 00:57:30.979
send electricity to Germany because the, uh, Germany's shut

767
00:57:30.979 --> 00:57:33.469
down all their nuclear power plants, and people are

768
00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:38.310
getting angry about becoming a political problem. So I

769
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.149
think This big change coming.

770
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.580
So I, I have one last question then. Do

771
00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.899
you think that it would be possible to rehabilitate

772
00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:52.459
how our culture deals with nuclear energy and make

773
00:57:52.459 --> 00:57:55.620
people more welcoming of it? And if so, how?

774
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.679
Yes, it's possible. It's not going to be on

775
00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:06.040
the timescale that most politicians would like, which is

776
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.239
5 years, which is their span, uh, it's going

777
00:58:10.239 --> 00:58:13.030
to take a generation, it's going to be like

778
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.899
persuading people to smoke less. Uh, IT'S a cultural

779
00:58:17.899 --> 00:58:21.459
change, and it's going to take 20 years for

780
00:58:21.459 --> 00:58:26.580
it to be complete. It's also true that the

781
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:32.939
technology is developing more cheaply and meaningfully, uh, and

782
00:58:32.939 --> 00:58:36.139
so on, so that we can have these small

783
00:58:36.139 --> 00:58:39.090
reactors, and I haven't been talking about that, uh,

784
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.699
but there's going to be more different kinds of

785
00:58:41.699 --> 00:58:45.639
it. It's rather like. Uh, AT the end of

786
00:58:45.639 --> 00:58:50.199
the 19th century when people were told that there

787
00:58:50.199 --> 00:58:54.159
were going to be engines on the roads, and

788
00:58:54.159 --> 00:58:59.239
they imagined, uh, steam huge steam trains coming down

789
00:58:59.239 --> 00:59:01.800
and they said that's going to frighten the horses,

790
00:59:01.959 --> 00:59:05.870
er and er I'm voting against it. Well, uh,

791
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:11.610
in fact, The what came along then, principally from

792
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:17.040
France and Germany were little cars, which were, everybody

793
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.260
had one. They're not not great big steam trains,

794
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:27.330
things can be much, significantly smaller, significantly local er

795
00:59:27.649 --> 00:59:33.340
and er. If you have for 100,000 people, one

796
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:39.629
nuclear reactor, uh, then the children at school can

797
00:59:39.629 --> 00:59:43.350
go on school visits to see it, then maybe

798
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:49.020
their uncle works there, uh, they go to parties,

799
00:59:49.189 --> 00:59:53.399
and they have er er um festivals there and

800
00:59:53.629 --> 00:59:58.340
they'll get some. Uh, OWNERSHIP of this, so it's

801
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.199
not something that comes from outside your region, it's,

802
01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:07.979
you say we have our nuclear power station, and

803
01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:11.419
that is what we rely on, and the Russians

804
01:00:11.419 --> 01:00:14.250
or anybody else are going to, even Mr. Trump,

805
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.139
they're not gonna take it away from us. So

806
01:00:17.139 --> 01:00:26.110
uh um there's a. Social identification of smaller units.

807
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:34.080
Um, And this will reduce. Megawatt miles, I mean

808
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.350
they, it, it costs money, uh, and loses energy

809
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:43.679
to transmit energy over long distances, it's ridiculous, um.

810
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:50.080
But mostly it's about education and it's about uh

811
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.159
getting children in schools to take er smoke detectors

812
01:00:55.159 --> 01:01:00.709
apart and see the radiation symbol on the uh

813
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.610
the smoke detector which you can buy very cheaply

814
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:14.340
uh and be taught how it works, um. There

815
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.320
are other things we've got to do. WHICH are

816
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:24.129
more difficult. There is a whole. A culture of.

817
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:32.540
Um, COMMITTEES and safety procedures and laws and regulations

818
01:01:32.909 --> 01:01:38.270
which have got to be, uh, taken down. They

819
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:42.699
are not based on science, they're based on fear.

820
01:01:43.919 --> 01:01:49.040
Uh, AND it's difficult to know how to do

821
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.350
that because you have to, to take them down,

822
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.949
you've also got to deal with the fear first,

823
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.310
and so that's why it's not going to take

824
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.959
er er some time. But in the end, electricity

825
01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:07.159
should be cheap. There's no shortage of nuclear fuel.

826
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:13.209
Uranium dissolves in seawater in water, it's soluble. So

827
01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:17.129
you actually to mine it, you can pump er

828
01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:20.080
water down a mine uh and pump it back

829
01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.169
out again, uh and you don't have to have

830
01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:28.090
people er digging, er down there. So, uh, the

831
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:34.129
extraction of uranium and since it's. It does invoke

832
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:39.179
it uh. Dissolves in water, the sea is full

833
01:02:39.179 --> 01:02:44.760
of uranium. Uh, AND it's not far, it's only

834
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.320
a factor of 2 or 3 away from being.

835
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:55.709
Commercially sensible to make uranium to get uranium from

836
01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:59.270
seawater. So there's no shortage of of uh of

837
01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:05.389
uranium. So, I think. That, well, my grandchildren are

838
01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:11.350
already er er here, um, but my great grandchildren

839
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:16.629
and great great grandchildren will think that electricity is

840
01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:22.689
cheap. And essential, rather like water and clean water

841
01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:27.310
and clean air, uh, just saying they are too

842
01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:30.169
cheap to meter doesn't mean to say they're not

843
01:03:30.169 --> 01:03:35.129
important. Air and clean water are extremely important, and

844
01:03:35.129 --> 01:03:37.010
