00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.019
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.679
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Laps. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.829
joined by Doctor Robert Boroski. He is the Director

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.939
of the Center for Public Anthropology and Professor Emeritus

5
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.229
of Anthropology at Hawaii Pacific University. He's the author

6
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.629
of several books. And today we're going to focus

7
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:23.040
mostly on and anthropology of anthropology. Is it time

8
00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.049
to shift paradigms? And we're also going to talk

9
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.920
a little bit about public anthropology. So, Doctor Barosy,

10
00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.479
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.979
everyone.

12
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.970
Thank you very much Ricardo. I appreciate it. So

13
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.799
we don't always get invited to youtube channels starting

14
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.119
in Portugal. So, yeah, this is exciting to me.

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.009
Great. Uh Likewise. So, um uh let me start

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290
by asking you this. You wrote, as I said,

17
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.599
this book, an Anthropology of Anthropology. But what do

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.029
you mean by an anthropology of anthropology? Exactly.

19
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.779
This is very fascinating to me. We have all

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.809
these anthropologists studying these other societies and some study

21
00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:09.959
our own, right? Do they really stay their own

22
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.830
discipline? Excuse me? For the spontaneous gesture? Um No

23
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.879
worries. It's um David Graber, the deceased David Graber.

24
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:25.569
Um Well, it's very nice thing. But um this

25
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.819
book you might have it here. Yes. Um He

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.360
wrote um anthropologists announcement announcement, a generation reflecting on

27
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.160
power dynamics in the field. And um he says,

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.349
quote, that is really they are unlikely to be

29
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.199
any real world consequences because we are the ones

30
00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.599
with all the power. We say all these other

31
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.699
people in all their organizations, but we dominate because

32
00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.889
it's the power structure implicit in them. Um But,

33
00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:02.639
but have written almost nothing about the conditions of

34
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.709
work, patronage, funding and institutional hierarchy in the economy.

35
00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.440
That is the power relations under which anthropologists writing

36
00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.160
is actually produced. This was the most postmodernist thing

37
00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.279
that George market tried to do. But in the

38
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.830
end, it perpetuate the same stretches. So George will

39
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.830
be pissed. Am I saying that? Sorry George? Um

40
00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.789
Roosky is one of the few who had the

41
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.889
rec uh records that carry should do so that

42
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.990
he said that yeah, we have to go beyond

43
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.059
just talking about other people's structures which you look

44
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.309
at our own. Um And not just in the

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.199
writing which the post moderns do very well, but

46
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.830
really the power dynamics that keep us from really

47
00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.800
um facilitating significant change. Um The various structures of

48
00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:52.630
all this incessant publication, it in principle good that

49
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.470
you get it out to all these other people,

50
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.309
but what they write and what they produce not

51
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.919
very legible or intelligible to many people, including myself

52
00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.960
at times. And um, many of the publications I

53
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.479
just counted not right when they have tenure reviews

54
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.240
a study by the, um, kneer Corporation, I believe.

55
00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.440
And they said, um, half the faculty research, one

56
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.720
universities or maybe more than half believe that most

57
00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.309
of their publications in tenure review account and not

58
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.190
read, you just have a few things. And so

59
00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.990
there's all this movement of appearing to be intellectual,

60
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.550
appearing to do all these things appearing to help

61
00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:37.110
others. Um It's not clear that they do that

62
00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.089
an anthropology, anthropology means we should look at these

63
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.679
dynamics. Why are we dysfunction? Why is it discipline

64
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.880
losing importance it had, I think it's 12,000 members

65
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.130
um about a decade or more ago. It has

66
00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.509
about 8000. The AAA American Anthropological Association has about

67
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.429
8000 members. Now. Um It's the in the class

68
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.589
sizes for anthropology um and decreasing in the United

69
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.259
States. Why has anthropologist lost its push? And it

70
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.820
turned to in intellectualism um in talking about post

71
00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.910
colonialism, which sounds great, but really um doesn't get

72
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.140
the polo colonial structures that still exist. We'll get

73
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.730
to that with the question of culture in a

74
00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:26.329
minute. But there's a sense that um these people

75
00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.130
aren't very reflective about themselves in an honest way

76
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.619
about the power relations that really shape the discipline

77
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.279
and they clearly shape it. And so an anthropology

78
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.970
of anthropology is using anthropology techniques to actually look

79
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.529
at these and try and make it anthropology. So

80
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.339
wonders of wonders, miracles are miracles. Anthropology could benefit

81
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.480
other people in a way that they would really

82
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:54.019
find helpful. That's a goal. And um anthropology and

83
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.540
the body means being more reflective about the power

84
00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:03.399
dynamics that limit um as being effective in serving

85
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.929
the brighter moral good and, and maybe no, no,

86
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.339
of course.

87
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.160
And so one of the things that you talk

88
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.470
about in the book is uh to focus on

89
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.570
outcomes and what results from publications in anthropology. But

90
00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.149
I, I mean, why do we need or do

91
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.359
you argue that we need to focus more on

92
00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:32.385
the outcome? Because I mean, many times when we

93
00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:36.985
hear academics talking, they talk about things about like

94
00:05:36.996 --> 00:05:42.036
pursuing the truth, finding out something about reality out

95
00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:45.145
there. But I mean, per perhaps uh when it

96
00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:48.786
comes to the actual outcomes of the work, many

97
00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:52.346
times, people are not so focused on that apart

98
00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:56.411
from producing, of course. But I mean, what do

99
00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:59.351
you mean by these? And what are the outcomes

100
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.881
that you have in mind here?

101
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.141
OK. Let me just go to truth if they

102
00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:05.582
can find it, be my guest. But I believe

103
00:06:05.592 --> 00:06:09.451
it's like Don Quixote tilting, it will, it keeps

104
00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:12.921
an employee, it gave Don Quixote something to do

105
00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:16.092
a purpose. But um it's not clear to me

106
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.221
that that does it when I mean, outcomes if

107
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.720
we are funded as we are by mostly by

108
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.679
state institutions that give us taxpayers money and we

109
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.980
are in other ways supported by all these people

110
00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:34.059
who host us and live among them. I live

111
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.170
for 14 months. Among these people, 750 people, my

112
00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:40.510
wife and my daughter and myself on a coral,

113
00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.489
a toll in the middle of the Pacific. The

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.140
boat came out three times a year. Um These

115
00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:49.470
people put up with my incessant questions. They're very

116
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.850
hospitable by and large, don't I? So in some

117
00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:58.010
moral way, have a reciprocity in the most sense.

118
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.670
Oh They gave me a very important gift that

119
00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:03.600
allowed me to have a career in anthropology. Should

120
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:07.049
I in turn, help them? And this gets to

121
00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.549
be really intriguing because we'll get to, how can

122
00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.609
you actually help people and saying you're gonna help

123
00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:15.959
people, doesn't really help them often. You have all

124
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.989
these people who kind of, who say they're gonna

125
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.070
help you or all these NGO S that say

126
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.290
they're doing all these good things or governments that

127
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.799
say they're doing a good thing. It's mostly focus

128
00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:27.869
on appearance, what I'm going to do. And here's

129
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.690
an example of how, how is I'm giving my

130
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.369
field notes back to the people, the original field

131
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.660
notes back to the people um in Poca, Poca

132
00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.040
and I'm putting them on the web because they

133
00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:42.980
have a global desper, they um poke poke in

134
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:47.109
the Cook Islands in New Zealand, um Australia and

135
00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:50.910
other places. Um And let them just use it

136
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:55.410
now, this is important. Um BECAUSE they didn't take

137
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.540
it and don't trust me as a source of

138
00:07:57.549 --> 00:07:59.869
all wisdom. They would never do that. I would

139
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.130
be so foolish to do that. But they have

140
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.089
it and they can use it to then create

141
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.480
their own visions, their own history or their own

142
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:12.649
present. It gives them tools to empower themselves. Now,

143
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.339
they, they cannot change the economic condition. Most of

144
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.519
them um go to New Zea over half, go

145
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:22.910
to New Zealand and live there or live off

146
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.989
the government do in New Zealand. Um And then

147
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.790
have in doing that though, they have all these

148
00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:33.109
community responsibilities that help preserve the community, help take

149
00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:37.179
care of these people um who are having trouble.

150
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.630
And so they try and make a community that,

151
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.559
that's product, socially productive and socially affirming. Um um

152
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.039
THE Pocas here, you know, I just get homeless

153
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:50.789
and left by the wayside because it's a caring

154
00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:55.630
community. And um but the sense is that they

155
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.090
will take this and use it for their own

156
00:08:58.099 --> 00:09:00.849
ends. I did not change the names. They got

157
00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:04.219
very pissed. I use that word when I um

158
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.500
suggested that we just use code names as anthropologist

159
00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.780
to do. They want to take credit for what

160
00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:13.409
they had the idea that I would use. Um

161
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.609
And then I give them credit with insulting to

162
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.799
them. Um And all these people wanna be able

163
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:22.539
to show their Children grandchildren, their relatives or neighbors

164
00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:26.190
that they contributed. I think I had about 100

165
00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:30.609
island of 750. Um, I had about 100 and

166
00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:33.130
80 informants in the end and all those are

167
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.140
listed. The idea is to do things that let

168
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.890
them take control, more control over their own fate.

169
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.320
They don't have control over it. The power dynamics

170
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.880
and nor do they have it in New Zealand

171
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.429
or Australia. But they do have something that can

172
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.659
give them dignity and it empowers them. The idea

173
00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:56.859
that people create their own history, as Max famously

174
00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:59.219
said, not under the conditions of own making is

175
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:02.070
very true, but here they can create their own

176
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.409
cultural traditions and in terms more of their own

177
00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:09.929
making that helped answer in some small way about

178
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.570
what I mean by outcome, benefiting those who won

179
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.609
funding your research and those who help facilitate it

180
00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:21.130
for governments. Um Let's just take that for a

181
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.679
second. Why would governments not mine that you don't

182
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.000
do a great deal of good, you should be

183
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.710
for all this stuff. Partly it's um you see,

184
00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.580
I medicine because it takes time to find the

185
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.840
right thing in anthropology. They do all these things.

186
00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:42.619
But what anthropologists do very well is they don't

187
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.929
really, they talk about disrupting the status quo incessantly,

188
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.559
they talk about how they're gonna have this big

189
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.979
dynamic effect that they never do. So talking about

190
00:10:52.729 --> 00:10:56.109
change and doing productive things and lots of people

191
00:10:56.119 --> 00:11:00.030
do, lots of institutions, government states. Um BUT they

192
00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:02.489
don't do it. And so all these publications that

193
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.440
few people read are good because they do keep

194
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:12.330
the anthropologist busy. They keep them um self-aggrandizing and

195
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.940
trying to be important. But these trends come and

196
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.330
go as you um raised with me in one

197
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.940
of your questions and um what the heck is

198
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.419
going on? Where's the value for other people who

199
00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:28.900
are funding them? I don't know about you, but

200
00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:32.820
you pay taxes in Portugal and you would like

201
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.090
to see the Portuguese government do something positive with

202
00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:38.950
them. Not just let a few people prim and

203
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.400
prime themselves about um their own self aggrandizement with

204
00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:46.460
books that nobody reads and don't help the people

205
00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:49.119
who help them do their research. That's what I

206
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.460
mean by outcome, doing something that empowers the people

207
00:11:52.789 --> 00:11:55.530
to try and take control of their fate and

208
00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:59.909
try and prove the common good in the states

209
00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:00.469
that fund them.

210
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.020
OK. But, but then let me ask you this

211
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.380
and probably uh some aspects of this question that

212
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.179
I'm about to ask. You will come up later

213
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.520
on in our conversation again. But uh in hearing

214
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.229
what you said there, what you answered to my

215
00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:23.760
previous question, I would imagine that many people, academics,

216
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.479
intellectuals and other kinds of people would react to

217
00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:30.580
what you said there by saying something like, oh,

218
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:36.080
but then you're saying that science, anthropology in this

219
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.859
specific case. But I would imagine that in your

220
00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:42.520
view, it would apply to all science out there

221
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.340
would need to have also some political goals, moral

222
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:51.809
goals instead of, as some people say, instead of

223
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:57.210
being a political, a moral because what matters, uh

224
00:12:57.219 --> 00:13:00.880
at least, um, as they say, uh what matters

225
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.650
is for us. I, I if for science is

226
00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:08.000
to uncover the truth and then, uh the rest,

227
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.609
uh that, that has to do more with politics,

228
00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:15.719
morality, helping people and so on doesn't matter that

229
00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:19.000
much, that's for other people to deal with. And

230
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.549
they also say that sometimes having those goals in

231
00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:27.080
mind might in a way, um I don't know,

232
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.479
contaminate in a sense, the production of knowledge. So

233
00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:31.979
I, I mean, I want to ask you this

234
00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:34.539
because I really want to hear what would be

235
00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:38.710
your real, right, Ken. They say all this and

236
00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:45.630
I view this as disingenuous or self delusionary. In

237
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.380
the end, I can use other words, but let's

238
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.880
not do it in a formal interview. Um There's

239
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.950
a sense of um they believe it because it's

240
00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.210
self serving. Matthew Arnold famously said truth is beauty,

241
00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:02.330
beauty truth. And that's all you need to know.

242
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.010
That's all you will know. I believe the ending

243
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.780
is and um beauty maybe. But um these anthropologists

244
00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:16.109
are looking to say how these people lived and

245
00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:19.659
it turns out we'll get to this perhaps. Um

246
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.840
They don't really know if you interview five informants

247
00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:32.159
and I 755,000 and group community. How the heck

248
00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:35.039
can you say that those five informants are the

249
00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:40.070
most knowledgeable? I interviewed, as I said, I talked

250
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.929
with about 100 and 80 people by interviewing intensively

251
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.489
about 60 people. Um 50 of the 50 of

252
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.619
those deemed most knowledgeable and I can compare them

253
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.020
with what had been said by um an anthropologist

254
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.820
who visited them in 1935 30 six. I believe

255
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.070
it is. Um, AND I have been in 77

256
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.729
to 81. Ok. Um Different, you know, all these

257
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:10.309
people have different views of the old system. They

258
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.090
have different views of which fish exists in Poca

259
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.010
Pogan, w which um fish hooks. The po the

260
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.830
Poca Pogan gave to the Fisher Museum in 1937

261
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.929
or so, which um material culture they had in

262
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.919
3637 when the Beagle hosts did their research. I'm

263
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.869
not sure I have the exact date there, but

264
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.809
it's in the very late thirties. Ok. Um And

265
00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:40.799
people differ. The first is one of the central

266
00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:44.260
elements, not only of this human species, but I

267
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.640
think life on earth, it has all these diversity.

268
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:54.049
They just found some new species. Um Off I

269
00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:58.960
think Chile um in the underwater, the mountain range.

270
00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:03.760
Um THE, and keep on finding differences and all

271
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.270
these species. Now, all humans are absolutely not alike.

272
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.140
All the people in this small island of 750

273
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:15.049
people are not alike. Um, TO say there's an

274
00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:18.539
American culture and that's a little ish. Um, WE

275
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:22.530
certainly know Americans are quite different at times. And,

276
00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:26.719
um, that's a political statement. The idea that people

277
00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:29.479
are going off to truth. I wanna know really

278
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:34.260
what they're doing with it. It's a camouflage for

279
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.359
actually trying to just go on and do what

280
00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:39.969
they want because they don't, what is true. And

281
00:16:39.979 --> 00:16:44.609
they, they're talking about building cumulative knowledge. Great. But

282
00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:46.729
if they do that, that's how they feel notes

283
00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.849
out in the public. Let's there was a um

284
00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:51.890
as I mentioned in that book and Lance, there

285
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.049
was about 80% of the medical research is worthless.

286
00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:57.729
They said Lance of all places and others have

287
00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:00.690
done this because all of this shades, they don't

288
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.080
give you all the data, they distort it. They

289
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:08.680
have all this um imperfections. The National Institute of

290
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:11.959
Health, the largest funder of health projects in the

291
00:17:11.969 --> 00:17:15.750
world is now asking now demanding everybody put their

292
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.959
field research on their research data in an archive

293
00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:23.010
that can be publicly accessible. Um There's a new

294
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.130
movement I just signed the economist about, well, it's

295
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.989
been going on but there's a new journal, a

296
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.430
new editor, a journal point journal. Um THE saying

297
00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:34.829
that everybody has to show the data. Um If

298
00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:38.949
they're gone for truth, great, maybe you can show

299
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:40.949
us a data that brings you to that truth

300
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.810
because claiming truth. What makes you not a false

301
00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:49.449
prophet? What makes you, um, any more than a

302
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:55.290
political um challenge that's self serving, trying to aggrandize

303
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.000
yourself and avoid moral responsibilities to the people who

304
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.280
funded you and the people who helped you. Mhm.

305
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.209
I can go on in a more point way

306
00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:06.390
but I

307
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.099
think, uh, you know, of, of course, but I

308
00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:11.829
guess we'll have more time to explore more details

309
00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:15.170
surrounding that in later questions. So I, I would

310
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.930
like to ask you now to get a little

311
00:18:17.939 --> 00:18:22.209
bit here, a little bit more into the theoretical

312
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:25.160
aspects of all of these uh the, the things

313
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.430
you explore in your book. Um What is culture?

314
00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:31.099
Exactly? What does

315
00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:35.800
it do? Culture? I'm not really sure what culture

316
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.829
is. Let's be clear. Um Anthropologists have all anthropologists

317
00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.219
have a very clear definition. If you look in

318
00:18:42.229 --> 00:18:46.459
anthropology textbook, you will see various definitions, but they

319
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:49.910
differ. Do they share a common view? Do they

320
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.589
allow people to interact with one another? Papuans interact

321
00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:56.449
with one another all the time? And yet they

322
00:18:56.459 --> 00:19:00.469
don't share common views like straight talk about property.

323
00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.969
Americans interact with one another. So they don't share

324
00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:06.540
common views politically. Um Does that mean they, because

325
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.979
they interact and proper with each other? And they

326
00:19:08.989 --> 00:19:11.989
have a distinctive way of talking doesn't seem to

327
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.030
me very different from Mexico or Canada or the

328
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.619
United States uh from, from Europe. People have all

329
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.920
these different ways of interacting and negotiating and those

330
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.069
negotiating style on just to one group of people

331
00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:29.439
in terms of content, which is what usually refers

332
00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:32.140
to culture. People don't all share that confidence for

333
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.609
sure. They have vague understanding and not if POA

334
00:19:36.939 --> 00:19:38.880
pokings can't agree on which fish are in their

335
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.329
waters, they can't agree in which the old fish

336
00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:43.770
hooks were. They can't agree in the present social

337
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.209
organization, they can agree in who owns a particular

338
00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:49.920
piece of land. And they, he, they don't, I'm

339
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.060
not sure we can say that the Unified Culture

340
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.209
Program and cluck home long ago, they found, I

341
00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:58.390
think 100 and 50 definitions of culture and there's

342
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.979
all these things, it be nobody, nobody knows. And

343
00:20:02.989 --> 00:20:05.040
you might not have had this in your and

344
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.949
your and the interviews talking about civilization and culture,

345
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.229
natural science mentions this. That's how it came to

346
00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:15.369
it. And um the idea of culture is just

347
00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.849
unifying during the German romantic era, all these different

348
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:25.060
oppression over German states and got them um unified.

349
00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:31.579
He did it politically. It just doesn't work. Um

350
00:20:31.589 --> 00:20:34.349
All these people that are different. And if you're

351
00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.819
an anthropologist, you go interview five or six trusted

352
00:20:37.829 --> 00:20:41.219
informants. Whiting. John Whiting once told me you only

353
00:20:41.229 --> 00:20:45.160
need three good informants. Yeah, about the culture. I

354
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.510
didn't challenge him because I was a graduate student.

355
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.140
Um AND time talking to him on the phone.

356
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.619
But um no, if you want to know what

357
00:20:56.099 --> 00:21:00.859
the group of 750 people. Ah, well, first of

358
00:21:00.869 --> 00:21:03.579
all, you have to stamp, sample them more effectively

359
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.839
and you have to say which group and young

360
00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:10.699
people, not as I interviewed 16 of the older

361
00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:14.599
people, it seems more knowledgeable about, I think. 30

362
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:25.530
30 um, one second, I interviewed 80 informants all

363
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.369
the time. Um, IT'S been 40 years a little

364
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.880
rusty. Um, BUT, uh, in a sense and then

365
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.550
I talked to both the emotion um knowledge about

366
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.770
the subject and all they different. And then they

367
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.089
came to a group together in a group, they

368
00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:44.609
came to a common version. And then when they

369
00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:47.229
left, they went back to their own original versions.

370
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.849
They were just being polite in the group. So

371
00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:52.449
there's all this fluidity about what culture is but

372
00:21:52.459 --> 00:21:57.430
people believe even what they think. Um That's ok

373
00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:00.420
when people are doing these things, they're responding to

374
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.510
context, they're shaping the behaviors. There's certain things from

375
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.500
the past that shape them in the present. These

376
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.430
are all known and very true. But it doesn't

377
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:11.800
mean that one group um as a unique thing

378
00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:15.510
that's only not shared with other people, probably shared

379
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.239
widely with a brand of people. I, I defy

380
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:26.010
you to tell me what American culture is. I

381
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.930
mean, it's,

382
00:22:26.939 --> 00:22:29.780
it's complicated, I guess you have to look at

383
00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:34.920
different uh at people with different socio-economic backgrounds, with

384
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.380
different sub uh subcultural backgrounds. If you want to

385
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.099
call them that and, uh, I, I mean, of

386
00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:45.089
course we can talk about, it would be very

387
00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:49.290
hard to talk about one unified American or Portuguese

388
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.180
or whatever.

389
00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:52.760
I didn't say. What do you think? Is this?

390
00:22:53.609 --> 00:22:55.979
Have you have a uni culture?

391
00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.469
Uh No, I don't think so. I, I mean,

392
00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:02.810
even, even just the simple fact of comparing, for

393
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:08.729
example, people from rural areas to people who live

394
00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:12.290
in cities or something like that, the urban areas,

395
00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:15.739
I mean, there are many diff e evident differences

396
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.530
there. So

397
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.010
even the people who live in that city or

398
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.660
even in a rural village that's different. Yeah. And

399
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.060
human diversity and some of them just differ for

400
00:23:25.069 --> 00:23:28.630
spite, they just like being different than someone else.

401
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.520
Um And so the idea of this unified culture,

402
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.890
so I'm not sure what culture is. Um ANTHROPOLOGISTS

403
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.160
have grasped onto it as an identity marker. But

404
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.130
the notion that they have this culture is a

405
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.959
very colonial vision. Um If I could say generally

406
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.550
that they're trying to say um you can fit

407
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.969
all these people into one nice spot, which is

408
00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:55.890
what Boaz did in his sense of culture. Um

409
00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:59.680
THE Eskimos. Um BUT there's a sense that he

410
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:07.050
um of anthropologists ignoring all these differences and that

411
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.449
to frame them as a collectivity without the individuality,

412
00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:15.689
without their diversity is very colonial. It's very talking

413
00:24:15.699 --> 00:24:18.750
about in a colonial way of um the col

414
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.849
imperialism framed the world.

415
00:24:21.609 --> 00:24:25.089
Mhm So we'll come back to, to that colonial

416
00:24:25.099 --> 00:24:28.199
aspect in a second. But let me just ask

417
00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:32.729
you then what is, then the object or what

418
00:24:32.739 --> 00:24:36.579
are the objects of study of cultural anthropology? I

419
00:24:36.589 --> 00:24:39.780
mean, what kinds of questions does it deal with?

420
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.119
To me, it's my view, culture and anthropology is

421
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.170
rather important. If we live in a world of

422
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.770
diversity, it's absolutely stamped in us of human differences,

423
00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:57.910
cultural anthropology or social anthropology or however you wanna

424
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.689
call it. And it's beyond me how they call

425
00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:03.890
it um is to try and help understand human

426
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.069
differences and find common ground among them. What you

427
00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:11.819
want to do is understand how other people think

428
00:25:11.829 --> 00:25:17.079
from their perspectives in the diversity and try and

429
00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:20.699
have common good come out of this, helping them.

430
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:24.849
Um As well as you to find ways to

431
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:30.280
um work together, find common solutions. We're right now

432
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.130
in a problem of climate change and it's a

433
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.329
very ish proposition whether we will get to the

434
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.500
State of Paris Agreement, they will back a it

435
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.540
pretty soon um about climate change. And there's a

436
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.869
sense that um people can, we find ways to

437
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.530
frame things to help one another. Um And all

438
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:58.130
these um things, there's enough conflict, it's enough, silence

439
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:04.369
isn't enough misunderstanding is enough stereotyping or the Portuguese.

440
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.040
If you go to Spain, they will say the

441
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.680
Portuguese. So this way you go to Portugal and

442
00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:12.060
say, oh the Spanish this way, that's all. That's

443
00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:14.760
a political tool. And if you can get below

444
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.550
these political tools, try and understand people on their

445
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.069
own terms and what is meaningful and what motivates

446
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:26.619
them and try and bring good to, um, in

447
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.920
some sort. Certainly to the people that you work

448
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:34.630
with and certainly facilitate policies, policies of the states

449
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.760
so that they plan to do not for their

450
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.079
own self interest, but for um, others that would

451
00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:44.150
seem to me not a bad place to begin,

452
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.920
but you're working with people not telling them how

453
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.719
to help them. Um Your mother probably tells you

454
00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:53.050
how to help him. You don't like it. I

455
00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.290
my mother is dead but I didn't like that.

456
00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.449
You have to or interact with people in participatory

457
00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:03.109
if you will, but you don't frame the things.

458
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.300
Um It's intriguing to think about giving people back

459
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.869
their field notes, not because they will use it

460
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.189
in my terms. They will use it in their

461
00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:12.900
terms and they do all sorts of different things

462
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.630
and you'll dispute um Much of what I say

463
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.160
perhaps fine, but it'll give them a way to

464
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.449
feel empowered in shaping their future. You wanna help

465
00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:25.069
people feel power in shaping the future in a

466
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:29.229
world that doesn't encourage that necessary. So culture, anthropology

467
00:27:29.239 --> 00:27:32.500
helps you engage with human differences, understand them better

468
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.119
and try and find common good in a way

469
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.709
that helps improve the human condition, especially for the

470
00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:39.699
people you work with.

471
00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:43.130
And what would you say, are some of the

472
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.089
biggest challenges of doing ethnographic work

473
00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:54.050
value. Any other graphic records of what I said

474
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.300
is a really big challenge here. But we'll get

475
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:07.060
to that. I presume, OK, um Trying to really,

476
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.489
and ethnic ethnographic work is absolutely wonderful. Um You

477
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.849
go in and you live with people and you

478
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:19.189
interact with them. You come to understand how they

479
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:23.329
envision the world. This is really great, how they

480
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.930
do things Malinowski famously said about um living among

481
00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:32.689
them and how that helped um seeing everything versus

482
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.400
point to Radcliffe living on the porch in the,

483
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.750
with the Australian Aborigines. I'm having people come to

484
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.609
him and tell them these answers. Um BUT um,

485
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.920
the question of the problems, you have to talk

486
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.390
to a lot of people, you have to stay

487
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.339
there a lot of time. Um WHEN you seem

488
00:28:55.349 --> 00:28:58.209
sufficient, suppose if you just do four or five

489
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:02.229
informants, I did 80 at least. And I guess,

490
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.640
and all these other people helped me. I stayed

491
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:11.800
there 41 months. Um We need you to really

492
00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:14.390
go there and you have to ask big questions.

493
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.280
The question I asked that led me off was

494
00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:21.430
that, um, the Beagle host have been there and

495
00:29:22.189 --> 00:29:24.089
trying to find out the exact date. I'm a

496
00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:28.000
little embarrassed here um when they did in the

497
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.400
late thirties and um, they know this until I

498
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.290
compared what people said about the past with what

499
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.780
they had, it turns out they were in the

500
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.810
midst of a cultural revival. Um THE ACAA system

501
00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:44.760
in which um several key informants, prominent informants um

502
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.060
said they had, you remember living through in the

503
00:29:48.069 --> 00:29:51.739
earlier years, there have been five anthropologists before me.

504
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.560
In all this government reports, no one ever mentioned.

505
00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:56.819
The question I dealt with in the first book

506
00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:59.699
was did the popo intervention a new tradition and

507
00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:03.239
the anthropologists e recording an old one and the

508
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.560
issue, the answer, as I said, both the poos

509
00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:10.290
are always revising the path, very Polynesian, very Pacific

510
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.709
Islander to um bring it up to date. So

511
00:30:13.719 --> 00:30:15.510
it's meaningful to them and bring it up to

512
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.099
date. It empowers them because they then take charge

513
00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:22.400
of what they believe their traditions. Um It's one

514
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.209
thing to listen to your parents tell you how

515
00:30:24.219 --> 00:30:26.750
it was in Portugal in the old days. It's

516
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.239
another thing for you to take those, change them

517
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.040
around making what you think is meaningful and then

518
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.510
say to your Children, this is how it is,

519
00:30:34.989 --> 00:30:37.839
this is how it was. Um IT empowers you

520
00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:41.520
as a person. Um Now the last of my

521
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.780
sense of the track for a second ethnographic field

522
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:52.930
work um that the problems of ethnographic field work

523
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:56.849
as to have all these different views and to

524
00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:00.650
um understand that people can present that to you,

525
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.959
particularly in a group of others may um be

526
00:31:04.969 --> 00:31:07.890
just trying to look positive. It's a trend. Um

527
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.930
And clearly when they get into these groups, I

528
00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:13.270
have it very clearly record. I went through before

529
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.810
they get to the group and another group and

530
00:31:14.869 --> 00:31:16.380
they view when they get in the group and

531
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.569
then different uh probably somewhere close to the original

532
00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:21.739
view when they leave the group. So that all

533
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.640
this view is things you have to understand what

534
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.410
the complexity of it. But in getting some of

535
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.599
this is better than nothing stereotyping, Portuguese, uh blah,

536
00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:36.270
blah, blah, who actually engaging with Portuguese and getting

537
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.780
a sense of them having appreciation. And God knows

538
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:46.890
about Americans um tremendous diversity. And um and right

539
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.689
now, of course, for me, sadness about what's going

540
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:55.859
on um is really, um you have to engage

541
00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:59.390
with that to understand it. I think it's fair

542
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.060
to say Americans who land a possibility, but a

543
00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:08.449
lot of possibility and um how do these people

544
00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:12.189
envision, how do they have hope, what are they

545
00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:15.229
doing this? So you engage with people and that's

546
00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:17.760
what I think graphic does and trying to do

547
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.699
it with a broader sample, I guess I'm getting

548
00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:23.469
hit that point. I'm sorry, being worthy. You have

549
00:32:23.479 --> 00:32:25.359
to engage with a broad number of people over

550
00:32:25.369 --> 00:32:27.589
a long period of time to get it good.

551
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.800
That would have been the short answer I should

552
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.109
have given you at first.

553
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.930
And so when it comes to the practice of

554
00:32:34.939 --> 00:32:38.699
cultural anthropology and perhaps going a little bit back

555
00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:40.479
to one of the points you made at the

556
00:32:40.489 --> 00:32:43.680
beginning of our conversation in what ways does the

557
00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:46.300
academic context shape?

558
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:54.099
It shapes it very clearly. Um It pays the

559
00:32:54.109 --> 00:32:57.599
academic salaries, it makes it, it gives it um

560
00:32:57.699 --> 00:33:00.160
in place to me. You do know that in

561
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.479
the early days we were saying in 18 seventies,

562
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.339
anthropologists did not reside in um universities. Often they

563
00:33:08.349 --> 00:33:11.880
reside in museums in the small detail relation that

564
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.209
the American anthropologists originally gave people when they gave

565
00:33:15.219 --> 00:33:19.500
their affiliation, they gave their home addresses with Bo

566
00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:23.849
eyes and the rises of um anthology from him,

567
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:30.180
they start giving the university affiliations the academic. Um

568
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:35.060
And today the academic affiliation is certainly cut. Wait,

569
00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:38.650
who can get a job where those in the

570
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.680
elite schools tend to get more jobs, definitely get

571
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:44.939
maybe 10. Is it often tend to get um

572
00:33:44.949 --> 00:33:48.680
more jobs than those at lower size universities. But

573
00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:55.170
the very sense of trying to of publishing all

574
00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:00.300
this material, which goes back to the 17 hundreds,

575
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.880
at least in Germany, they said professors had to

576
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.589
um publish things to give people to know they

577
00:34:07.599 --> 00:34:10.668
were doing something to bring in funding to the

578
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:17.800
right test today. Um Is that, let me just

579
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:23.350
think how to phrase it? Um And lost track

580
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.570
for a second. I'm just thinking about Germany then

581
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.409
um the focus, the question is culture and what

582
00:34:31.418 --> 00:34:34.469
is the cultural oh tied to the academics?

583
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.020
Uh All the academic context shapes the practice of

584
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.540
cultural

585
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:44.489
andrology. But I'm more, that was a warm up

586
00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:46.539
for the base because I'm gonna be much more

587
00:34:46.549 --> 00:34:51.629
direct. It shapes their components and makes them so

588
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.350
they appear to be doing all these dynamic issues

589
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.790
a certain come and clearly like micro me and

590
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:03.820
others really stir public debate by and large. Um

591
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.560
ALL these publications, all these things. Um I'm going

592
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.489
anywhere and that's my view purposeful because it means

593
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.939
that universities aren't threatened. Um They don't have to

594
00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:20.060
threaten their fundraiser just with this whole issue of

595
00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:27.770
Gaza. Um ON these academics um being told that

596
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.620
they can, they have to be students until they

597
00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:33.139
have to be very careful about not being anti

598
00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:37.719
or anti scientist or anti-israeli. And the Palestinians are

599
00:35:37.729 --> 00:35:42.770
clearly suffering and having these massacres. And what do

600
00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.050
you eat? Genocide? Depends on how you define genocide,

601
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.169
but they supposedly have to behave. Um They can't

602
00:35:50.489 --> 00:35:54.139
go around protesting too much about what is really

603
00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:00.100
to my mind, despicable thing is really so out

604
00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:06.520
of hand excessive. Um What happened there is the

605
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.600
initial attack by the Palestinians was deeply unfortunate, but

606
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:18.489
the response is far more unfortunate. Um And, and

607
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.419
keep it down that you don't have the academic

608
00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:26.030
say too much though. And though there was protest

609
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.389
at first they all become soft present becomes softer.

610
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.860
The um because they want the funds, um they

611
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.860
don't wanna lose their jobs. It becomes a politically,

612
00:36:38.209 --> 00:36:42.590
it has appearance of disruption, change without being that

613
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:46.600
the academics have, um, now write all these publications

614
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:54.040
that and some, like, vapors or vapors, they just

615
00:36:54.050 --> 00:37:02.840
don't matter that much. Um, YEAH. Shouldn't we be

616
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.100
trying to help others if we get money, if

617
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:12.179
we get help from them? Um, IT'S something, um,

618
00:37:12.189 --> 00:37:17.879
it's a bit moral, um, academics while talking more

619
00:37:17.889 --> 00:37:24.080
often it is very self serving, aggrandizement of individuals,

620
00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:27.629
um, talking about how important they are and they

621
00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:31.169
talk about all this good they're doing. It sounds

622
00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:33.139
good. I don't know if it is good because

623
00:37:33.149 --> 00:37:34.919
we don't see the data, we don't see what's

624
00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:37.800
really happening. Um When all these people say they,

625
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.489
they, the people they lived among um love them.

626
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.010
If you are the only source of that, what

627
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.239
do you believe? Um YOU want to see the

628
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.439
field of, you want to see their data, you

629
00:37:55.449 --> 00:38:00.159
want to be able to um too good the

630
00:38:00.169 --> 00:38:04.360
benefits others besides yourself and academics allows you to

631
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.800
get away with talking about truth and beauty. Well,

632
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:11.209
not beauty, but I think that um that um

633
00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:15.770
doesn't exist as a way of conning out um

634
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.530
your own self aggrandizement and the political pac conversation

635
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.219
of you in terms of um the bri and

636
00:38:22.229 --> 00:38:26.790
good when you're in the academy, I think that

637
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.620
covers it, that it could be more vocal but

638
00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:34.100
gets a big basic idea. It's highly provocative as

639
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.300
you can imagine. Um A few people sort of

640
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.209
agree with me maybe agree with me temporarily, but

641
00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:43.860
that's really what's going on. The hegemonic structures, the

642
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:48.449
University of hegemonic and a revised sense of sub

643
00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:50.850
hegemonic or whatever you want to use, going to

644
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:56.629
jump, um, keep university professors and academics politically passive

645
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.310
so the school can get more money. It doesn't

646
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.790
disrupt the funders of those who support them. Um,

647
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.409
WELL, glorifying in all these publications that they have

648
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.469
that don't, in the end do a lot, they

649
00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:11.969
said they build truth up here. But if they

650
00:39:11.979 --> 00:39:16.000
don't show the data, who the hell knows. It

651
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.290
was a, um, I mean, you Phil Salman who

652
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.300
caught someone else that is when you try and

653
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:26.919
bring different anthropologists together, um about a particular region

654
00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:30.159
or even Spain and you try and find out

655
00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:32.949
how they, um I don't all together, it's very

656
00:39:32.959 --> 00:39:36.419
difficult. They have all these different things you want

657
00:39:36.429 --> 00:39:38.360
to see the data and how they come to

658
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.429
it as a way of trying to get a

659
00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:43.570
broad underst understand that can benefit others.

660
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:49.330
But these hegemonic structures that you talk about there,

661
00:39:49.649 --> 00:39:53.169
where do they stem from? Exactly? Is it from

662
00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:56.520
the socio cultural context they exist in?

663
00:39:57.219 --> 00:40:02.729
Yeah, they, um, Ramsey is a good person to

664
00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:05.580
begin with but he talked, he was this poor

665
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.370
guy in prison for so many years scribbling notes

666
00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:15.020
in um in prison, passing them out. Um He

667
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.870
uh ideas that these are broader frameworks in which

668
00:40:19.879 --> 00:40:23.949
we operate and we don't, we're focusing on everyday

669
00:40:23.959 --> 00:40:25.979
life and the details are we don't see a

670
00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:30.489
bigger picture. The bigger picture um is the way

671
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.860
those in power maintain their power. Um Basically, it's

672
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.780
a power thing. Um It comes from the cultural

673
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:44.280
context but raise among human. So I think, I

674
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.929
don't know, but I think it's, well, let's say

675
00:40:46.939 --> 00:40:52.050
very common in human societies, the people um do

676
00:40:52.159 --> 00:40:56.919
not grasp the bigger picture, the truths and present.

677
00:40:56.929 --> 00:40:59.870
So they try and defend against it. They try

678
00:40:59.879 --> 00:41:03.139
and do things but they can never succeed by

679
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.820
opposing something. They actually reinforce it because this isn't

680
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.669
succeed in imposing a debt freedom. They're just not

681
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.770
succeeding. Um But in fact, the very structures don't

682
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.979
allow them to suc succeed in here, anthropologists and

683
00:41:16.989 --> 00:41:22.110
intellectuals could help illuminate this hegemonic structure. They're not

684
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.719
doing a good job of that, certainly not anthropologists.

685
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.580
And uh uh I mean, going back to one

686
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.459
of the points you've alluded to earlier in our

687
00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:37.100
conversation, what are, would you say the drawbacks of

688
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.300
specialization?

689
00:41:41.649 --> 00:41:44.129
You only see the bigger picture of the hegemonic

690
00:41:44.139 --> 00:41:48.239
things. People talk about these and there's some very

691
00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.860
good things, you know why Nancy Shepherd J pa

692
00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:57.189
particularly Paul Farmer talks all these bigger issues. But

693
00:41:57.199 --> 00:42:05.540
um they tend to get lost um in the

694
00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:09.489
Russia for in interest, you're able to keep control

695
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.469
of what you're studying. If I specialize in antibiotics.

696
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.080
Now specialize in subtopics or sub fields are within

697
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:22.300
that society. Um YOU miss a lot of dynamics

698
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.709
going on in the society. He lets you feel

699
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:29.449
like you have control over something, right? Your feeling

700
00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:35.110
control doesn't mean you're adding full knowledge, particularly if

701
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.729
you're not showing others how you got the data

702
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.750
and how they can then confirm and not get

703
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:48.350
other broader perspectives. Um Yeah, Poca. Poca, right? You're

704
00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:52.110
not sure. Um TALK various when I had a

705
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.610
public display, my own public display. And then before

706
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.560
I put out these notes, which I'm about to

707
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.689
do within the next two or three months, um

708
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.649
they were very respectful to me and so forth

709
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.979
when they get them, they will argue with me,

710
00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:10.060
they will argue with this and that, that's to

711
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:15.479
be expected, they're trying to empower themselves. Um That's

712
00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:18.360
what academics do. They try to power themselves, elbowing

713
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.310
everybody else in their own things saying that and

714
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.939
to trust and truth I did as you may

715
00:43:23.949 --> 00:43:28.270
know um about the Yanomami experience. Some of those

716
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.860
people are very nice people, Ray Haines are particularly

717
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:37.540
like um that's one that I like, but um

718
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.419
they just have to go at each other, they

719
00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:47.030
just can't stop. Um And not really just truth

720
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.919
in my mind as much as scoring points and

721
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.159
writing more articles at the end of feeling more

722
00:43:54.169 --> 00:43:59.439
empowered. Um It just goes on and on. Um

723
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:07.169
ALONE, can we do something better who we people

724
00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:08.169
who are helping us?

725
00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:13.310
Yeah. So uh uh uh I would like to

726
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.810
get into the topic of public anthropology. But just

727
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:22.000
before that, could you tell us what, uh post

728
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:27.649
colonialism really means? Because many times we hear people

729
00:44:27.659 --> 00:44:30.469
talking about it but they tend to be very

730
00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:35.489
dismissive. Some people say that it's, I mean, actually

731
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.929
not real science, but I, I would like to

732
00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:41.899
hear as someone who, uh, who proposes a post

733
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.989
colonial approach. Uh I would like to hear from

734
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.409
you what it really entails.

735
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.570
This is very interesting, a good rule to show

736
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:56.040
that I'm not fully courage to take on the

737
00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.959
system is I should tell you the truth here.

738
00:45:00.189 --> 00:45:04.620
Um, I think post colonialism, it was very hot

739
00:45:04.629 --> 00:45:07.530
about 20 years ago and came back now with

740
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.139
Aurora because anthropologists need something to write about all

741
00:45:11.149 --> 00:45:13.439
these transit because they need things to write about.

742
00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:15.989
They write about them and then like a slash

743
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.330
and burn economy gets filled up with all these

744
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.010
weeds and things. So they had to go on

745
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:25.030
to something else. Um, I think Anthony Wallace in

746
00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:30.340
1960 said that too long before most people's time.

747
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:35.169
Um, MAYBE it was a wolf. I don't know.

748
00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:43.689
Sorry. Um, ANYWAY, the idea, um, post colonialism. Mhm.

749
00:45:44.629 --> 00:45:48.050
Since we're pretty much stealing colonialism, I'm not sure

750
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:53.850
what post is the, the talking about post colonialism.

751
00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:59.500
We just as post colonialism exists. Um, IT may

752
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:04.600
be like with Gertrude Stein said of Oakland in

753
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:06.850
a famous quote which I presume you do not

754
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.050
know. They said there's no, there there um she

755
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.330
was saying, but San Francisco Bay was really open

756
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.149
and there's no idea that where is a clear

757
00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:21.399
delineation of people embracing post Mongia in more than

758
00:46:21.409 --> 00:46:25.889
rhetoric, they talk about participating and helping these people.

759
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.030
God knows the colonial regimes did that as well

760
00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:34.629
in some places like Uganda and Nigeria and Nadal

761
00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:37.709
um did a very good job at times in

762
00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:40.830
helping for in his time and his terms. And

763
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.590
what's happening now in Nigeria? Um Uganda is side

764
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.760
to my mind um that there's a sense of

765
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.949
um people did good then they're trying to do

766
00:46:55.959 --> 00:46:59.909
good. Now it seems to me is an elbowing

767
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.780
out of the old. They try to put themselves

768
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:08.219
into new and be prima donnas, I think in

769
00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:11.000
a way maybe I shouldn't um be in the

770
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.689
attic by um uh my old days, you forget

771
00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:21.340
it was an American anthropologist, um former president of

772
00:47:21.399 --> 00:47:27.689
the Anthology American Anthropological Association. Um It's suggesting making

773
00:47:27.699 --> 00:47:29.899
me less effective to be old and not remember

774
00:47:29.909 --> 00:47:36.739
everybody's name. That's something um The ale is just

775
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:41.010
trying to tear down the old. Um And it

776
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.629
makes no sense trying to do that unless you're

777
00:47:43.639 --> 00:47:47.290
trying to, you know, um fashion brand. I mean,

778
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.610
just make more space for your new publications, which

779
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:55.110
it's doing. But what the hell goes on if

780
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.320
you're just focusing on new publications and not helping?

781
00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:03.689
Are they benefiting others particularly those who helped you,

782
00:48:04.659 --> 00:48:09.570
who you benefit from. Um It's just another excuse

783
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.780
me, Shane. Um I remember you have to regret

784
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.629
this. It's just another scan you're talking about all

785
00:48:16.639 --> 00:48:19.860
these new things, blah, blah, blah, blah, um de

786
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:21.899
integrating the old as a way of being able

787
00:48:21.909 --> 00:48:26.429
to publish new things. The focus in the publications

788
00:48:26.739 --> 00:48:31.659
declaring something new rather than trying to do something

789
00:48:31.669 --> 00:48:36.870
good. Um I mean, I understand good is like

790
00:48:36.879 --> 00:48:39.600
truth. It's very vague and so forth. But if

791
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:41.870
you can empower the people in a way that

792
00:48:41.879 --> 00:48:44.010
they can feel good about trying to address their

793
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.229
problems and that's very good one that relate to

794
00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:52.260
that. One of the themes in America, there's tremendous

795
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:57.300
inequalities more so than Portugal Spain, so horrendous ones.

796
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:01.679
Um But many of the people could, came in

797
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:04.560
the morning with a sense of hope of possibility

798
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.830
that they can improve their life. It may not

799
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:14.219
be true. This ideology makes life more livable. So

800
00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:18.030
they do that. The sense of trying to help

801
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.570
people feel empowered and more hope is not a

802
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.850
bad way to go rather than just trying to

803
00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.810
publish more publications that cited by so many people

804
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.139
and within such a period of time. Um I'm

805
00:49:34.149 --> 00:49:36.429
doing a project with All Metric which you may

806
00:49:36.439 --> 00:49:38.790
have heard of. I mean to a degree people

807
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.209
have cited in the, their publication is cited in

808
00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:44.129
the public room going to the newspapers of the

809
00:49:44.139 --> 00:49:47.560
world. And um that will be coming up soon.

810
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.209
But I've tried to encourage them with them saying

811
00:49:51.219 --> 00:49:52.909
here's the people who are doing this and I

812
00:49:52.919 --> 00:49:57.149
tried to say here, departments now, next month or

813
00:49:57.159 --> 00:50:00.600
two, talk about a ranking system. Here's this university

814
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:03.419
or departments, here's a rank and here's the people

815
00:50:03.429 --> 00:50:07.500
who contributing to that ranking is the people who

816
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:09.780
are not. And if these people who are not

817
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.050
doing it could publish more in the public realm,

818
00:50:12.229 --> 00:50:15.350
they would get a higher ranking. I don't know.

819
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.679
Um But the idea is trying to get people

820
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.909
out of the narrow niche and do broader good.

821
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.620
I mean, what the is going on here is

822
00:50:26.629 --> 00:50:30.209
this just um a talk show in which people

823
00:50:30.219 --> 00:50:32.290
can say what they want and do what they

824
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.610
want. Is there no moral basis for what we're

825
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:42.679
going we're doing here. Mhm The answer is no,

826
00:50:42.689 --> 00:50:52.899
there isn't but um sinus moment but also probably

827
00:50:53.239 --> 00:51:01.679
really moments, intellectuals having a very protective protected lifestyle

828
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:06.040
could do more, should do more for helping improve

829
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.010
the human condition.

830
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.709
And so what is then a public anthropology?

831
00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:20.719
OK. I coined the term um And everybody would

832
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:24.060
say, oh yeah, this is good. The first surprise

833
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.399
of coining it is all these people started arguing

834
00:51:26.409 --> 00:51:29.389
with me about what it meant and about finding

835
00:51:29.399 --> 00:51:34.699
other terms engage in. Um SO apply anthropology who

836
00:51:34.709 --> 00:51:37.030
I thought would be really good to work with.

837
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.239
And we have all these overlapping things really trying

838
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.870
to ice me out. Oh, you know, it's all

839
00:51:42.939 --> 00:51:47.780
apply anthropology. I mean, in the end, what is

840
00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:50.540
this all about? This is just giving people more

841
00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:55.090
space to publish, to argue and argue about these

842
00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:01.080
things. Public anthropology with very clearly a series that

843
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.360
came out of the California s with the California

844
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.939
series of Public Anthropology is now being continued on

845
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:11.370
University of California Press. But as I talk to

846
00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:13.800
you here, it sort of a vision of dealing

847
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.219
with public problems in public ways that can make

848
00:52:16.229 --> 00:52:20.659
a difference to others. And, um, I have so

849
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:23.100
I have all these different definitions. I bring up,

850
00:52:23.699 --> 00:52:26.280
I'm very liberal myself about what it means. I'm

851
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:30.030
not sure I haven't been there. It was just

852
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.770
shocked to see all these people arguing with me

853
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.310
about it. Um, LIKE they knew it, try to

854
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.760
just claim it and elbow me out. Um, THOUGH

855
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.719
it's had an impact on these various programs. It

856
00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.320
was for a while. Um, JUST a current anthropology,

857
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:52.760
which they had a public anthropology forum, I believe

858
00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:57.750
in their, um, in there. Um, IT'S been used

859
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.620
in very twice but, um, lot of people try

860
00:53:01.629 --> 00:53:05.030
to coop into their own ends and they're doing

861
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.590
reasonably well in their own terms. But I don't

862
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.750
believe that's what public anthropologist, that's what I'm saying,

863
00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:17.500
trying to help others benefit others do good that

864
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.820
empowers other people in ways that make you feel

865
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.000
good. You can have hope the future, not just

866
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.739
the oppression

867
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.560
and what specific issues does it address

868
00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:37.699
the world, but particularly, as I've said in anthropology

869
00:53:37.709 --> 00:53:41.149
of anthropology, the hegemonic structures that limit anthropologists from

870
00:53:41.159 --> 00:53:44.530
doing squat and keep them talking about these dynamics

871
00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.989
and talking about this being bla bla and, um,

872
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:55.229
not doing very much. Um, THEY try but maybe

873
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:59.239
they've made a difference. But it's a question of

874
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.520
whether you have the hegemonic structures that we talked

875
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:06.739
about earlier or maintain the stay seem to work

876
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:12.669
reasonably well. People. Um No change. That's what I'm

877
00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:15.949
trying to point out. And as you perhaps know,

878
00:54:15.959 --> 00:54:18.810
it's a losing battle and people who are going

879
00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:22.179
to just sit run dominate and I in my

880
00:54:22.189 --> 00:54:26.100
retirement in Hawaii with enough fun to just keep

881
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:30.419
on making the point, trying to remind people there's

882
00:54:30.429 --> 00:54:33.110
something more than their own self, a brand, even

883
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.030
more than just their own self interest that they

884
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.719
should be helping others in the world, benefiting other

885
00:54:39.729 --> 00:54:44.110
particular people who help them on the state to

886
00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:49.189
make human life to improve the human condition, not,

887
00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:53.429
not by cutting down trees and publishing more books,

888
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.899
but by um helping people feel more empowered about

889
00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:03.669
trying to do good. It's a very complex issue

890
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.739
but what good means in all these things and

891
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.620
they're trying to empower them. So they become more,

892
00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.860
they have more control over their own fate.

893
00:55:13.169 --> 00:55:16.919
And when it comes to the ethics side of

894
00:55:16.929 --> 00:55:20.270
things here, does it, I it, I would imagine

895
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.360
that it also includes uh the way we do

896
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:30.860
ethnography and the way we treat the subjects of

897
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:34.939
study in anthropology, namely the people from, for e

898
00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:38.870
for example, traditional societies and elsewhere.

899
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.520
I'm not sure what tradition is just in the

900
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:47.250
side. Um We go, we go to these places

901
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.129
and we say, oh, this is traditional society because

902
00:55:50.139 --> 00:55:52.050
it's not like us. And we are the center

903
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.010
of dynamic change. We have no idea as graver

904
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.290
and the other person in the history of Don

905
00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.959
talked about these societies are always changing so traditional.

906
00:56:02.969 --> 00:56:05.090
I'm not sure it just means something like us,

907
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.949
but I know exactly what you mean.

908
00:56:07.379 --> 00:56:09.929
I, I mean, I mean, let's say then non

909
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.120
industrialized societies

910
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:20.090
perhaps, maybe just, maybe that should be something you

911
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.850
negotiate with the people themselves, you come with these

912
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.469
rules, you're not supposed to cite them by name

913
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:32.320
in your field work, which the poca pokings off

914
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:36.000
tremendously as I said to you before, they want

915
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.959
to be cited. What am I icing them out,

916
00:56:38.969 --> 00:56:43.909
making them nameless characters? Um There's a sense of

917
00:56:43.919 --> 00:56:48.429
um negotiating those ethics with the people in an

918
00:56:48.439 --> 00:56:51.929
honest way. You do not want me to tell

919
00:56:51.939 --> 00:56:55.360
you, Ricardo how you were supposed to lead your

920
00:56:55.370 --> 00:57:00.070
life, going to my ethics and you have to

921
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.310
negotiate that with me or I with you that

922
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.719
we have to um talk about. And so let's

923
00:57:07.729 --> 00:57:17.100
leave ethics. Phil Philosophical can um steady open because

924
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.399
it's trying wait all the time. Um, AND try

925
00:57:20.409 --> 00:57:28.090
and deal with the people themselves. Here's a tricky

926
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:34.939
situation. Shannon who is now deceased ju, and ethical.

927
00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:37.770
Should he have given guns to these Yanomami who

928
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.600
then perceived to turn around and kill a Yanomami?

929
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.909
Yeah. The mommy got the guns really liked it.

930
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.840
You know, mommy got killed and no, and it

931
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:51.370
turns out it's supposedly, I don't know if it's

932
00:57:51.379 --> 00:57:55.199
true. So the missionaries were involved in some of

933
00:57:55.209 --> 00:57:57.510
this. It gets to be this whole can of

934
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.639
worms and so forth. Um It's never easy but

935
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:05.870
the question is, I think what groups are you

936
00:58:05.879 --> 00:58:08.550
dealing with? And what terms and how can you

937
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.760
find something that will work? Did Neil and all

938
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:15.639
his work with the, you know, Mommy for the

939
00:58:16.149 --> 00:58:19.489
National Atomic Commission. I'm getting a little every night,

940
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.590
every night here. Um But the Yami controversy, I

941
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.310
don't believe Neil tried previously caused um an epidemic

942
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.340
among the um you know, Mommy trying to do

943
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:35.149
good, but it's often, but he never consulted them.

944
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:41.000
Consulting with people was a decent long way to

945
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:45.870
um trying to make things work between you. That

946
00:58:45.879 --> 00:58:49.330
would be my take on ethics, talk to the

947
00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.629
people, listen to them right yet listen to them

948
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.780
negotiate what will work for both parties.

949
00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.879
And do you think there is enough collaboration across

950
00:59:01.889 --> 00:59:04.290
subfields in anthropology?

951
00:59:06.159 --> 00:59:10.500
Short answer is no. Um The proper answer is

952
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:15.280
yes I did. This paper some years ago. Um

953
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.310
AND it said basically that the Cooper operation among

954
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.229
subfields, which is very important to some anthropologists to

955
00:59:21.239 --> 00:59:24.260
the establishment is a myth and went through the

956
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:29.500
old American anthropology um articles from the beginning to

957
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.860
the present showed most of these were very separate,

958
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:35.719
distinct features. Kroeger could deal with physical anthropology or

959
00:59:35.729 --> 00:59:38.830
biological anthropology. You know, they could deal with um

960
00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:42.949
linguistics, it could deal with archaeology, could deal with

961
00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:46.139
ethnography, culture and anthropology, but they get all combined

962
00:59:46.739 --> 00:59:49.870
um in some ways, the association because uh as

963
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.939
members from all these different specialties want you to

964
00:59:53.949 --> 00:59:56.010
combine and want you to collaborate. It seems to

965
00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.800
me it's not a bad thing, a good thing

966
00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:02.219
trying to collaborate um not out of appearance but

967
01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:05.090
out of substance, but you should collaborate with them

968
01:00:06.429 --> 01:00:11.350
other people beyond its truth. Um You should just

969
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.159
limit to that you try and instead of dealing

970
01:00:14.169 --> 01:00:17.610
with a fail with it, this is like try

971
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.760
and deal with problems how to ease the pain

972
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:28.669
in certain situations that people who are suffering. Um

973
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:34.280
Most places anthropologists go need more non western settings,

974
01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:39.719
live under what could be termed oppressive political environments.

975
01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:43.040
You know, when you get kicked out of the

976
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.879
country the next day, so you try and behave

977
01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:50.300
in some modest way perhaps. But what can you

978
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:56.830
do to help and maybe just giving them information

979
01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.379
that they can then get themselves in trouble over

980
01:00:59.459 --> 01:01:02.080
they they can then feel empowered about, they can

981
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:08.419
do things maybe good, um, giving people the tools

982
01:01:08.429 --> 01:01:13.030
they need to power themselves. That education is supposed

983
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.139
to do, give others a tool. So maybe you're

984
01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:19.729
trying to just help them figure out how to

985
01:01:19.739 --> 01:01:24.320
do things. Mhm. But, um,

986
01:01:25.129 --> 01:01:26.439
no. Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry.

987
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.030
Now, go on. Ok.

988
01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.550
Now, uh, I have one last question then, uh,

989
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.270
regarding public anthropology. So, what would you say are

990
01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.260
the main obstacles to it?

991
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.479
I'm gonna get in trouble again. I, um, in

992
01:01:48.489 --> 01:01:53.179
principle I should be well behaved. That's my personality.

993
01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:59.489
I guess I'm too feisty. Um, YEAH, it's a

994
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.350
self aggrandizement of anthropologists in the hegemonic structure of

995
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.689
academia that prevents real political change, that prevents these

996
01:02:08.699 --> 01:02:12.409
people from doing more than talking about change, appearing

997
01:02:12.419 --> 01:02:16.659
to, to help others in doing squat to, um,

998
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.280
really focus on others. Just a simple, straightforward thing.

999
01:02:21.889 --> 01:02:25.300
And you are, seem to me a sophisticated person,

1000
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:27.389
talk to lots of people. I'm gonna ask you

1001
01:02:27.399 --> 01:02:31.100
this question. How many anthropologists, how many researchers do

1002
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:34.649
you know that have made it? Put the public?

1003
01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:37.909
They have put their research notes, the field materials

1004
01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.750
onto the web for others to see. Um,

1005
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.830
I mean, no one I know of. I don't,

1006
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.530
I don't think I can name anyone unfortunately.

1007
01:02:53.929 --> 01:02:57.399
Yeah, I agree with it, unfortunately. And I, I'm

1008
01:02:57.409 --> 01:03:02.709
embarrassed, I'm somewhat nervous here that I'm doing this.

1009
01:03:02.719 --> 01:03:06.199
It's taken a while to get all these, unfortunately.

1010
01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:08.929
I have 14,000 pages of field notes because I

1011
01:03:08.939 --> 01:03:12.280
was here for, for 41 months and then have

1012
01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:15.760
in condition to piled some earlier field notes to

1013
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.929
the 16,000 to go. But I, I'm under the

1014
01:03:18.939 --> 01:03:22.780
impression they haven't done that. They could simply make

1015
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:27.129
it to it be more post collo if you

1016
01:03:27.139 --> 01:03:30.689
will to let others empower themselves rather than dictating

1017
01:03:30.699 --> 01:03:33.989
how that empowerment will go by making them public

1018
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.939
on the web. Papuans were not some. I said

1019
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.500
that the A tower system that they were under

1020
01:03:45.879 --> 01:03:48.060
try to say it somewhat gently but I said

1021
01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:52.679
it was a myth. They never really existed. Do

1022
01:03:52.689 --> 01:03:55.050
you think that slowed down the Poca Poca? Did

1023
01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:01.000
that become a um criticizing incessantly? They said that's

1024
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.100
Rob's position. That's not mine. He doesn't know what

1025
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:08.459
he's talking about. I do. Um I know what

1026
01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:12.649
my grandfather told me my experience and um you

1027
01:04:12.659 --> 01:04:16.350
just go on, I can dismiss it. I, the

1028
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.409
theological will have po comments about particular people and

1029
01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:22.149
they'll laugh and say, yeah, that's true of that

1030
01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:26.739
person or that wasn't me or that's, but they're

1031
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.510
used to this back and forth. You walk out

1032
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.939
your door and people say nice things and not

1033
01:04:33.949 --> 01:04:38.479
so nice things. That's just life. And I if

1034
01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:41.399
you look at me carefully here, I'm not God,

1035
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.030
I'm not an expert on person. I 14,000 pages

1036
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.520
of funerals here, many from surveys, but there's a

1037
01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:54.229
sense of um just one more view that they

1038
01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:59.350
can take and use for themselves. But why should

1039
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.229
we give them tools for their own empowerment by

1040
01:05:03.239 --> 01:05:07.590
showing the film notes? I came in this by

1041
01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:13.030
accident and have great insight here. Um But um

1042
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:16.179
I think, oh, I was gonna give them to

1043
01:05:16.189 --> 01:05:18.419
the University of Auckland Library because they had it

1044
01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:23.570
on the notes and then I retired. Um AND

1045
01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.100
then say, oh, maybe that's Ganda and that maybe

1046
01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:29.560
who knows when that would happen. And then I

1047
01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:31.790
decided I can scan them myself here in the

1048
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:35.120
body and turned out to be a lot longer

1049
01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:37.919
than I thought. And then universal often did not

1050
01:05:37.929 --> 01:05:40.040
want them because they weren't just these unique things

1051
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:43.300
that only them would have. I said that's great.

1052
01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.100
I'll just put it on the web myself. I

1053
01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:48.560
have the ability to do that. So that's the

1054
01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:52.060
next two or three months. I'm hoping in two

1055
01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:56.449
months, maybe that, but, and down your nose, um

1056
01:05:56.459 --> 01:05:59.540
it will all be out there. And then the

1057
01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:02.250
idea to like Pocas use them and have people

1058
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.919
help them from the community make sense of them

1059
01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:08.810
in ways that they can use more effectively. We

1060
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:13.149
stir up arguments about land. Absolutely. Instead of just

1061
01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:15.449
one person giving a view of that land, they

1062
01:06:15.459 --> 01:06:18.100
have several and I can assure you, they won't

1063
01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:21.469
just believe me in an argument, they believe whatever

1064
01:06:21.479 --> 01:06:27.330
they want. Uh So it gives them empowerment. That's

1065
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.610
a most colonial view. Um And like you, I

1066
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.659
haven't found anybody. It makes me a little nervous.

1067
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:37.949
What the heck am I doing here? But that's

1068
01:06:37.959 --> 01:06:42.030
right. It should be done. NIH, doesn't, there's a

1069
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.399
movement like um about doing it. Um More as

1070
01:06:47.409 --> 01:06:50.510
I said, may have said, Lance said, um that

1071
01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.919
80% of the research was useless because there were

1072
01:06:52.929 --> 01:06:55.830
all these ways of not being able to replicate

1073
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.479
anything or not just you can't replicate and post

1074
01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:01.550
the field work and, but you can get a

1075
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.439
sense of how you came to it. Um, OTHER

1076
01:07:06.449 --> 01:07:08.060
people were there and I can see how they

1077
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.459
came to their conclusions and I can differ with

1078
01:07:10.469 --> 01:07:17.610
them. Um, IS that what you perceive? So we're

1079
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:23.120
going after truth purity, something else, cumulative knowledge. Maybe

1080
01:07:23.129 --> 01:07:26.419
we should establish being a little vulnerable and open

1081
01:07:26.429 --> 01:07:26.929
up your fingers.

1082
01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.050
So, Doctor Borovsky, just before we go, would you

1083
01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:36.540
like to tell people where they can find you

1084
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.340
and your work on the internet?

1085
01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.830
Um That's Center for pub, I think it's Public

1086
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:49.169
anthropology.org in which, um, they will be in the

1087
01:07:49.179 --> 01:07:53.219
front page there. Um Right. Being done now, there'll

1088
01:07:53.229 --> 01:07:55.780
be poke, poke and field materials. You can see

1089
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:57.850
that you can go look at it now and

1090
01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.290
then you'll be under that Public Anthropology series. I

1091
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.149
think it says, and that will, um, have more

1092
01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:11.070
books. Um, BUT I would, if they have the

1093
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.898
basic materials, yeah, I would encourage them to think

1094
01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:21.069
for themselves and try and do something that gets

1095
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.319
them out of these hegemonic stretches and self serving

1096
01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:28.270
stretches that really benefit other people. I mean, what

1097
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:32.149
the hell, what's going on here? It's, I think

1098
01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.500
it's a bit of a scam that we talk

1099
01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:36.950
about helping all these other people and we clearly

1100
01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:39.040
do in some ways, we clearly help empower some

1101
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.299
and we don't know this, but we clearly try

1102
01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.950
and, um you should do more than just talk

1103
01:08:47.959 --> 01:08:52.019
about it. It's more than I talk. The famous

1104
01:08:52.028 --> 01:08:57.109
thing by uh O Rich Cleaver. Wasn't, can you

1105
01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.379
go uh if you, if you know, not part

1106
01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:03.919
of the um solution, you're part of the problem.

1107
01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:06.089
And the idea is that these people just talk

1108
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.229
and talk about doing concrete things and they don't

1109
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.750
necessarily. So I like you can read some more

1110
01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:17.620
of my stuff. It's, it's what you said, you

1111
01:09:17.629 --> 01:09:19.950
can read the field notes and see what poca

1112
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:24.709
pins think of it. But um and these other

1113
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.979
projects I'm doing, I like them to try and

1114
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.060
do innovative things themselves. How can they get this

1115
01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:36.700
anthropology, cultural anthropology in particular as perhaps to be

1116
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:42.750
more beneficial to others, particularly in the people they

1117
01:09:43.629 --> 01:09:48.350
or who have facilitated their work into the broad

1118
01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:53.180
community that funded them in a way that we

1119
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.959
do some of the suffering um in the human

1120
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:57.959
condition today.

1121
01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:05.419
Mhm So I think that's a great message went

1122
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:09.220
on. Doctor Borovsky. And thank you so much again

1123
01:10:09.399 --> 01:10:11.180
for taking the time to come on the show.

1124
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:13.339
It's been a real pleasure to talk with you.

1125
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:16.200
Thank you. I think I got carried away a

1126
01:10:16.209 --> 01:10:18.560
little bit and saying things that I very much

1127
01:10:18.569 --> 01:10:20.759
believe, but they're probably not gonna go down too

1128
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:24.149
well, um, with some people. Um, BUT I appreciate

1129
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.399
you asking about these Ricardo and um thank you

1130
01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:30.069
