00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.779
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.329
the Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez,

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.189
and today I'm Jack by Doctor Blaine Fowers. He's

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.529
professor of counseling psychology at the University of Miami,

5
00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.699
and today we're talking about his book, The The

6
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.620
Science of Virtue, a framework for Research. So, Doctor

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.180
Fowers, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.850
to everyone.

9
00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:23.579
Yeah, it's a pleasure for me too.

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.260
So, just to introduce the topic because I guess

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.819
there's going to be an interplay here since we're

12
00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.340
talking about virtue and virtues in the plural, there's

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.569
going to be an interplay between philosophy and psychology.

14
00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.819
What is virtue theory in moral philosophy?

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.750
In moral philosophy, it dates back to Aristotle, actually

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.319
to Socrates, but Aristotle put a very nice formulation

17
00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.599
on it and a more he's more articulate than

18
00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.459
Socrates or Plato are about it, and moral theory,

19
00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.080
or I mean, virtue theory is really the idea

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.959
that Um, Virtues are aspects of a person that

21
00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.839
help them to act in the best way consistently

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.519
so that they can then pursue the best kind

23
00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:21.750
of life. Um, AND so these virtues are, um,

24
00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.470
elements of an individual's life, uh, that they, um,

25
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:30.360
have habits and they, they do them, uh, they

26
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.029
practice the virtues spontaneously and naturally. So it's not

27
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.010
something you have to work toward or sacrifice for.

28
00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:41.699
Uh, I mean, well, let me back up a

29
00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.779
bit. It is something you have to develop. You

30
00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.260
have to develop a habit, but then once the

31
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.489
habit is developed, then they, uh, come into play

32
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.800
uh relatively easily. And that's the idea of virtue

33
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.620
is that you develop, uh, what we would call

34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.610
a second nature. Uh, WHICH is, uh, the habit

35
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.260
to act fairly or in a friendly way or

36
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.380
in a kind way, um, a compassionate way. So

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.979
that, so it becomes a way of life that

38
00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.429
one does, um, and so, uh, virtues are always

39
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.119
um, Have a bunch of characteristics. One of them

40
00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.009
is that it's, as I said, it's a habit.

41
00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.660
A second one is that we have attendant, cognitions

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.899
and emotions, things that go along with that to

43
00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.479
make it a, so we have a cohesive approach

44
00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.460
to things. Um, NOT, not that we have to

45
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.740
force ourselves, but that we just naturally want to

46
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.559
be fair. Um, AND for example, um, The, and

47
00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.559
then another feature of it is that it shows

48
00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.839
up in action. So this isn't just something we

49
00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.080
think or feel, but it's something we do. So

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.429
it's a way of life. Um, AND so, uh,

51
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.520
the Aristotle's idea was that a person could develop

52
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.600
all the virtues. Um, WE know as well as

53
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.330
a psychologist, what I know is that Uh, we're

54
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.009
going to be better at some and worse at

55
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.289
others. Uh, SO it's, it's the sort of thing

56
00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.729
that we, we make efforts toward and we develop

57
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.929
these habits as best we can, but we're going

58
00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.089
to be imperfect, and that's a piece of the

59
00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.904
virtue theory that Aerosol didn't really develop, um. He,

60
00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:29.634
if you read the Nicomachian ethics, which is his

61
00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:33.925
primary ethics text, uh, it sounds like people are

62
00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:37.005
kind of working toward perfection. Well, you and I

63
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:38.955
know that we are never going to be perfect.

64
00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:42.725
Um, WE'RE hopefully we can be good, um, but

65
00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:45.779
we don't. Really think we have to be perfect,

66
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.539
so we do the best we can and sometimes

67
00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:55.020
through fatigue or illness or something else, maybe a

68
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.500
person who's normally pretty virtuous is not able to

69
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.779
do that. Um, SO, um, so it is a

70
00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.100
thing that is part of our imperfect lives in

71
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.899
an imperfect world, and we do the best we

72
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:08.250
can.

73
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.419
But what are virtues? Are they traits or what

74
00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.820
characterizes them psychologically?

75
00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:21.168
Yeah, as a psychologist, I see virtues as traits,

76
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:26.338
um, and I see traits as a big category.

77
00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:30.079
So it includes personality, it includes intelligence, it includes

78
00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:35.769
things like narcissism, um, and, uh, I see character

79
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:40.209
virtues as a form of trade. It it differs

80
00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:42.250
from personality. I know I'm anticipating one of your

81
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.230
later questions, but um, I'll go ahead and say

82
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.549
it now that because we need to differentiate between

83
00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:51.390
the two because one of the things that happens

84
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.690
with virtues is we're always talking about moral behavior

85
00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:01.029
and moral thinking and moral emotions and so personality

86
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.510
doesn't really have, doesn't build that in. So we

87
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.029
have to have a different way to talk about

88
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.709
it. Another big difference between personality and virtues is

89
00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.630
that virtues involve what we could call phrenicis or

90
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.820
practical wisdom. That is, we have to know what

91
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.450
we're doing and we have to be able to

92
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.100
approach things in the right kind of way. And

93
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.859
so having good judgment is the way we do

94
00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:28.220
that. Well, there's no place for reneis in personality

95
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.980
either, so we have to have a differentiation there.

96
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.100
Nevertheless, I see them as traits because they are

97
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.369
habitual ways of living, um, and, um. A person

98
00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.609
develops them through practice and, uh, at least that's

99
00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:47.559
the Aristotelian way to think about it. Um, AND,

100
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.609
uh, we practice virtues by just every day. I

101
00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:53.369
mean, one of the things that I'll often ask

102
00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.369
my students is how many decisions they think they

103
00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.450
make in a, in a single day. Um, AND

104
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.470
when you stop and think about it, we make

105
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.190
thousands of decisions every day. Uh, DECISIONS about what

106
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.299
to wear, how to look, how to talk, uh,

107
00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.940
how to, whether to be kind, whether to be,

108
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.640
uh, fair, whether to, um, Just all kinds of

109
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.260
things and um. What, what you try to do

110
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.339
as a virtuous person is you try to make

111
00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.899
good decisions about all of those things, decisions that

112
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.420
are going to bring good into the world. Um,

113
00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:35.329
AND by doing that, um, We become more fair

114
00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:38.730
or more honest or more courageous. So if you

115
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.369
practice courage repeatedly, then it's easier and easier to

116
00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:46.410
be courageous. Um, SO it becomes more natural, becomes

117
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.600
more habitual, and that's what we try to do.

118
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.959
So, so there are traits in that they are,

119
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.809
uh, things that we cultivate, things that we practice

120
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:58.730
and learn. Um, NOW, another difference between personality and

121
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.279
virtue. Is that personality is generally thought of as

122
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.000
dispositions, so we're born with certain dispositions to be

123
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.140
more extroverted, to be more open to experience or

124
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.190
less, to be more neurotic or less neurotic. Um,

125
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.149
SO personality has a kind of a, a genetic

126
00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.359
or inherited aspect to it. Uh, VIRTUES aren't like

127
00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.140
that. The way Aral put it, he said that.

128
00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:28.369
Uh, WE'RE neither born to be virtuous, nor do

129
00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.649
we, are we born to be evil, um, but

130
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:35.329
we develop capacities along the way. Um, SO I

131
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.959
think that's a good way to think about it

132
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:40.010
because some people think that humans are either born

133
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.970
bad or born good, um, and I don't think

134
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.529
that way at all. I think we are born

135
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:47.450
and then we learn how to, how to act

136
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.690
and how to live from the people around us

137
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.160
and from, um, from our peers, from our families,

138
00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.140
from our culture, and so forth.

139
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.350
But your book is really about the development of

140
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.130
a science of virtue. So if virtue is already

141
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.170
discussed and studied in philosophy, why should it also

142
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.010
be studied scientifically?

143
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.089
Yeah, that's a good question. The Philosophers have been

144
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.660
talking about virtue for a very long time. Um,

145
00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:22.649
IT'S kind of been, it's waxed and waned over

146
00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:25.529
time. So sometimes they talk about it more, sometimes

147
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.929
less. Right now it's a very, a very big

148
00:08:28.929 --> 00:08:34.929
topic in philosophy. Um, SO, um. Anscom and McIntyre

149
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.330
introduced it in philosophy, and it became a big

150
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.690
topic in the last 50 years, let's say. And

151
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.590
then psychology has taken this on in the last

152
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.809
20 years or so. So it took us a

153
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:51.330
while to catch up, and there are what's interesting

154
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.289
to me is there are a lot of philosophers

155
00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:57.330
who are interested in virtue ethics. And they're interested

156
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.090
in psychological research about it, so I work. As

157
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.059
much with philosophers as I do with psychologists on

158
00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.650
this, um, probably a little bit more actually, um,

159
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.059
because they're very interested in it. And what psychology

160
00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:13.690
has to offer is we have a set of,

161
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.950
uh, methods and we focus on empirical facts, um,

162
00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:23.820
whereas philosophers, um, they tend to talk a lot

163
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.989
about it theoretically, and they might, um, Talk about,

164
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.260
uh, virtues for let's say, uh, alien species. Uh,

165
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.989
SO that's one of the things that some of

166
00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:40.229
them do. Um, AND that's interesting and useful, and

167
00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:43.390
it's something philosophers do, but it's not something psychologists

168
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.859
are particularly interested in. We're interested in this world

169
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.909
and this species, so we focus in on what

170
00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:56.630
humans actually do more than on just abstract thinking

171
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.299
about virtues and so I think philosophy has a

172
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.780
lot to offer because philosophers spend a lot of

173
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.419
time carefully analyzing things and thinking through problems in

174
00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:13.900
a way that psychologists typically do not. So the

175
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.109
philosophy is very, very valuable. Um, NOW what makes

176
00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:22.270
psychology valuable low is this empirical focus. Um, AND

177
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.669
so we try to get some data that verify

178
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:28.950
various points of view or maybe just confirm various

179
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.340
points of view, um, so it could go either

180
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.280
way. Mhm.

181
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.400
So when it comes to a psychology of virtue,

182
00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:42.049
how does it relate to other subfields in psychology?

183
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.429
Well, I've talked about the relationship between virtue and

184
00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:49.789
personality. Uh, I think that they are related, but

185
00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:51.909
I think that they're different. So I would say

186
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:55.109
trait is the large category. Personality is one kind

187
00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:57.510
of trait, character is another kind of trait. Um,

188
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.229
THE, uh, what's known sometimes as the dark triad

189
00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:05.359
or dark quatrad is another kind of trait, um,

190
00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:09.770
and, um. So there are different ways to see

191
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.609
it. Um, FROM a social-psychological point of view, a

192
00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:17.380
lot of my work looks very social psychological. Um,

193
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.010
SO virtues are something that happened between people. Um,

194
00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:25.270
AND so we can study how people act in

195
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:31.179
various circumstances. We can study whether virtues are promoted

196
00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:35.830
or discouraged by certain circumstances. That's really very much

197
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.309
what social psychologists, at least in the United States,

198
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:43.830
do. So that looks very similar. Developmental psychology is

199
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.270
also important because as I talked about, the virtues

200
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.270
are developed, so there's something that they're cultivated over

201
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.140
time. Um, AND so there's going to be a

202
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.500
developmental history to that. Um, AND one of the

203
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.179
interesting things about human development is that there are

204
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:02.179
some regularities to it. Um, AND what we find

205
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.299
is that children develop pretty much the same across

206
00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:08.299
cultures. Um, NOW, when you become an adult, as

207
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:11.419
you become an adult, uh, there are various cultural

208
00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:15.140
differences that show up, but children have, uh, pretty

209
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.869
much, uh, A regular way of, of, of interacting.

210
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.429
So for example, when a baby is born, they

211
00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:24.710
can't do much of anything. All they can do

212
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.989
is suck and cry and eliminate, and they have

213
00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:31.030
a few reflexes. Then over time they learn a

214
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.059
lot of things. So for one thing they learn

215
00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:36.030
is they learn that this is my hand. They

216
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.640
don't know that at first. So a baby will

217
00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:42.320
Wave its hands, but it doesn't know that it's

218
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.309
waving its hands. Um, SO an infant though over

219
00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:50.039
time learns that and then learns to, uh, one

220
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.859
of the most rudimentary things in in development is

221
00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:56.960
mutual gaze, and that leads to the ability to

222
00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:01.070
focus on an object with another person, uh, which

223
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.789
is called a shared attention. Um, AND those two

224
00:13:04.789 --> 00:13:06.940
things develop in order, so you have to have

225
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.799
mutual gaze first. And that's when a baby looks

226
00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.719
at you. So if you've held a baby and

227
00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:15.460
just looked at it, which is they're, they're enormously

228
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.559
cute, and they draw our attention. So this is

229
00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:21.119
a very natural thing for people to do. Well,

230
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.440
babies learn how to control and interact socially long

231
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.640
before they can talk or walk or even sit

232
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.710
up. Um, SO development is a very social thing.

233
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.280
Um, SO you have there an interplay between development.

234
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.409
Uh, AND social psychology, uh, personality psychology, all of

235
00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:41.869
it plays into it. So some children are going

236
00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:45.049
to be more prone to longer bouts of mutual

237
00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:47.849
gazes than others. Some like to be touched, some

238
00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:51.049
don't like to be touched as much. Um, SO,

239
00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.799
These are things that develop over time, and then

240
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:58.020
as a child becomes about 3 years old, they

241
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.159
start to become capable of moral action, um. Prior

242
00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:05.239
to 3 years, not so much. They don't really

243
00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:07.590
understand it. Uh, IT takes, it takes a long

244
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.190
time for our brains to develop. Um, AND, um,

245
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.880
but they do start to become capable of moral

246
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.640
action, and so they can start to learn rudimentary

247
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.799
versions of the virtues. So you'll, you'll see parents

248
00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:23.479
teaching their children to be kind, to share, to

249
00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:25.520
be honest, and so on, and they have to

250
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.159
learn all these lessons because at first, The only

251
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:31.030
thing a child knows is that they want something

252
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.719
and they go after it. They, they try to

253
00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:34.799
get it any way they can. Um, AND so

254
00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:37.080
morality is not really much of a factor prior

255
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.400
to 3 years of age, and it only gradually

256
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.320
becomes one. So by 6, they're pretty clear on

257
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.859
this. Um, AND so, um, It's, it's very interesting

258
00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:51.580
to watch. So if you watch children develop, you

259
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:57.059
can see these things happen. Um, ALSO, I guess

260
00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:00.140
I would say that virtue relates very strongly to

261
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.690
my profession or sub-discipline, which is counseling psychology. Um,

262
00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:08.130
SO, um, not everybody sees it this way, but

263
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.789
the way I look at it is that Therapy

264
00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:14.130
is an opportunity to create a better life. That's

265
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.369
what we do it for. Um, THAT doesn't mean

266
00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:18.400
it's easy or it's fun all the time. Um,

267
00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:22.010
SO it's sometimes very hard and painful. So we

268
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.530
have to take a look at difficult things. We

269
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.570
have to, uh, resolve, uh, experiences we've had that

270
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.890
are problematic, but the end goal is for people

271
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.320
to have a better life. My belief is that,

272
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.159
uh, to have a better life, we have to

273
00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:42.919
develop good characteristics. So it's natural for me then

274
00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:46.039
to focus on things like courage and honesty and

275
00:15:46.039 --> 00:15:53.280
compassion and fairness. With clients because that's, uh, that's

276
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.500
the way that they develop better lives is by

277
00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.820
uh honing those characteristics, um. And one of the

278
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.500
things that I have done a lot of is

279
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.130
marital therapy, um, and what I've come to learn

280
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.900
is that everybody wants, uh, a person of good

281
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.880
character to be their partner, uh, and their friend

282
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.460
and their, uh, family members, they hope to have

283
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.419
good character. So, um, so this is not something

284
00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:26.080
that's just, uh, abstract or, uh, Difficult or anything

285
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.849
like that. It's everyday life. Um, AND that's one

286
00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:30.599
of the things I like about virtue ethics is

287
00:16:30.599 --> 00:16:33.510
that it applies to everything. Um, AND it's just

288
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.440
as important for me to be honest and courageous

289
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.280
as a psychologist as it is for me to

290
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.760
be honest and courageous as a husband or as

291
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.159
a father or as a, um, teacher. Um, SO

292
00:16:45.159 --> 00:16:47.119
it, it cuts across all these domains.

293
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.500
Mhm. And what would you say are the main

294
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.979
challenges of developing a science of virtue?

295
00:16:55.369 --> 00:16:57.789
The biggest challenge, the one that we're struggling with

296
00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:02.030
now is measurement, um, because the vast majority of

297
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:09.868
virtue science is done with self-report scales. Um, SO

298
00:17:09.868 --> 00:17:12.150
I, you know, if you were one of my

299
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.868
participants, I would give you a measure of virtue,

300
00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:19.670
some virtue or another, and ask you how well

301
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.709
you think you do it. Well, that has some

302
00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:25.199
obvious problems in that. Uh, ONE, you might want

303
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:28.300
to deceive me. That's the most obvious, um, and

304
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.109
that's the one psychologists spent a lot of time

305
00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:33.119
on, but also, you might be more or less

306
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:38.349
self-aware. So you might not even know that, um,

307
00:17:38.979 --> 00:17:43.140
let's say, uh, you have a a cruel streak

308
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.180
or you have a, a tendency to take advantage

309
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.449
of people. Uh, YOU might just see that as,

310
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.890
as normal and not, not unusual, and so you,

311
00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:55.780
you wouldn't even report it. So, um, and then

312
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.699
the other thing, the big problem with virtue measurement

313
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.300
is that in theory, virtue should be somewhere between

314
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.890
two extremes. Um, SO, uh, for example, honesty would

315
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.400
be between the extremes of on the one hand,

316
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.339
being dishonest, uh, and on the other hand being

317
00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:17.890
brutally honest, so saying the truth more than you

318
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.849
should, maybe. Um, SO we often use white lies

319
00:18:21.849 --> 00:18:25.660
or little uh courtesies to make life easier, uh,

320
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:28.000
that don't create much of a problem, we hope.

321
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.689
Um, SO that would be honesty, courage is the

322
00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:34.540
same thing. It's somewhere between Um, cowardice on the

323
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.770
one hand and um brashness or rashness, let's say,

324
00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:43.500
that's a better word, rash, um, that we don't

325
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.500
take account of risks or possible outcomes. Um. And

326
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.339
what the virtue measures mostly do is when you

327
00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.739
look at them, more is almost always better. Um,

328
00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:58.300
AND so that's, that's been a difficult challenge for

329
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.420
us to find a way to measure that middle

330
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.810
ground. Um, SO, so measurement's a very big challenge.

331
00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.959
Um, I think. Some of the answers to this

332
00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:12.479
problem are to get other reports, not just self-report,

333
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.400
but to get others to say, let's say I'm

334
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.599
the subject of interest, maybe we get my wife

335
00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:21.479
and a friend or a family member to also

336
00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:24.589
say what they think my strengths or weaknesses are.

337
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.439
So that's one way to do it. Another way

338
00:19:27.439 --> 00:19:31.829
to do it is to ask people questions over

339
00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:34.709
a period of time. So maybe I might ask

340
00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:38.609
the virtue questions um twice a day or 3

341
00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:42.420
times a day for 2 weeks. Um. And that

342
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.140
is still self-report, but it tends to be more

343
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.380
valid because people are willing to say in the

344
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.660
last 2 hours I was dishonest with someone, or

345
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:58.010
in the last 2 hours I acted quite fairly

346
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.380
and they're much more willing to admit faults and

347
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.939
weaknesses for a short period of time than they

348
00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:06.339
are to say, oh, in general I'm a dishonest

349
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:10.750
person, or in general I'm a cruel person. Um,

350
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.160
So that's another way to do it. And there

351
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.880
are a variety of ways to get around these

352
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.599
challenges, but I think, uh, we need to, we

353
00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.839
need to work on it. So virtue science right

354
00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:26.180
now is, um, In its infancy, it's only been

355
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.619
really studied for the last 20 years or so,

356
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.390
and it's, it's going to take a while for

357
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.349
us to get develop the sophistication and clarity that

358
00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:38.349
we need to have. But I think it's gotten

359
00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:40.349
a good start. There are many, many studies of

360
00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:45.300
virtue, and it's, it's, it's documented now that we

361
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.859
can measure it and that that it's pretty much

362
00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:50.390
what I would call a scalar concept. People have

363
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.920
more and less of it. Um, THE, uh, research

364
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.119
so far does not show that the, um, Um,

365
00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:02.479
the deception bias that people worry about. There's a

366
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:03.959
little bit of it, but there isn't a lot

367
00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:07.119
of it, no more than anything else. Um, AND

368
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:09.959
particularly if you do, uh, this measurement I talked

369
00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:14.650
about with, uh, uh, having someone answer questions multiple

370
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.319
times a day over the course of a couple

371
00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:20.410
of weeks, um, We find that there's a pretty

372
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.729
normal distribution of virtue trades, which suggests again that

373
00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:28.290
we're probably not seeing a tremendous amount of deception

374
00:21:28.729 --> 00:21:31.099
because people are willing to say, you know, for

375
00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:32.609
the last couple of hours I wasn't a very

376
00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:36.939
nice person, and if they're willing to say that,

377
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.209
then that helps us to eliminate that self-report bias,

378
00:21:41.349 --> 00:21:47.630
that deception bias. So, um, so I'm pretty optimistic

379
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.189
about it. I mean, it's, uh, it's a difficult

380
00:21:50.189 --> 00:21:53.869
road ahead, uh, but, um, I think psychologists have

381
00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:56.349
developed a lot of really wonderful methods that can

382
00:21:56.349 --> 00:22:01.030
be used to, uh, To study virtue as well

383
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.900
as anything else.

384
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.380
So this probably should have been one of my

385
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:11.900
early questions, but what does virtue mean exactly? For

386
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.209
instance, does it vary cross culturally? And if so,

387
00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:21.170
does that then imply that we should be committed

388
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:26.420
to a sort of moral relativism or anti-moral realist

389
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.880
stance or not?

390
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.459
OK. Yeah, that's, I think it's an important question

391
00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:36.660
about the relativism because there's no doubt that virtues

392
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.500
do vary by culture. They vary by time as

393
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.339
well. So if we look at, let's say, warrior

394
00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:46.859
cultures, for example, Homer is a really big example

395
00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:50.130
for Aristotle, and it's a useful example for us.

396
00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:52.099
So if we look at the virtues in the

397
00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:54.660
Odyssey and the Iliad, they look quite different than

398
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.339
what we hold as virtues now. Um, SO we're

399
00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:01.780
not as focused on honor. We're not as focused

400
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.770
on battlefield courage. Um, THOSE things do come up

401
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.300
and they are important, but they're not central to

402
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.420
our culture in the way that they seem to

403
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.900
be for the ancient Greeks. Um. So Um, given

404
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.290
that relativism, what it means is that you have

405
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.219
to take culture into account. You can't just measure

406
00:23:21.219 --> 00:23:25.619
it and study it the same way everywhere. And

407
00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:29.420
that's been a tough lesson for psychologists because a

408
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.579
lot of times we think we're studying something so

409
00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.500
basic that it's going to be the same across

410
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.099
cultures, but I think culture is a very powerful

411
00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:42.849
influence, so. Now, on the one hand, that that's,

412
00:23:42.969 --> 00:23:45.010
that's one side of it. The other side of

413
00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.569
it, I'm going to be very Aristotelian here, is

414
00:23:47.569 --> 00:23:50.849
that we need to be somewhere not in on

415
00:23:50.849 --> 00:23:52.569
the extremes. The other side of it would be

416
00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:55.290
something like relativism where we just kind of throw

417
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.760
up our hands and say, well, it's different everywhere,

418
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.010
so we can't really study it. We can only

419
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.640
study it locally. Um, TO me that's too extreme.

420
00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:07.410
So I would say. That in most cultures you

421
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.780
will see something like courage, for example. Um, AND

422
00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:15.000
uh I just uh edited a book on courage,

423
00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:20.449
um, and we had people from Africa, uh, we

424
00:24:20.449 --> 00:24:23.280
had people from different theoretical points of view like

425
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:29.140
stoicism. Um, AND Jewish thought and Christian thought and

426
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.219
so forth, and so they all had a little

427
00:24:31.219 --> 00:24:34.060
different take on courage, but they could all talk

428
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.410
about courage, and there was a clear family resemblance

429
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.380
between what they talked about across these different cultural

430
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.939
viewpoints, whether it was religious or cultural or theoretical

431
00:24:46.939 --> 00:24:50.369
differences. There was something there that was important to

432
00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:53.359
everyone. Um, SO we could all talk about it

433
00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:55.410
and all of the chapters made sense. I could

434
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.770
read them and, and they made great sense to

435
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.130
me. So for example, I'm not a stoic, but

436
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.410
we had a chapter on a stoic view of

437
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.650
courage, and it was really informative. I learned a

438
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.079
lot by reading it. Um, WE had a chapter,

439
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.079
as I said, from Africa, and, and this person

440
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:16.989
uh wrote the A chapter from a Yoruba point

441
00:25:16.989 --> 00:25:20.310
of view. Um, AND so he talked about how

442
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.670
courage was important in his culture and where he

443
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.349
grew up, and it was really very, it was

444
00:25:26.349 --> 00:25:29.630
fun to read because, again, I learned some things

445
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.949
and the Yorubas have a little bit different way

446
00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:35.349
of looking at things. They're very communally oriented, so

447
00:25:35.349 --> 00:25:38.229
for them, courage is always related to your place

448
00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:42.319
in your community. It's never an individual thing. Um,

449
00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:46.020
AND so it's a little bit more, um, communal

450
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.300
than the way that we in the West tend

451
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.630
to look at it in the US and Europe

452
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.650
is what I mean by the West. Um, SO,

453
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.060
Um, so I don't think we need to go

454
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.069
to the extent of relativism, but I do think

455
00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:02.979
we need to talk about virtue as culturally relative,

456
00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:07.109
um, that it does matter. Um, SO that's where

457
00:26:07.109 --> 00:26:10.589
I would put it somewhere, uh, not at either

458
00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:14.060
extreme, but somewhere different from those extremes.

459
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.050
Right. But is there a list of virtues? I

460
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.369
mean, do we already have a complete list of

461
00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:25.609
virtues and if not, is that something that scientific

462
00:26:25.609 --> 00:26:27.839
psychology can help us uncover?

463
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.910
Well, um, that's a, that's a tricky question. Um,

464
00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:37.339
THERE are people who like lists of virtues, um,

465
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.719
and Aerosol has a list, um, and other people

466
00:26:40.719 --> 00:26:44.680
have lists. Um, I don't really think there is

467
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.880
a definitive list. Um, I think that we could

468
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.640
talk about virtues in a variety of ways. So

469
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.640
for, let me give you an example. Um, IS

470
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.069
kindness a virtue that's separate from Uh, say generosity.

471
00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.010
Um, WELL, it's hard to say. There's a lot

472
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.439
of overlap between them. So what I would say

473
00:27:04.439 --> 00:27:07.119
is that virtues are in a way a little

474
00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:10.439
bit fuzzy, um, in that they can be defined

475
00:27:10.439 --> 00:27:14.380
in different ways and um they can be separated

476
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.000
out in different ways. Um, SO to me, a

477
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.119
list is not as important as am I acting

478
00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:25.689
appropriately in this current situation. So right now, let's

479
00:27:25.689 --> 00:27:29.199
say, I'm having a discussion with my wife about

480
00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:32.510
chores. Am I behaving in a fair way about

481
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.849
that? So are we going to divide things up

482
00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:37.089
in a way that's equitable to both of us,

483
00:27:37.099 --> 00:27:40.300
um, and so that we share the burdens and

484
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.609
we share the, the benefits of our home life

485
00:27:43.609 --> 00:27:47.729
and our um our marriage, um, or not. And

486
00:27:47.729 --> 00:27:52.660
so, Um, I think that's going to be important

487
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.219
anytime people interact, and in fact we find different

488
00:27:56.219 --> 00:28:00.660
versions of justice or fairness in different cultures, but

489
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.979
every culture has some way to deal with that

490
00:28:02.979 --> 00:28:05.979
question because it's inherent in human relations. It's not

491
00:28:05.979 --> 00:28:08.699
something we can do without. So we have to

492
00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:10.969
have some way to figure out what's a good

493
00:28:10.969 --> 00:28:15.020
way to divide up this pie, the burdens and

494
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.910
the benefits. So, so I think that um It

495
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.189
might be called fairness in one place. It might

496
00:28:22.189 --> 00:28:25.310
be called something a little bit different in another

497
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:30.280
place, and so. To me, the list doesn't matter

498
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.229
as much as that when we're doing this thing,

499
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.959
dealing with burdens and benefits, we think about it

500
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:39.719
in an equitable way. We think about it in

501
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:44.079
a way that is good for everyone and not

502
00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:46.719
just good for me. So I don't, the idea

503
00:28:46.719 --> 00:28:49.010
would be not to take advantage as an individual,

504
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.719
but to try to work with someone else in

505
00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:54.989
a way that we both feel good about, and,

506
00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:56.479
and that's going to look a little different in

507
00:28:56.479 --> 00:29:00.229
different places. So In my parents' generation, for example,

508
00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:04.109
there was a very clear differentiation by gender who

509
00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:08.020
does what? In my marriage and in the current

510
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.109
world, we don't necessarily do that. We divide things

511
00:29:11.109 --> 00:29:13.430
up in terms more in terms of who's good

512
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.739
at what and who's willing to do what and

513
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.069
so, uh, so we try to make it fair

514
00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:23.989
though, even though the content of that fairness might

515
00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:25.140
be a little bit different.

516
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.439
Do you think that in developing a science of

517
00:29:30.439 --> 00:29:35.479
virtue, we have to infuse science with moral values

518
00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:38.400
and if so, is that a problem or not?

519
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.150
I don't see it as a problem. Some people

520
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.989
do. Um, I'm what I've described as a bullet

521
00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:49.630
biter, um, that, what that means is, uh, that's

522
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.589
a, uh, probably an American phrase when people used

523
00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:57.770
to get, uh, Uh, medical treatment, we didn't used

524
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.369
to have anesthesia. So we had to have some

525
00:30:00.369 --> 00:30:02.089
way to deal with the pain. And one way

526
00:30:02.089 --> 00:30:04.489
to deal with the pain is to bite the

527
00:30:04.489 --> 00:30:08.290
bullet, um, or bite a stick or something just

528
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.010
so you could manage the pain as as you

529
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.439
had a medical procedure done. Um, FORTUNATELY, we have

530
00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:15.969
anesthesia now, so we don't have to worry about

531
00:30:15.969 --> 00:30:17.410
that too much anymore. So it's more of a

532
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.489
metaphorical thing. um, BUT I think that all facts

533
00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:25.359
have values associated with them in the human world

534
00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:30.410
and all values have some facts about them. It's

535
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.170
useful to distinguish between the two, but I think

536
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.079
the dichotomy was a mistake that previous generations made.

537
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.050
So that's why I think that virtue can be

538
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:46.150
studied scientifically, is that it is a It's something

539
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.349
that's inherently valuable. It's good to be virtuous. It's

540
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:53.469
good to have a good life. We endorse those

541
00:30:53.469 --> 00:30:56.209
things, um, and I don't think we should shy

542
00:30:56.209 --> 00:30:58.670
away from that. Now some people think that in

543
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.189
order to have a science, you have to eliminate

544
00:31:01.189 --> 00:31:05.189
values, and I think that's an error. Um, WHAT

545
00:31:05.189 --> 00:31:07.939
you'll see, if you look in the literature, there's

546
00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:11.229
a lot of debate, well not debate, but a

547
00:31:11.229 --> 00:31:15.459
lot of argumentation. Uh, AGAINST the fact value dichotomy

548
00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:18.579
and almost no one defends it. It's just kind

549
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:21.510
of a dictum that's been around forever and people

550
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.449
think it's just the way you should do things.

551
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.589
Um, BUT I don't think that's true. So, um,

552
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.260
to me, studying something that's valuable is really important.

553
00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:34.579
I mean, in fact, if you think about it

554
00:31:34.579 --> 00:31:37.219
as a scientist, I am, I care about the

555
00:31:37.219 --> 00:31:40.709
things I study. I'm not neutral about them. Um,

556
00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:44.680
AND so, uh, if I'm studying, say, human development,

557
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.569
I'm interested in how a person develops from an

558
00:31:47.569 --> 00:31:51.810
infant to an adult. And I think there's a

559
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.170
normative path there. I think there's a way in

560
00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.040
which we could say, oh well, we can recognize

561
00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:00.849
certain signs of maturity along the way. Um, AND

562
00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:04.050
when someone becomes a full, fully fledged adult, we

563
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.089
can say they're capable of doing things they weren't

564
00:32:06.089 --> 00:32:12.150
capable of when they were 2. So Um That

565
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.589
suggests an endpoint or a telos in Greek terminology.

566
00:32:16.829 --> 00:32:20.040
So there's a goal that we're aiming toward, and

567
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.439
in human development, you can't avoid that goal. And

568
00:32:22.439 --> 00:32:25.349
the goal is a moral term. So that's another

569
00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:30.619
thing that psychologists study as goals. Um, WELL, We

570
00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:33.339
care about our goals. We want to reach them.

571
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.180
We, we work hard for them. And so uh

572
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.939
in that domain of research, you can't really get

573
00:32:40.939 --> 00:32:44.660
away from people's values. Now one of the ways

574
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.729
that psychologists have tried to do that is by

575
00:32:47.729 --> 00:32:51.140
saying, oh well, you as a research participant or

576
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.699
as a human being have goals, but I as

577
00:32:53.699 --> 00:32:56.859
a researcher, I'm neutral about that. Um, WELL, I

578
00:32:56.859 --> 00:32:59.675
think that's a mistake because we're not. Actually neutral.

579
00:32:59.954 --> 00:33:03.474
So if you have the goal of dominating people

580
00:33:03.474 --> 00:33:06.084
and controlling them and being a, say, a human

581
00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.724
trafficker, I'm not going to be neutral about that.

582
00:33:08.885 --> 00:33:10.564
That's something I don't like. I think it's a

583
00:33:10.564 --> 00:33:13.834
problem, uh, and I'm going to try to prevent.

584
00:33:14.244 --> 00:33:16.805
Um, SO I, I just don't think that that

585
00:33:16.805 --> 00:33:21.000
value neutrality is a, a tenable position, um. It's

586
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.239
something that people try to do, and they, they

587
00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:26.439
try, they try to say, in the science of

588
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:29.319
psychology, if nowhere else, I'm going to be neutral

589
00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:31.760
about values. Well, I don't think that's possible for

590
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.520
humans. I don't think we are neutral in that

591
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.150
way. So, uh, so that's what makes A bullet

592
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.489
biter, I think we have to deal with this

593
00:33:39.489 --> 00:33:43.189
problem and we have to recognize that we have

594
00:33:43.189 --> 00:33:47.030
values as researchers, and we try not to have

595
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:51.500
our values influence what we present as facts, but

596
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.270
it's going to happen and so we need to

597
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:58.900
be prepared to deal with that. Let me give

598
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.689
you an example of that. So how might values

599
00:34:02.689 --> 00:34:05.459
influence people in ways that they don't know that

600
00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:08.978
they do? Um, SO I'm working on a, a

601
00:34:08.978 --> 00:34:13.340
piece now that deals with the concept of individualism.

602
00:34:13.648 --> 00:34:17.197
Um, AND that's something that's become more and more

603
00:34:17.197 --> 00:34:21.438
widely recognized in the United States and Europe, that

604
00:34:21.438 --> 00:34:25.039
we have a tendency to prioritize the individual, to

605
00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:29.158
see the individual as the basic social reality, and

606
00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:31.438
that everything comes back to the individual. So we

607
00:34:31.438 --> 00:34:35.958
need to promote the autonomy of the individual. We

608
00:34:35.958 --> 00:34:40.509
need to Uh, respect the values that individuals have,

609
00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:43.398
all those kinds of things. Well, that's a point

610
00:34:43.398 --> 00:34:45.799
of view that isn't held in most of the

611
00:34:45.799 --> 00:34:49.099
world. So most of the world is more communally

612
00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:52.029
oriented, so they tend to think about the group

613
00:34:52.428 --> 00:34:55.079
before they think about the individual. The individual has

614
00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:57.948
a role in the group, and that's important. So,

615
00:34:58.499 --> 00:35:01.398
so the big divide then is between individualism and

616
00:35:01.398 --> 00:35:05.729
some kind of communal formulation. Um, SO the, um,

617
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.560
What's happened in American psychology though is that the

618
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.770
individual has been prioritized. So for example, if we

619
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:18.620
look at someone's well-being or they are they flourishing

620
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.449
or not, that tends to be studied through a

621
00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:24.489
self-report measure. So I tell you how much I'm

622
00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:27.679
flourishing, and that's, that's the end of the story.

623
00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:29.449
So no one else gets a say in that.

624
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.719
I only have my own say. Um, AND that's

625
00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:37.439
a very individual subjective viewpoint. Um, SO I could

626
00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:39.399
think I'm flourishing, but I could be wrong about

627
00:35:39.399 --> 00:35:43.000
that. Um, AND then, uh, how would you know

628
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.030
I was wrong? Well, people around me would say,

629
00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:46.560
yeah, he thinks he has a good life, but

630
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.889
he really doesn't. It's terrible. Uh, LET me tell

631
00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:52.030
you all the way that it's terrible. Um, AND,

632
00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:59.129
um, So, um, So, oh yeah, so it's an

633
00:35:59.129 --> 00:36:02.610
individual subjective focus. Um, NOW the other thing that

634
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.969
psychologists do a lot is we do a lot

635
00:36:03.969 --> 00:36:07.489
of experiments, but the typical experiment is with an

636
00:36:07.489 --> 00:36:11.290
undergraduate student comes into a laboratory that is a

637
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:17.239
strange situation, and they are given some protocol um

638
00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:20.530
to respond to. um, AND at the very most

639
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.530
they might be responding to a stranger. Almost never

640
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:29.620
do people study, uh, other individuals in ongoing relationships.

641
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.129
Um, SO they study people separately. So we also,

642
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.520
we kind of have a psychology of strangers, um,

643
00:36:36.729 --> 00:36:39.090
which is a very odd thing because if you

644
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.050
know about strangers and, uh, loved ones, we act

645
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.370
very differently with them. Um, AND we should. I

646
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.290
mean, with people we know and care about, we

647
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.209
develop patterns of interaction, we develop ways of being

648
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:56.350
together. Um, And that's, uh, uh, so that's another

649
00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:00.149
way that psychologists have focused on the individual. Um,

650
00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:03.840
SO individualism is very pronounced in American psychology. It's

651
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.590
in the theories, um, and so if you look

652
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.820
at the theories with that in mind, if you

653
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.639
look at the research with that in mind, you

654
00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:15.379
can't help but see it. Um, AND now, no

655
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:18.840
American psychologists or virtually none would say, oh yeah,

656
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.479
I'm, I'm influenced by individualism, and this is the

657
00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:24.280
way I do my research. They don't own that,

658
00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:27.439
but you can see it in their behavior, um,

659
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.649
and you can see it in how they think

660
00:37:29.649 --> 00:37:32.810
about, write about, talk about, feel about what they're

661
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.340
doing. Uh, SO, Um, so I think it's a

662
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:41.409
very profound value bias, um, and Even though I've

663
00:37:41.409 --> 00:37:43.689
been critical of that throughout my career, so for

664
00:37:43.689 --> 00:37:47.360
30 years I've been criticizing individualism, I still find

665
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.250
myself thinking and talking in individualistic ways because that's

666
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.649
the way I was raised. That's what I was

667
00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:56.820
taught. That's how, that's what is real. So it's,

668
00:37:56.889 --> 00:38:00.129
it's very hard to get around, but once we

669
00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:02.129
get a beat on it, we can start to

670
00:38:02.129 --> 00:38:04.929
say, oh, you know, that's not a very good

671
00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:07.010
way to think about this. So what I need

672
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.500
to think about is Maybe more how I fit

673
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.100
into a group. How I fit into relationships, uh,

674
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.669
and not only what's good for me and what,

675
00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:21.169
what do I want, um. So we need some

676
00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:23.389
balance between the two, I think.

677
00:38:24.919 --> 00:38:27.060
Right. So at a certain point there you mentioned

678
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.780
flourishing. I've already asked you about the virtues, but

679
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.550
I would like to go back to Aristotle a

680
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:38.409
little bit now and ask you about euaemonia. So

681
00:38:38.409 --> 00:38:41.820
what is euaemonia and how does it relate to

682
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:41.979
the

683
00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:46.290
virtues? OK. So I'll start by defining it. Um,

684
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.139
IN Greek, uh, you means good. So like we

685
00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:55.300
have the word euphoria, um, and eudaimonia, so it's

686
00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:02.780
good, and a diamond is a quasi-divine, uh, Uh,

687
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.139
being. So for Aristotle, he would say that we

688
00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:10.179
have a dime on something like what we might

689
00:39:10.179 --> 00:39:12.659
think of as a guardian angel, uh, someone who

690
00:39:12.659 --> 00:39:14.860
looks out for us, someone who tries to guide

691
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.500
us, and then I means that's a way of

692
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:24.780
living. So it means literally good, um, Guardian angel

693
00:39:24.939 --> 00:39:28.409
life. Uh, ANOTHER word that Aristo used that he

694
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:33.010
used pretty much synonymously with eudaimonia is Makarios, and

695
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.929
that means blessed. So that's a good translation of

696
00:39:35.929 --> 00:39:40.129
that word. So the way I translate eudaimonia is

697
00:39:40.129 --> 00:39:44.449
into English is flourishing. Um, SOME people, uh, philosophers

698
00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.320
in particular use the term happiness. And I think

699
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.209
that works from a philosophy, philosophy point of view

700
00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:52.760
because they don't think of it as a temporary

701
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.360
emotion. They think of it more as a way

702
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.800
of life. But for psychologists and ordinary people, if

703
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.590
you say happiness, they think it means an emotion

704
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.610
and something that comes and goes. For Aristotle, it

705
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.790
really meant a way of life. So we're living

706
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.070
in a way that we're guided toward good things,

707
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.669
um, and we're living the best kind of life

708
00:40:14.669 --> 00:40:18.344
a human being can live. IN our circumstances, of

709
00:40:18.344 --> 00:40:23.264
course, because sometimes circumstances are quite bad. Now we're

710
00:40:23.264 --> 00:40:26.465
fortunate to be in countries where things are generally

711
00:40:26.465 --> 00:40:29.814
pretty good. We have food to eat, we have

712
00:40:30.304 --> 00:40:35.385
employment, we have relationships, we have relatively stable governments.

713
00:40:35.475 --> 00:40:39.570
Those are all very good things. And some places

714
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.530
in the world don't have those things, so there's

715
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:47.709
famine, there are failed states. There are lots of

716
00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:51.570
conflict and so forth. So, so we're very fortunate.

717
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.449
So given those circumstances, we have the opportunity to

718
00:40:55.449 --> 00:40:59.850
craft a good life, and that's what Judamania means

719
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.810
is to build a life that's a good one.

720
00:41:03.889 --> 00:41:06.830
So one of the sayings that Aristotle liked was

721
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.429
um that he said call no man happy until

722
00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:14.709
he is dead. Um, WELL, being dead doesn't sound

723
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:17.030
really great, but what he meant by that is

724
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.629
we have to look at the complete life, not

725
00:41:19.629 --> 00:41:22.550
just that one moment. So that's why Eudamania is

726
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.399
not an achievement. It's not something we Get to

727
00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:27.830
and then just, we've done it. We're already there.

728
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.370
So it's not like having a PhD or an

729
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.800
MD or a DDS that, you know, you achieve

730
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.679
that and that's once you have it, you have

731
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:39.870
it. Um, Eomina is a way of life. So,

732
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.229
uh, what that means is that at any time,

733
00:41:43.689 --> 00:41:46.860
uh, that could be, I could lose that. Um,

734
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.439
I could have a good life and then I

735
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:52.159
could lose it either through some external circumstance or

736
00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:55.379
because I do something dumb or crazy. Um, AND

737
00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:59.120
so. Um, WHAT we need to do is we

738
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.600
need to live well throughout our lives, um, and

739
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.639
that's, you know, that's a pretty good goal, I

740
00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:06.020
think, is to have a good life all the

741
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.600
way through. Um, EVERY once in a while there

742
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.080
are some hiccups and problems. Um, MAYBE we need

743
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.159
a root canal or maybe we break our arm

744
00:42:15.159 --> 00:42:18.280
or something, uh, and we, we. Do what we

745
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.719
need to take care of that so we can

746
00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:22.189
go on living well, and that's the idea of

747
00:42:22.189 --> 00:42:24.719
Eomia. Now the way virtue fits into that, and

748
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:27.590
I think this is very important, is that virtues

749
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.959
are, as I said, character traits, so the things,

750
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.320
habits that we cultivate, and those habits help us

751
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.620
to live well. Um. So if we live in

752
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:43.350
a way that is fair and kind and caring,

753
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.959
we're going to have a better life than if

754
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:48.439
we do the opposite, and I'm convinced of that.

755
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.479
So some people think you should get all the

756
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:52.510
advantages and you should have all the fun you

757
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.709
can. And that's what a good life is. I

758
00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:58.830
don't think that's true. I think that having good

759
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:02.580
relationships and being a productive member of a group

760
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.189
are very important things, and that without them we're

761
00:43:07.189 --> 00:43:09.750
kind of lost as individuals and we don't have

762
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.350
the fullest kind of life. And so that was

763
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.550
Aristotle's idea is that because we're human beings, there's

764
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.989
certain things that make sense for humans and that's

765
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:22.510
what we should strive for, um. So it's not

766
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.250
that I want to. The humanist version is that

767
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.290
I want to actualize myself as a person. I

768
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.679
want to be the best la I can be.

769
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.830
Well, that's great, but Erla said, we're humans before

770
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.330
we have an identity, so we should try to

771
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.770
maximize what it is about us that is our

772
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:47.350
human nature. That's what is, is maximizing our human

773
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.189
nature, being the best person we can be.

774
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:55.159
So tell us now about your strive for model

775
00:43:55.159 --> 00:43:58.850
as a new conceptual framework to study virtue.

776
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.469
Yeah, we came up with that. I mean, it's

777
00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:06.780
a, it's a very cute acronym, um, but, uh,

778
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.020
I think it's also very meaningful. And someone, a

779
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.469
reviewer who once told me that, he said, you

780
00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:14.820
know, you need to really emphasize that model because

781
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.229
people can read past it and they're used to

782
00:44:17.229 --> 00:44:19.949
seeing these acronyms that don't mean anything. Well, this

783
00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:22.469
one really does mean something. So the S is

784
00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:26.139
for scalar. Um, AND that's really important if you're

785
00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:28.780
going to study virtue scientifically. You have to have

786
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.820
something you can measure and you can gauge and

787
00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.320
you can have more and less of. So that's

788
00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:37.649
what scalar is. And so all virtues are scalar,

789
00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:39.979
that is, a person can be more or less

790
00:44:39.979 --> 00:44:43.550
honest, more or less kind, more or less courageous,

791
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:48.649
and so forth. Um, AND The T is for

792
00:44:48.649 --> 00:44:51.060
trait. I mentioned before that it was, uh, I

793
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.979
see virtue as a trait. So it's something we

794
00:44:53.979 --> 00:44:58.780
develop. Um, RATHER than are born with, um, but

795
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.939
nevertheless, it becomes trait-like over time. Uh, THEN the

796
00:45:01.939 --> 00:45:06.689
R is for yeah, so it's about a role.

797
00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:10.340
Now this was a great insight and um I've

798
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.419
since come across something called identity theory that focuses

799
00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:17.699
a lot on roles, um, and the point here

800
00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:23.429
is that with roles. Um, WE have, uh, some

801
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:25.830
roles call for certain virtues in a, in a

802
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.149
very strong way and some roles call for other

803
00:45:29.149 --> 00:45:31.899
kind of virtues. So what we find is if

804
00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:36.399
we study people, we find that they act differently

805
00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:38.790
in one role than another, and one of the

806
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.350
most commonly studied is being at work or being

807
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.179
at home. Another one is in the role of

808
00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:48.100
a student or a friend, and this works really

809
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.899
well with college students, and it turns out people

810
00:45:50.899 --> 00:45:54.280
are different, so they tend to be more conscientious

811
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.179
when they're students and more friendly or affable when

812
00:45:57.179 --> 00:45:59.979
they're in the role of friend. So, and that

813
00:45:59.979 --> 00:46:05.199
makes sense, right? Um, SO you get a higher

814
00:46:05.199 --> 00:46:07.679
degree of some virtues than others in a role.

815
00:46:07.719 --> 00:46:10.250
So let's take the example of a first responder.

816
00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:14.239
What we expect of someone who is a police

817
00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:20.330
officer or an EMS person, an emergency worker, somebody

818
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.159
who drives an ambulance and goes to people who

819
00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:27.350
need immediate medical attention. Um, WE expect courage from

820
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.229
them in a way that's going to surpass what

821
00:46:30.229 --> 00:46:34.270
most of us have. Um, AND so, uh, that

822
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:36.750
role really calls for that. If we think about

823
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.110
a parent, that's another kind of role. So we

824
00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.709
have to have a parent needs to be alone.

825
00:46:41.889 --> 00:46:45.439
A person needs to be someone who cares about

826
00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:48.000
their offspring and takes care of them in a

827
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.199
unilateral way. Well, that's a role that's very important

828
00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:56.159
as well. So it calls for characteristics that revolve

829
00:46:56.159 --> 00:47:04.530
around caring and responsibility and structure. Um, SO, uh,

830
00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:13.719
the roles matter. Um, THE, um. The, uh, interactions,

831
00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.189
yeah, so, um, the idea there is that. Uh,

832
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.669
WE, that our virtue traits interact with situations. Um,

833
00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:27.040
SO in some situations, uh, they're going to call

834
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.419
for a very strong, uh, virtue response or a

835
00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:33.639
particular virtue response. Um, SO if we think about,

836
00:47:33.919 --> 00:47:37.379
let's, let's think about like a, a time like

837
00:47:37.639 --> 00:47:41.989
someone's birthday. Um, SO I have to be It's

838
00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:44.479
important when someone's going to have an event like

839
00:47:44.479 --> 00:47:46.310
this that I think in terms of what kind

840
00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:47.709
of gift do I want to buy them or

841
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.979
or find for them. And I might buy it,

842
00:47:49.989 --> 00:47:52.139
I might make it, I might do something else.

843
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:57.310
Um. So in that situation, generosity is really important.

844
00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.300
So I want to be able to give a

845
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.139
gift that they're going to like, that's appropriate to

846
00:48:03.139 --> 00:48:05.709
the situation. That's not too big a gift, it's

847
00:48:05.709 --> 00:48:08.729
not too small a gift, um, that is something

848
00:48:08.939 --> 00:48:14.860
that's, uh, geared toward their likes and dislikes, um,

849
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.729
and so that's, that shows up there. But in

850
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:21.489
another situation, generosity may not be the most important

851
00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:25.050
thing. Uh, SO in another situation, fairness might be

852
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.889
what's important that I interact with someone in a

853
00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:33.040
fair way. Um, SO the situations are important, um,

854
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.330
and we don't want to think that, uh, people

855
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.590
have a trait like Uh, uh, a character trait,

856
00:48:39.629 --> 00:48:41.709
a virtue trait, and they're gonna do that all

857
00:48:41.709 --> 00:48:44.110
the time. Well, we don't do anything all the

858
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.780
time. We do things according to what makes sense,

859
00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:49.629
what's appropriate to the situation, and that's what the

860
00:48:49.629 --> 00:48:54.310
interactions mean. So V is for values, and again

861
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.469
that comes back to that fact value dichotomy that

862
00:48:57.469 --> 00:49:00.389
I think that we, we do study things we

863
00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:05.020
value, we care about, and so that's important to

864
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.280
be able to take note of. And then E

865
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.620
is for Edimona. Um, AND that's the whole point

866
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.929
of having virtues. So virtu. Uh, LEARNING virtues and

867
00:49:16.929 --> 00:49:20.570
being virtuous is not about just gritting your teeth

868
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.409
and doing the right thing even though you don't

869
00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:25.510
want to. It's about living a good life. It's

870
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.810
about having a felicitous life. Um, AND so when

871
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.810
we learn these traits, then we're learning how to

872
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.639
live in a good way as a human being.

873
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.129
And so that's you doineia. And then the 4

874
00:49:39.129 --> 00:49:42.800
is for the four features of virtue, which, um,

875
00:49:43.709 --> 00:49:46.969
Starts with practical wisdom, which I talked about, uh,

876
00:49:47.189 --> 00:49:50.550
as renneis or good judgment. We have to be

877
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:53.629
able to use good judgment as we deal with

878
00:49:53.629 --> 00:49:58.300
virtues, and then it's emotions, uh, cognitions, and behavior.

879
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.270
Those, that's, uh, three things that all psychologists like

880
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.489
to talk about and think about. Uh, SO virtues

881
00:50:06.489 --> 00:50:09.219
show up in all those domains, uh, and the

882
00:50:09.219 --> 00:50:12.550
idea is for us to have some congruence between

883
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:16.860
our actions, our feelings, and our thoughts. So again,

884
00:50:16.899 --> 00:50:19.580
it's something that comes naturally it's something we want

885
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.419
to do, it's not something we struggle about. Now

886
00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:25.100
of course we're imperfect, so sometimes all of us

887
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.850
struggle, sometimes all of us do the wrong things,

888
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.050
um, but in the main, we try to do

889
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:34.229
as much. Uh, VIRTUOUSLY as possible.

890
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.810
Mhm. And what are the main goals of the

891
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:42.889
science of virtue, both the intellectual and the practical

892
00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:43.449
goals?

893
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.270
Um, I'll start with the intellectual goals because that's

894
00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:52.159
where I spend most of my effort. Um, WHAT

895
00:50:52.159 --> 00:50:54.070
we want to do is to be able to,

896
00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:59.080
uh, uh, assess these virtues and figure out which

897
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.360
things really do conduce to a good life. Um,

898
00:51:02.399 --> 00:51:05.360
AND I think that those are, can be empirical

899
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.750
questions. They are also conceptual questions where we, um,

900
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.280
try to, uh, develop a theory that's consistent and,

901
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:18.399
uh, articulate. Um, BUT, uh, we also want to

902
00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:21.649
find, uh, the facts about it. So we don't

903
00:51:21.649 --> 00:51:23.610
want to just think about it, and that's where

904
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.610
I think psychology is very useful is that we

905
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:29.489
can, we can actually study things. And try to

906
00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:33.250
get an empirical feel for um what does courage

907
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:37.469
look like, how does it show up? What does

908
00:51:37.469 --> 00:51:40.219
it look like for someone to be honest, um,

909
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:47.649
what, um. What do we think, um. Uh, FAIRNESS

910
00:51:47.649 --> 00:51:51.679
consists in, um, and then the ultimate question is,

911
00:51:51.729 --> 00:51:53.689
do those things lead to a good kind of

912
00:51:53.689 --> 00:51:58.000
life? Sorry, I'm having a little trouble with my

913
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.149
voice. I um,

914
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.070
no problem.

915
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.739
Yeah. It's, I've had, um, I think some new

916
00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:07.340
allergies that uh cause I don't seem to be

917
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.090
sick, but I, um, cough quite a bit and

918
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.669
have a bit of a hoarse voice, so I

919
00:52:13.669 --> 00:52:20.530
apologize for that. Um, Yeah, so that's the intellectual

920
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.090
goal is to try to understand this as best

921
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.530
we can, and, and then the practical goals, of

922
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.409
course, are that we want to encourage virtue. So

923
00:52:30.409 --> 00:52:32.090
it's a good thing that we want to see

924
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.889
more of. So we might work on some interventions

925
00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:38.320
to help people to be more generous or more

926
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:44.689
honest or more fair or more courageous. Um, AND,

927
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.219
uh, and help people to know, you know, what

928
00:52:48.219 --> 00:52:50.699
it means to be honest. So, so the thing

929
00:52:50.699 --> 00:52:54.300
is, it's not hard to say, it's good to

930
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.060
be generous. It's hard to say what is generosity

931
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:03.010
in this situation. So, um, when I, you know,

932
00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.290
I don't know how it is in Portugal, but

933
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.370
when I drive my car around at intersections there

934
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.409
frequently will be people who are begging. So do

935
00:53:11.409 --> 00:53:12.909
I give them money or do I not give

936
00:53:12.909 --> 00:53:15.850
them money? Would it be a generous good thing

937
00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:17.530
to give them money or would it be a

938
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.719
bad thing? And that's something everybody has to decide,

939
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.639
and they have to work out some way of

940
00:53:25.129 --> 00:53:27.449
what do I do with people who have needs

941
00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:31.919
that they can't satisfy themselves. So how do I

942
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.389
orient myself to that? Do I just ignore them?

943
00:53:35.469 --> 00:53:37.510
Do I give them money? Do I give to

944
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.629
a charity? What do I do? Um, AND so

945
00:53:40.629 --> 00:53:43.790
we'll have to work that out. And so deciding

946
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:46.790
how to be generous is the hard thing, not

947
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.699
whether to be generous or not, um, because that's

948
00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:52.469
a, that's a relatively easy question. If you ask

949
00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:54.500
someone, they would say, yeah, I'm a generous person,

950
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:58.110
you know, but how are you generous? Then, then

951
00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.709
that's where the rubber meets the road.

952
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.050
Right. So let me ask you then just one

953
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.010
last question. How do you look at the future

954
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.889
of the science of virtue? I mean, uh, do

955
00:54:10.889 --> 00:54:14.040
you, are there any specific questions you would like

956
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.469
to see answered? Any particular lines of research that

957
00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:21.129
you think are going to be explored by people

958
00:54:21.129 --> 00:54:22.530
who work in this field?

959
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.530
Yeah, one of the things that interests me, uh,

960
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:31.320
particularly is this interaction of situation and character trait.

961
00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:36.260
Um, SO one study we did, for example, we

962
00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.620
set up a scenario. This was an experimental study,

963
00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:41.649
so it's guilty of all the things I said

964
00:54:41.649 --> 00:54:44.699
about that. Um, BUT it's a good, it helps

965
00:54:44.699 --> 00:54:46.850
us to get some data in some ways. So

966
00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:49.820
we gave people a situation where they could act

967
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.830
more and less fairly. And the situational prompts encourage

968
00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:58.550
them to act less fairly. And then we also

969
00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:02.439
assess their fairness traits. So what we're interested in

970
00:55:02.709 --> 00:55:07.429
is, are people who report that they're fair, are

971
00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:10.510
they fair across the board in the situation that

972
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.629
encourages unfairness and in a neutral situation? And then

973
00:55:14.629 --> 00:55:17.350
are the people who say that they're less fair

974
00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.719
or are they more influenced by the situation? Well,

975
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.679
that's exactly what we found. Um, SO that interaction

976
00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:28.350
is really interesting because, um, I, as I said

977
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.479
before, it's really important for us to look at

978
00:55:30.719 --> 00:55:33.840
how people act in different situations, not expect them

979
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.610
to act the same way in every situation. And

980
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:40.050
so, If a fair person is going to be

981
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:44.090
fair regardless of the circumstances, then that's the sort

982
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.810
of thing we want to encourage and we hope

983
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.370
for. Um, AND if someone is going to take

984
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.129
advantage when they think they can get away with

985
00:55:50.129 --> 00:55:53.659
it, that's not so great. Um, NOW, of course,

986
00:55:53.689 --> 00:55:55.610
there are lots of people who do that, and

987
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.100
so there's a lot of room for interventions there,

988
00:55:58.729 --> 00:56:00.409
um, and I think that's another kind of research

989
00:56:00.409 --> 00:56:03.679
that would be really important. We have quite a

990
00:56:03.679 --> 00:56:06.600
lot of research that encourages generosity. So that's been

991
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.840
a, a target of a number of people who

992
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.719
find that you can increase generosity, and it turns

993
00:56:12.719 --> 00:56:16.520
out, interestingly enough, that when people are more generous,

994
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.449
they're happier. Um, SO the people who were given

995
00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:24.179
the task, for example, there'll be a, there's one

996
00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:25.830
study that's really wonderful and it was done in

997
00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.939
136 countries, so it's not just one place. Uh,

998
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:34.850
THE experimenter gave participants a meaningful amount of money,

999
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.959
um, and said to one set of people, spend

1000
00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:41.229
this money on someone else, do something nice for

1001
00:56:41.229 --> 00:56:43.570
someone else with the money. And he said to

1002
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:46.399
another set of people, spend this money on yourself,

1003
00:56:46.649 --> 00:56:49.129
do something nice for you. The people who spend

1004
00:56:49.129 --> 00:56:52.409
it on other people were happier, uh, on average

1005
00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:55.149
than the people who spend it on themselves. This

1006
00:56:55.149 --> 00:56:58.889
is across many, many cultures. So, uh, it suggests

1007
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:02.169
that it's not just a US thing or a

1008
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:03.810
Christian thing or any other kind of thing, it's

1009
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:08.510
a human thing that we are, um, At our

1010
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:12.060
best when we're being generous to other people. Um,

1011
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:14.469
AND there's also, there's a lot of research by

1012
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:18.899
some people, uh, two women named Crocker and Canovelo

1013
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.189
that have demonstrated this. And what they show over

1014
00:57:21.189 --> 00:57:25.110
and over again is that people who are nice

1015
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.189
to other people or good to other people are

1016
00:57:27.189 --> 00:57:29.949
happier and, and they do better in life, and

1017
00:57:29.949 --> 00:57:32.590
people who are focused on themselves do less well

1018
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.100
in life. Um, AND, um. So, uh, what they

1019
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.100
say is that the idea that people are ultimately

1020
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.620
self-interested is exaggerated. Maybe it's a complete fabrication. So

1021
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.020
that's something that's, that's an article of faith in

1022
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.699
the United States is that we should look out

1023
00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.860
for number one. But it turns out that it's

1024
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.659
probably wrong, uh, because these women study Americans and

1025
00:57:55.659 --> 00:57:57.979
they find that Americans who give are happier than

1026
00:57:57.979 --> 00:58:01.419
Americans who look out for number one, mostly. Um,

1027
00:58:01.459 --> 00:58:05.070
SO, so I think, um, Uh, that's great research

1028
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:07.919
and so, so interventions are another kind of thing.

1029
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:14.590
Um, THERE'S a, um. In the United States, we

1030
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.340
call it character education. Uh, THAT'S starting up in

1031
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.570
Europe now. There's a, an association for character and

1032
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:26.699
virtue education, um, and I think it's a, it's

1033
00:58:26.699 --> 00:58:30.659
wonderful. And what they're doing in Europe, um, is

1034
00:58:30.659 --> 00:58:34.100
that they are trying to integrate the virtue science

1035
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.459
and the virtue theory from the beginning. We didn't

1036
00:58:36.459 --> 00:58:37.620
do a very good job of that in the

1037
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:41.810
United States, so character education. IS somewhat divorced from

1038
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:46.219
virtue ethics, um, and I think that relationship should

1039
00:58:46.219 --> 00:58:48.540
get closer. So I like very much what the

1040
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.659
Europeans are doing, and I hope that the, that

1041
00:58:51.659 --> 00:58:54.929
American character educators will pay more and more attention

1042
00:58:54.929 --> 00:58:58.060
to virtue ethics. And so that's a whole other

1043
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.719
line of research is how to apply this, uh,

1044
00:59:00.939 --> 00:59:06.770
in schools with children, um. And I think that

1045
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:07.929
I think we can do a lot of good

1046
00:59:07.929 --> 00:59:10.649
there. So there are lots and lots of kinds

1047
00:59:10.649 --> 00:59:13.370
of research. Some of them are very basic sorts

1048
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:16.610
of research, how do we understand virtues? Can we

1049
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:21.169
measure them, and so forth. And then there's intervention

1050
00:59:21.169 --> 00:59:24.209
research and one kind of intervention research is educational

1051
00:59:24.209 --> 00:59:28.129
methods. Um, SO I have a student now to

1052
00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:31.239
give you another example, uh, who's teaching a course

1053
00:59:31.239 --> 00:59:36.219
on udaimonia basically. And she's collecting data with students

1054
00:59:36.219 --> 00:59:40.340
in her course and students in another course, and

1055
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.699
she's going to compare whether or not the people

1056
00:59:42.699 --> 00:59:47.689
in her course have greater degrees of udominia than

1057
00:59:47.689 --> 00:59:50.219
the ones in the other course. Um, AND there

1058
00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:53.689
are lots of measures of this. And so, um,

1059
00:59:53.899 --> 00:59:56.500
this is an intervention study and so it's a

1060
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.770
very interesting kind of study. That we hope that

1061
01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:03.169
people will benefit from this course. We don't know

1062
01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:05.370
that, so we're going to find out. And the

1063
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:08.199
great thing about virtue Science, it helps us to

1064
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:12.159
document the things that are the case and to

1065
01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:17.860
um Eliminate things that maybe people want to believe

1066
01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.860
or have believed in the past that aren't, uh,

1067
01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:25.110
aren't really reflected in reality. So, um, I mentioned

1068
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:27.879
this case of looking out for number one, that's

1069
01:00:27.879 --> 01:00:30.389
been a steadfast belief in this country for a

1070
01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:33.830
long time. Turns out that it's mostly wrong, uh,

1071
01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:36.590
and we should never believe that, and we should

1072
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:40.149
try to eliminate that view because it's not good

1073
01:00:40.149 --> 01:00:42.550
for people and it doesn't make a good life.

1074
01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:45.659
Um, SO it's not a good thing.

1075
01:00:47.639 --> 01:00:50.560
Right, so the book is again the Science of

1076
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.669
virtue, a framework for research. I'm leaving a link

1077
01:00:53.669 --> 01:00:56.280
to it in the description of the interview. And

1078
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.790
Doctor Fowers, apart from the book, are there any

1079
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.520
places on the internet where people can find your

1080
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:02.949
work?

1081
01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:08.219
Um, WELL, Google is quite a tool, um, and

1082
01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:10.620
if, you know, you've probably done this yourself, you

1083
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.100
Google yourself, and it's kind of amazing what comes

1084
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.739
up. So, um, all told now I have published

1085
01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:20.780
8 books, or no, 7, and I have written.

1086
01:01:21.169 --> 01:01:23.689
Uh, ANOTHER couple of books, and I'm working on

1087
01:01:23.689 --> 01:01:27.189
a third one. So, uh, I'm easy to find,

1088
01:01:27.399 --> 01:01:30.179
uh, and, uh, and I published a lot of,

1089
01:01:30.189 --> 01:01:33.969
uh, scholarly articles as well, so it's not hard

1090
01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:38.479
to find, uh, things that I've done. Um. But

1091
01:01:38.479 --> 01:01:40.560
the, the book The Science of Virtue is one

1092
01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.560
of the things I'm most proud of and very

1093
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.229
happy to talk with you about, uh, because it's,

1094
01:01:46.399 --> 01:01:48.270
it's just fun for me to talk about virtues.

1095
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.159
Uh, IT'S really a very interesting topic and there's

1096
01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:53.840
no end of the depth. I've been studying it

1097
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.080
for 30 years and I'm still learning things.

1098
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.919
And thank you so much for taking the time

1099
01:01:59.919 --> 01:02:01.909
