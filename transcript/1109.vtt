00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.039
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.640
to the MG by Doctor Stefan Ziroans. He is

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.439
professor of European intellectual history at New York University,

5
00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.879
and today we're talking about his book, The Invention

6
00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:22.110
of Prehistory, Empire, Violence and Our Obsession with Human

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.639
Origins. So, Doctor Glenz, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.139
a huge pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.430
The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Lopez. Thank you.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.869
So, let me start by asking you

11
00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:33.500
then,

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.310
when did we become interested in pre-history, at least

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.790
in the

14
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.110
West. So I, I tend to think that this

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.549
happens at, at multiple stages, the different stops, if

16
00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:48.419
you will. Uh, THERE'S a very clear moment in,

17
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.630
in the 18th century. I wouldn't even call it

18
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.470
a moment, it's a gradual realization. And then there

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.540
are, again, particularly significant periods in the 1860s. And

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.779
then again in the post-war period. And you can

21
00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:04.500
see why at these times. The, the book basically

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.300
argues that the early stages around 1750 and that

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.459
it's linked in part to uh Jean-Jacques Rousseau. And

24
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.900
I do this for a particular reason, which is

25
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.209
to say that it's not that people weren't concerned

26
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.500
with what they saw as early humans before, that

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.379
is to say, with indigenous people whom they described

28
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.959
as savages or Uh, barbarians. But it is that

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.569
up to that point, there was a kind of

30
00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.730
almost religious and classical logic. These are peoples who

31
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.239
exist. Where in the past are they? They're not

32
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.319
like us, quote unquote, we are civilized and they

33
00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.000
are savages. And the real question at that point

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.389
with Rousseau becomes that Rousseau switches it around and

35
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.209
suggests that they are, that their state of nature

36
00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.930
is much closer to the original human state. Um,

37
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.410
THAN, than, than modern civilized people, uh, would be.

38
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.669
That inversion for me is Uh, is very important

39
00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:06.470
because it suggests that now you can have a

40
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.990
competition. It's not simply that people look to imagine

41
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.309
what the past looked like, but now you can

42
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.229
have competing theories, and Rousseau is a good stand-in

43
00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.949
for the competing theories about early humanity as, as

44
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.020
well as about uh indigenous peoples. In the 1860s,

45
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.149
prehistory becomes a sort of a discipline, and that's

46
00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.509
partly linked to um Charles Darwin, but it's also

47
00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.869
linked to people like John Lubbock. Um, AND Charles

48
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:38.710
Lyell. Um, Darwin's, uh, first famous work on the

49
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.070
Origin of Species says very little about humans, but

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.139
implies a lot. This became something of a debate.

51
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.869
Uh, AND parallel to it, the logic developed that

52
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.970
we needed to be able that, that the English

53
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.820
and the Europeans needed to be able to compare.

54
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.479
What they found in archaeological dig sites with peoples

55
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.119
existing elsewhere in the world, peoples that um the

56
00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:06.520
British and others were uh still colonizing. In the

57
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.389
third stage of this, and so, and that's really,

58
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.919
Lubbock is really treated as somehow having founded a

59
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.259
field, very discreet and specific. In the post-war period,

60
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.160
partly because of the rejection of Nazi racism and

61
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.389
anti-Semitism, partly because separately, Um, the question continued, where

62
00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.309
is it that humans are coming from if the

63
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.270
old racial ideas are not the way to understand

64
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.589
it. Uh, THE new questions develop and at the

65
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.020
same time, a far larger infrastructure for studying, um,

66
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.550
you know, sites that could and turn out to

67
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.470
be archaeological sites, particularly in Africa. So on the

68
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.630
one hand, you have organizations like UNESCO who are

69
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.710
very much opposed. TO racism, and who are very

70
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.600
much invested in trying to understand what early humanity

71
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.720
um would have looked like or in supporting questions

72
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.550
of like, how, how is humanity a single species

73
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.160
in which we are all equal. Uh, AND at

74
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.419
the same time, you have a new infrastructure basically,

75
00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:10.600
that people are now studying in multiple sites across

76
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.839
Africa, uh, as well as in multiple sites across

77
00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.488
Southeast Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Um, AND

78
00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:19.970
then eventually also in, in Latin America. So it's

79
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.250
as though the field expands dramatically because it has

80
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.209
something to say about the past and something to

81
00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:28.329
say about the future. Um, IT'S that idea that

82
00:04:28.329 --> 00:04:31.920
we have something to say. About the future that

83
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.559
begins with our earliest past that remains really important

84
00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.790
today.

85
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:41.440
Why do you call prehistory an invention in the

86
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.829
book? In what ways is it an invention?

87
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.760
So, I, I want to be clear, I'm not

88
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.410
using the term invention in a straight up pejorative

89
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.209
fashion that would say that it's not real. Uh.

90
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.880
It's to say that the way that we understand

91
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.880
prehistory, the way we understand human origins, is much

92
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.179
more filled with speculation than we would like to

93
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.670
believe. And yet we make assertions about it that,

94
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.720
you know, pretend to be very exact. Uh, THIS

95
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.760
is to say that there is very serious and

96
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.040
very good science, yes. But parallel to that science,

97
00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.399
we tend to fill things, fill things in, and

98
00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.140
this has been happening for the last couple of

99
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.829
100 years. Uh, AND it continues to happen now.

100
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.359
So, this, uh, very often, the more popular accounts

101
00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:37.309
of human prehistory, often written by scientists as well,

102
00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.829
they're basically filled in with details that are speculative

103
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.769
details. They are details where we're guessing. I have

104
00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:50.119
absolutely no problem when somebody is saying, well, here's

105
00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:53.890
a guess, but it really is a guess. Nevertheless,

106
00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:55.890
a lot of the time, that's not the language

107
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.250
in which things are written. They're written in the

108
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.079
language, um, of, you know, here's what we know,

109
00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:03.850
and what we know is that people would have

110
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.929
lived like this or like that. And these, this

111
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.929
involves a lot more filling in than I would

112
00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:09.799
be comfortable with.

113
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.899
Uh, WHAT are the theories of our past shaped

114
00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:17.690
by? What factors play a role in them?

115
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.089
So, uh, you know, this is, this is, this

116
00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.970
is a really tricky question, and the book doesn't

117
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.929
actually answer it in, in full. Uh, A lot

118
00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.410
of it is based on, so some of it

119
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.089
is based on the evidence that we have, and

120
00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.049
the types of evidence that we have. Um, THAT

121
00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:39.010
is to say, are we looking at, uh, skulls

122
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.049
and bones? Are we looking at linguistic artifacts? Are

123
00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:46.869
we looking at tools? Are we looking Uh, at,

124
00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:51.250
you know, particular building sites, are we looking at

125
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.089
things people wore? So there are multiple types of,

126
00:06:54.109 --> 00:07:00.000
of physical, archaeological, you know, uh, zoanthropological, uh, evidence,

127
00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:03.850
and these get to be studied and pursued and,

128
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.209
and, uh, in detail. That's one side. The second

129
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:11.899
side of this is that, um, A lot that

130
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.239
goes into each study has to do with how

131
00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:19.279
scientists write grants, uh, how we all write grant

132
00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.500
applications. We, when we write grant applications, we explain

133
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.820
how it is that we're going to solve a

134
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.660
bigger problem than we're usually capable of, um, solving

135
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.140
or at least we explain multiple extra points that

136
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.660
this will, uh, go in. I think it is

137
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.890
there that a lot of speculation walks right in

138
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.829
and um that can involve Ideas that we believe

139
00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:43.950
in, ideologies that we've been raised in, words that

140
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.910
we don't understand, or that we do understand, but

141
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.029
whose implications we don't take fully into account. That

142
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.950
side, I think, is one of the more important

143
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.549
pressures that we, we, we find ourselves confronting. So,

144
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.619
You know, and so, so then you begin to

145
00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:05.170
ask yourself, where is it that we are, uh,

146
00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:08.040
what is it that we're looking at exactly? Are

147
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.619
we looking at the evidence before us? Are we

148
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:14.299
looking at the way that we articulate, uh, what

149
00:08:14.299 --> 00:08:17.809
it is that How to put it? Are we

150
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:20.649
looking at the way that, that, that we articulate

151
00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.649
the goals of our study? Are we looking at

152
00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:26.609
political ideas that we have been raised in? Are

153
00:08:26.609 --> 00:08:28.329
we looking at things that it is that we

154
00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:30.769
oppose? There's also competing theories at every point in

155
00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:33.770
time. It is not like there ever was a

156
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.250
single theory of prehistory. Uh, THERE are competing ones

157
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.919
and these are, are fighting against each other. People

158
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.010
who write grants write, write them for themselves as

159
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.789
opposed to for other um competing approaches. And then

160
00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:48.109
there's the language. The language is the trickiest part.

161
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:50.590
And this book really is a kind of history

162
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.969
of a language about talking about the past and

163
00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:57.280
how particular expressions and words ended up competing. Mhm.

164
00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:01.830
So we, you start the book by talking about

165
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.190
how the depiction of Neanderthals has changed over the

166
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.030
past few decades. Tell us about that also because

167
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.950
I think it's a very illustrative example of what

168
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.830
you explore in the book. And what does it

169
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.719
say about how we deal with our prehistory?

170
00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:24.109
Right. So when, you know, when I was growing

171
00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:31.190
up, uh, we We repeatedly uh shown on television

172
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.590
and books, and newspapers and, you know, the replication

173
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.859
of old images and so on. The Neanderthal is,

174
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.270
you know, just a step above the gorilla. Um,

175
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.390
HAIRY, dark-skinned, with a kind of, uh, you know,

176
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.890
bent over, uh, bent over, um, you know, stances.

177
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.390
Um, THE Neanderthal was a figure who is capable

178
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.940
of some sort of semi-human behavior, but is really,

179
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.380
really left behind. Sapiens were so much better. They

180
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.159
arrived, they, you know, took Europe by storm and,

181
00:10:08.229 --> 00:10:12.070
and so on and so forth. Now, that set

182
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.380
of ideas was already largely obsolete in the science.

183
00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:20.830
People did know that Neanderthals were not nearly as

184
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.320
hunched over, incapable of, of coping with the environment,

185
00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:29.349
um, weak in the, in the face of the

186
00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:32.789
elements. But we continue to see that, and some

187
00:10:32.789 --> 00:10:35.469
of those images continue to this day. In the

188
00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.780
last 20 years, these images have flipped completely. Uh,

189
00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:43.950
NOW, reconstructions of Neanderthals present them as quite white,

190
00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:48.750
uh, with no really different hair than, um, than,

191
00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:54.539
than sapiens. Um, YOU know, humans are wearing clothes.

192
00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:59.609
Uh, AND to have elaborate trade networks and elaborate,

193
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.520
um, you know, rituals for hunting and for, for

194
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.090
living. That's which You know, the, the point is,

195
00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:11.309
the point, uh, uh, that I'm very interested in

196
00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:14.390
is how is it that the look of the

197
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.159
Neanderthal and their standing changes so dramatically. In the

198
00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:22.710
worst of cases, the idea that Neanderthals are blonde,

199
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.869
blue-eyed, and so on, translates quite easily. Into far

200
00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:31.780
right politics. They were somehow Europe's original inhabitants, and

201
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.270
uh kind of quote unquote white genocide took them

202
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.070
out. Um, SO that scenario, you know, doesn't seem

203
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.940
to have uh much basis in reality that was

204
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.789
much debated, the extinction of the Neanderthals is much

205
00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:47.940
debated. Uh, BUT what I'm very, very interested in

206
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.869
is that sense that the image changes and the

207
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:54.309
capacities change at a certain moment where a lot

208
00:11:54.309 --> 00:11:58.510
of it may come from again, material evidence, but

209
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.630
a lot of it comes from, hey, now we

210
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.950
can identify with this figure. We're not simply seeing

211
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.750
them as subhuman. But as parahuman, as competing with

212
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.669
sapiens in this, in this story. That became for

213
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:15.909
me a really uh interesting way of abbreviating massive

214
00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:19.580
changes of perceiving other species of the genus Homo,

215
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.390
um, as well as other ideas about who it

216
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.109
is that, that we aren't and who it is

217
00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:25.739
that we are.

218
00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:30.090
So in the book, you talk a lot about

219
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.090
how our understanding of pre-history, I mean, the ways

220
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.929
it has been shaped, uh, it has, it has

221
00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:40.570
been shaped in a way by the expansion of

222
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.409
European colonization, contact with other peoples, studying the natural

223
00:12:46.409 --> 00:12:49.539
man, the State of nature. And then, of course,

224
00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:53.559
uh things like the rise of racism using words

225
00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:58.260
like primitive and savage applied to other peoples. So,

226
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.320
could you tell us a little bit about that

227
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.440
and also how the rise of the concept of

228
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.599
civilization occurred?

229
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:14.099
Right. Um, Let me see how to, to abbreviate

230
00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:15.840
your question because this is, this is a very

231
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.390
difficult and big one. ALREADY from Uh, already from

232
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.270
the 16th century, there are elaborate debates about where

233
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.950
it is that non-Europeans, uh, are, are to be

234
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.539
found. Who is it that peoples who have been

235
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:34.750
recently discovered, or who are now discovered, um, who

236
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.979
don't seem to fit, uh, in the Hebrew Bible,

237
00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:41.429
uh, belong, or as a European saw it in

238
00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:43.150
the Old Testament as they would have referred to

239
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.669
it, uh, belong. How do we understand how they

240
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:48.159
ended up where they ended up? So those sorts

241
00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:53.349
of studies proceed and parallel studies of early humanity,

242
00:13:53.429 --> 00:13:58.200
any attempt to understand early humanity. By the 18th

243
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.599
century, a concept of civilization are playing out, not

244
00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:05.960
least in competition with India and China and, and

245
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.919
ideological competition, let's say with India and China, but

246
00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:13.119
also sometimes in celebration, uh, of, of, of other

247
00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:18.340
cultures. What becomes really Interesting is that as you,

248
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.299
as you noted, as European colonization expands, this becomes

249
00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:27.210
a sort of linear story. We become able, we,

250
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.099
uh, quote unquote, become able to say like, look,

251
00:14:30.219 --> 00:14:33.049
we are the most advanced, and we can start

252
00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:36.929
putting everybody else somewhere in, you know, the, the,

253
00:14:37.219 --> 00:14:40.260
somewhere further back in history. History is a linear

254
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.179
progress of some sort, and from the earliest to

255
00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:46.080
the present, Um, times we would be able to

256
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.099
put other people as belonging there. That cre uh

257
00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:53.500
helps create a distinction between, not only between savage

258
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.960
and civilized, but between savage barbarian and civilized, which

259
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.780
is, it's a kind of three-stage scenario. The, you

260
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.919
know, the lowest of the low are savage, the,

261
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.940
the, the ones who have escaped from a savage

262
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.500
setup are barbarians who may be both ferocious, but

263
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.859
also there might be a little bit of a

264
00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:13.460
description of how we came to be who we

265
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.539
are. Whenever I say we, I don't mean you,

266
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.460
you know, we, I mean people thinking about themselves.

267
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:23.090
Um, IN this period. So, that distinction of savage,

268
00:15:23.169 --> 00:15:27.530
barbarian, and civilized is quite convenient, uh, in the

269
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.219
19th century, because everybody who would use it would

270
00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:34.849
identify themselves as civilized as opposed to everybody else

271
00:15:34.849 --> 00:15:37.690
that they would, uh, wish to compete with. That

272
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.090
becomes a major, um, concern, and the question of

273
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.750
on what grounds or how is it? That these

274
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.710
developments took place. Those questions become pressing questions across

275
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.099
a series of disciplines, but also uh across international

276
00:15:55.099 --> 00:15:58.580
politics as well. So on the one hand, uh,

277
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:03.309
you can say Europeans confronted their own idea about

278
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:08.169
themselves, um, by describing themselves in better terms than,

279
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.500
than the peoples that they were in contact with,

280
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.900
or the peoples they lowered over. And at the

281
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.340
same time, they begin to ask on what grounds

282
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.809
did this kind of change and development take place?

283
00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:23.890
Did it happen because of something innate, something natural?

284
00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:27.719
Did it happen? Because of some sort of, you

285
00:16:27.719 --> 00:16:31.960
know, capacity to build superior, uh, tools, so the

286
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.640
shift from, let's say, the Stone Age to the

287
00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:37.159
the uh the Bronze Age to the Iron Age,

288
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.989
or did it happen for other reasons as well?

289
00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:43.760
That scenario is the part that becomes uh really

290
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.039
key because there, Europeans come to debate whether they

291
00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:54.479
really um are fundamentally racially or culturally different. And

292
00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:57.580
in what ways they would, you know, um, they

293
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.659
can be in genuine contact with the people that

294
00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:04.660
they, uh, that they're interacting with. That scenario also

295
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.939
becomes part of the history of racism, um, not

296
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:11.260
simply because of this distinction between savage civil rights

297
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.689
and so on and so forth, um, but also

298
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:18.160
because it begins to power different ideas about human

299
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.420
nature. That is to say, how you produce these

300
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.288
distinctions between You know, one, you know, one, let's

301
00:17:27.288 --> 00:17:31.088
say, ethnic or national, uh, or cultural or linguistic

302
00:17:31.088 --> 00:17:35.828
group and another, these begin to harden, uh, very,

303
00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:40.630
very, very Intensely. Uh, AND so much of the

304
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.150
history of prehistory, the book argues, is a history

305
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.510
of how these distinctions took place, and how these

306
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.579
distinctions came to power subsequent research, you know, for

307
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.390
how these, whether they were speculative or not, by

308
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.150
the way. Um, SO how it is that the

309
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.869
British came to believe in their own superiority, came

310
00:17:59.869 --> 00:18:03.069
to contribute to a system of international politics in

311
00:18:03.069 --> 00:18:04.599
which to be a proper state, you have to

312
00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:06.869
be civilized as opposed to others who do not

313
00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:12.839
have rights. Uh, TO international legal personhood. Um, AND

314
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.930
at the same time, how it is that you

315
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.250
understand the superiority or this difference from others that

316
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.770
you, that you believe you're experiencing or you believe

317
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.170
you are uh living with. It's a bit of

318
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.810
a long answer, but I think you, you see

319
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.599
where I'm going with it.

320
00:18:26.069 --> 00:18:29.949
Yes, uh, and in regards to the expansion of

321
00:18:29.949 --> 00:18:34.650
European colo colonization and the contact with other peoples,

322
00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:40.449
when and how were indigenous peoples primitivized and turned

323
00:18:40.449 --> 00:18:44.109
into living representatives of the first humans?

324
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.939
Well, a version of this. It's already clear in

325
00:18:48.939 --> 00:18:53.719
the 18th century. That is to say, when uh

326
00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:58.000
Rousseau refers to quote unquote, the Carib as uh

327
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.949
existing very close to the original state of, of,

328
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.000
uh of nature, um, that is, you know, it's

329
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.750
already certainly there. Um, OTHER versions of the problem

330
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.349
exist so much earlier, that is to say, with

331
00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:15.550
the colonization of the Americas, um, theological debates are

332
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:21.150
raging whether, you know, native peoples are basically some

333
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.510
rendition, um, of, you know, people's, um, after the

334
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.829
fall of, of Babylon, or do they, um, of

335
00:19:29.829 --> 00:19:31.829
the Tower of Babylon, or is, uh, sorry, of

336
00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:33.670
the Tower of Babel, um, my brain is kind

337
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.140
of um freezing for a second. Um, IS, are

338
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.180
these peoples before or after the fall of the

339
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.250
Tower of people and where exactly would they belong

340
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.939
in this, in this story? So where is it

341
00:19:43.939 --> 00:19:47.650
that they got stopped, or that their transformation stopped?

342
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.739
It's in that um construction of the deep, of,

343
00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:55.300
of a deep past of a kind of early

344
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.099
humanity that this is already there. Now, that scenario

345
00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:00.979
plays out again and again, but it plays out

346
00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:05.500
around different languages. So, In a way, the language

347
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.459
of primitive is a very 19th century language. That's

348
00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:12.180
it, the, the term primitive, uh, really begins and

349
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.979
it means, you know, people who are primal, people

350
00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:18.819
who are, are closer to the original condition, but

351
00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:21.739
also people who are uncouth, ungrown, you know, we

352
00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:25.420
have not developed a culture who are savage. That's

353
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.979
the terms of primitive, and those are very common

354
00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:30.939
in the 19th and in the 20th century. Um.

355
00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:34.369
It's a term that is, that is now regarded

356
00:20:34.369 --> 00:20:37.040
as obsolete, but that really wasn't the case before

357
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.800
1980, even 1990. Um, BUT the thing is that

358
00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:47.530
this kind of primitivization, if you will, also translates

359
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:53.180
into other languages. So, as indigenous peoples are being

360
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.849
wiped out, partly by Europeans, partly by diseases, partly

361
00:20:57.849 --> 00:21:00.819
because their ways of life. Uh, GET destroyed and

362
00:21:00.819 --> 00:21:03.819
they have, they're forced to adapt to different kind

363
00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:07.910
of social pressures from the, the, from the outside.

364
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:15.619
Um, As, uh, indigenous peoples are Effectively destroyed, Europeans

365
00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:17.699
begin to discuss with them, to discuss them as

366
00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:21.939
disappearing, um, and Americans. These are disappearing natives is

367
00:21:21.939 --> 00:21:25.979
the, the expression. And so the implication there as

368
00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:28.140
well, if they do disappear, it isn't really a

369
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.660
great loss. They're further back, they're kind of a

370
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.099
loss. Well, it's not very nice that they're quote

371
00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:37.510
unquote, disappearing, but it's not really a problem for,

372
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.550
for the moderns. That scenario is quite Uh, present

373
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.800
in the later 19th and the first half of

374
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.489
the 20th century. And in some respects, we even

375
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:50.459
to this day, people speak of uncontacted tribes, um,

376
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.359
as though there's a kind of world out there

377
00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:56.520
that's just, you know, not really, um, doesn't really

378
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.040
belong somehow in the modern world and doesn't have

379
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.400
a different, uh, scenario to, to, to live in.

380
00:22:02.479 --> 00:22:04.819
There are other expressions. The book spends quite some

381
00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:07.640
time tracking this idea of the savage beneath the

382
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.640
thin veneer of civilization. Um, WHICH is to say

383
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.160
an idea that, you know, within each of us,

384
00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:18.599
there exists some sort of primal savage, uh, who

385
00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:21.800
is ready to, you know, explode in aggression and

386
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.949
violence and, um, who is, you know, has, uh,

387
00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:28.880
is, is merely just slightly hidden by the trappings

388
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.119
of civilization. Um, THERE are other languages that take

389
00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:34.560
off in the 19th century as well and that

390
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.890
are just as important, the idea that the psyche.

391
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.239
Is perhaps, uh, carrying the entire history of humanity

392
00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:43.640
within it. And what does it mean for that

393
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.780
to, um, to be the case. So, it's not

394
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.040
simply that people believed in one idea around human

395
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.989
prehistory, and they sort of left it at that.

396
00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:57.560
Uh, IT'S that, rather, they developed multiple languages, and

397
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.239
they could speak one or speak the other. They

398
00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:03.880
could easily switch into one, a kind of, um,

399
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.790
fantasy of a Tarzan. Um, SCENARIO that they would

400
00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.630
then project back into the past, or other cases

401
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.910
where they would speak like, well, it's, it's really

402
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.709
terrible what, what's happened to indigenous peoples. But, you

403
00:23:15.709 --> 00:23:20.949
know, uh, society, uh, let's say, society requires, they

404
00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:25.040
thought, um, eugenic transformation. And so it's not a

405
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.589
surprise that other peoples would disappear. Um, I don't

406
00:23:28.589 --> 00:23:30.550
like repeating some of this language because this is

407
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.989
something that Um, is, is, of course, you know,

408
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.520
not very far from a certain kind of racism

409
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.920
that exists today as well. But this is very

410
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.959
much the way in the way in people, in

411
00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:44.359
which people, uh, thought and, and, and argued. And

412
00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:46.560
part of the goal of the book is to

413
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.880
kind of show what an ugly history some of

414
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.239
these expressions have, uh, and in some occasions, what

415
00:23:53.239 --> 00:23:56.239
an interesting history, some other occasion, some other expressions

416
00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:57.910
have as well. Mhm.

417
00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:02.050
So, in regards to our prehistory, we also tend

418
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.170
to talk about a human nature. Uh, TELL us

419
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.390
about how the debate surrounding human nature informs and

420
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:15.349
serves political debates like the ongoing one between socialists

421
00:24:15.349 --> 00:24:19.869
and capitalists and perhaps, uh, whether these kinds of

422
00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:24.500
debates also and the motivations behind them also shape

423
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.310
our understanding of prehistory.

424
00:24:28.189 --> 00:24:32.260
So, um, Let me, let me give a little

425
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.500
vignette as a, as a way of handling that.

426
00:24:34.699 --> 00:24:40.140
Um, IN the 1860s and 1870s, uh, there are

427
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.819
multiple debates playing out, uh, among socialist thinkers, both

428
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:48.010
in Europe and in America, regarding the question of,

429
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.079
uh, was there ever a kind of primitive communism?

430
00:24:51.459 --> 00:24:54.739
This is even before Marx begins to take notes.

431
00:24:55.199 --> 00:25:00.160
Uh, ON, on anthropological subjects and before Engels takes

432
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.839
Marx's notes and prepares the origin of the family,

433
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.400
private property in the state. Um, YOU know, is

434
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.800
there, is there a pre-capitalist human nature, which was

435
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.599
distorted by capitalism? That, uh, debate is played out

436
00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:18.510
rather lightly, uh, and it begins to use anthropological

437
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.359
studies. Um, SCHOLARS or intellectuals and, and politicians begin

438
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:27.420
to use anthropological studies to answer the question. Then

439
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.160
Engels comes in, publishes um, The Origin of the

440
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.859
Family. Private property in the state in which he

441
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:39.459
uses the anthropological work of uh Henry Louis Morgan.

442
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:46.060
Um, IN which Morgan argued that originally societies either

443
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.339
shared property and, you know, had no sense of

444
00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.140
ownership in the sense of, uh, in, in the

445
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.459
modern sense, or if they had a sense of

446
00:25:54.459 --> 00:25:58.540
ownership, this descended, uh, through the mother, uh, from

447
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.569
mother to daughter to daughter, granddaughter, and so on.

448
00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:10.219
Um, Engels argues that uh Morgan, Engels follows Morgan,

449
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.910
who says, well, we can't actually see that in

450
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:18.619
any currently existing societies, but we can see leftovers

451
00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:21.589
of that kind of social organization in the way

452
00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:23.030
that families are set up and in the way

453
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.989
that language is organized. And Engels goes, Aha, this

454
00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:34.109
is to indicate that when Um, when Men realized.

455
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:39.680
The significance of technological innovation and their capacity to

456
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.510
claim land and and objects for themselves, that was

457
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.959
in a way a kind of first birth of

458
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:52.550
capitalism. And that indicates to him that ownership, the

459
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.150
creation of private property, is both important for the

460
00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.000
shaping of the family. And also important for a

461
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.770
way of giving up on some sort of pre-capitalist

462
00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:07.560
natural state for human beings. Now, that debate, as

463
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.160
you indicated, becomes a major human nature debate that

464
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.880
continues into the 20th century. We like to think

465
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.839
that, you know, we just think about prehistory ideas

466
00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:22.020
randomly, right? But the idea of primitive communism. Uh,

467
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.599
BECOMES a matter of much debate both in the

468
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:27.949
West and in the last debate, in this case

469
00:27:27.949 --> 00:27:31.939
in the Soviet Union. The Stalin constitution of 1936

470
00:27:31.939 --> 00:27:34.869
enshrines primitive communism as the original state of mind.

471
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.150
Um, AND whereas in the West, uh, socialists have

472
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.609
to confront the Attack, let's say, that their ideas

473
00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:49.500
are unnatural, that they're trying to distort modern society

474
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.219
through fundamentally unnatural ways of, uh, of living. And

475
00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:57.170
they proceed similarly to our, you know, in fact,

476
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.089
we are the natural ones. It's not modern, modern

477
00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:03.530
capitalist society that is our, our natural condition. You'll

478
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.000
recall, for example, that from Adam Smith to today,

479
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.260
there is an argument about how the market really

480
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.449
works, about what nature is like, about what human

481
00:28:10.449 --> 00:28:14.239
nature is like. So that debate plays itself out,

482
00:28:14.489 --> 00:28:17.209
um, in this, in the sense, a lot of

483
00:28:17.209 --> 00:28:19.170
the time people don't actually directly argue about it,

484
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.489
but they will say, your ideas are unnatural, and

485
00:28:22.489 --> 00:28:25.569
the back and forth would, uh, would begin again.

486
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.849
Now, the ideas of primitive communism are largely left

487
00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:31.609
aside by anthropologists. They're not taken seriously after a

488
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:36.650
certain point. Even among those anthropologists who have a

489
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.410
kind of emotional attachment. Uh, LET'S say, or a

490
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.969
kind of profound empathy towards indigenous peoples. Uh, Claude

491
00:28:45.969 --> 00:28:50.489
Levisjos famously sees the nambicuara, uh, in Brazil and

492
00:28:50.489 --> 00:28:54.010
describes the nambicuara of Brazil as, you know, the

493
00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:00.640
closest, um, to a kind of threatened original, uh,

494
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.569
human nature that survives now, but survives, you know,

495
00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:09.280
without writing, without violence, without power. Um, AND for

496
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.589
him, it becomes really important to say, look at

497
00:29:13.589 --> 00:29:16.160
how much we have distorted the world, and we've

498
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.119
made it impossible to get out of these gigantic

499
00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:25.270
cities and these overwhelming, um, cultural and technological powers.

500
00:29:25.719 --> 00:29:27.479
But there is a kind of other way of

501
00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:30.040
life. We can't go to it, but that way

502
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.199
of life also exists and we're wiping it out.

503
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.089
So even though the idea of primitive communism effectively,

504
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:39.880
on the one hand, gets, you know, uh, becomes

505
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.390
obsolete, on the other hand, except for, you know,

506
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.599
um, people are really like eco eco-anarchists of some

507
00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:54.880
sort. Um The or an anarcho-primitivist of some sort,

508
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.489
uh, the, the idea of a kind of attachment

509
00:29:58.489 --> 00:30:02.050
to particular peoples who belong in a fundamentally different

510
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.969
way to this earth than we do. This becomes

511
00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:07.160
a hit in the 70s and 80s as well.

512
00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:10.719
There's a kind of like the, the, the, the,

513
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.010
the pure authentic Indian idea uh that, that, that

514
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.810
plays out, who's a great tracker, who has a

515
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.650
real relationship to To the world and so on.

516
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.170
That scenario becomes a kind of a dream of

517
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.880
its own. So these, again, these are ideas that

518
00:30:26.489 --> 00:30:29.800
on the one hand, whether they succeed or they,

519
00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:32.489
they fail, they also tend to translate. Even when

520
00:30:32.489 --> 00:30:35.609
they fail, they tend to translate into other ideas

521
00:30:35.609 --> 00:30:37.369
that then get picked up, perhaps a little bit

522
00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:41.770
more softly than the, the, the harder expressions, let's

523
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.089
say.

524
00:30:43.089 --> 00:30:46.300
Uh, FOCUSING a little bit on the 20th century,

525
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:51.209
these ideas about our human past also play a

526
00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:52.959
role in eugenics.

527
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.160
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. You need to think of eugenics,

528
00:30:57.209 --> 00:31:01.969
um, first off, as a series of, you know,

529
00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:06.650
basically aesthetic ideas. Uh, IT'S uh a mixture, it's

530
00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.760
aesthetic ideas with a kind of moral fantasy, uh,

531
00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:14.680
attached to them. That is to say, uh, Throughout

532
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.709
the better part of the 20th century, the only

533
00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:24.310
technology for eugenics was to effectively uh remove people,

534
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.270
and I want that to sound as violent as,

535
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:30.239
as, as it was from a gene pool, from

536
00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:33.280
the capacity to uh have children. So it was

537
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.069
either by uh extermination, uh, or by castration, usually

538
00:31:39.069 --> 00:31:45.010
chemical. Um, AND, uh, the The idea in many

539
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:50.550
respects was that Um, There's a kind of impending

540
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.910
threat, a looming threat, either on a particular section

541
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:58.069
of society or on society in general. And people

542
00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:01.750
who are either cognitively disabled or who are racially

543
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:07.660
distinct needed to be removed, supposedly, from society, um,

544
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.630
so for the, for its own future. Now, that

545
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.979
kind of threat is an aesthetic threat. Nobody had

546
00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.000
Uh, the tools to, or nobody has any sort

547
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.089
of tools. It's a, it's a, it's an ideological

548
00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:23.280
decision. And all of these scenarios played with multiple

549
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.839
ideas of prehistory. First off, are we, uh, the

550
00:32:26.839 --> 00:32:31.790
old debate, is this a monogynistic, um, uh, species,

551
00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:36.630
or are there multiple human species within? That polygenism,

552
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:41.520
one which uh Darwin, for example, uh rejects, persists

553
00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.640
in many ways, certainly through Nazism. Um, SO, there,

554
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.400
there's one distinction, but also you could say in

555
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.430
segregationist societies as well, where there's a hard distinction

556
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:57.050
that unless you keep that, um, distinction between Uh,

557
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.729
racial groups, absolute, uh, you, you're going to undo

558
00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:05.260
some A, B, or COD or whatever. Um, THOSE

559
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.130
ideas very much rely on a kind of original

560
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.660
nature of us scenario. That's what I meant by

561
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.699
aesthetic before. It's like, we the beautiful, they the

562
00:33:14.699 --> 00:33:18.619
ugly, we must, uh, produce this kind of separation

563
00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:20.380
and turn it into a moral and a political

564
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.579
imperative. That's what eugenics ultimately is, uh, and the

565
00:33:24.579 --> 00:33:27.790
same would continue into Uh, some of that would

566
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.469
continue into the present day. It's this idea that

567
00:33:30.469 --> 00:33:35.150
you can mark, uh, hard distinctions between different groups

568
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.949
of people on the basis of whether you see

569
00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:41.069
them as healthy or as, uh, or as, you

570
00:33:41.069 --> 00:33:44.869
know, unhealthy, um, and then to produce a fantasy

571
00:33:44.869 --> 00:33:49.489
of the future. In which fantasy, only you win

572
00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:53.089
out. That scenario is the part that is, is

573
00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:56.369
among the most odious forms and precisely because of

574
00:33:56.369 --> 00:34:00.050
its capacity to hide in other languages. Uh, AND

575
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.359
to pretend that there's a kind of grand moral

576
00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:04.819
imperative to do A or B or C, uh,

577
00:34:04.849 --> 00:34:07.040
for the survival of the species, blah, blah, blah.

578
00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:10.409
All of that stuff is among the most dangerous

579
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:14.159
that's, uh, that's out there. In all of this,

580
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.850
the idea that a certain original human nature, an

581
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.208
original character of a race, an original character of

582
00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:24.850
a supposedly superior class, blah, blah, blah, all of

583
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.989
that stuff um plays in, and these ideas about

584
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.228
Of, you know, purity and authenticity at one level

585
00:34:33.228 --> 00:34:37.310
versus a destitution or a strength. All of this

586
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.750
language linked to the idea of what, uh, a

587
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.659
kind of deep human past of, quote unquote, us,

588
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.790
that's where uh that links in because people then

589
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.599
proceed to speak of how Uh, humanity would have

590
00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:52.789
gotten to where it is, what its benefits are,

591
00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:56.518
what its strengths are, what the supposed dangers of

592
00:34:56.518 --> 00:34:59.839
modern society are, and accordingly, they look into the

593
00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.559
future as a story of rise or as a

594
00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:05.678
story of decline, as a story of purity or

595
00:35:05.678 --> 00:35:09.329
as a story of degeneration. So, eugenics has been

596
00:35:09.628 --> 00:35:15.479
absolutely attached. Um, TO, uh, to the, the, the,

597
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.199
um, to the story of human origins. Never more

598
00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:23.760
so even than in the Nazi case. Uh, National

599
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.280
Socialist, um, intellectuals in Germany, if we can call

600
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.149
them that, um, very much insisted, starting from Hitler,

601
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.050
that Aryans and Samites were fundamentally different. Uh, RACISM

602
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.639
and that they were essentially opposed and, and forever,

603
00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:46.290
um, in conflict. Part of the great, um, theory

604
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.770
that he tried to build is precisely that there

605
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.090
is an argument, sorry, let me just rephrase that

606
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.959
sentence. Hitler's theory was that there is uh a

607
00:35:56.959 --> 00:36:01.810
distinction, uh, that has to do with racial self-consciousness.

608
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:06.649
Uh, SUPPOSEDLY for him, Aryans would, uh, get more

609
00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:09.570
powerful when they became racially conscious. And this had

610
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.449
been a history of all of Aryan humanity since

611
00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:15.840
the beginning. That was the Hitler, um, uh, position.

612
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.929
It's in Mein Kampf, and then it played out

613
00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:21.209
sometimes, uh, in very similar terms, sometimes in somewhat

614
00:36:21.209 --> 00:36:24.510
more different terms across other uh racial theorists in,

615
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.860
in Nazi Germany. Uh, THE implication of that, of

616
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:34.469
course, was that racial self-consciousness was supposedly essential for

617
00:36:34.469 --> 00:36:39.729
the survival of Germany now, and that unless, uh,

618
00:36:39.929 --> 00:36:44.260
you know, the, supposedly the German people were self-conscious

619
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.750
of their racial origins of the and their racial

620
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.149
destiny, they would be swamped, uh, and they would

621
00:36:52.149 --> 00:36:55.659
lose to the supposedly Semitic. Uh, ELEMENTS in their

622
00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:59.129
society. That's like at the heart of Nazi anti-Semitism.

623
00:36:59.379 --> 00:37:02.600
Uh, THERE'S, there's, there's no way, uh, of, of,

624
00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:05.020
of, uh, of missing it, even if at times

625
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.540
it is expressed under somewhat different, uh, somewhat different

626
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.179
terms. So I think it's really important to see

627
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:15.379
that there Uh, Nazism uses that harsh distinction, and

628
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:18.899
then proceeds to guide it with a supposed moral

629
00:37:18.899 --> 00:37:22.699
panic into an argument of we the beautiful and

630
00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.100
they in the extermination camp.

631
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.770
When it comes

632
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.429
to yeah, sorry, hence the eugenic uh plan.

633
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:36.250
Right. When it comes to disseminating ideas surrounding our

634
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.810
prehistory, why we should care about our human past

635
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.969
and how we should think about it, what do

636
00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:46.280
you make of the impact of popular books like,

637
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:50.239
for example, Yuval Noah Harari's sapiens,

638
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.010
right? So these are books that since the 1950s.

639
00:37:54.449 --> 00:37:57.429
Um, uh, Erika Mailla has a great book called

640
00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:00.030
Creatures of Cain, which is very much about the

641
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.189
invention of the scientific paperback, let's say. So it's

642
00:38:03.189 --> 00:38:06.030
the moment when paperbacks begin to take over. And

643
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.429
so already from the 1950s with Robert Ay's um

644
00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:15.770
African Genesis, all the way to Yuval Harari's sapiens,

645
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.110
these popular uh arguments about where we come from

646
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.550
and who we are and where we are going

647
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:25.770
to go. Um. Have been, uh, have been very

648
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.570
successful, as you noted. You could even actually say

649
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.780
that the original of this, uh, was Orson Orson.

650
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.120
uh HG Wells is the outline of history. Um,

651
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.010
SO, why, uh, what do we make of this?

652
00:38:39.169 --> 00:38:41.090
One version is that it fits with a certain

653
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.139
kind of public need. It's as though we all

654
00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:47.979
need for a bedtime story version of where we

655
00:38:47.979 --> 00:38:50.989
come from and what our future is like. These

656
00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:55.189
books typically say something in terms uh that feels

657
00:38:55.189 --> 00:38:58.989
surprising on you. And in the case of Harari,

658
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:06.120
this was a certain kind of, you know, Creativity

659
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.750
story. Uh, IN, in Audrey's case, uh, it was

660
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.360
much more a story about human violence and the

661
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.959
almost ingrained quality of human violence and the difficulty

662
00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:19.159
of, of, of, you know, covering that violence with

663
00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:22.280
civilization. Uh BUT it, it, you know, so that,

664
00:39:22.399 --> 00:39:25.199
this was an explanation in the 50s of the

665
00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:28.689
Holocaust of violence uh across the world of, of

666
00:39:28.689 --> 00:39:31.639
ongoing wars and so on. In Yuvalhari's case, it's

667
00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:34.649
an argument about creativity. It's that we are fundamentally

668
00:39:34.649 --> 00:39:38.800
creative beings who project, have the capacity to project

669
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.530
ideas and then share them and uh insofar as

670
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.209
we can share them, we can imagine, we can

671
00:39:44.209 --> 00:39:49.689
create shared futures. Now, This, of course, relies on

672
00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:53.169
minimal evidence and very much ideology. It's like a

673
00:39:53.169 --> 00:39:57.409
kind of PowerPoint generation, um fantasy of where it

674
00:39:57.409 --> 00:39:59.129
is that we are, where it is that we're

675
00:39:59.129 --> 00:40:02.889
going to, to, to go. But precisely because they

676
00:40:02.889 --> 00:40:07.209
can offer A grand narrative about us as human

677
00:40:07.209 --> 00:40:11.239
beings. These books are almost primed to be super

678
00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:14.889
successful. Um, A much better version, you know, far

679
00:40:14.889 --> 00:40:19.070
superior in my opinion, version than the Harari argument

680
00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:24.439
is the David Graber and David Wengro, um, position

681
00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:26.879
regarding, you know, the book, the, the Dawn of

682
00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:29.870
Everything. And yet, that book too is full of

683
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.479
speculation and fantasy. That book two just can't help

684
00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:35.139
itself but make an argument about who we are

685
00:40:35.139 --> 00:40:38.419
as humans and how we are, you know, essentially.

686
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.060
Uh, YOU know, near anarchic as, as humans that

687
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.219
are at a, at a most basic, um, character.

688
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.639
I think that that all is basically mythmaking. Uh,

689
00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:51.409
WE all need certain kinds of myths to live,

690
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.530
and these books are myths about what humanity is,

691
00:40:54.899 --> 00:40:57.340
about how we are good or pure or wonderful,

692
00:40:57.389 --> 00:41:00.739
or this or that, or how we imagine ourselves

693
00:41:00.739 --> 00:41:04.850
as striving, as moving forward, and so on. Um,

694
00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:09.560
SO, there are better and worse myths. Uh, THAT'S

695
00:41:09.689 --> 00:41:13.080
for sure, but at the same time, this becomes,

696
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.889
I think, very dangerous territory and basically fantasy rather

697
00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:19.090
than um, than enlightenment.

698
00:41:20.449 --> 00:41:25.100
How does some of these translate into claims about

699
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.350
how we should live our present life? So, like

700
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:33.229
when people claim that we should follow our human

701
00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:36.709
nature or that there is a human nature we

702
00:41:36.709 --> 00:41:39.000
cannot get past and so on.

703
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.229
Right. I mean, part one, there is no such

704
00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:45.429
thing as human nature. Uh, IT'S been two centuries

705
00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:47.379
now that people have been trying to determine it,

706
00:41:47.709 --> 00:41:50.270
uh, to find it in, in, in, in some

707
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.350
sort of node or some particular setup. Uh, BUT

708
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.510
there is no plausible concept that is going to

709
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.590
satisfy nor a discrete concept. That is going to

710
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.070
satisfy more than a few people at a time

711
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.439
on the basis of, you know, of, of, of

712
00:42:03.439 --> 00:42:06.989
other reasons, political, ideological, philosophical, and so on and

713
00:42:06.989 --> 00:42:10.790
so forth. Um, THERE is also, it's important to

714
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:15.419
note, no concept of human nature that has been

715
00:42:15.419 --> 00:42:20.010
very clear and discrete in scientific studies of prehistory.

716
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.350
It is very, very difficult to decide at what

717
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.540
point. Human nature begins, or at what point human

718
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.969
nature stops? Are we talking about language? Are we

719
00:42:28.969 --> 00:42:32.250
talking about toolmaking? Are we talking about certain biological

720
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.649
characteristics? What biological characteristics as opposed to others? What

721
00:42:36.649 --> 00:42:40.129
linguistic element as opposed to, to others. The result

722
00:42:40.129 --> 00:42:42.449
is that this stuff just gets really very dangerous.

723
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:47.409
So at the very fundamental level, Uh, I'm, you

724
00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:49.290
know, one of the reasons for writing this book

725
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.929
is to emphasize that that concept is both profoundly

726
00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:56.310
outdated. Uh, YOU know, really a kind of 18th

727
00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.260
to 19th century construct, and one that no longer

728
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.179
helps move toward any version of equality. People who

729
00:43:04.179 --> 00:43:07.689
appeal to human nature most of the time are

730
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:13.060
not there to say, here's multiple possibilities, here's infinite

731
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.580
possible futures, or, you know, here's a kind of

732
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.250
very thin understanding of human nature. The point is,

733
00:43:18.739 --> 00:43:21.370
usually, like, here's a very strict sense of like,

734
00:43:21.379 --> 00:43:23.879
here's what's possible and what's not. What do we

735
00:43:23.879 --> 00:43:26.110
make of these appeals? It's very difficult to figure

736
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.560
it out. And, in brief, I think it's the

737
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.879
kind of concept where the moment somebody uh appeals

738
00:43:31.879 --> 00:43:35.300
to it, Our obligation, at least the scholars and

739
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.020
intellectuals, is to just say, where is this coming

740
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.689
from? Where is this going? Is this a particular

741
00:43:41.689 --> 00:43:45.610
religious argument? Is this a particular, you know, vision

742
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.219
of what secular uh life is supposed to, to

743
00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:51.850
look like? What does it say about us as

744
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.750
technological, uh, beings? What does it say about us

745
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.379
as, you know, people who live in an extraordinarily

746
00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:03.040
complex society. Um, SO one of the key arguments

747
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.399
of the book is against any such understanding. It

748
00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:08.840
isn't because of any human nature or because of

749
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:14.000
where we come from, where Human origins Um, have

750
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.959
gone from the past to the present. Those aren't

751
00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:19.030
the reasons that we live as we, we live.

752
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.199
Uh, YOU know, I think I've, I've, I've noted

753
00:44:22.199 --> 00:44:24.560
this in the book and probably um said this

754
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.189
somewhere before. But we are a society where most,

755
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.159
uh, of the things that we consume, we live

756
00:44:32.159 --> 00:44:34.080
in societies where most of the things that we

757
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.159
consume come from very, very far away, uh, require

758
00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:41.840
elaborate trading networks, require elaborate Um, you know, flows

759
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:47.189
of money require very expensive and often very destructive,

760
00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:50.560
uh, or extractive, if you prefer, uh, ways of

761
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.379
handling the earth. Um, WE, we're speaking of societies

762
00:44:55.379 --> 00:44:58.639
in which people live in cities in the millions,

763
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.530
something that certainly never existed at any, um, but,

764
00:45:02.639 --> 00:45:04.310
you know, up to a certain point and, and,

765
00:45:04.399 --> 00:45:06.719
and time certainly it never existed. So these appeals

766
00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:10.719
to nature are basically fantasy. And they're part of

767
00:45:10.719 --> 00:45:15.149
a fantasy that, you know, maybe helps some people

768
00:45:15.159 --> 00:45:17.840
sleep well at night. Uh, BUT I think for

769
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.800
the most part, are much more, um, appropriate, let's

770
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.080
say, for oppressive purposes rather than for, uh, a

771
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.479
kind of possibility. Mhm.

772
00:45:30.169 --> 00:45:33.850
So, I have one last question then. Uh, WHEN

773
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:39.090
it comes to these different accounts of our origins

774
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.129
and our past, some of them are non-scientific, but

775
00:45:43.129 --> 00:45:46.739
I also understand that, uh, others have been put

776
00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:52.274
forth by scientists themselves and Even nowadays, some of

777
00:45:52.274 --> 00:45:56.965
them perhaps are considered scientific. But uh is there

778
00:45:56.965 --> 00:46:03.165
any problem with, for example, anthropologists studying our past?

779
00:46:03.334 --> 00:46:06.205
Uh, IS there any problem with us having a

780
00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:09.854
scientific account of our origins and past?

781
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.340
Yeah, so, no, absolutely no problem. I have, I

782
00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.330
have absolutely no problem with that. I think that

783
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.110
that's a perfectly legitimate point of study. Just as

784
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.560
I think that the study of black holes, which,

785
00:46:20.689 --> 00:46:23.219
you know, we're never going to like physically encounter

786
00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:26.719
as human beings, um, are, is is a perfectly

787
00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:30.159
legitimate field of study. I think that sociological, anthropological,

788
00:46:30.239 --> 00:46:34.510
historical, you know, political, scientific and psychological and other

789
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.560
uh researchers are really, really, uh, important, useful and

790
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.120
interesting and that absolutely, this is, this is not

791
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.560
problematic. Um, THE point of the book was really

792
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.250
not to say that there's something invented or awful

793
00:46:48.709 --> 00:46:51.800
about this study as such. The point is to

794
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.199
say that the giant drama surrounds it. And that's

795
00:46:55.199 --> 00:46:57.639
the thing that I find very tricky for us

796
00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:00.949
to be able to, uh, to think with. The

797
00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:04.389
aim, I think, from my perspective is to de-dramatize

798
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.800
this kind of situation, is to say that our

799
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.479
purpose as scholars is never to create new gigantic

800
00:47:13.479 --> 00:47:17.510
myths. And the ones who do create gigantic myths

801
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.959
need to be treated with great suspicion. Uh, THE

802
00:47:20.959 --> 00:47:25.120
book ends by noting Uh, with me noting that

803
00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:31.699
when People make arguments that are very skeptical. This

804
00:47:31.699 --> 00:47:35.780
appeals to me, uh, very, very much, not skeptical,

805
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.780
in general, scientifically skeptical. Um, WHEN they work with

806
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.629
the science to say, look, there are multiple possible

807
00:47:42.629 --> 00:47:44.820
answers to this. I'm really not sure exactly what

808
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.669
this is going to be. In a few years,

809
00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:50.270
this scenario might be upturned, will be upturned. And

810
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.790
the point is to study things carefully little by

811
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.919
little, in a way that doesn't necessarily uh make

812
00:47:56.919 --> 00:48:00.500
these grandiose claims. I think that's absolutely fantastic. Uh,

813
00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:05.239
THAT helps us understand little elements of our society

814
00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:07.959
or perhaps important elements of our society, but it

815
00:48:07.959 --> 00:48:12.149
helps us understand them tentatively. The really key part

816
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.300
Is that sense of tentativeness. Uh, THE point of

817
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.060
scientific research is absolutely never to answer a question

818
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.540
once and for all, because then that would exactly

819
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.659
be uh an answer that gets replaced. The problem

820
00:48:26.659 --> 00:48:31.070
with human origins is that, of course, we would

821
00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.379
like to have this answer and we'd like to

822
00:48:33.379 --> 00:48:36.949
have it now. And the, the scientific element of

823
00:48:36.949 --> 00:48:40.909
this is to resist these easy answers. Answers like

824
00:48:40.909 --> 00:48:44.550
the, you know, Hararis, who would be like 10

825
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.340
million years ago, this happened and this determines us.

826
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.020
And then 100,000 years ago, we invented cooking, and

827
00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.550
that determines, like, that kind of stuff needs to

828
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:57.040
be treated much more cautiously, uh, and with a,

829
00:48:57.229 --> 00:49:00.139
with a great deal of skepticism at the public

830
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:03.189
level, and hypotheses need to be put up and

831
00:49:03.189 --> 00:49:08.090
tested. Um, CAUTIOUSLY and with the sense that there's

832
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.969
something about early human life that not a single

833
00:49:10.969 --> 00:49:14.469
discipline is going to be able to answer. I

834
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.020
don't mean that, um, everyone fails on its own.

835
00:49:17.129 --> 00:49:20.209
I just mean to say Anthropologists will be able

836
00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:22.810
to answer to a certain point, and biologists will

837
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.370
be able to answer to a certain point, and

838
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.080
so on and so forth. These answers do not

839
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.330
need to give us a complete picture. I know

840
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.449
that we would love a complete picture, but that

841
00:49:31.449 --> 00:49:34.760
complete picture will always be wrong and ideological, and

842
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.050
potentially really quite dangerous.

843
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.689
Great. So the book is again the invention of

844
00:49:40.689 --> 00:49:45.889
prehistory, Empire, Violence and our obsession with human origins.

845
00:49:45.969 --> 00:49:47.729
Of course, I'm leaving a link to it in

846
