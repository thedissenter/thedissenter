00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.320
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.159
today I'm joined by Doctor Sam Carr. He's a

4
00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.000
reader in the Department of Education at the University

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.470
of Bath. And today we're talking about his book,

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.270
All the Lonely People Conversations on Loneliness. So, Doctor

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.680
Carr, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.030
everyone.

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.120
Thanks very much, Ricardo, and it's great to be

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.389
here.

11
00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.530
So, let me start by asking you perhaps the

12
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.450
most basic question here. What is loneliness? What counts

13
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.770
as loneliness?

14
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.110
Yeah, I think that is a great question, and

15
00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.700
The thing that I always start with when I'm

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.369
talking about this issue is What I have learned

17
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.900
at least from The many years that I've been

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
researching loneliness is that we think we know what

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.169
it is, but I don't think we really do.

20
00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.110
Um, IF I have 100 people in front of

21
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.270
me, and each one of them tells me that

22
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.040
they feel lonely. We think they all feel the

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.120
same thing, but, but I'm pretty convinced that actually

24
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.830
they don't, and there are 100 different stories behind

25
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:14.040
what each of them means. And so in some

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.120
ways you could say loneliness has many, many different

27
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.349
faces. However, if there's anything that They're all talking

28
00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.349
about that might be the same thing. It's a

29
00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.389
sense of disconnection and longing in that person. But

30
00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.540
what you don't know is, is what that really

31
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.750
means for that person and what exactly they're longing

32
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.830
for, and what that's rooted to. And I think

33
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.430
I, I go back to Carl Jung, who, who

34
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.029
used to say that when you've got any kind

35
00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:49.150
of psychological, uh, label, whether that be, yeah, loneliness

36
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.629
or depression or anxiety. The label tells you very

37
00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:56.510
little until you appreciate the story behind it for

38
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.790
that person. So, so the, the complex answer to

39
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.250
that question is there are probably. Thousands of definitions

40
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.769
of loneliness, and you really do need to appreciate

41
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.369
the story for the person before you have any

42
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.729
idea what that loneliness in that person is rooted

43
00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.830
to, what they mean when they say they're lonely.

44
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.490
And I think that's where psychology often, and I

45
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.720
am a psychologist, often fall short in that we

46
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.369
think we're talking about something that's very easy to

47
00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.630
define, a sense of disconnection, but actually that's rooted

48
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.500
to a story and. You never understand what that

49
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.330
means for a person until you hear that story.

50
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.399
So you got to dig and um. So for

51
00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.199
me, yes, it's a sense of disconnection, and the

52
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.229
person is usually longing for something to alleviate that,

53
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.399
but you don't know what that is until the

54
00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.589
story is told. Uh, AND, and in a way,

55
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.160
that's the whole point of my book, you know,

56
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.160
to, um, to, to, to get that to be

57
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.600
appreciated, that, that notion.

58
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.479
OK, but then, I mean, how do you determine

59
00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.520
or do you determine that someone is lonely? I

60
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.800
mean, is it just the person telling you that

61
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.389
they are lonely or how does it work exactly?

62
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.679
Well, yeah, I mean, you've got, if you look

63
00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.520
at the literature on loneliness, you will, you have

64
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.839
all of, again, it's so complex and gray, you'll

65
00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.679
have people who might look at loneliness in a

66
00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:24.820
very objective way, literally, as in. Do, do you

67
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.979
literally interact with anyone in the course of your

68
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.940
day, as in, and you, you literally could look

69
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.979
at people's patterns of movement and how much space

70
00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.339
they have to themselves versus how many times they're

71
00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.020
in contact with other people, etc. ETC. So that

72
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.860
could be quite an objective way of looking at

73
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.940
it. But then I think most people would agree

74
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.259
in the literature that it's much more about subjective

75
00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.589
senses of loneliness, you know, so. Even if you

76
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.899
don't see anybody at all for many, many days,

77
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.669
you might not feel lonely at all. Um, CONVERSELY,

78
00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.300
you might be in contact with many, many, many

79
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.070
people for 3 or 4 days, but feel incredibly

80
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.070
alone. So the subjective sense of isolation. I probably,

81
00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.330
um, more the thing that we talk about when

82
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.360
we, when we are talking about loneliness more than

83
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.730
the objective sense, although it has been studied both

84
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.600
ways. Um, SO you can look at it objectively

85
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.230
and subjectively. Um, AND even subjectively though when people

86
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.750
say, yes, I feel lonely, what do they mean

87
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.470
by that is my point. Yeah, what do they

88
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.950
mean by that? You don't know that until you

89
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.450
dig.

90
00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:38.029
Right, so loneliness is not the same as being

91
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.149
alone, or is it?

92
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.290
Not at all, no. There's, there's for a long

93
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.750
time, I think we've recognized the distinction between the

94
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.470
two. Yeah, being alone need not in any way

95
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.510
be accompanied by a feeling of loneliness, uh, the

96
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.390
sense that I am disconnected or isolated, or it

97
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.420
might be. But it it certainly isn't a given

98
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.829
that the two would always be accompanying each other.

99
00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:06.309
I, I know from my own experience that being

100
00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.739
alone is often the time I feel least lonely

101
00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.019
in, in, in my, in my life, for example,

102
00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.429
and there are reasons for that.

103
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.500
I, I mean, do we know if there are

104
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:26.720
any psychological traits that make people experience subjectively loneliness,

105
00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:31.630
because we can find two different people in similar

106
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.700
circumstances and perhaps one of them feels uh lonely

107
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.010
and the other doesn't. Right.

108
00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:45.470
Absolutely, yeah, that can be. Two incredibly similar situations

109
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.190
and yeah, in, in one person that can be

110
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.480
a real precursor for a feeling of loneliness, whereas

111
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.839
in another, not at all. Um, IN, in some

112
00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.899
of my work, for example, on older people, you

113
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.540
know, towards, towards the end of life, uh, people,

114
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.700
people in the last, say, decade of life. I

115
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.859
have talked to people in very similar situations. For

116
00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:12.220
example, they, it's quite common in old age to

117
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.220
lose things, so people might lose their, their long

118
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.859
term partner, their wife, their husband, who they've been

119
00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:20.660
with for 50 years. Their children have grown up

120
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.940
and moved away to other countries. They don't have

121
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.299
a job anymore, so they don't have that identity,

122
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.540
etc. For some people, I've seen that result in.

123
00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:31.829
A very, very devastating feeling of loneliness to that

124
00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.179
person. There's nothing they feel they're connected to anymore,

125
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.429
yet others, um, in the very same situation do

126
00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:42.750
not seem to, to experience that in any way

127
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.570
as a lonely situation. And I try to think

128
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.679
and try to understand, well, what's the difference between

129
00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.459
those two people. It's difficult for me to say

130
00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:53.730
a trait. I wouldn't say it's a trait per

131
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.019
se, more like how do they? How do they

132
00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.619
understand the situation that they're in, and the people

133
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.829
that seem to find meaning in that situation have

134
00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:06.869
something about them. I remember once talking to an

135
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.250
old woman, she said to me, I've lost my,

136
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.390
I'm not a mother anymore. My children have all

137
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.940
gone. I'm not a wife anymore. My husband died.

138
00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:16.070
I don't, I'm not, I'm not a psychologist anymore.

139
00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.350
She was actually a psychologist. But what I do

140
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.829
believe is that this part of my life where

141
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.350
I've had to cross this desert and lose everyone

142
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.679
and everything. Has actually allowed me to access parts

143
00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:30.959
of me that I couldn't access before. So I

144
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.079
can now be, she said, the hermit who lives

145
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.839
in a cave. She was always in there, but

146
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.559
she could never come out when I was um.

147
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.179
When I was 30 or 40 or 50, so

148
00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:43.420
she saw, saw old age and the wasteland that

149
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.570
some people sort of suffer in as an opportunity

150
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.609
for new growth. Why she saw it that way,

151
00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:52.769
I'm not sure, but she had something about her

152
00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:55.940
that enabled her to see her situation differently to

153
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.019
other people who've Seen flounder in the same situation,

154
00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:01.149
you know. So I do think it's true that

155
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.029
there are qualities, but I wouldn't be confident enough

156
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:06.390
to say, yes, it's because of X trait or

157
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.470
Y trait. I wouldn't know what trait that would

158
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.709
be, but certainly there are some people who seem

159
00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:14.989
to have a sort of resilience or a capacity

160
00:08:14.989 --> 00:08:19.589
to relate to loneliness differently. They don't, it doesn't

161
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:20.309
floor them.

162
00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.410
Yes, I was just wondering, of course, I'm not

163
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.339
sure if this has been studied in any way,

164
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:34.530
but I was wondering whether psychological traits like extroversion,

165
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.200
for example, would have any influence on And that

166
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.890
sort of subjective feeling of loneliness and maybe things

167
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.640
like, I don't know, attachment styles or something like

168
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:46.950
that.

169
00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:50.200
I think, yes, and uh certainly you, you can

170
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.640
certainly see why people might think that. Some you

171
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.599
might, you might easily make the assumption that introversion

172
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.809
might, might make you more likely to feel lonely,

173
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.250
but I don't think that's necessarily true. Introverts actually

174
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.859
tend to be. People that are quite comfortable with

175
00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:11.099
their own solitude because they're quite used to looking

176
00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:16.010
inwards, whereas it can often be extroverts, not always,

177
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.140
who often find uh being alone is a time

178
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.530
where they might be more likely to feel lonely,

179
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.750
um. At the same time, I am an introvert

180
00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:30.460
and I often feel like. The time that I

181
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.419
am least lonely is when I'm on my own

182
00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:36.219
because I'm connecting to something in myself that really

183
00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:40.419
makes me feel less alone, actually. The same is

184
00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:43.099
true with attachment, of course, I think with insecure

185
00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:48.299
attachment. The notion is often accompanied by a sense

186
00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:51.099
that you need other people in order to feel

187
00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:54.380
safe, you know, so there are lots of people

188
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.700
whose loneliness stems from a sense that without another

189
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.900
person around as a sort of comfort blanket, I'm

190
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.940
not safe. And so therefore, I feel terrified and

191
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.900
alone when I am alone. So yeah, I've definitely

192
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.940
seen evidence in the attachment literature that insecure models

193
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.979
of attachment can be precursors to a sort of

194
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.289
sense of longing for other people, and the idea

195
00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.900
is the other person is a solution to my

196
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.219
loneliness, and that comes with a whole host of

197
00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:23.900
things you could analyze about whether that's a good

198
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.619
or a bad thing.

199
00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:30.510
Mhm. Uh, COULD you tell us about your loneliness

200
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.719
project? I mean, what do you study there exactly?

201
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.909
How do you approach loneliness there? What are its

202
00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:38.750
goals?

203
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.830
Yeah, the loneliness project, um, which I conducted over

204
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.700
the last 345 years was a large scale project.

205
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:52.260
It was funded by um. A provider of older

206
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.549
people's living. So it was very much focused on

207
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:59.309
older people, and, and we wanted to understand what

208
00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:03.700
does loneliness feel like and where is it rooted

209
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.390
for older people. So it particularly was tethered to

210
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.489
the end of life, you know, people at that,

211
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.950
that stage of the lifespan. I think that those

212
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.869
funding the project had the idea that they might

213
00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:20.359
be able to sort of cure. Loneliness in older

214
00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:22.460
people, because I think that's often a, a, a

215
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.840
sort of goal in our society, and I'm not

216
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.239
saying that's a bad thing, but I think it

217
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.880
might be a misguided goal, the idea that we

218
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.159
can cure loneliness. Um, SO the project may have

219
00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:38.400
come from the funder's perspective from that place. From

220
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.830
my perspective, it came from, I want to understand

221
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.099
how and why when people grow old. Is there

222
00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:49.049
a unique kind of loneliness that dawns on them?

223
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.900
And um so it was very much the goal

224
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.679
of it was that, and we explored. What's unique

225
00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:59.570
about loneliness in the last two decades of life?

226
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.479
Is there something unique about it, and I think

227
00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:03.590
there is, there are unique things about that.

228
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:08.880
Right. I, I mean, I asked you earlier about

229
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.229
uh traits, psychological traits, but how about people's own

230
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:20.020
circumstances and perhaps events in their lives that might

231
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.700
lead them to loneliness? I mean, do, do we

232
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.140
know which types of events might lead to that?

233
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.789
Yeah, I mean, to give you an example, continuing

234
00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.510
what we just, what we just talked about, the

235
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.140
loneliness Project, that phase of life, you know, when

236
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.880
we, when we get towards the end of our

237
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.039
life, there are quite a lot of losses that

238
00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.880
we experience and that's one of the big things

239
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.719
we uncovered in the Loneliness Project was people are

240
00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:49.929
losing things quite rapidly towards the end of life.

241
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.159
They're losing relationships. People are dying around them that

242
00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:56.190
they were attached to. Um, THEY'RE losing attachment figures

243
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.030
if you go into attachment theory. They're losing long

244
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.070
term spouse, they're losing identity very often, and that

245
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.630
can be rooted to a job or being a

246
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.869
mother or a father or a parent, they're losing

247
00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:14.109
their body, health and their physical, literally their physical

248
00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:18.200
integrity. And the more people tend to lose. The

249
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.039
more, the less opportunity they have to grab onto

250
00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:23.119
something to make them feel less alone in this

251
00:13:23.119 --> 00:13:25.200
world, you know, because often what we found was

252
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.469
they'd grabbed onto their partner as reassurance in this

253
00:13:28.469 --> 00:13:31.919
world that their bodies had enabled them to connect

254
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:35.489
with the world by walking or in nature or

255
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.760
their eyes through poetry or books. And as these

256
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.710
things deteriorate, we, we found quite A striking finding

257
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.039
that clearly you're losing things that help you feel

258
00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:51.080
less alone in the world at that stage of

259
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.169
life quite rapidly. And a lot of older people's

260
00:13:54.169 --> 00:13:58.890
loneliness stemmed from this sort of onslaught of losses

261
00:13:59.169 --> 00:14:01.809
that occur at that particular phase of life. And

262
00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.729
I think that's an example of a place in

263
00:14:04.729 --> 00:14:08.169
the lifespan where particular things happen to us in

264
00:14:08.169 --> 00:14:12.510
particular ways that create a particular shade of loneliness,

265
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.929
um, that's perhaps unique to that point in the

266
00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:17.770
lifespan, whereas at other places and spaces in the

267
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.169
lifespan. Yes, of course we lose things, but not

268
00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.330
quite in the same way as at the end,

269
00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:26.010
if you see what I mean. So that's one

270
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.609
example in answer to your question of of how

271
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:31.690
there can be quite unique parts of the lifespan

272
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.609
if you take a lifespan perspective, um, that make

273
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:39.289
loneliness, or they paint a particular shade of loneliness,

274
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.409
whereas other phases of the lifespan, it might be

275
00:14:41.409 --> 00:14:44.330
very different things, you know. Yeah.

276
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.119
Yeah. So, uh, so, I mean, since you're studying

277
00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:54.130
loneliness and you have this project, why does loneliness

278
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.919
matter? Why should people care about loneliness?

279
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.309
Well, I think if you listen to the rhetoric

280
00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:07.349
and the discourse about loneliness. The dominant idea about

281
00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:11.349
loneliness right now is that it's some, I think

282
00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:15.270
we've medicalized the concept. So we live, I think

283
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.270
we live in a world where we're quite quick

284
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:21.950
now to medicalize and pathologize a psychological state. So

285
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.030
I think the dominant message about loneliness right now

286
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.190
is we need to cure it. There's often these

287
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.400
campaigns to end all loneliness, um, or. Cure loneliness,

288
00:15:30.419 --> 00:15:33.419
somehow get rid of it. And so I think

289
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:35.700
one way of thinking about it is it matters

290
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.940
because it's like a health risk. You know, it

291
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.440
matters because, and I've heard literally people talking about

292
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.659
the equivalent of loneliness is the equivalent of smoking

293
00:15:44.659 --> 00:15:46.299
so many cigarettes a day, you know, you get

294
00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:52.380
those kind of health, health related alarmist measures or

295
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.820
messages about loneliness. I'm not. I, I'm not in

296
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.260
that camp. Um, I, I don't put myself in

297
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.099
that ballpark. My own idea about loneliness is that

298
00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:06.500
I think it's probably, uh, there was a psychologist

299
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.809
James Hillman. He said that He thinks that loneliness

300
00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:15.929
is an inevitable part of being alive, um, and

301
00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:17.890
at some point in your life as a human

302
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.210
in your journey, it's an inevitability that most humans

303
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.219
will encounter loneliness. He said we need to think

304
00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:28.460
very carefully about what our reaction to loneliness, therefore

305
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.510
is. Is it to immediately seek to get rid

306
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.940
of it as soon as we feel it, encounter

307
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.659
it or understand it, or should we be more

308
00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:40.900
concerned with seeing loneliness as an inevitable part of

309
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.179
human life that might even have a value in

310
00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.989
some way, shape or form, and maybe. Is trying

311
00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:50.270
to tell us something or maybe is quite an

312
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.919
appropriate part of our journey at certain points. Um,

313
00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:56.630
I would see it as the latter. And so

314
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.349
I, I think that for me, we should care

315
00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:03.150
about loneliness because. It's an inevitable part of our

316
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.430
growth as a human being, and on the other

317
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.949
side of the desert of loneliness sometimes is a

318
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:10.270
new version of us. I've often seen that in

319
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.140
people, you know, the transition from a divorce or

320
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.510
the end of a relationship or the end of

321
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.270
a particular part of your life where you when

322
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.390
endings happen, loneliness often happens. And but at the

323
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.709
other side of it is often an essentially evolved

324
00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:31.670
version of you. And I think seeing loneliness more

325
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.349
as, how can I relate to it is a

326
00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:37.140
much healthier way to set the concept up than

327
00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.680
how can we get rid of it? It's terrible,

328
00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:41.290
it's an illness, let's cure it kind of idea.

329
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.469
So there are different ways of thinking about it,

330
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.229
but I think the dominant one. Yeah, the moment

331
00:17:46.229 --> 00:17:49.780
it's definitely, it's terrible. It's a blight on our

332
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.670
society. It's a, it's a health risk, it's a

333
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.869
medical risk. Let's see it as that and cure

334
00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:57.229
it like a disease. I don't, I don't see

335
00:17:57.229 --> 00:17:59.229
it that way. I'm not saying it can't be

336
00:17:59.229 --> 00:18:04.030
brutal and it isn't tethered to suffering. But I

337
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.949
think there's a danger in saying that it's an

338
00:18:06.949 --> 00:18:09.989
illness or a disease or a pathology or something

339
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:13.510
we should fight and battle. I'm not in that

340
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.949
ballpark. So I think we should care about it

341
00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:18.430
for one, simply in the sense that we need

342
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.510
to get right what we're talking about and how

343
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.130
we talk about it and how we think about

344
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.449
it.

345
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.699
So tell us more about that bit about loneliness

346
00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:32.180
being or uh in uh or that it can

347
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.949
be, or it can contribute to our growth as

348
00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:39.479
human beings. In what ways can it do that?

349
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.310
Sure. Well, you know that you can go back

350
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.630
to, there's an old poem by Rumi, um, you

351
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.229
know, a really ancient poem by Rumi called The

352
00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:53.150
Guest House, where he says that, I don't know

353
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.750
if you know it, but this poem, paraphrasing it,

354
00:18:56.829 --> 00:18:59.949
he suggests that we should think about being human

355
00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:03.369
as a guest house. Every day a new guest

356
00:19:03.369 --> 00:19:05.180
arrives at the door. It might be sadness, it

357
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.900
might be love, it might be joy, it might

358
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.859
be loneliness, but he argues that we should treat

359
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.699
each one of those guests with equal respect, because

360
00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:14.260
if we, if we invite them in and allow

361
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.579
them to sit down, they may well have something

362
00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:20.869
to offer us now. What that might be for

363
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.479
loneliness is a really important thing to think about,

364
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.569
right? What, what does loneliness have to offer us?

365
00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:31.260
Well, As I said to you earlier, talking to

366
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.829
the old woman who, like all of the other

367
00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:36.699
people that I'd spoken to in the particular retirement

368
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:40.689
home I went into this particular year. Was feeling

369
00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:46.130
very lonely. Talking to her though, she. She saw

370
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.199
her loneliness as, well, why, why wouldn't I feel

371
00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:54.290
lonely if I've lost my husband, my job? I'm

372
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.280
not a mother anymore. A part of my life,

373
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.329
a part, a version of me has finished, and

374
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:02.050
you don't just wake up the next morning as

375
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.329
a new version of you. You have to go

376
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.569
through a period of transition, uh, a period of

377
00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:10.609
grief. It's painful. I've lost things. I long for

378
00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:13.089
those things again. In a way, grief is loneliness

379
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:16.219
in many ways. The way that that woman saw

380
00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:18.910
it, for example, was that I've got to pass

381
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.819
through this period. And as I pass through it,

382
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.380
I'm becoming a new version of me. And loneliness

383
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.540
is simply the symbol or the thing I have

384
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.099
to pass through, the psychological state I have to

385
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:34.540
encounter in order to go through transition. Transition isn't

386
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.140
always easy, it's sometimes painful. And for her, it

387
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.699
was seen as. Not just this horrible feeling I

388
00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:44.939
need to get rid of, but something I have

389
00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:47.369
to pass through a desert I have to cross,

390
00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:50.160
a transition period I have to go through. No,

391
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.780
I'm not saying everybody manages to see it that

392
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.329
way because they don't, and it's the people that

393
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:58.859
don't see it that way that really struggle. So

394
00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:03.260
in some ways, perspective about it. I think change

395
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.900
is the very essence of, of how you see

396
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.140
loneliness and what you think it might be doing

397
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.810
to you or bringing you. So I would, I

398
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.969
would think, and I would argue that it's possible.

399
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.900
I'm not saying it's easy to do it, but

400
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.939
loneliness has things to offer us. It may well

401
00:21:19.939 --> 00:21:22.739
be a signifier that you have, you're at the

402
00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:24.770
end of one point at the beginning of another,

403
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.660
for example. It can be that.

404
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:33.089
Right. Uh, CAN one feel lonely even if he

405
00:21:33.089 --> 00:21:37.170
or she has relationships? I mean, I'm asking you

406
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.930
that because many times we hear about the, the

407
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.489
so-called loneliness epidemic and people bring to the table.

408
00:21:46.814 --> 00:21:52.734
Statistics like the percentage of people who report having

409
00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:57.275
no close friends and things like that. So, but,

410
00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:01.135
but can people feel lonely even if they have

411
00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:02.035
relationships?

412
00:22:02.295 --> 00:22:06.425
Yes. And I think sometimes, and this is where

413
00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:09.535
you get to that, um, what I was saying

414
00:22:09.535 --> 00:22:11.564
at the beginning that you've got to really dig

415
00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:13.814
deep sometimes to get to the essence of what

416
00:22:13.814 --> 00:22:16.670
someone's loneliness might mean. And when I've talked to

417
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.760
people who. Who have many relationships around them, even

418
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.239
like a, a marriage where they spend most of

419
00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:27.449
their time with their partner. But still feel very

420
00:22:27.449 --> 00:22:31.489
lonely. What that often can be about is they

421
00:22:31.489 --> 00:22:36.010
feel lonely because they hide huge versions of themselves

422
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.810
from their partner. So even though they, they see

423
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.449
their partner every single day, there's a big part

424
00:22:41.449 --> 00:22:44.560
of them that they don't show their partner, even

425
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.130
in some cases, a big part of them that

426
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.729
doesn't even love their partner anymore, doesn't feel seen

427
00:22:48.729 --> 00:22:51.400
by their partner, wishes they weren't in this relationship,

428
00:22:51.449 --> 00:22:53.729
but cannot show that part of themselves. It's a

429
00:22:53.729 --> 00:22:57.270
deep, deep buried side of them. And it's that

430
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.150
deep buried side of them that feels lonely, because

431
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.979
it is a loan. It's not in the world,

432
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.750
it's not being shown. They're, they're acting to their

433
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.709
partner, that they're showing a version of themselves. So

434
00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:11.369
often people can feel alone in a crowd. Because

435
00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:15.369
they're not seen by that crowd, um, they basically

436
00:23:15.369 --> 00:23:18.410
are acting and pretending they're wearing a mask, and

437
00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.010
when you wear a mask, the person behind the

438
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.770
mask might feel incredibly alone because they are not

439
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.170
seen. So in some cases where loneliness seems to

440
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:35.339
be in someone's psyche. And they have lots of

441
00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:40.420
apparently close relationships. The loneliness can be connected to

442
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.500
the fact that actually those relationships are not genuine

443
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.420
enough or allowing them to feel seen enough. You

444
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.699
feel invisible and relationships can often make you feel

445
00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:53.719
invisible. They can be the source of that. So

446
00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:57.239
I often also will say that. Again, it's a

447
00:23:57.239 --> 00:24:01.280
sort of default saying that the solution to loneliness

448
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.880
is always other people. They're frequently the cause of

449
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.760
it too. They can be the cause of it,

450
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.560
not saying they always are, but they can be.

451
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.239
So again, we have to be very careful to

452
00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:14.569
try to understand that some people's loneliness, yeah. It's

453
00:24:14.569 --> 00:24:19.109
rooted to their relationships, um, literally, the reason for

454
00:24:19.109 --> 00:24:21.219
it can be that they don't know how to

455
00:24:21.219 --> 00:24:26.060
be seen in relationships, don't feel seen. Lonely children

456
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.579
very often are invisible within the family, for example.

457
00:24:30.459 --> 00:24:33.780
Yeah. And I mean, uh, going back to what

458
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.260
I mentioned in a, a minute ago in regards

459
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.619
to the loneliness epidemic and the kinds of statistics

460
00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:45.739
people collect to study it. Do you think that

461
00:24:45.739 --> 00:24:51.489
just uh simply knowing that some people have no

462
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:55.420
or report having no close friends is enough to

463
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.969
determine that they are lonely?

464
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.310
Not for me, no. Uh, AND that's why I

465
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:07.489
always have. Some skepticism about the sort of large

466
00:25:07.489 --> 00:25:13.319
scale cross-sectional studies of how many people feel lonely,

467
00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:15.010
and like you say, and how many people have

468
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.810
close friends, etc. ETC. For me, that tells us

469
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.650
very, very little. Um, AND as, as I say,

470
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:26.199
I think loneliness can only be appreciated fully when

471
00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:28.660
you really dig deep into a person's psyche. Yeah,

472
00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:33.770
because absolutely having no close friends doesn't necessarily mean.

473
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.910
That you will automatically qualify for being a lonely

474
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.760
human being. Having many close friends doesn't necessarily mean

475
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.750
that you don't feel lonely, um, either. So, yeah,

476
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.310
for me, no, I don't see those sorts of

477
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:53.260
snapshots as good enough evidence for a great deal,

478
00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:54.900
actually. For me, I don't see that.

479
00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.030
Uh, SO, and what do you make, because earlier

480
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:05.699
you mentioned about uh medicalizing loneliness, what do you

481
00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:11.660
make of those studies point which point to uh

482
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:18.579
health consequences of not having close relationships, what do

483
00:26:18.579 --> 00:26:19.739
you make of them? Yeah,

484
00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:21.359
I mean somebody said to me the other day

485
00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:23.380
I was giving a talk on loneliness and somebody

486
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.339
at the back said to me, OK, I hear

487
00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:29.489
what you're saying. But what about the indisputable correlation

488
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.719
between feeling lonely or not having many close relationships

489
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:39.119
and health consequences, because there is a connection. But

490
00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:42.030
for me, my answer to that is always that,

491
00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:46.770
yes, OK, loneliness and feelings of loneliness might be

492
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.170
connected to ill health and health consequences in some

493
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.920
way, and it is, but that still doesn't mean.

494
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.050
That the solution to that problem is getting rid

495
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.250
of loneliness. It might mean that we just haven't

496
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.810
got a very good relationship with loneliness. So those

497
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.609
people that feel it and have health consequences from

498
00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:08.599
it have no idea how to be with it.

499
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.959
And actually see it as something terrifying, and it's

500
00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:14.439
because of their relationship with loneliness that it's associated

501
00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:17.170
with negative health consequences. We don't know that. We

502
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.239
don't know that that's not true, for example. So

503
00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:22.959
it might well even be a sign that we

504
00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:25.079
don't know how to live with loneliness, to be

505
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:27.859
with our loneliness. It still doesn't mean that we

506
00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:30.739
should go on a crusade to destroy it, if

507
00:27:30.739 --> 00:27:33.099
you see what I mean. And it doesn't necessarily

508
00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:35.030
imply that. And I think we, that's where I

509
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.660
think we have to be careful because often it

510
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.930
is implied. Yeah, there's a negative association with health.

511
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.359
So therefore, the only solution is get rid of

512
00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:45.020
loneliness. I'm not sure that would be like for

513
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.660
me, that's like saying get rid of death or

514
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.420
get rid of breathing. You know, if, if loneliness

515
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.660
is an inevitability, you don't get rid of it.

516
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.410
You maybe have to learn. To have a healthy

517
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.890
relationship with it, and maybe our attention being turned

518
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:05.569
to that might be more fruitful for me at

519
00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:09.449
least I, I believe, a way of dealing with

520
00:28:09.449 --> 00:28:12.640
that, that particular statistic that you, you're talking about.

521
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.839
Yeah, so do you think then that perhaps people

522
00:28:17.839 --> 00:28:22.270
who are able to deal well with their own

523
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:28.930
loneliness might not suffer the health consequences as much?

524
00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:32.239
Yeah, but again, we don't tend to look for

525
00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:36.869
there aren't any studies that explore that particular point,

526
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.359
for example. So the answer to that is we

527
00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:42.400
don't know, but we'd be wise to explore that

528
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.099
possibility. Uh, BEFORE we, before we decide what the

529
00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.819
actual conclusion is that we reach, because that is

530
00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:53.500
absolutely a plausible possibility. We've no idea. Well, what

531
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.859
does it mean to have a healthy relationship with

532
00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:58.619
loneliness? What does that mean? Uh, WHO are the

533
00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:01.420
people that have that? Um, WHAT, what, what, how

534
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.939
do they relate to loneliness and how is that

535
00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:05.339
different to people that don't have that relationship with

536
00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:07.660
loneliness? We, we've no idea of all of those

537
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.140
things, partly because we're not asking those sorts of

538
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.479
questions. We're asking. Questions driven by the medical agenda,

539
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.310
which is not wrong, but it's only one agenda.

540
00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:21.150
So the information

541
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:21.319
we

542
00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:23.390
have is not enough.

543
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.949
For me, no, I think it's not balanced enough.

544
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.510
I think it's very much in a particular camp,

545
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.400
a particular um ballpark, um, and we need a

546
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.760
more balanced and. Broad perspective on loneliness and I

547
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.130
think about when do we learn about loneliness in

548
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.849
our life as a part of our journey, where,

549
00:29:44.969 --> 00:29:48.890
where in society and our own educational experiences do

550
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.410
we really get to grips with our own loneliness?

551
00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.689
Not, not very, not very often, and not very

552
00:29:54.689 --> 00:29:56.890
frequently and not in a great deal of depth.

553
00:29:57.939 --> 00:30:01.170
Right. So I now want to ask you about

554
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:05.530
loneliness in different kinds of circumstances, which is something

555
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.689
you go through in your book and illustrate with

556
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:15.739
particular cases of uh people, so. Um, HOW about

557
00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:21.229
loneliness in unusual circumstances like during the, during a

558
00:30:21.229 --> 00:30:25.469
pandemic uh as we experienced just a few years

559
00:30:25.469 --> 00:30:28.380
ago during the COVID-19 pandemic.

560
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:35.079
Yeah, I mean, again. We need to be careful

561
00:30:35.079 --> 00:30:40.520
about in the pandemic. What kind, what, what are

562
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.199
we talking about when we say loneliness and the

563
00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:44.510
pandemic? So the, the, the things that I would

564
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.439
think about when we talk about the pandemic and

565
00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:51.930
loneliness are. One, there was at least the perception

566
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.270
and, and some evidence, although again, it's quite cross-sectional,

567
00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.300
large scale snapshots of loneliness that the loneliness increased

568
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.290
during the pandemic. But there was this sense that

569
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:07.109
loneliness, everyone was walking around living lives that were

570
00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:09.219
not lonely, and then suddenly the pandemic comes along

571
00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:11.859
and loneliness rides into town on a horse. I

572
00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:14.140
don't think that was true. I think loneliness always

573
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.939
existed. I think actually the pandemic. Actually brought it

574
00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:20.469
to the forefront and we talked about it more,

575
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.989
and we had to look at it a bit

576
00:31:21.989 --> 00:31:24.640
more. It could be that the pandemic forced us

577
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.439
to look at in some cases, things that were

578
00:31:27.439 --> 00:31:29.640
already there that made us feel lonely. So a

579
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.239
lot of people that I talked to around the

580
00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:37.609
pandemic time, they felt lonely, partly because the pandemic

581
00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:41.699
forced them to spend. 24 hours with a partner

582
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:44.020
who they realize they've always felt very lonely with,

583
00:31:44.229 --> 00:31:46.030
but now they're in the same house with that

584
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.630
person 24/7, and they realize, oh my goodness, this

585
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.949
relationship's always made me feel really lonely, but this

586
00:31:50.949 --> 00:31:54.630
is just exacerbated that that truth or forced me

587
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.709
to confront that truth. So in some ways I

588
00:31:57.709 --> 00:32:02.290
feel the pandemic. Actually, as well as just creating

589
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:06.439
disconnection, which it did do, undoubtedly it created disconnection.

590
00:32:06.729 --> 00:32:11.770
It also exacerbated already existing experiences of loneliness that

591
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.449
people just weren't looking at, or could run away

592
00:32:14.449 --> 00:32:18.010
from, or could distract themselves from that were just

593
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.729
impossible to do that with when you're stuck in

594
00:32:20.729 --> 00:32:24.459
a particular position. So yeah, the, the pandemic absolutely

595
00:32:24.459 --> 00:32:30.680
was a sort of unprecedented circumstance that Probably a

596
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.209
bit like throwing a stone in a pond created

597
00:32:33.209 --> 00:32:35.280
ripples of loneliness in ways we could never have

598
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.079
predicted that were huge, yeah, for sure. And certainly

599
00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:42.540
things like the older people stuff that I've looked

600
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.160
at, it did exacerbate for many of the older

601
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.660
people that I've talked to, loneliness for sure.

602
00:32:49.609 --> 00:32:55.250
Can people experience loneliness after a breakup and in

603
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.079
what ways?

604
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.089
Yeah, um. I think a really common experience of

605
00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:07.699
loneliness is the loss of A relationship that you

606
00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:11.060
at least experienced as the closest, one of the

607
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.479
closest relationships you've ever had, um. Loneliness is a

608
00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:20.560
massive part of heartbreak, um, post, post breakup. It's

609
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.199
one of the the core characteristics of the end

610
00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:26.599
of a relationship is loneliness. One of the reasons

611
00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:29.479
I think people might feel so lonely at the

612
00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:32.910
end of a relationship can be, and there's a,

613
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.839
a psychoanalyst who used to say that in a

614
00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:40.680
way, every relationship is completely unique. You know, in

615
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.810
the sense that it's like an abstract painting, you

616
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.359
and that person create some sort of love or

617
00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:50.800
connection that nobody else has ever had exactly the

618
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.880
same as that relationship before and will never have

619
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.900
again. So you've lost something completely unique in in

620
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.939
many senses, even though your mom and dad might

621
00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:01.780
say, yeah, I know what that's like. I broke

622
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.939
up with someone when I was 15. They they

623
00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:05.630
didn't break up with that person and they weren't

624
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.418
you and they didn't have that relationship. What that

625
00:34:08.418 --> 00:34:13.969
psychoanalyst argued was, you've lost something completely inimitable, um,

626
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.820
completely impossible to replicate. You'll never have it again.

627
00:34:18.418 --> 00:34:21.358
And nor will anybody else. And the loneliness in

628
00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:24.878
that is, therefore, nobody can ever understand that, if

629
00:34:24.878 --> 00:34:26.368
you see what I mean, because no one's ever

630
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:27.888
been there. You know, you walked a part of

631
00:34:27.888 --> 00:34:29.809
the desert, no one else ever did. So there's

632
00:34:29.809 --> 00:34:33.489
a complete loneliness in that no one knows what

633
00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.299
this is like, no one. And I think one

634
00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:38.569
of the painful bits of heartbreak is the loneliness

635
00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:43.350
of that truth. Nobody knows, and we'll ever know

636
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.070
what this was like. And I think people are

637
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.870
often driven to sort of try to communicate what

638
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.550
they've lost, the uniqueness of that through art or

639
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.708
poetry or writing or some way of expressing what

640
00:34:53.708 --> 00:34:56.989
they've lost. But there is a loneliness in loss

641
00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:59.899
and grief, not that that's true also of losing

642
00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:02.909
a partner through death, um, that there is a

643
00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:05.340
uniqueness to what you lost that makes it very,

644
00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:07.070
very isolated and lonely.

645
00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:13.060
And also I would imagine particularly so because it

646
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.620
must be very frustrating when we hear from other

647
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.770
people that they've gone through the same because it's

648
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.969
not actually exactly the same,

649
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.459
exactly that, yeah. And so there's a sort of

650
00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:30.020
bittersweetness to that person trying to comfort you, but

651
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.260
at the same time, they haven't been in, in

652
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.500
that part of the desert that you're in because

653
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.860
no one can be. And and in a way

654
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.540
that's part of the existential reality of being human

655
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.500
and loving someone. It's every time you love, you

656
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.969
are sort of surrendering to something completely unique.

657
00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:53.050
Right. Uh, HOW about loneliness after losing a loved

658
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.939
one? Because I would imagine that, uh, I mean,

659
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:03.689
death itself, uh, it's very, it's very definitive. I

660
00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:07.129
mean, there's no turning back, so it's basically losing

661
00:36:07.129 --> 00:36:12.090
someone forever. Uh, WHAT kind of effect might that

662
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.159
have on people?

663
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:20.379
Yeah, I mean, clearly, grief is an incredibly lonely

664
00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:23.300
experience, and I do, as I said when I

665
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.149
talked to people in the loneliness Project. Who were

666
00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:28.590
at that phase of life where losing a partner

667
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.959
was very common. I think maybe quite 50 or

668
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:35.989
60% of our of our participants had lost in

669
00:36:35.989 --> 00:36:39.340
very recent years the person they had loved quite

670
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.550
frequently for a very long time, you know, older

671
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.229
people often had been together for 50 years, 40

672
00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:47.840
years, 30 years. And some of the things that

673
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.899
struck me, you know, when you start uncovering, well,

674
00:36:49.959 --> 00:36:53.280
what exactly have you lost? Um, CLEARLY they've lost

675
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.959
that person and the unique relationship in the same

676
00:36:55.959 --> 00:36:58.360
way we just talked about with heartbreak. But it

677
00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.659
was also little things like, I always remember touch

678
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.840
was a really important one. So intimate touch was

679
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.010
a big one that people had lost, and many

680
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.439
older people had, would say to me, I realized

681
00:37:11.439 --> 00:37:15.850
very abruptly when my husband or wife died. That

682
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.370
that was the only place that I had physical

683
00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.010
touch anymore with another human being. And I might,

684
00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:24.530
I'm even including sexual touch, in that, you know,

685
00:37:24.649 --> 00:37:27.409
and so a lot of older people felt like

686
00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:30.770
a really clear realization of how important physical touch

687
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.169
is in relation to the alleviation of um, of

688
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:37.729
loneliness, that sort of physical sense that I'm not

689
00:37:37.729 --> 00:37:42.439
alone, that reassurance of just being touched or held.

690
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.830
Or having somebody touch you in a way that

691
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.889
you can feel they love you. And that's not

692
00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:56.909
felt. It's not. Yeah, so I think um. On

693
00:37:56.909 --> 00:37:59.469
one level, at that at that end of the

694
00:37:59.469 --> 00:38:05.929
spectrum, grief definitely connected to um. Things like touch.

695
00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:10.129
Um, IT also left people, I think grief also

696
00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:12.090
leaves you, I don't think there's a distinction here

697
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.209
between heartbreak and death, actually they're quite similar. It

698
00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:19.100
leaves Gives you having to become a new version

699
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.080
of you. You know, you're never gonna be the

700
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.520
same version of you that you were with that

701
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.120
person. It's like you grew roots with each other.

702
00:38:27.399 --> 00:38:30.520
You sort of shaped each other, shaped yourselves around

703
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.469
each other. And you are going to have to

704
00:38:33.469 --> 00:38:37.350
somehow re-exist in this world as a sort of

705
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.189
version 2 or version 3 or version 4 of

706
00:38:40.189 --> 00:38:42.590
yourself. And in a way, you die, a bit

707
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.550
of you dies when their relationship dies. And there's

708
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.909
a real loneliness in that, that, that I, I

709
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:51.909
remember feeling almost vicariously through the people that I

710
00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:55.459
would talk to. um. How lonely and difficult that

711
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:57.590
was for them to reinvent themselves in the world.

712
00:38:57.659 --> 00:38:59.939
Who am I gonna be without this man or

713
00:38:59.939 --> 00:39:02.179
this woman, uh, that I loved for all of

714
00:39:02.179 --> 00:39:05.810
these years. Uh, THAT was incredibly difficult for them

715
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:10.189
and incredibly lonely, but you can't sidestep that. There's

716
00:39:10.189 --> 00:39:13.860
no way around it. They had to navigate that.

717
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.340
Some of them were still doing it, some of

718
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.010
them didn't know how to do it. Um. And

719
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.810
there's no guidebook for that.

720
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:27.110
Yeah. But I mean, this sort of loss that

721
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.870
we experience, a permanent loss and the uniqueness of

722
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.669
uh particular kinds of relationships which you were talking

723
00:39:36.669 --> 00:39:41.929
about earlier applied to romantic relationships. Uh, IT'S also

724
00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:45.679
true for other sort of, other sorts of close

725
00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:49.550
relationships, like a relationship with a father, a mother,

726
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.439
a brother or a sister, a close friend. We

727
00:39:53.439 --> 00:39:58.360
can also experience permanent loss from those kinds of

728
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.639
relationships, right?

729
00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:02.830
Yes, I, I, I think you could argue that

730
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.709
the very same sort of concepts would apply to

731
00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:09.270
those sorts of losses too. They are unique. Yeah,

732
00:40:09.429 --> 00:40:13.310
every time you lose something unique, which in a

733
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.340
way, every human relationship kind of is, um, you

734
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.580
are losing something that is completely irreplaceable and unique,

735
00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:25.989
and there is something very lonely about that. Um,

736
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.070
AS I said, because nobody else quite knows what

737
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:33.250
that loss. Really means. They know what a similar

738
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.370
loss for them might mean, but it's not the

739
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.530
same one. So there's always a sort of distance

740
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.969
between you and them by virtue of that. The

741
00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:44.040
fact that they, they can't be in my shoes

742
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.600
here they can't be. Yeah.

743
00:40:47.209 --> 00:40:49.729
So you've already told us a little bit about

744
00:40:49.729 --> 00:40:53.929
this earlier, but uh what, in what ways can

745
00:40:53.929 --> 00:40:57.639
people experience loneliness in old age?

746
00:40:59.159 --> 00:41:01.909
Yeah, as I said, I think that the ways

747
00:41:01.909 --> 00:41:08.780
that we commonly found loneliness to Manifest in old

748
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:14.260
age. It was quite simply that people had by

749
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.659
old age, very defined ways that they connected to

750
00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:21.790
the world. And that would usually be through their

751
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.820
spouse. There's something they connect to outside of themselves.

752
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.120
It was usually their spouse. Or it might have

753
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.879
been, even if it's something like nature, that you,

754
00:41:31.959 --> 00:41:33.719
you can feel, I, I think most people know

755
00:41:33.719 --> 00:41:35.290
what I mean when I say you can feel

756
00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.199
a sense of connection when you're, when you're in

757
00:41:37.199 --> 00:41:40.280
nature sometimes, you know, with, with the mountains or

758
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.560
the trees or the sky. It could be through

759
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.800
reading or literature or art. It could be through

760
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.189
your identity and your job, because people, people need

761
00:41:50.189 --> 00:41:52.179
you because of the fact that you're an expert

762
00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:55.429
in something, whatever that might be. But the older

763
00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:56.989
you get and the more you lose all of

764
00:41:56.989 --> 00:42:00.189
those things, the less you've got those things to

765
00:42:00.189 --> 00:42:04.310
rely on as a kind of um. As a,

766
00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:07.149
as a sense that you're connected to something outside

767
00:42:07.149 --> 00:42:11.459
of you. So it is like old age does,

768
00:42:11.469 --> 00:42:14.110
and I think it's quite inevitable that the longer

769
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.350
we live, the more likely we'll lose a lot

770
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.110
of the things and the tools and the mechanisms

771
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.379
we have in place to connect to the world

772
00:42:23.379 --> 00:42:26.310
outside us. And, and we definitely found in our

773
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.709
study that older people we talked to either had

774
00:42:29.709 --> 00:42:32.310
lost those things and were still really in the

775
00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.429
middle of. A sense of loneliness in the world

776
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:38.189
around, well, how on earth do I exist without

777
00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:41.139
those things? Or they were afraid of those things

778
00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:44.040
of being lost. They were, they were realizing, oh

779
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.189
my goodness, my husband's ill. He's only got another

780
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:47.790
year. What on earth am I going to do

781
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.389
in the world without him? So old age was

782
00:42:50.389 --> 00:42:53.520
quite unique in that it created all of these

783
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.510
um. These losses. I, I know some philosophers argue

784
00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:03.810
they think that maybe. That's a that's a necessity

785
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.290
in that you've got to let go of this

786
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.969
world before you move on to whatever the next

787
00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:10.939
one is. Um, AND so maybe there's an inevitable

788
00:43:10.939 --> 00:43:14.459
painful letting go of all the things that you

789
00:43:14.459 --> 00:43:17.739
were tethered to, tied to, connected to in this

790
00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:22.830
world. Whereas other psychologists have argued, no, maybe you

791
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.790
still can, you can lose all those things, and

792
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.350
then another version of you will emerge like a

793
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.459
butterfly out of a chrysalis in another two years.

794
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.110
And I have seen some older people sort of

795
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.429
they're reborn after all of that, as though another

796
00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:39.350
version of them having another, another round. So how

797
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.629
we, how we conceptualize that, I'm not sure, but

798
00:43:42.629 --> 00:43:45.850
definitely there was a sense in older age that

799
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:51.179
you can't avoid all of those losses. Eventually, and

800
00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:55.459
They are likely to give rise to a pretty

801
00:43:55.459 --> 00:43:57.899
powerful sense of disconnection and loneliness that you're gonna

802
00:43:57.899 --> 00:44:00.850
feel. You're gonna feel that. Right.

803
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.649
Do people experience loneliness in retirement homes?

804
00:44:08.149 --> 00:44:11.310
Yeah. Um. And the funny, the funny thing about

805
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.949
the loneliness Project was that our, our funder was

806
00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:20.229
a sort of provider of retirement homes, which is

807
00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:23.179
a popular phenomenon in the West at the moment.

808
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.909
You know, retirement homes are a big thing. And

809
00:44:26.909 --> 00:44:28.550
one of the things I think that they felt

810
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.389
they could do was create spaces where old people

811
00:44:31.389 --> 00:44:33.590
would never feel lonely. You know, they thought, well,

812
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:36.080
if you come and live here, you'll always have

813
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.709
neighbors, people in the same space as you, um.

814
00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:42.419
We, you won't feel lonely, but I think that

815
00:44:42.419 --> 00:44:44.780
was a marketing ploy, if I'm honest. I feel

816
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.979
like it's a sort of way to sell to

817
00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:50.340
someone, a utopian life. It's like if you open

818
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.459
these gates and you come inside, everything's wonderful and

819
00:44:53.459 --> 00:44:57.370
there's no realities of being human, like loneliness anymore.

820
00:44:57.659 --> 00:44:59.899
That was not true though, for us. I think

821
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:02.219
you, like I said, the losses that we are

822
00:45:02.219 --> 00:45:07.340
talking about. Can't be avoided by retirement communities. They

823
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.149
don't protect you from losing your spouse. They don't

824
00:45:10.149 --> 00:45:13.659
protect you from losing your identity. They don't protect

825
00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:16.459
you from your body deteriorating so that you can't

826
00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:18.979
do the things you used to do. They can't

827
00:45:18.979 --> 00:45:21.300
protect you from those things. Yes, they can provide

828
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.840
you with. Neighbors who are in the same boat,

829
00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:28.939
they can provide you with yoga classes and gyms

830
00:45:28.939 --> 00:45:32.340
and libraries and communal eating. They can provide you

831
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.699
with that, but that doesn't compensate for the unique

832
00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.419
losses that you've experienced. You've still got to go

833
00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:41.459
through the desert, so to speak, and that's what

834
00:45:41.459 --> 00:45:43.300
I tended to find with all of the older

835
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.409
people that I talked to. Yeah, maybe those things

836
00:45:47.409 --> 00:45:52.659
are. Positives in people's lives, but they don't replace

837
00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:56.510
or cure or compensate for the kind of loneliness

838
00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:00.189
that people are experiencing in later life. And I'm

839
00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:03.070
not even sure they, they should, they should. I

840
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.060
don't think those things can be replaced. They can't.

841
00:46:08.479 --> 00:46:13.620
How about uh loneliness that people experience when they're

842
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:20.159
confronted with, I guess, the ultimate kind of loss

843
00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:24.239
that is uh themselves dying. I mean, when they

844
00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:27.750
know that their life is coming to an end,

845
00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:32.070
do they experience a special kind of loneliness there?

846
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.729
Yeah, I do think that um And again, when

847
00:46:36.729 --> 00:46:40.989
I talked to older people who Who seem to

848
00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:43.439
feel, even when they're not terminally ill or anything,

849
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.149
they seem to feel like death is more imminent,

850
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.629
as in they they're closer to it maybe because

851
00:46:49.629 --> 00:46:54.610
they're older. There was a marked difference in how

852
00:46:54.610 --> 00:47:00.850
people seem to. Handle the the fact that death

853
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:03.550
might be on the horizon, and I suppose for

854
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.439
all of us it's on the horizon, but they,

855
00:47:05.629 --> 00:47:07.830
you know what I mean with older people. Some

856
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.750
older people were terrified of that um of that

857
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:15.429
prospect. The idea that they're going to die and

858
00:47:15.429 --> 00:47:21.070
how that's going to happen and um. What that

859
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:25.899
means for them was incredibly isolating, whereas other people

860
00:47:25.899 --> 00:47:27.790
seemed to feel like, and it often tended to

861
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.709
be religion, that seemed to be for some people

862
00:47:30.709 --> 00:47:33.040
the real comfort in relation to this. I I

863
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.870
tended to find that those who have a strong,

864
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:42.199
strong belief that death is not the end. Um,

865
00:47:42.709 --> 00:47:47.479
DIDN'T feel like. It was something to be afraid

866
00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:50.239
of or that they were, it didn't even make

867
00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:52.510
them feel that lonely, I think. So I think

868
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.600
that, that partly connected to, to the, in the

869
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600
people I talked to, to belief, um, around what's

870
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.449
going to happen after death. And, and is death

871
00:48:01.449 --> 00:48:03.959
the end or is it a transition? Um IS

872
00:48:03.959 --> 00:48:06.639
death gonna mean I'm connected again? Some people really

873
00:48:06.639 --> 00:48:09.120
believed. I think in death, I'll be more connected

874
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.229
than I've ever been. Others didn't believe that.

875
00:48:13.209 --> 00:48:19.449
Uh, ARE there circumstances where people, uh, isolate themselves

876
00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:24.250
voluntarily? I mean, they, where they seek isolation for

877
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.000
some reason.

878
00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:31.889
Yeah, um, and that can be. Well, often that

879
00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:35.159
can be, it's certainly people I have talked to,

880
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.850
I might, the people will isolate themselves because being

881
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.810
in the world makes them feel more alienated than

882
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.540
being out of it. So. WHETHER you, whether you

883
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.959
think that's like two bad alternatives, then they've just

884
00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:52.929
chosen the least bad alternative, as in being alone.

885
00:48:53.379 --> 00:48:56.469
But some people, yeah, it's because the world seems

886
00:48:56.469 --> 00:48:59.979
to invoke in me a real sense of disconnection

887
00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:02.500
because I cannot feel like I'm connected to it

888
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.260
anywhere, and I walk down the street and I

889
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.770
feel like I'm an alien and I go to

890
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.979
this lunch club and I feel like I'm an

891
00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:11.320
alien or I I go to school and I

892
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.189
feel like I'm an alien. It's for some people,

893
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.360
yeah, being alone seems to be the more palatable

894
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.879
alternative than being in the world, because being in

895
00:49:19.879 --> 00:49:22.320
the world is more disconnecting. It's certainly not a

896
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.959
given that that plugging into the world somewhere will

897
00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:30.120
make you feel less lonely. It's not. So, so

898
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.750
for some people, I think it's an understandable response

899
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.739
to not feeling like you belong anywhere, um. And

900
00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:42.899
so being alone feels more comforting on some level,

901
00:49:43.139 --> 00:49:45.530
or at least less discomforting.

902
00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:51.489
Yeah, and can people isolate themselves when they've been

903
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:57.510
particularly the victims of, for example, social persecution, discrimination,

904
00:49:57.689 --> 00:49:59.479
betrayal, and so on.

905
00:49:59.729 --> 00:50:01.689
Yeah, and I think I guess that's the natural

906
00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:03.689
extension to the to what we've just talked about

907
00:50:03.689 --> 00:50:06.080
there, that you've got to start asking the question,

908
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.090
why do some people feel so alienated by the

909
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.770
world that they live in and the world that

910
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.830
they try to connect to. That's when you get

911
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.040
the notion that, yeah, some people the world just

912
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.399
persecutes. Um, AND actually that was true for many

913
00:50:19.399 --> 00:50:21.239
of the older people that we spoke to, you

914
00:50:21.239 --> 00:50:26.149
know, they, they didn't feel connected to society anymore.

915
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.120
They felt invisible. And there's quite a lot of

916
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.510
research to show that in urban spaces, for example,

917
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.409
older people often feel invisible, persecuted. Not included, uh,

918
00:50:38.419 --> 00:50:41.000
and so they don't go into those spaces, and

919
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.280
they are persecuted, they are isolated from them. So

920
00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.520
I do think that actually, yeah, the way the

921
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.689
world is. And how welcoming it is to us

922
00:50:50.689 --> 00:50:53.770
has a massive role to play in that issue,

923
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.360
yeah.

924
00:50:56.449 --> 00:51:03.189
Do we know how and when certain people deal

925
00:51:03.189 --> 00:51:08.709
well with their own loneliness and uh when they

926
00:51:08.709 --> 00:51:09.419
do not?

927
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.449
Yeah, it's a great, that's a great question and

928
00:51:13.449 --> 00:51:18.179
I I think that. My own, my own sense

929
00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:22.209
of it. And I, I don't have like definitive

930
00:51:22.209 --> 00:51:26.129
data on this. I, I'm only speaking from the

931
00:51:26.129 --> 00:51:28.209
conversations I've had with many, many people about their

932
00:51:28.209 --> 00:51:33.399
loneliness. It seems to be that the people who

933
00:51:33.399 --> 00:51:37.360
deal with it. Better, or in in in in

934
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.989
a different way. For some reason or another, they

935
00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:44.429
just have a different relationship with their loneliness. They

936
00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:49.800
just don't see it. As this terrible thing that

937
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:55.469
they need to. Run away from, get rid of,

938
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.510
hide from the world. You know, when, when we

939
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:02.629
did our loneliness project, it was very frequent that

940
00:52:02.629 --> 00:52:04.110
we would get to the door or I would

941
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.429
go to the door for an interview and like

942
00:52:06.429 --> 00:52:08.110
an old lady would look around and she'd say,

943
00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:09.350
Are you the guy who's here to talk about

944
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.110
loneliness? And um, it would be like it was

945
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:14.500
a secret. It was a secret. She didn't want

946
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.419
to let the secret out. And then, because she

947
00:52:17.419 --> 00:52:19.540
was slightly ashamed of it, you know, she was

948
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.139
slightly ashamed of her loneliness. But then behind the

949
00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:24.659
door when we were talking, she'd reveal it. She'd

950
00:52:24.659 --> 00:52:26.820
show it to me. She'd share it with me,

951
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.939
her loneliness. She might even cry about it. But

952
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:31.620
when she went out every day, she wouldn't do

953
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.699
that. She'd put on her mask. She'd pretend that

954
00:52:33.699 --> 00:52:36.840
she was OK. So loneliness, I think, for many

955
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.419
people is something they've put into what Jung would

956
00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:43.879
call the shadow. It's the shadow side of themselves.

957
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.320
It's something to be ashamed of, to hide, it

958
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.530
means something bad about me. It's not a normal

959
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.139
part of being human. I'm probably broken, I'm probably

960
00:52:52.139 --> 00:52:55.639
defective. If that's what, that's how people see it.

961
00:52:56.699 --> 00:52:58.739
I can't see how you'll ever have a very

962
00:52:58.739 --> 00:53:01.500
healthy relationship with your own loneliness, if you see

963
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.620
what I mean. So what I've found is the

964
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.760
people that do seem to get on better with

965
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.709
their loneliness don't see it that way. They see

966
00:53:09.709 --> 00:53:13.419
it as, well, this is just my time to

967
00:53:13.419 --> 00:53:15.860
feel lonely right now. It's understandable that I would.

968
00:53:15.939 --> 00:53:18.139
I've just lost that person. I, I'm in a

969
00:53:18.139 --> 00:53:21.000
pretty difficult space right now. It's part of my

970
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.840
transition. That might sound like a very simple distinction,

971
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.530
but actually I think it's quite powerful. Now, how

972
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.290
people reach those different spaces, I don't think I

973
00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.770
know the answer to that yet. But um, I've

974
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:36.199
definitely felt in conversation the difference between the two.

975
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:39.080
And it's, it goes back to the Rumi poem.

976
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.370
Some people invite loneliness in, some people shut the

977
00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:45.139
curtains, lock the door, and don't let it in.

978
00:53:45.239 --> 00:53:47.929
And I think, um, I think Rumi was talking

979
00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:50.330
from a space of wisdom when he, um, when

980
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:54.120
he wrote that poem. Even though it was thousands

981
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.949
of years ago that he wrote it. Yeah.

982
00:53:58.889 --> 00:54:01.810
Do you think that it is possible for people

983
00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:08.610
to avoid loneliness and uh should people avoid loneliness?

984
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:16.219
I personally. Would I, if, if someone had said

985
00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.659
to me, you have to say yes or no

986
00:54:17.659 --> 00:54:20.219
to, is it possible to avoid loneliness, I'd probably

987
00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:22.820
say no. I think that at some point on

988
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:31.399
the journey. You will encounter something that inevitably creates

989
00:54:31.399 --> 00:54:34.270
a new sense of disconnection and loneliness. It probably

990
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.149
will be lost. You'll lose something because you can't

991
00:54:37.149 --> 00:54:41.260
hold on to everything forever. Um. And the longer

992
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.129
you live, the more likely that's gonna be true.

993
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:48.770
Um, SO for one, I think, yeah, I'd say

994
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.209
no, I don't think it's possible to avoid it.

995
00:54:52.159 --> 00:54:54.159
What your second question was, sorry, I forgot the

996
00:54:54.159 --> 00:54:54.659
second one,

997
00:54:54.780 --> 00:55:00.560
uh, if people should try to avoid loneliness,

998
00:55:00.639 --> 00:55:05.320
I mean. Like I said to you, the people

999
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.050
that I, that I saw and talked to. WHO

1000
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.600
I think believed they should try to avoid it,

1001
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.929
but still felt it, were the ones who hid

1002
00:55:15.929 --> 00:55:18.530
it. They then hid it. And what I, what

1003
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:23.560
I also think about loneliness is paradoxically. The cure

1004
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.800
or the, it's not really the cure, but the

1005
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.520
thing that soothes loneliness most is sharing stories of

1006
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.320
loneliness. That's one of the reasons I wrote the

1007
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.350
book. What I often found older people would say

1008
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.120
to me is, I feel so much better that

1009
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.590
I told that story. I feel so much better

1010
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.080
that I told that story. I let my loneliness

1011
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.360
out. I showed it to somebody else, and that

1012
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.360
feels connecting. You know, the idea. And so maybe.

1013
00:55:48.709 --> 00:55:52.570
The loneliness is there because through it, it drives

1014
00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.330
us to connect with other people. You know, it

1015
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:59.209
drives us to connection maybe in some senses, and

1016
00:55:59.209 --> 00:56:02.729
maybe sharing stories of loneliness is a way for

1017
00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:06.840
us to paradoxically connect with other with other people.

1018
00:56:07.169 --> 00:56:13.399
So often I think that maybe. It's there. Um,

1019
00:56:13.409 --> 00:56:16.620
AND has potential. I think through it, you can

1020
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.010
also empathize with other people who feel it, right?

1021
00:56:19.139 --> 00:56:21.580
So I often would find that older people loved

1022
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.729
to know that actually the women three doors down

1023
00:56:24.729 --> 00:56:27.649
the road feels very similar to you. And you,

1024
00:56:27.659 --> 00:56:30.179
you can share that experience as human beings on

1025
00:56:30.179 --> 00:56:33.260
some level. So I, I won I wonder whether

1026
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.540
loneliness might not be a sort of glue in

1027
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.659
some way, shape or form that we just haven't

1028
00:56:38.659 --> 00:56:41.639
realized is quite powerful and potent. If we could

1029
00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.879
see it as more than just a disease or

1030
00:56:44.879 --> 00:56:45.709
an illness.

1031
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.790
OK, so I have just one last question then.

1032
00:56:53.629 --> 00:56:58.790
What can people do to deal with loneliness? Are

1033
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:04.229
there specific kinds of activities or are there specific

1034
00:57:04.229 --> 00:57:10.669
kinds of, uh, I don't know, mental ways of

1035
00:57:10.669 --> 00:57:15.620
dealing with, uh, loneliness in a positive way.

1036
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:21.310
Again, I mean, the amount of times that I

1037
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.790
spoke to people, um, in the course of my

1038
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.860
studies, who would say. I'll tell you what the

1039
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.939
most frustrating thing of all is about loneliness. When

1040
00:57:32.939 --> 00:57:36.530
it's when people say you lonely people can go

1041
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:40.179
to this dinner every Thursday. We'll put you on

1042
00:57:40.179 --> 00:57:42.580
a bus, we'll drive you to the dinner, and

1043
00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.340
that will be the solution to your loneliness. They

1044
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.830
would often say, that is not. The answer to

1045
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.020
my loneliness, it, it almost felt insulting to them

1046
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.699
that even though it was coming from a very

1047
00:57:53.699 --> 00:57:56.729
well-meaning place from the people who created these things,

1048
00:57:56.899 --> 00:58:02.439
these initiatives very frequently. DIDN'T help people. They actually

1049
00:58:02.439 --> 00:58:05.120
made them feel like they had leprosy or something,

1050
00:58:05.199 --> 00:58:08.080
you know, some kind of, some kind of disease

1051
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.459
that they, and they felt like a, that doesn't

1052
00:58:11.459 --> 00:58:13.820
really touch my loneliness because it's not really about

1053
00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.959
that. It's not just about me having dinner with

1054
00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:18.239
a few people on a Thursday or doing a

1055
00:58:18.239 --> 00:58:20.360
bit of yoga with some people in, in, in

1056
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.909
the same space. It's deeper than that, and I

1057
00:58:23.909 --> 00:58:27.070
need the opportunity to tell my story of loneliness

1058
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.429
for one. I need to let that out, and

1059
00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:31.169
I need someone to want to know what that's

1060
00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:34.439
about for me and care about it. That begins

1061
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:38.750
to alleviate that, that feeling of loneliness. It doesn't

1062
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.790
get rid of it, but it begins to alleviate

1063
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:43.350
it. But I'd say to people who feel lonely.

1064
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.090
Really think about, um, for one, how you're seeing

1065
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.969
your own loneliness is a really important thing. How

1066
00:58:49.969 --> 00:58:52.830
are you seeing this, this feeling inside you? Um,

1067
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.879
ARE you instinctively, like James Hillman argued, looking for

1068
00:58:56.879 --> 00:58:58.840
the exit so you can kick loneliness out of

1069
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.159
it as quickly as possible? Or could you take

1070
00:59:02.159 --> 00:59:04.840
another possibility that if it's here for me right

1071
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.719
now, what is it really meaning? What is it

1072
00:59:06.719 --> 00:59:10.280
telling me? What's it, what's it revealing about me?

1073
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.370
So I'd say one thing that we should all

1074
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.250
do is is think carefully about what our loneliness

1075
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.260
might mean. Um, AND I do think that should

1076
00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.659
be rooted in our education about loneliness from the

1077
00:59:20.659 --> 00:59:23.580
very beginning. Even in, even as a child, what

1078
00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.979
is our loneliness about? Where do we learn about?

1079
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.199
Are we loneliness literate, so to speak? I don't

1080
00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:31.620
think we are, but we can, we, when as

1081
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:35.459
adults, maybe we can at least adopt a critical

1082
00:59:35.459 --> 00:59:38.899
understanding, patient approach with our loneliness. I'd definitely say

1083
00:59:38.899 --> 00:59:40.419
that would be the first step I would want

1084
00:59:40.419 --> 00:59:43.260
to do if I felt lonely, rather than just

1085
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.379
head to the doctor. You, you know, who will

1086
00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:51.820
immediately take the medicalized perspective on loneliness.

1087
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.550
I mean, uh, do you think that there are,

1088
00:59:56.719 --> 01:00:01.709
or, or are there any approaches in, for example,

1089
01:00:02.239 --> 01:00:08.000
psychotherapy that do not treat loneliness as uh some

1090
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.949
sort of disorder or disease and approach loneliness, uh,

1091
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.360
in a way that is more similar to your

1092
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:18.870
approach?

1093
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.610
Yeah, I mean, I have seen I've seen approaches

1094
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:29.149
where people have, for example. Created spaces or groups

1095
01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:34.189
where people simply come to share their stories of

1096
01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:36.550
loneliness with a bit like a therapy group in

1097
01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.229
some senses, but people would come to share their

1098
01:00:39.229 --> 01:00:42.820
stories of loneliness, not with the intention necessarily even

1099
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.389
of getting rid of the loneliness, but just to

1100
01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:48.540
allow it to exist. And share it with other

1101
01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.340
people who have similar stories or, or maybe very

1102
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.419
different stories of their own loneliness. The, the nice

1103
01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:58.860
thing about that is, it doesn't individualize it. You

1104
01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.500
know, you, you get the sense that when other

1105
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.389
people have it, they carry it to on their

1106
01:01:02.389 --> 01:01:05.770
journeys. You get to hear and empathize with them,

1107
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.510
and they get to hear and empathize with yours.

1108
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.389
And there's a sort of. A, you're allowing the

1109
01:01:11.389 --> 01:01:13.159
loneliness, you're not trying to get rid of it.

1110
01:01:13.409 --> 01:01:15.969
B, you're connecting with it. C, you're listening to

1111
01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:18.449
other people and feeling a bit more normal because

1112
01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.050
everyone has it. That kind of approach has it

1113
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:24.610
does exist in some spheres, for example, around loneliness.

1114
01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:27.010
I've seen someone in America who does that in

1115
01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:29.169
an old people's home, for example, the old people

1116
01:01:29.169 --> 01:01:31.729
do that, and he's created his own group around

1117
01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:33.929
that. I like that approach. To me, that makes

1118
01:01:33.929 --> 01:01:35.649
much more sense than simply going to the doctor

1119
01:01:35.649 --> 01:01:39.179
and them saying. Take some antidepressants and maybe also

1120
01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:41.909
go to this yoga club or, or, or, or

1121
01:01:41.909 --> 01:01:43.909
make a friend with somebody on the street or

1122
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.030
whatever. I don't know what, whatever, whatever might be

1123
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.070
prescribed. So yes, I do think there are models

1124
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.929
we might look at. That would take a different

1125
01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:55.090
approach to how we see the problem, but still

1126
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.250
do something, if you see what I mean, as

1127
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.969
a sort of, as, as uh trying to do

1128
01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:01.770
something about it rather than nothing.

1129
01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:07.570
Right. OK, so do you have any final remarks

1130
01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.969
on the topic of loneliness, something that we might

1131
01:02:10.969 --> 01:02:14.159
not have touched on during our conversation?

1132
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.090
I mean, not really. I mean, I think as

1133
01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:21.489
our conversation has revealed, at least my own perspective

1134
01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.439
on it, is that we've got a lot more

1135
01:02:24.729 --> 01:02:27.370
thinking to do. Go back to your very first

1136
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:31.610
question about even what is loneliness. We, we might

1137
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.169
think we know the answer to that, but I

1138
01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:36.510
think we really don't. It's a much more complicated

1139
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:41.810
subject than the discourse around it sometimes betrays. And

1140
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:43.850
I, I think I'd, I'd encourage us as a

1141
01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:48.620
society and as academics. Not to forget that. We

1142
01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.540
don't know as much about it as we think

1143
01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.129
we do.

1144
01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:56.870
Right. OK, so I will be leaving a link

1145
01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:00.030
to your book in the description of the interview,

1146
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.500
which is again, all the lonely people conversations on

1147
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.870
loneliness and Doctor Carr, apart from the book, would

1148
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.949
you like to tell people where they can find

1149
01:03:10.949 --> 01:03:13.340
you and your work on the internet?

1150
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.939
Yeah, sure. Um, I think my university, the University

1151
01:03:17.939 --> 01:03:21.260
of Bath, that's the university where we conducted the

1152
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.290
Loneliness Project, and I think if you simply Google

1153
01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:28.100
the Loneliness Project, University of Bath, you can access

1154
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.620
a lot of the more, the more scientific papers

1155
01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.229
that we published, um, around that particular project and

1156
01:03:34.229 --> 01:03:36.620
loneliness itself. So yeah, it's quite easy to find

1157
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.899
through Bath University.

1158
01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:42.409
OK, great. So thank you so much for taking

1159
01:03:42.409 --> 01:03:44.729
the time to come on the show. It's been

1160
01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:49.600
a very informative conversation, so thank you so much.

1161
01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:49.889
Yeah,

1162
01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:52.010
thanks, Ricardo. Thanks for your questions too. I appreciate

1163
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.330
