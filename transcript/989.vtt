00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.739
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob to the MG

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.460
by Doctor Robert Vinton. He's a postdoctoral research fellow

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.539
within a project on epistemic injustice and previously also

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.799
a postdoctoral research fellow on a project on the

6
00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:20.620
Epistemology of religious belief at the Nova University of

7
00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.799
Lisbon. And today we're going to focus on the

8
00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.309
book. He is the editor of Cognitive uh Wittgenstein

9
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.690
and the Cognitive Science of Religion, Interpreting human nature

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.369
and the mind. And toward the end, we're also

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.909
going to talk a little bit about epistemic injustice.

12
00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:39.110
So, Doctor Vinton, welcome to the show. It's a

13
00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:40.189
pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.340
It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for

15
00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.119
having me on. I'm, I'm glad to have been

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.759
in finances.

17
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:46.020
Su

18
00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.610
Sure.

19
00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.319
So, um I've already had several different cognitive scientists

20
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.970
of religion on the show and that's also one

21
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.119
of the main reasons why when I got across

22
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.669
your book, I really wanted to invite you one.

23
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.209
So, uh but perhaps the approach that you bring

24
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.165
on into this book um is um different than

25
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:10.055
the one that is more mainstream in the cognitive

26
00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:12.724
science of religion. So how do you try to

27
00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:16.224
approach religion in the book? Exactly. OK.

28
00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.644
So um my background actually isn't in the cognitive

29
00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:23.275
science of religion. My background is in philosophy and

30
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:28.824
particularly the philosophy of uh Ludwig Fensin. And um

31
00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:34.669
so I became interested in cognitive science of religion

32
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.870
through reading Finian critiques of cognitive science. And I

33
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:44.540
thought that those could be applied across over to

34
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.760
cognitive science of religion. I saw a lot of

35
00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.599
the kind of mistakes that were being identified by

36
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.720
Vicks Finian's reappearing in the work of cognitive scientists

37
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.599
of religion. Um So, I su I suppose in

38
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.440
one sense, my approach, my own personal approach is

39
00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:04.099
uh is uh a critical one from a Vicky

40
00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.000
perspective. Um But within the book, there, there isn't

41
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.710
really a single approach to religion. There's uh a

42
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.020
variety of different contributors from quite different backgrounds. There's

43
00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:23.000
uh Rita mcnamara who's a cross cultural psychologist, uh

44
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.520
Olympia Panagiotou studies history and uses neurocognitive approaches to

45
00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.399
studying ancient rituals. Um There's some people with a

46
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.970
background in cognitive science of religion. So Roger Trigg

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.259
uh Hans Van Agen, um uh there's Casper Hes

48
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.830
who studies social neuroscience and then there's a, a

49
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:48.929
variety of philosophers as well. So um there's quite

50
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.759
a lot of different approaches to religion within the

51
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.770
book and there's disagreements between the authors as well.

52
00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.570
So in, in some sense, I would say there

53
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.419
isn't a single approach within the book. Um There's,

54
00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.940
there's quite a lot of different approaches and, and

55
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.279
disagreements between the different authors. On the other hand,

56
00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:14.419
there is a commonality between the various authors. There's

57
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.380
a common interdisciplinary, which is something that I emphasize

58
00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.639
in the, the introduction. And I think that's something

59
00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:27.960
that's uh cognitive scientists of religion agree that their

60
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.949
discipline is, is basically an inter interdisciplinary discipline that

61
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.720
it, it takes on board insights from linguistics and

62
00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.970
psychology and neuroscience, anthropology and kind of bring tries

63
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.039
to bring all of that evidence together along with

64
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.100
reflections on frameworks and things like that, philosophical uh

65
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.100
reflections as well. So there's a common interdisciplinary. Um

66
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.380
AND Wittgenstein is also a common thread throughout the

67
00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.600
book. So 10 out of 11 of the chapters

68
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:08.009
discuss Wittgenstein explicitly and all of the chapters discuss

69
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.000
Vick and Stian themes in, in one way or

70
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.940
another. So, so yeah, there's, there's those two common

71
00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.088
two com com common elements between the whole, the

72
00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:23.408
whole book. Um And one more thing I I

73
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.908
would say about the book is that it's more

74
00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.209
philosophical than empirical. So that's another thing that I

75
00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:33.148
think the authors have in common is that it's,

76
00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:37.859
it takes a step back from empirical reflections on

77
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.669
uh you know, data about religion or descriptions of

78
00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:46.789
religious rituals. It's, it's more about the frameworks through

79
00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:51.910
which we few religion, uh the relationships between the

80
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.619
various disciplines via which we might study religion. Uh

81
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.579
These kind of philosophical questions are at the center

82
00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:00.200
of the book

83
00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:06.029
a and apart from its interdisciplinary, how would you

84
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.709
characterize mainstream cognitive science of religion and in what

85
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.670
ways would you say, perhaps it differs from the

86
00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.369
sorts of approaches that you have in your book?

87
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.309
Um So the first thing I'd say about cognitive

88
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.970
science of religion is that it's a, it's a

89
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.119
relatively young discipline. It's been around for about 30

90
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.589
years. If you, if you date it back to

91
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.920
Tom Lawson and Robert mcauley's book, uh what's it

92
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:39.670
called? Rethinking religion? Yeah, it's rethinking religion. Um That

93
00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.989
book is sometimes identified as the kind of founding

94
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.630
document of cognitive science of religion and that was

95
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:56.750
published in 1990. Um And so it emphasizes commonalities

96
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.690
between uh participants in religious practices. Um QUITE often

97
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.420
taking uh an evolutionary approach to that. So, showing

98
00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:14.190
that human cognitive abilities have certain things in common

99
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.970
as a result of human beings having involved in

100
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.089
a certain way. Um AND then looks at how

101
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.059
that might help us to understand religion. And I

102
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.160
mean, there, there are differences between different cognitive scientists,

103
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.470
but I, I suppose we'll, we'll get into some

104
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.989
of the ways in which the mainstream cognitive scientists

105
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.130
of religion uh uh do their work.

106
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:44.630
Uh Yes, we're, we're going to get into some

107
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.619
of that later in our conversation. But why Wittgenstein

108
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.339
in this particular case? I mean, in what ways,

109
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.450
uh I mean, general ways because we're going to

110
00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:58.809
get into more detail. W would uh would you

111
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.589
say his work connects to the, not necessarily the

112
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.089
cognitive science, but perhaps more broadly the science of

113
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.709
religion?

114
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.070
Um So, uh one reason that I uh wanted

115
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.329
to bring wittenstein into this is just my background,

116
00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.260
but I'm, I have a particular interest in Wittgenstein

117
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.609
uh myself. Um And there has been a bit

118
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:29.929
of an interest amongst Finian's in cognitive science in

119
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.410
recent years. So, one of the books that inspired

120
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.920
me um to take an interest in this was

121
00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:40.570
uh Peter Peter Hacker and uh Maxwell Bennett's book

122
00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:45.230
on the Philson Foundations of Neuroscience. And it struck

123
00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:48.329
me that a lot of the criticisms of cognitive

124
00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:51.519
science and neuroscience that they make in that book

125
00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.859
can carry over to cognitive science of religion. So

126
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.799
that's one reason for bringing fensin into this. So,

127
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.920
so uh one of those criticisms is that there

128
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:07.869
is a bit of a tendency within cognitive science

129
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.700
of religion to muddle together neuroscientific language and psychological

130
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:19.220
language. Um So one very straightforward way in which

131
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.220
they do that is to talk about the mind

132
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.519
as if it's synonymous with the, the brain and

133
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:29.510
to use the expressions, mind and brain interchangeably. Why,

134
00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:34.349
why Fensin was the question? Yeah. Um So, so

135
00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:37.960
there's lots of reasons actually. So um for one

136
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:42.379
thing, Wittgenstein had quite a lot to say about

137
00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:46.609
religion in his work and some of that was

138
00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:50.179
commenting on people like uh James Fraser and The

139
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.090
Golden Bough, which I think can be seen as

140
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.969
a precursor to the kind of work that you

141
00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:59.150
get in cognitive science of religion these days. So

142
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:04.580
it was a scientific attempt to, to grapple with

143
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.729
uh religious ritual and magic. Um And Wittgenstein made

144
00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:13.500
criticisms of Fraser, which I think carry over to

145
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.349
some of the work in cognitive science of religion

146
00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:20.229
today. Um So there's, there's an interest in religion

147
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.520
in Wittenstein. There's also an interest in uh the

148
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.500
correct use of psychological terms and particular, particularly in

149
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.359
uh terms like belief, knowledge, certainty in his later

150
00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:36.950
work in uh uncertainty. So I think some of

151
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:42.890
Wittenstein s reflections on, on uh psychological expressions on

152
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.090
cognition are gonna be relevant as well to cognitive

153
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:51.989
science of, of religion. Um Yeah. So uh by,

154
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.130
by the way, since, since you've already mentioned, uh

155
00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:01.909
Wittgenstein's examinations of uh concepts like belief, knowledge, certainty

156
00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.530
and so on. Uh I have this question saved

157
00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:07.239
for later in our conversation, but perhaps it's good

158
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.750
to introduce it now. Uh How do you think

159
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.200
that notions like that? And also notions like uh

160
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.619
thought and faith, it would fit into a naturalistic

161
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.760
framework because since we're talking about the science of

162
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.299
religion here, um we're basically approaching things through that

163
00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:27.429
sort of framework,

164
00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:30.229
right? Yeah. Well, I, I mean, I think from

165
00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:32.520
a F and Stian perspective, you might wonder whether

166
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.349
they do fit into a naturalistic framework at all.

167
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.969
Um uh It, depending on what you mean by

168
00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:45.489
naturalistic. So naturalism is sometimes taken, I think, to

169
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:52.479
be synonymous with, with scientism. Um, AND in that

170
00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:57.289
sense, fensin certainly wouldn't think that, that you could

171
00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:02.080
give a naturalistic account of these psychological expressions. Um,

172
00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:05.940
I mean, obviously this is something that cognitive scientists

173
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.640
of religion think you can do. So, uh, cognitive

174
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.469
science of religion is, that's exactly what it's all

175
00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:16.739
about. Right. It's about a scientific investigation of notions

176
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.150
like belief and knowledge and faith uh from a,

177
00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:29.609
from a scientific perspective. Um uh II, I wonder

178
00:11:29.619 --> 00:11:31.260
if I, I might say a bit more later

179
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.750
on, I think about Wittgenstein and, and, and naturalism.

180
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.380
But um but that's how, how I'll, I'll answer

181
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.450
that one for now. OK.

182
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.890
Uh And do, do you know if there's been

183
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.260
lots of interaction or not so much between people

184
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.609
working in the cognitive science of religion and people

185
00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:55.900
working on Wittgenstein's philosophy? I mean, do you know

186
00:11:55.909 --> 00:11:59.280
at all if the cognitive scientists of religion, for

187
00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:04.630
example, are aware of work uh on religion than

188
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.630
by, by the wits and if they take it

189
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:11.710
seriously at all or if they are aware of

190
00:12:11.719 --> 00:12:15.280
it, but just don't uh take it very seriously.

191
00:12:15.289 --> 00:12:17.039
I mean, what do you know about it?

192
00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:18.979
I don't, so I don't think there is a

193
00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:22.969
huge amount of interaction between cognitive scientists of religion

194
00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:26.739
and Fenians. I know uh in the Lawson and

195
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.609
mcauley book that I mentioned before, rethinking religion, they

196
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:33.820
mentioned Peter Winch, there's a bit of discussion of

197
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.169
Peter Winch there and they're critical of Peter Winch.

198
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:41.650
And I wonder if that's been influential in um

199
00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:45.010
putting people off a kind of thick and Stian

200
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:51.799
approach to understanding uh religion. Um But I think

201
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:56.739
probably um part of the reason that there hasn't

202
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.140
been a huge amount of interaction is just the

203
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.940
way in which academia works that people are divided

204
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:09.789
up into different departments, different disciplines and they tend

205
00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:13.340
to interact with people from their own discipline. So,

206
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.919
you know, although I in the book uh say

207
00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:21.799
that it's, it's a, it's a virtue to, to

208
00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:24.580
kind of have interaction between different disciplines and that

209
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.940
it's going to be fruitful. Actually in my professional

210
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.539
life, I tend to mostly mix with other philosophers.

211
00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:34.719
And even more than that, I tend to mix

212
00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:39.015
particularly with finian philosophers. I go to conferences with

213
00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:42.044
Wickens Stans. Um And if I'm not going to

214
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.734
Wittenstein conferences, I go to philosophy conferences and I

215
00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:47.835
very, very rarely go to a conference where I'm

216
00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:51.015
going to interact with somebody from uh from another

217
00:13:51.025 --> 00:13:54.234
discipline. And a lot of people working in the

218
00:13:54.244 --> 00:13:58.284
cognitive science of religion work in other departments, they

219
00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:01.294
work in religious studies or they work in psychology

220
00:14:01.604 --> 00:14:07.640
um or anthropology. So they probably don't come across

221
00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:10.890
philosophers all that much, let, let alone Vick and

222
00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:14.349
Stinn philosophers. So that would be one reason why

223
00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:20.200
there's not very much interaction. Um But it, it's

224
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.729
not as though there's no interaction whatsoever. So, some

225
00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:27.080
of the contrib contributors to the book, uh Roger

226
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.419
Trigg, uh he was involved in a project on

227
00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:33.700
cognitive science of religion. He's edited a book on

228
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.289
cognitive science of Religion with Justin Barrett. Um And

229
00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:40.280
he's also written about Fensin in the past. So

230
00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:43.659
he has an interest in, in both. He's quite

231
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:46.179
critical of wittenstein, but he at least takes an

232
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.659
interest in, in Fensin and philosophy. And he's contributed

233
00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:53.820
a discussion of Fensin to this, to this volume.

234
00:14:53.979 --> 00:14:57.219
Uh Christopher Hoyt, one of the other contributors to

235
00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:00.390
the volume. Um I saw him give a presentation

236
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.369
on Fensin and cognitive science um at a conference

237
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.900
in Seville a few years ago and I was

238
00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.609
impressed by that. And so I asked him to

239
00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:12.469
contribute to the, to the volume so that there

240
00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:16.690
is a bit of awareness um between the two

241
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.960
cups and there's some that kind of that are

242
00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:22.299
not quite in either camp as well. So the,

243
00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:26.140
the guy a still contributes a, a chapter and

244
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.289
he's, he works in philosophy, philosophy of religion, but

245
00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:34.419
he's not particularly interested in Fensin. Um And he

246
00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:37.169
doesn't focus entirely on cognitive science of religion, but

247
00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:40.179
he has a bit of interest in body. Um

248
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.929
Yeah, but unfortunately, I think there, there isn't a

249
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.570
huge amount of interaction between the two. And that

250
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.419
was one of, one of the motivations for the

251
00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:52.309
book was to, to bring people together

252
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:56.130
And by the way, let me just mention uh

253
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.030
some of the names that you mentioned, there are

254
00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:02.099
people that I've had on the show like Justin

255
00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:06.460
Barrett, Robert mcauley and also from your own book,

256
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:09.679
uh I'm releasing an interview with Casper Hesp in

257
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.390
just a few months, it's already recorded, but by

258
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.900
the time we're recording this one, it's not out

259
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:18.059
yet. Uh And also I think that uh on,

260
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.090
on your book you also have in Zolli.

261
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.929
That's right. Yeah. She, she writes a chapter jointly

262
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.640
with Casper Hes. Yeah. So she's from a philosophy

263
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.679
background and he's from a neuroscientific background and they've

264
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.900
written a paper together.

265
00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:36.030
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I have interviews with all

266
00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:38.210
those people on the show if people want to

267
00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:40.270
check them out and also because they might get

268
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.049
a little bit more familiar with some of the

269
00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:46.090
ideas from both sides here.

270
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.869
Sure. Sure. It's a wonderful resource show podcast. I

271
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.950
mean, it's enormous, isn't it the number of interviews

272
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.510
that you've done? There's hundreds of them there and

273
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.200
uh you know, lots and lots of different, interesting

274
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.039
people to, to look, to look into. So, yeah,

275
00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:03.280
I, I'd recommend that people come and come and

276
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:04.339
take a look.

277
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.280
Well, thank you so much. And by the way,

278
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.358
do you think that perhaps one of the reasons

279
00:17:08.368 --> 00:17:11.579
why there's not been lots of interaction between the

280
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.390
cognitive scientists of religion and the Wiens as also,

281
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.160
or would also have to do with them, uh

282
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:24.188
coming into the discussion or into the science of

283
00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:29.129
religion with different theoretical frameworks. Do you think that's

284
00:17:29.139 --> 00:17:30.468
perhaps one of the reasons?

285
00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:35.300
Yeah. Sure. Sure. I mean, you, but I, I

286
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.030
suppose it, in both cases, there's a, there's a

287
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.359
broad spectrum of, of, uh, of opinion. So within

288
00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:46.849
wittenstein studies, wittenstein is quite a dense and difficult

289
00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:50.250
philosopher. And so there's lots and lots of different

290
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.489
interpretations given of, of his work. Um And within

291
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.300
cognitive science of religion, there are obviously differences as

292
00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.729
well. I mean, we've mentioned people like uh mcauley

293
00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:07.140
and Lawson and uh Boy a and um and

294
00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.060
Barrow and I think there's quite a lot of

295
00:18:09.069 --> 00:18:14.060
similarities between their work. Um But there are other

296
00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:17.819
other people working in the cognitive science of religion

297
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:21.560
who I think are probably closer to a vic

298
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:23.619
and Stian kind of approach.

299
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.699
Mhm And what would you say are the main

300
00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:33.199
critiques of contemporary uh cognitive science of religion by

301
00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:37.619
Wittgenstein or, or even cognitive science more broadly?

302
00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:42.489
OK. So uh I mentioned the book by Peter

303
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.420
Hacker and Maxwell Bennett earlier. That was one of

304
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.359
the books that inspired me to uh engage in

305
00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:53.280
this, this project. Um And the central critique that

306
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.939
they make of um cognitive science and work in

307
00:18:57.949 --> 00:19:02.619
neuroscience that they identify from a finian perspective is

308
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.880
that they commit what, what they call the Mereological

309
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:12.630
fallacy. And that's the fallacy of attributing to a

310
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.010
part of a thing, things that only properly apply

311
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.430
to the whole thing. So, in particular, they think

312
00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:29.310
it's a mistake to apply psychological predicates to something

313
00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:33.160
less than a whole, a whole preacher. And so

314
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.949
they're inspired by Wittgenstein's remark, I've got the quote

315
00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:39.229
here. Only if a living human being and what

316
00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:43.709
resembles in brackets behaves like a human being. Can

317
00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:47.099
one say that it has sensations it sees is

318
00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:52.540
blind hears, is deaf, is conscious or unconscious. So,

319
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.040
Wittenstein, there is making a, a remark about what

320
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.959
it makes sense to say. So he, he thinks

321
00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:04.969
it makes sense to, to ascribe psychological properties to

322
00:20:04.979 --> 00:20:07.900
human beings and things that behave like human beings,

323
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.810
but not to some as a stone or something

324
00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:13.790
like that. Um So it makes sense to say

325
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.180
Ricardo has a headache. Um It makes sense to

326
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:23.599
talk about animals having AAA kind of psychological life

327
00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:26.140
if I see my cat walking out into the

328
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.459
garden looking at a bird and following the bird's

329
00:20:29.469 --> 00:20:33.219
movements, chasing it towards a tree. Uh And I

330
00:20:33.229 --> 00:20:35.300
see my cat staring up at the tree, I

331
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.520
think I could appropriately say that my cat thinks

332
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.949
that the bird is up the tree. Um And

333
00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:48.729
that's because the cat exhibits behavior that's similar to

334
00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:52.030
human beings in some ways that it moves towards

335
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.599
things that it's interested in and looks at them.

336
00:20:54.609 --> 00:21:00.250
And uh but what what that means if we

337
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.609
accept what Wittgenstein says, what it means is that

338
00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:07.890
we can't ascribe psychological states to brains or to

339
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.069
parts of brains. And that's something that cognitive scientists

340
00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:15.209
of religion do all of the time. So, uh

341
00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:18.920
uh Pascal Boyer, whose work I discuss in my

342
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.849
chapter, he talks about inference systems in the brain,

343
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:29.560
uh perceiving things, inferring things, understanding things, uh all

344
00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:33.599
kinds of psychological predicates applied to parts of brains.

345
00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:37.160
But of course, parts of brains can't behave in

346
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.020
a manner similar to human beings as my cat

347
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.689
can. And so it doesn't make sense to talk

348
00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:50.400
in that way um about parts of brains. Um

349
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.380
So related to that, I think one problem that

350
00:21:55.989 --> 00:22:00.729
Finian's have with both cognitive scientists of religion and

351
00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:04.689
with the precursors to the cognitive scientists, uh cognitive

352
00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:09.170
science of religion is uh the idea that there's

353
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:16.890
uh an unwarranted intellectualism in their work. So there's

354
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:24.209
this idea that that what they're interested in studying

355
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:30.380
human cognition is hidden uh in people's brains or

356
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.969
in their minds hidden behind behavior in that it

357
00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:39.530
has to be inferred from visible behavior. And so

358
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.180
what you need is uh scientific work in order

359
00:22:44.189 --> 00:22:51.239
to uncover what's hidden. And so, Finian's criticize that

360
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.859
by saying that this is a kind of uh

361
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:58.319
a misconceived picture, a Cartesian picture of the mind

362
00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:01.689
where the mind is something inner and private and

363
00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:07.630
hidden. Uh And it's entirely logically independent of the

364
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.770
behavior of, of human beings. Um So I, I

365
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.530
think they're probably the two central critiques. Um BUT

366
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.910
I mean, there's lots of other things that you

367
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.489
can say as well.

368
00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:23.050
Yeah, of course. And the book gets into many

369
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.290
more of those critiques. Uh But of course, we

370
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.689
don't have time to explore them all here today.

371
00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:33.099
Um But going back to the naturalistic bit that

372
00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:38.119
I mentioned earlier. So, is religion a natural phenomenon

373
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.780
or at least according to the Witkin Stian, do

374
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.329
you think that we should approach religion as a

375
00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:47.619
natural phenomenon or not?

376
00:23:48.229 --> 00:23:50.979
Again, I suspect that this is gonna be an

377
00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:55.130
area where Vick Andys probably disagree. I, I think

378
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.550
um so some finin I think are probably going

379
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:04.630
to be resistant to, to reasons altogether. Um Just

380
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.619
because of the thick Andy and uh uh uh

381
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:17.119
distaste for theory. Um And um so there, there's

382
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:22.130
two philosophers write about naturalism within the book. There's

383
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.640
a chapter by Thomas Carroll and there's a chapter

384
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.069
by Guy Axel and they both look at this

385
00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:33.160
different aspects of, of this question. And I myself,

386
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.829
I'm inclined to give an answer along the lines

387
00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:38.300
that Thomas Carroll does in the book. And it's

388
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.589
a kind of uh it's a bit of a

389
00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:44.479
philosopher's answer to it. And, and that is to

390
00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:47.109
say, well, depends on what you mean by natural

391
00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:50.189
and depends on what you mean by naturalism. Um

392
00:24:50.709 --> 00:24:53.800
And so natural as it's used by us, just

393
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.199
in our ordinary language, I think is used in

394
00:24:57.209 --> 00:24:58.959
a way that has lots and lots of different

395
00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:02.359
contrasts. It's used with different meanings within our ordinary

396
00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:06.369
language and within technical philosophy as well. Naturalism is

397
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:12.760
used in different ways. Um And so in religion,

398
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.069
there's a contrast between the natural and the supernatural.

399
00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:20.400
So you might think about that as being the,

400
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:24.040
the relevant contrast where what you're thinking about as

401
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.109
a uh is a distinction between the world as

402
00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:31.189
it's studied by science and the supernatural realm of

403
00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:38.329
God and angels and spirits. Um There's a discussion

404
00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:40.989
in cognitive science of religion that is discussed in

405
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.060
Guy Axel's chapter where um some cognitive scientists of

406
00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:51.520
religion claim that religion is, is natural. Uh WHEREAS

407
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.180
science isn't natural and what they mean by that

408
00:25:55.189 --> 00:25:59.599
is that religion kind of comes easily to us

409
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.359
given that we're the kind of creatures that we

410
00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:07.109
are. So we've evolved to have a certain kind

411
00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:13.890
of cognitive system and that cognitive system inclines us

412
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.020
towards taking on board, certain things quite easily but

413
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.189
not, not other things. And religion is one of

414
00:26:21.199 --> 00:26:23.739
the things that we take on board quite, quite

415
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.380
easily according to some of the people in the

416
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.030
cognitive science of religion. So there's a book by

417
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.680
Robert mcauley, which you're probably familiar with that, I

418
00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:33.900
think, is it called Religion is Natural and

419
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.250
science? I think, I think it's why religion is

420
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.839
natural and science is not. I think that's the

421
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:39.880
thing.

422
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.469
OK. Um Oh yeah, that's exactly his claim is

423
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:48.819
that um and, and there there are other philosophers

424
00:26:48.829 --> 00:26:52.199
claim similar things. So boy, a make similar arguments

425
00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:57.229
about religious concepts being ones that we that are

426
00:26:57.239 --> 00:27:00.859
easily spread. Um So religion is something that is

427
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.089
eas easily catches on. Whereas science is something that

428
00:27:05.099 --> 00:27:10.099
involves counterintuitive inclusion conclusions, it involves quite a lot

429
00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:13.579
of work. It's not something that comes so naturally

430
00:27:14.069 --> 00:27:19.579
to us. Um But so just carrying on with

431
00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:24.339
the naturalism thing, OK, you might say that there

432
00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:27.020
is a kind of naturalism within the work of

433
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.859
Fensin. So that's a claim that Thomas Carroll makes

434
00:27:30.869 --> 00:27:33.329
in his chapter of the book. And there are,

435
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.069
there are, um there are elements of Wickens Tin's

436
00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:41.719
work that lend support to that interpretation. So there's

437
00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:46.329
a passage that Carol quotes from Wickens Tin's remarks

438
00:27:46.339 --> 00:27:50.260
on Fraser's Golden Bow. Uh So Fensin says the

439
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.900
characteristic feature of the awakening mind of man is

440
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.020
precisely the fact that a phenomenon comes to have

441
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.819
meaning for him. One could almost say that man

442
00:27:59.829 --> 00:28:03.949
is a ceremonial animal. So there, it seems that

443
00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:08.270
Wickens Sein wants to characterize human beings as, as

444
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.180
having something in common that they're, they're inclined towards

445
00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:16.680
ceremonial or ritualistic behavior and that they're inclined to

446
00:28:16.689 --> 00:28:20.040
find meaning in things. The example that he gives

447
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:25.459
is fire, that people see fire and they, you

448
00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:27.489
know, they're struck by it, it makes an impression

449
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.670
on them. Um Iii I in a way that

450
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.900
it, that, that it only could to the kind

451
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.650
of creatures that we are the creatures that, who

452
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.670
live meaningful lives that who see things in a

453
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.969
kind of symbolic way. Um And you might think

454
00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:48.089
that that's something that, that kind of all human

455
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.050
beings share, regardless of whether they're religious or not.

456
00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:58.209
There is this symbolic meaning finding aspect to human

457
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:03.040
beings and uh a ritualistic and ceremonial aspect to

458
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.209
human beings live. So, y you know, there, there

459
00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:10.209
are religious ceremonies that are associated with burying people,

460
00:29:10.219 --> 00:29:13.060
for example, but it isn't only religious people who

461
00:29:13.069 --> 00:29:16.140
engage in ceremonies like that. There's, in fact, I,

462
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.250
I, there's very few people I think who, if

463
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.989
somebody dies, they say just stick them in the

464
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.939
ground, they're, they're dead now. You, you need to

465
00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:27.930
kind of mark the, the passing of somebody in,

466
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:32.790
in some way to honor their memory, to remember

467
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.329
them, you know, these kind of things and, and

468
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.949
people tend to have a, a ceremony built around

469
00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:44.770
that and get together and celebrate people's lives and

470
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.329
um you know, tell stories about people and things

471
00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:59.869
like that. So, so, yeah, there's, there's this naturalistic

472
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.609
interpretation that you might put on Fens Sein's work.

473
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.030
Um But as I said before, if, if naturalism

474
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.339
is taken to mean scientism, then I think that's

475
00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:13.939
certainly not present in, in Wickens Tin's work.

476
00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:18.420
Mhm. Uh So there are two or three other

477
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.250
ISMs that I would like to ask you about

478
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.310
here that some of your co-author also talk about

479
00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:29.290
in the book, uh What about reductionism? I, I

480
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.170
mean, do you think, or would you say that

481
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.260
the cognitive science of religion is, tends to be

482
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:42.109
reductionistic? And if so in what ways would that

483
00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:44.910
be an issue according to the Wittgenstein?

484
00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:50.800
OK. So, first of all, I'll, I'll, I'll just

485
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.849
tell you a little bit about what reductionism is.

486
00:30:53.859 --> 00:30:57.359
So, uh there's a, a definition that I pulled

487
00:30:57.369 --> 00:31:01.180
up from JJ C Smart. Um He says that

488
00:31:01.189 --> 00:31:04.569
X reduces to why? Only if X does not

489
00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:10.400
exist over and above why. Um So there's a,

490
00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:14.989
an ontological spin that you might put on reductionism

491
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.589
where, what you're claiming is that if wine re

492
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:24.750
um if, if X reduces to wine, then X

493
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.859
is nothing, nothing but wine, right? In, in terms

494
00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:34.829
of what exists. Um So you might claim that

495
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.180
uh all of the chemical things that exist uh

496
00:31:42.089 --> 00:31:44.589
um are, are, are basically made, they're made up

497
00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:48.390
of atoms. And so, and atoms are more fundamental.

498
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.459
And so you might say then that chemistry reduces

499
00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:57.849
to, to physics on that basis. Uh ONTOLOGICAL, the

500
00:31:57.859 --> 00:32:00.859
kind of things that exist in chemistry are just

501
00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:03.199
the kind of things that exist in physics and

502
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:08.479
nothing more. But you might also make a AAA

503
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.209
claim about reductionism in explanatory terms. So you might,

504
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.729
you might say, regardless of whether one thing reduces

505
00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:19.849
to another in ontological terms, you might think that

506
00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:22.410
think that things at one level are explainable in

507
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.050
terms of things at another level. So it might

508
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:30.050
be that you claim that chemical reactions, things that

509
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.069
go on in chemistry are explainable in terms of

510
00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:35.900
the property of atoms and the interaction of atoms

511
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.489
they're explainable in, in the terms of atomic physics.

512
00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:44.920
Um So particularly relevant to the discussions in my

513
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:51.069
book is uh reductionism from the mental to the

514
00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:57.589
physical or, or psychological to the neurological. Um And

515
00:32:58.089 --> 00:33:01.250
I, I think that there is a problematic kind

516
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.709
of reductionism present in quite a lot of the

517
00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:08.459
work of cognitive scientists of religion. So, one of

518
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:10.800
the things that I mentioned before was this, this

519
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:16.050
tendency to use the, the word mind and the,

520
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.869
the word brain interchangeably as if they mean exactly

521
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.969
the, the same thing. Um And to talk about

522
00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:28.099
brain processes, perceiving things and understanding things, I, I

523
00:33:28.109 --> 00:33:33.569
think is uh another aspect of that. Um Yeah.

524
00:33:33.709 --> 00:33:37.920
So, so that's, that's how I'd answer that question.

525
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:43.410
So earlier, you've also touched on scientism. You said

526
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.699
basically that Wittgenstein himself and the Wittgenstein ins more

527
00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:51.589
broadly uh take issue with it. But what does

528
00:33:51.599 --> 00:33:53.170
scientism mean?

529
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:56.790
Exactly. So the, the definition that I use in

530
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.099
the book is one taken from Hans Johan Klos

531
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.670
uh Fensin Dictionary. And Haar Klock is uh uh

532
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.438
Fensin scholar. He was my supervisor in reading some

533
00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.639
years ago. Um And I think he, he gives

534
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:16.600
a good definition. Uh So he defines scientism as

535
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:21.688
the imperialist tendencies of scientific thinking that result from

536
00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.010
the idea that science is the measure of all

537
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.699
things. Um And so as you say, this is

538
00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:30.668
something that you find within the work of Fensin

539
00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.350
himself. I've got the blue book here. And so

540
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.570
in the blue book, Fensin talks about our craving

541
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.759
for generality. And uh on page 18 of the

542
00:34:41.768 --> 00:34:43.688
blue book, if anyone wants to look it up,

543
00:34:44.197 --> 00:34:49.320
um Wittgenstein says our craving for genera, uh our

544
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.500
craving for generality has another main source, our preoccupation

545
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.580
with the method of science. I mean, the method

546
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.610
of reducing the explanation of natural phenomena to the

547
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.010
smallest possible number of primitive natural laws. Philosophers constantly

548
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.739
see the method of science before their eyes and

549
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.860
are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in

550
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.010
the way science does. This tendency is the real

551
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.429
source of metaphysics and leads the philosopher into complete

552
00:35:17.439 --> 00:35:24.330
darkness. Sosin there is clearly opposed to philosophers conceiving

553
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.610
their own work as being uh something akin to

554
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.810
work in the natural sciences. And he doesn't think

555
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.709
that you should import methods of the natural sciences

556
00:35:34.719 --> 00:35:38.169
into philosophy. He thinks that's a mistake because he

557
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:44.750
thinks philosophical problems are essentially uh grammatical or conceptual

558
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.879
problems. And that what philosophy aims at is understanding

559
00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:55.290
through um to getting to grips with our our

560
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.969
concept. But the the problems that philosophers fall into,

561
00:35:58.979 --> 00:36:02.989
they fall into as a result of of misusing

562
00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:07.939
certain terms that crop up in philosophical problems. So

563
00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:12.270
it might be knowledge that gets misused, say or

564
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.340
being. Um And what the philosopher needs to do

565
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.370
is to look carefully at how these terms are

566
00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:24.149
ordinarily and correctly used contrast that with the way

567
00:36:24.159 --> 00:36:28.199
that the philosopher is using them and point out

568
00:36:28.209 --> 00:36:31.679
that the philosopher is, is misusing them in some

569
00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:35.010
way according to our, the, the the ordinary rules

570
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.850
for their use. And so they're not talking as

571
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.290
we ordinarily do about knowledge or about being there

572
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:45.020
talking in some other peculiar philosophical way about things

573
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.939
and that's why they get into a mud. Um

574
00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:54.590
So you, there's within Wickens Sein's work, there's a

575
00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.129
rejection of scientism in philosophy. Um But of course,

576
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.899
scientism isn't something that is just a uh a

577
00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:09.610
problem identified by Vian. It's something that the cognitive

578
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.989
scientists of religion themselves talk about. They say that

579
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.189
they're wary of scientism that you can't construe all

580
00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:22.590
of the disciplines involved in cognitive science of religion

581
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.840
as being natural scientific ones. Um And recently, so

582
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.219
as you say, I've been um involved recently in

583
00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:34.929
a, a project on epistemic injustice and I've been

584
00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:38.010
reading a book by Jonathan Khan Race on the

585
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.399
brain. I don't know if you've come across that

586
00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:48.790
and he's a legal scholar and he um he

587
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.600
looks at the way in which legal scholars have

588
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.719
looked at scientific work on unconscious bias uh as

589
00:37:59.729 --> 00:38:05.520
a way of resolving legal disputes about racism. And

590
00:38:05.959 --> 00:38:08.620
um there's a bit of a tendency amongst these

591
00:38:08.629 --> 00:38:12.280
legal scholars who look to the the the implicit

592
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:23.290
bias um literature, to privileged science over other disciplines.

593
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.070
So that there's, he thinks there's a kind of

594
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.229
scientism present there. And why is that problematic? Well,

595
00:38:30.939 --> 00:38:41.679
because there are, there are psychological or neurophysiological aspects

596
00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:45.540
perhaps to understanding racism, but that's not the whole

597
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:50.649
story. So part of the story is uh about

598
00:38:50.659 --> 00:38:53.899
the ways in which society is structured about power

599
00:38:53.909 --> 00:38:58.969
relations, um about the way in which prejudice is

600
00:38:58.979 --> 00:39:04.350
embedded within institutions. And so he objects to thinking

601
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.320
about racism just in terms of these biases that

602
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:14.040
people have as individuals. Um And so there, I

603
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.540
think he's identifying a kind of scientism as being

604
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:23.389
problematic within legal studies. Um A, a privilege uh

605
00:39:23.399 --> 00:39:30.739
an unwarranted privileging of science. Um Are you a

606
00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:36.419
humanistic disciplines? Right? Social scientific disciplines.

607
00:39:36.709 --> 00:39:41.120
Mhm So just to cover one more is here

608
00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:45.500
before we get into what you say or what

609
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:49.860
you write about in your chapter on Pascal Boyer's

610
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.050
understanding of religion. Um There's also you also talk

611
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.000
about you, I, I mean, by you, I mean,

612
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.610
you and your co-author also talk about cultural relativism

613
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.360
in the book. And you claim that um the

614
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:07.979
cognitive science of religion might have been a response

615
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:11.379
to cultural relativism in a way. So could you

616
00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:14.040
explain that in what ways might it have been

617
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.840
a response to that?

618
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:24.020
Yeah. So um relativism looks at differences between cognitive

619
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:30.590
frameworks uh between the values and the practices of

620
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.830
different societies. So the, the focus of cultural relativism

621
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.500
is gonna be on cultural differences, differences in values

622
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.580
and perhaps the, the worry that these might be

623
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.919
incommensurable, you know, that there, that there are uh

624
00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:50.040
uh conceptual differences in the way that people conceive

625
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.729
of time or of color or, uh I, I

626
00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:59.510
suppose, particularly significantly or uh of values. Um And

627
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.790
that there's no way then to resolve differences between

628
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.860
the, the different cultures because they have in incommensurable

629
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:15.459
concepts or incommensurable values. Um COGNITIVE science of religion,

630
00:41:15.469 --> 00:41:19.500
on the other hand, because the focus is on

631
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.280
the way in which human beings as a whole

632
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:32.229
have developed evolutionarily and common uh common cognitive features

633
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:35.669
of human beings that result from that, that common

634
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:41.820
evolutionary heritage. There's, there's a an emphasis on what

635
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:44.100
human beings have in common as opposed to what,

636
00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:49.290
what divides them. So, so cognitive science of religion

637
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:55.820
I think is, is uh sits in contrast to

638
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.219
cultural relativism in that way. So human beings have

639
00:41:59.229 --> 00:42:04.580
in common, for example, that they uh they tend

640
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.129
to over detect agency. So this is one of

641
00:42:07.139 --> 00:42:10.989
the things that gets disgusting, cognitive science of religion,

642
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.399
quite a lot that cognitive uh that human beings

643
00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:21.409
because they evolved to uh prey upon pre and

644
00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:26.080
because human beings were predating, they needed to look

645
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.530
out for other agents in their environment, they needed

646
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.469
to look out for food sources and they needed

647
00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:34.199
to also look out for things that might kill

648
00:42:34.209 --> 00:42:34.530
them.

649
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.610
I think that there, you're referring to what the

650
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.929
cognitive scientists of religion called the hyperactive agency detection

651
00:42:42.939 --> 00:42:43.649
device.

652
00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:45.629
Yeah, that, so that's one of the ways of

653
00:42:45.639 --> 00:42:48.610
referring to it. Yeah. So the, the hyperactive bit

654
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.469
there is that what human beings tend to do

655
00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:57.479
is they tend to overestimate the agency in their

656
00:42:57.489 --> 00:43:00.979
environment according to cognitive scientists of religion because of

657
00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:03.949
the way they've evolved because it's beneficial to human

658
00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:08.909
beings to do that because it's better to think

659
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:11.060
that there's an agent in your vicinity and there

660
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.419
isn't rather than not to identify an agent in

661
00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:18.709
your environment that might kill you or might be

662
00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:25.070
a source of food. Um So human evolutionary history

663
00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:29.850
explains why humans tend to think that there are

664
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.620
more agents in their environment than there in fact

665
00:43:32.629 --> 00:43:35.429
are. And they take that to be an explanation

666
00:43:35.439 --> 00:43:39.300
for things like seeing spirits or belief in God

667
00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:41.790
or. Mhm.

668
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.820
Yeah. I, I mean, they try to many times

669
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.300
boil it down to evolve the adaptations in terms

670
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.750
of them having increased our uh fitness,

671
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.250
right?

672
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.979
It's something, uh uh they use terms like that,

673
00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:02.090
right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so there's, there's things

674
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.179
that have aided us in our survival throughout the

675
00:44:05.189 --> 00:44:09.399
evolutionary history that have kind of structured the way

676
00:44:09.409 --> 00:44:14.459
we are cognitively and um that's something that's common

677
00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:19.030
to human beings in general. Um So within Wickens

678
00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:22.310
tin's work as well, there's, as I've already said,

679
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.699
there's some emphasis on, on common features of human

680
00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:32.709
beings. So there, there is this uh common tendency

681
00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:37.679
towards finding meaning in things and to uh towards

682
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:44.040
ceremony. But there is also present within Wittgenstein hints

683
00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.580
of relativism. So some people have found relativism within

684
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:53.850
Wittgenstein's work. So there is of course, within Wittenstein,

685
00:44:54.219 --> 00:44:58.419
uh the an emphasis on the point that our

686
00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:01.449
con our concepts might have been different than they

687
00:45:01.459 --> 00:45:06.070
in fact are. So uh he likes to imagine

688
00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:13.590
circumstances in which um in, in which things in

689
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.520
the world are different than they in fact are.

690
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.250
And that, and that impacts upon the way in

691
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.189
which people categorize things in the, in the world.

692
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.870
Um So there's, there's uh uh this emphasis on

693
00:45:29.879 --> 00:45:33.419
the possibility of human beings having different concepts. And

694
00:45:33.429 --> 00:45:36.030
of course, you know, it's an empirical fact as

695
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.260
well that human beings throughout the world do conceptualize

696
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.290
things in different ways to each other in certain

697
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:50.659
ways. Um There's also within Wittgenstein, this um possibility

698
00:45:50.669 --> 00:45:53.340
that people might have different hinges, what he calls

699
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:58.639
hinges. Um So what he's referring to there is

700
00:45:58.649 --> 00:46:02.280
that people might have different um certainties that they

701
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:06.580
might be certain of quite different things. And sometimes

702
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.419
Fensin puts a, puts this into a, a kind

703
00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:15.959
of religious way of thinking about things. So he,

704
00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:19.479
he counter poses uh the way in which a

705
00:46:19.489 --> 00:46:22.449
Catholic might think about things to the way in

706
00:46:22.459 --> 00:46:26.340
which a non-catholic might think about things. So he

707
00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.040
he takes it that it's a hinge or a

708
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:34.250
certainty amongst most non-catholics that people have two parents.

709
00:46:35.129 --> 00:46:38.989
But he says Catholics think that Jesus only had

710
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.959
one human parent and he, he says, uh and

711
00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:46.510
others might think that there are humans with no

712
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:52.590
parents at all. Um So there's, there's this worry

713
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.790
of, of, of relat rela relativism that arises out

714
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.510
of the fact that human beings might have different

715
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.229
fundamental religious beliefs, different fundamental values. Um These are

716
00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:12.760
all things that fensin kind of acknowledges um in,

717
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:17.300
in uncertainty and which might lead us to, to

718
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.350
towards a kind of relativism. So if we think

719
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.429
that these fundamental certainties aren't something that we can

720
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:32.020
uh discuss rationally and come to a resolution of

721
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:36.929
the problem rationally, then you might think that there's,

722
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:41.189
there's a problem uh of relativism there that, that,

723
00:47:41.489 --> 00:47:45.510
that one set of hinges can't be justified relative

724
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.489
to another set of hinges.

725
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:53.199
Mhm. So let's get then into your chapter on

726
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.080
Pascal Boyer. So uh how would you summarize his

727
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:02.000
views? I mean, the way by which he understands

728
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:03.600
and approaches religion.

729
00:48:04.659 --> 00:48:09.050
Um So we've already mentioned these, these systems in

730
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.399
the brain and um the inference systems, what he

731
00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:17.919
calls inference systems are, are absolutely central to the

732
00:48:17.929 --> 00:48:22.179
way that Pascal Boyer understands religion. So he thinks

733
00:48:22.189 --> 00:48:25.489
that we have this agency detection system, the hyper

734
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:31.169
hyperactive agency detective system that you were talking about.

735
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.780
He also thinks that we have what he calls

736
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.479
uh an intuitive physics system. Um He thinks that

737
00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:41.820
we have something called an intuitive psychology system which

738
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.919
makes inferences about the thoughts and feelings and beliefs

739
00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:49.419
of other people. So we have all these things,

740
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.899
computational processes going on in our brain inferences going

741
00:48:54.909 --> 00:49:02.899
on um that are, that are um activated by

742
00:49:03.929 --> 00:49:08.550
stimuli in our environment. So, um the intuitive physics

743
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.030
system might be stimulated by seeing one billiard ball

744
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.399
hit another billiard ball. Um TO take an, I

745
00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:20.250
think that's an example that Boyer himself uses, but

746
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.600
it's an example that goes back to hume. Um

747
00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:27.939
And in, in a sort of human fashion, Boyer

748
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.800
says that what then happens is that we then

749
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.000
infer that there's a cause present between the two

750
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:38.050
events, the event of one billiard ball approaching the

751
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.409
other billiard ball and then the other billiard ball

752
00:49:40.419 --> 00:49:44.560
moving. But the, the, the intuitive physics system in

753
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.030
our mind infers that there is a cause present

754
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.050
when it's stimulated by um seeing these, these events

755
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.860
in our environment. Um So Boyer, he thinks we've

756
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:03.300
got these, these various um systems and I've got

757
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.969
a quote from Boyer here. Let's see if I

758
00:50:04.979 --> 00:50:10.179
can find it. Yeah. So these inference systems, they're

759
00:50:10.189 --> 00:50:12.489
made to do a huge amount of work in

760
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.820
Boyer's book. I th I think basically they do

761
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:19.580
all of the work really in, in explaining religion.

762
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:22.939
So here's a quote from Boyer. He says the

763
00:50:22.949 --> 00:50:26.020
activation of a panoply of systems in the mind

764
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:30.139
explains the very existence of religious concepts and their

765
00:50:30.149 --> 00:50:33.489
cultural success and the fact that people find them

766
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.669
plausible and the fact that not everyone finds them.

767
00:50:36.679 --> 00:50:40.389
So and the way religion appeared in human history

768
00:50:40.489 --> 00:50:43.770
and its persistence in the context of modern science.

769
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.719
So the ba basically wants to say that the

770
00:50:48.729 --> 00:50:51.419
the discovery of these various systems in the brain

771
00:50:51.429 --> 00:50:55.270
cognitive science, it can explain, you know, a huge

772
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.260
amount of things uh that we want to understand

773
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.500
about religion. It can explain the spread of religious

774
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.739
concepts. It can explain why people engage in certain

775
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:10.169
religious rituals. Um Yeah. So I I think in

776
00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:15.729
summary, that's, that's Pascal Fer's Boyer's theories that, that

777
00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:20.030
we have these inference systems in our brain. And

778
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.320
that if, if we look at the results of

779
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.320
studies in psychology and in cognitive science, they can

780
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:31.830
inform the way in which we understand religion. Mhm

781
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.639
Yeah. By, by the way, also for the audience,

782
00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:37.610
I have a handful of interviews, one of them

783
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.320
with Pascal Boyer himself, by the way, where we

784
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:45.459
talk about what people in psych developmental psychology and

785
00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:49.750
some areas of anthropology refer to as core knowledge

786
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.270
that is intuitive physics, intuitive biology and intuitive psychology

787
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.360
sometimes in instead of intuitive, they was they use

788
00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:01.060
the word folk, folk physics, folk biology, folk psychology.

789
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.939
Uh But yeah, I have a handful of interviews

790
00:52:03.949 --> 00:52:08.699
with people on the show evolutionary psychologists, anthropologists about

791
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:11.780
that. So um and And so from a Wittgenstein

792
00:52:12.149 --> 00:52:17.340
in perspective, what would be your critique here of

793
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:21.050
those in or that that approach based on influence

794
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:21.889
systems?

795
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:27.989
Uh So, first of all, there's the, the criticism

796
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.370
that I've already mentioned coming from Vick and Stian

797
00:52:30.379 --> 00:52:33.620
philosophers. So the first criticism that we might make

798
00:52:33.629 --> 00:52:37.699
of Boyer is that what Boyer is doing here

799
00:52:37.709 --> 00:52:40.620
in talking about inference systems in the way that

800
00:52:40.629 --> 00:52:46.800
he does is misusing psychological concepts. So uh Boyer

801
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.899
doesn't only say that these inference systems can explain

802
00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:55.360
these various aspects of religion. He all of the

803
00:52:55.370 --> 00:53:02.270
time, he's attributing psychological um states to these infant

804
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.120
systems. So he says that the the inference systems

805
00:53:05.129 --> 00:53:10.310
perceive things in our environment uh that they understand

806
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.179
things that they interpret things, um obviously being called

807
00:53:14.189 --> 00:53:18.780
infer systems, they're inferring things all the time. Um

808
00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:21.050
And so these are the kind of things that

809
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.840
we would ordinarily attribute to human beings, right? The

810
00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:30.449
human beings compute that they infer that they perceive.

811
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:37.429
Um And so if fensin is right, that psychological

812
00:53:37.439 --> 00:53:42.570
expressions are only properly properly uh applied to human

813
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:46.750
beings and creatures that behave like human beings, then

814
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.989
Pascal Boyer has gotta be wrong to attribute psychological

815
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.219
states to infer systems in the brain or to

816
00:53:54.229 --> 00:53:57.750
any part of the brain because the brain can't

817
00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:05.820
behave like a human being. Um So that criticism

818
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:09.959
of Boyer is connected with uh another criticism that

819
00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:14.810
we might make. So as Fensin notes, there are

820
00:54:14.889 --> 00:54:22.080
behavioral criteria that are associated with psychological concepts. So

821
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.040
there's the remark I've already quoted to you where

822
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.060
he talks about psychological concepts being attributable to human

823
00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.719
beings and creatures that behave like them. Uh There's

824
00:54:31.729 --> 00:54:34.610
other passages within his work where he talks about

825
00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:38.919
how it is that we learn concepts like pain

826
00:54:39.199 --> 00:54:42.939
and how it is that we attribute paying to

827
00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:47.830
other people. And his answer to that is that

828
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:54.500
there are behavioral criteria by which we um attribute

829
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.250
those states to, to other people. So things like

830
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:02.139
crying and wincing and saying I'm in pain, these

831
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:05.889
kind of behaviors, they're not just kind of accidentally

832
00:55:05.899 --> 00:55:10.459
or contingently associated with the, the mental state. In

833
00:55:10.469 --> 00:55:15.350
question, there's a, a logical connection between those behaviors

834
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.090
and, and the pain. Um And that logical connection

835
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.600
is obscured by the fact that people can, people

836
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:33.070
can um suppress those behaviors. So people need not

837
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.919
behave in that way when they're in pain. Pe

838
00:55:35.929 --> 00:55:39.389
people need not give any sign that they're in

839
00:55:39.399 --> 00:55:42.989
pain. Uh OR they might pretend to be in

840
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.820
pain when they're not. Uh OR yeah, they, they,

841
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.010
they might hide their plane for one reason or

842
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.300
another. So, so there, there is sometimes a mismatch

843
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:59.600
between what's going on, be behaviorally and what's going

844
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:03.830
on psychologically. And I think that that mismatch between

845
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.620
the behavior and the psychology is what has led

846
00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:10.389
some people to think that there's no logical connection

847
00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:13.659
between the two at all. And that's Boyer's view,

848
00:56:13.669 --> 00:56:17.850
right? So Boyer thinks that the internal realm is

849
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:24.020
entirely logically disconnected from the behavioral realm. It's, it's

850
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:28.459
hidden behind behavior rather than the behavior being criteria

851
00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:34.760
for the, the psychological stuff. Um So a second

852
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:38.149
criticism that you might then make in connection with

853
00:56:38.159 --> 00:56:43.409
that is, is the boy a holds a kind

854
00:56:43.419 --> 00:56:48.979
of Cartesian view of the mind. So, so although

855
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.260
he wouldn't accept that label, he wouldn't think of

856
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.459
himself as being Cartesian. Um So he, he doesn't

857
00:56:54.469 --> 00:56:59.139
believe in the, in the Cartesian view that there's

858
00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:01.629
a uh a material substance and a and an

859
00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:05.139
immaterial substance. That's not, that's not what I'm referring

860
00:57:05.149 --> 00:57:07.389
to here, but what he does believe and that

861
00:57:07.399 --> 00:57:10.500
they, that, that Descartes believes is that there is

862
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:14.570
a, a logical disconnection between the mental or the

863
00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:19.110
psychological realm and the physical and the behavioral realm.

864
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.620
Um And that what, what we have to do

865
00:57:22.629 --> 00:57:27.020
because thoughts are hidden, we have to infer psychology

866
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:32.030
from their behavior. So there's a kind, there's a

867
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.790
kind of Cartesian aspect to Boyer's work and lots

868
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.780
of other work in the cognitive science of religion,

869
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:42.389
which I think is, is problematic um from a

870
00:57:42.399 --> 00:57:47.110
victim Stian perspective. Um Yeah. OK. I'll leave it

871
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.820
at that for now. OK.

872
00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:51.840
Uh And I guess that also sort of related

873
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:55.919
to what you talked about when you mentioned intuitive

874
00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:59.879
physics, biology and psychology, there's also these very common

875
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.459
idea among researchers in the cognitive science of religion

876
00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:08.439
about uh theory of mind or mind reading and

877
00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:13.080
how and how these sort of Western model of

878
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:17.189
the mind uh w would, would also apply cross

879
00:58:17.199 --> 00:58:22.260
culture across all cultures. So, uh I, I mean,

880
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.840
from a Wittgenstein in perspective, uh what do you

881
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:29.919
think about that? And if it doesn't apply cross

882
00:58:29.929 --> 00:58:33.979
culturally, what would be the implications for the study

883
00:58:33.989 --> 00:58:34.820
of religion?

884
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.800
Uh So, so I think this is a further

885
00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.209
criticism that you can make of Boyer's work actually

886
00:58:41.219 --> 00:58:44.479
is that there's a kind of scientism present in,

887
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.810
in Boyer's work. So what it means that this

888
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.510
division, this strict division between the inner and the

889
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.530
outer, it means that there's always work to be

890
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.520
done in uncovering what's going on in the inner

891
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.879
realm. And so this is where science comes in,

892
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:07.889
right? So, so uh the idea then is that

893
00:59:07.939 --> 00:59:12.449
cognitive science is needed to uncover what is hidden.

894
00:59:13.219 --> 00:59:17.689
Um And that's also related to the, the idea

895
00:59:17.699 --> 00:59:21.260
of a theory of mind, I think um the

896
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:24.949
idea that there, that there's something theoretical about the

897
00:59:24.959 --> 00:59:31.939
way in which we attribute uh psychological states, um

898
00:59:31.949 --> 00:59:36.919
beliefs, pains, et cetera to, to our, to our

899
00:59:36.929 --> 00:59:41.419
fellow human beings. Um So I, I think as

900
00:59:41.429 --> 00:59:44.020
a vic and Stian, I'm very wary of this

901
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.649
talk of theory of mind at all. I, I

902
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:48.889
think it's a, it's a bit of an uh

903
00:59:48.899 --> 00:59:51.889
an odd way of talking about things. I don't

904
00:59:51.899 --> 00:59:56.840
think babies or chimpanzees or, or adult human beings

905
00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:59.830
have a, have a theory of mind unless they're

906
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.530
doing psychology, right? Um Just in, in just attributing

907
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.169
mental states to other people, that's a perfectly ordinary

908
01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:21.100
everyday non theoretical activity. But the, the, the reason

909
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.199
that the reason that people think of it as

910
01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:27.159
something theoretical I think is that they're, they're holding

911
01:00:27.169 --> 01:00:30.679
on to this kind of Cartesian picture where the

912
01:00:30.689 --> 01:00:34.310
inner is something hidden that has to be unburied

913
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.500
by science. It's a bit like you have to

914
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:42.459
uh um observe uh certain things in order to

915
01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:45.409
detect what's going on with atoms that are hidden.

916
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.820
The, the, the psychological is conceived in a similar

917
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.459
way to, to the atomic. And I think that's

918
01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:57.129
a mistaken analogy that the psychological isn't analogous analogous

919
01:00:57.139 --> 01:01:02.830
to the, to the atomic in that way. Mhm

920
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.959
So, uh I mean, of course, as I said,

921
01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:09.389
there are many other critiques that you and your

922
01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.219
co-author is explore in your book. But now for

923
01:01:12.229 --> 01:01:14.800
the last part of our conversation, I would like

924
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.840
to ask you actually about a new project that

925
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:23.635
you working on right now on epistemic injustice. Uh

926
01:01:23.645 --> 01:01:25.465
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

927
01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:27.165
And, and by the way, just to introduce the

928
01:01:27.175 --> 01:01:30.264
topic to uh for the audience, uh I mean,

929
01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:34.274
what is epistemic injustice exactly?

930
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.270
OK. So the, the coin uh the, the, the

931
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.070
term was coined by uh Miranda Fricker in her

932
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.449
book, uh epistemic injustice, which has become a bit

933
01:01:45.459 --> 01:01:47.800
of a, a classic in the field that's inspired

934
01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:50.820
a lot of the work in the field. Um

935
01:01:51.669 --> 01:01:57.090
And she distinguishes two kinds of epistemic injustice, two

936
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:02.459
basic kinds of epistemic injustice, uh testimonial, injustice, and

937
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:09.389
hermeneutic injustice. So, what she's talking about are injustices

938
01:02:09.399 --> 01:02:14.350
that are connected with uh human beings as being

939
01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:19.120
knowing and believing creatures. So that's the epi epistemic

940
01:02:19.129 --> 01:02:22.520
side of things, right? So, epistemology is this the

941
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.739
theory of knowledge or the study of knowledge, belief

942
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:33.050
and justification. Um So, epistemic injustice is injustice in

943
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.530
the area of uh epistemic things. So, injustice in

944
01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:43.629
relation to knowledge and belief and justification. Um So,

945
01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:50.219
in particular, um testimonial injustice that Friar talks about

946
01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:55.370
this is the injustice of somebody offering up testimony

947
01:02:56.229 --> 01:03:02.659
and not being believed due to a prejudice that

948
01:03:02.669 --> 01:03:06.370
the hearer has. And so the, the speaker here,

949
01:03:06.379 --> 01:03:12.350
the person giving their testimony um is trying to

950
01:03:12.659 --> 01:03:17.239
convey some information to somebody else. They're perfectly believable.

951
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:21.260
There's no reason to disbelieve them, let's imagine. But

952
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:25.860
the, the heer nonetheless does not believe them because

953
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:29.120
they're prejudiced in some way because they're racist or

954
01:03:29.129 --> 01:03:33.040
because they're sexist uh or because they're homophobic, they

955
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.679
think that the person in question uh you know,

956
01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:41.949
is, isn't trustworthy on this issue when in fact,

957
01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:43.750
they have no reason to think that this person

958
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.419
is untrustworthy. So, in that case, uh an epistemic

959
01:03:47.429 --> 01:03:49.889
injustice has been done to that person. They're a

960
01:03:49.899 --> 01:03:54.790
victim of prejudice, but they're also a victim of

961
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.560
prejudice in their capacity as a, as a knower

962
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:00.850
and as a as somebody offering up knowledge to

963
01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.739
other people. Um So the other form of epistemic

964
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:10.340
injustice that Miranda Fricker talks about is hermeneutic injustice.

965
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.699
And that's the injustice of people not having the

966
01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:24.370
hermeneutic resources uh to, to understand their own oppressed

967
01:04:24.379 --> 01:04:28.399
condition. So the example that she gives is the

968
01:04:28.409 --> 01:04:32.889
example of sexual harassment. So the concept of sexual

969
01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:38.360
harassment is a relatively recent one. And until uh

970
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.409
women got together and discussed what was happening to

971
01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:45.120
them in the workplace, the the abuses that they

972
01:04:45.129 --> 01:04:49.320
were facing until they started to conceptualize it as

973
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:55.310
sexual harassment, they didn't fully understand their own uh

974
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:58.389
oppression that the, the, the, the way in which

975
01:04:58.399 --> 01:05:04.199
they are being harassed. Um So there, there's, there

976
01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:09.620
are gaps in the conceptual resources in society. Uh

977
01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:17.120
The hermeneutic resources more generally it that are unfavorable

978
01:05:17.129 --> 01:05:22.739
to certain people um that she points to so

979
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.270
that they're the two forms of epistemic injustice that

980
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.129
Miranda Fricker talks about. Um BUT you might think

981
01:05:29.139 --> 01:05:33.459
that it's broader than that, right? So Fria doesn't

982
01:05:33.469 --> 01:05:38.260
own epistemic injustice and I mean, it's quite natural

983
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.610
to expand the term in certain ways. So if,

984
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.760
if, if what we're talking about is injustices done

985
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:48.679
to people in their capacity as, as know as

986
01:05:48.689 --> 01:05:51.780
then we might think that there's various other forms

987
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:56.800
of um epistemic injustice. So one form of epistemic

988
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:59.949
injustice that people have pointed to is that oppressed

989
01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:06.229
people might in fact have better hermeneutic resources than

990
01:06:06.239 --> 01:06:10.209
their oppressors for understanding their situation. So it might

991
01:06:10.219 --> 01:06:14.449
be that oppressed people in virtue of being oppressed

992
01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.409
have a better understanding of their condition than the

993
01:06:17.419 --> 01:06:23.340
people that are oppressing them. Um But nonetheless, the

994
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:29.590
conceptual uh resources that are available within society don't

995
01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.439
reflect uh don't reflect that. So there are gaps

996
01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:39.479
in the conceptual resources of the people that aren't

997
01:06:39.489 --> 01:06:42.520
oppressed in that in that way. And so the

998
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:45.590
people that aren't doing uh that aren't oppressed or

999
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.459
perhaps the people doing the oppressing, they're the ones

1000
01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:52.540
that have gaps in their conceptual resources. And, and

1001
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:59.350
that's a problem for the oppressed because people within

1002
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.270
the society don't understand their oppression. So it might

1003
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.770
be that, I don't know, say black people have

1004
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.649
a very good understanding of the ways in which

1005
01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:13.270
they're being oppressed. But other people in that society

1006
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.750
don't have the conceptual resources that, that the oppressed

1007
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.600
people do. And that is therefore a problem for

1008
01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:27.830
the, the people that are oppressed because they try

1009
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.189
to talk to other people about their oppression and

1010
01:07:31.199 --> 01:07:34.149
don't get understood as a result of that. Or,

1011
01:07:34.159 --> 01:07:36.449
or it might be that the the misunderstanding is

1012
01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:39.649
wilful, right? So it might be that the people

1013
01:07:39.659 --> 01:07:45.959
doing the oppressing recognize that, that there are certain

1014
01:07:45.969 --> 01:07:49.929
gaps in the collective hermeneutic resources that are disadvantaged

1015
01:07:49.939 --> 01:07:54.659
people and they might deliberately obscure those her hermeneutic

1016
01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:58.419
resources. Uh I think I've rambled enough there, but

1017
01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:00.199
I just want to give, I give an impression

1018
01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.949
of how you might broaden things out. So, you

1019
01:08:02.959 --> 01:08:04.800
know, there's all kinds of directions that you might

1020
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:09.959
go off, go off in uh discussing epistemic injustice.

1021
01:08:09.969 --> 01:08:12.739
Uh If you're thinking about justice in the area

1022
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:17.220
of um people being oppressed in their capacity, as

1023
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:20.729
know, as then you're thinking about epistemic injustice and

1024
01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.520
that might take a, a number of different forms,

1025
01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:27.729
right? So just one more question then uh here

1026
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.009
in the particular case of epistemic injustice, you're also

1027
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:36.229
bringing into the table. Uh Wittgenstein and his philosophy,

1028
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.120
right? Particularly I guess his philosophy of language if

1029
01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:43.100
I understand it correctly. So in what way do

1030
01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:47.890
the Wittgenstein approach here also apply or be relevant

1031
01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:50.729
to discussions of epistemic injustice.

1032
01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:55.100
OK. So I, I mean, I've only just started

1033
01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:57.359
this project myself. So I, I haven't actually written

1034
01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:00.410
a huge amount on how this might, how this

1035
01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:02.799
might work out. But in, in very sort of

1036
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:08.419
broad brushstroke terms, Fensin, as I say, he conceived

1037
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:13.109
our philosophy as being concerned with uh conceptual or

1038
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.939
grammatical problems. And given that a lot of the

1039
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:23.519
discussions within uh the field of epistemic injustice are

1040
01:09:23.528 --> 01:09:29.368
philosophical um and conceptual that it's clear that Wittgenstein's

1041
01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:32.488
philosophy is going to have an application then. Um

1042
01:09:32.688 --> 01:09:35.118
SO one of the things that I started looking

1043
01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:39.548
at is uh the question of the relationship between

1044
01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:42.988
knowledge and certainty. So this is something that Fricker

1045
01:09:42.999 --> 01:09:47.148
raises in her book, Epistemic Injustice. She wonders whether

1046
01:09:47.158 --> 01:09:51.198
there's a confidence condition to knowledge, whether whether people

1047
01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:54.520
have to be confident of what whatever it is

1048
01:09:54.529 --> 01:09:56.029
that they know in order to be said to

1049
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.169
know or whether they have to be certain uh

1050
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:04.209
in order to know. Um And obviously, Fensin S

1051
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.970
work is useful in reflecting on the relationships between

1052
01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:12.459
knowledge and certainty. He wrote on certainty, which contains,

1053
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:19.250
yeah, you know, lots of interesting reflections um on

1054
01:10:19.259 --> 01:10:22.330
how exactly knowledge and certainty are related to each

1055
01:10:22.339 --> 01:10:26.140
other and how exactly we are to understand knowledge

1056
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:31.350
and certainty. So I think that's just one example

1057
01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:36.439
of how Fensin might be useful in uh in

1058
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:39.549
understanding issues of epistemic injustice. Um I mean, I'm,

1059
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.430
I'm not the first to do this. So, Fensin

1060
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.250
S work has been used in discussions of uh

1061
01:10:45.259 --> 01:10:49.120
epistemic injustice already. So, one of the ways in

1062
01:10:49.129 --> 01:10:52.209
which it's been used is to, to think about

1063
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.819
the potential for um Fensin S understanding of hinge

1064
01:10:55.830 --> 01:11:01.649
epistemology um to be used in discussions of epistemic

1065
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.799
injustice. Um Yeah. And there, there were discussions of

1066
01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:12.220
fensin and relativism and uh and epistemic uh epistemic

1067
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:16.910
injustice, lots and lots of different ways in which

1068
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.399
you might go off.

1069
01:11:19.529 --> 01:11:22.990
Great. So, um just to mention your book again,

1070
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.149
it's Wittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of religion, interpreting

1071
01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.410
human nature and the mind. I'm leaving a link

1072
01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.290
to it in the description of the interview and

1073
01:11:32.299 --> 01:11:35.740

1074
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.020
book, would you like to tell people where they
