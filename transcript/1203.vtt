00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.110
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.069
today I'm joined by Nicole Carley. She's a health

4
00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.590
and science journalist, and today we're talking about her

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.068
book Your Brain on Altruism, The Power of Connection

6
00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:20.190
and Community during Times of Crisis. So, Nicole, welcome

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.930
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.969
Thank you, Ricardo. I'm so happy to be here.

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.989
Right, so I mean, perhaps tell us first, what

10
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.810
is the main argument of your book?

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.849
Mhm. Yes, so the main argument of my book

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.869
is that when we think about self-care, we often

13
00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:46.029
think about like doing something for yourself in a,

14
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.220
you know, solitary way, but actually through Nearly like

15
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.380
8 years of research, interviewing psychologists, neuroscientists, um, sociologists,

16
00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:00.419
um, all different types of scientists, I found that

17
00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:03.979
actually the act of altruism, being of service to

18
00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.860
others can help you build resilience. And in other

19
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.010
words, it can be another form of self-care. Um,

20
00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:15.540
AND specifically, it can help, it kind of be

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.519
like the antidote to loneliness and anxiety.

22
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.050
And what is it that you call the self-care

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.190
industrial complex, and what does it tell people in

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.269
terms of how they should deal with their personal

25
00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.970
crisis?

26
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:37.760
Mhm. Yes, so the self-care industrial complex is basically

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.190
big corporations trying to sell us the idea that

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.389
in order to feel good and to feel, I

29
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.860
always say this in quotes, happy. And I can

30
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.529
get into why I do that later, um, that

31
00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.110
you need to buy something, you need to buy

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.150
some sort of experience to, to feel good. So

33
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.660
we have, I mean, clearly we have like the

34
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.900
beauty industry, which is, you know, a multi-billion dollar

35
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.069
industry, but we also have the wellness industry right

36
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.529
now, and that's also a multi-billion dollar industry. And

37
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.570
that's promoting all different types of You know, retreats,

38
00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.750
um, different kind of alternative health trends. And so,

39
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.970
yeah, that's, you know, that really keeps us, yes,

40
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.589
of course, we need exercise. I mean, there is

41
00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:27.610
in America, you know, a, a health crisis, you

42
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.850
could say. I mean, people aren't living as long

43
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.580
compared to, um, longevity rates in other countries in,

44
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.050
in the Western world. But, um, basically, you know,

45
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.899
Going back to the root of of good health

46
00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.750
is connection to others. And through that, you can

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.690
be kind to others. And that's actually a way

48
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.639
to improve a free way to improve your health,

49
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.089
to improve your society, your immediate community, your own

50
00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.570
quality of life, and it's also a way to

51
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.710
build resilience.

52
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.369
So that that aspect of connecting to others, do

53
00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:12.389
you think then that this emphasis on individuals themselves

54
00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.509
trying to improve their own self-care, I mean this

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.250
individualistic approach to self care is problematic then?

56
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.600
Yes, I do. I do think in many ways

57
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.250
it is problematic and I, you know, there's this

58
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.449
theory of the hedonic treadmill, um, that psychologists in

59
00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.369
the 1970s kind of came up with, and the

60
00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.580
idea is that You kind of have this level

61
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.839
of, you know, this base level of happiness, of

62
00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.720
satisfaction in life, and that we're on this treadmill

63
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.740
constantly kind of like grasping for these experiences to

64
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.639
up that level. But really, that, you know, we

65
00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.960
can reach a higher level for a temporary period

66
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.820
of time. But these scientists You know, found or

67
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.619
and hypothesized that actually you really always come back

68
00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.660
to your base level. And then there was some

69
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.740
sort of discourse of like, what you need is

70
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.820
some, you need to kind of break out of

71
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.100
that, that routine, that rhythm. And I do believe

72
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.779
that, you know, by regularly volunteering in your life

73
00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.540
and like prioritizing caring for others and kindness could

74
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.109
be one way to do that. But yeah, I

75
00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:32.109
do think, you know, it is problematic, this kind

76
00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:36.089
of individualized approach to self-care because it keeps people

77
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.029
focused on the self, and it can actually keep

78
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.510
people like in a state of rumination in their

79
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.149
head. It can keep people feeling lonely. Like if

80
00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:51.579
people are feeling lonely, a meditation retreat isn't exactly

81
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.529
the right. You know, a solution to that. Um,

82
00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:58.839
SOMETHING that's more social, that gives that person, you

83
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:01.200
know, more of a sense of purpose is probably

84
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.239
a better treatment for that.

85
00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.000
And so when it comes to altruism in the

86
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.540
book, you talk about how in moments of crisis,

87
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.519
uh, I mean, even if for some people it

88
00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:19.600
might it might sound paradoxical, it's when people feel

89
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.519
a deeper. Desire to help others even if they

90
00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.359
themselves are in danger. So tell us about how

91
00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.279
that happens. Why is it that in moments of

92
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:34.359
crisis or catastrophe we sometimes feel more connected to

93
00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:36.799
others and wanting to help them more.

94
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.320
Yes, so the idea behind that, it's called bounded

95
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.000
solidarity, and when people are in the wake of

96
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
a crisis, they are bounded by this crisis, and

97
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.519
we see this happen after natural disasters like hurricanes

98
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.440
or wildfires. I mean, we can see it happen

99
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.660
after some sort of massive political Um, event or

100
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.339
upset, um, even, you know, from a more granular

101
00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.820
perspective, if someone dies in your family, people come

102
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.140
together, people are really kind, trying to take care

103
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.940
of each other in that time. And so that

104
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.579
is a phenomenon that sociologists call bounded solidarity. And

105
00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.420
like you said, it's when people feel like a

106
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.140
really deep need to help others. And in the

107
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.570
book, I I really explore that through the Napa

108
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.750
wildfires in 2017 when people you know who weren't

109
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.970
even directly affected by the wildfires, like they didn't

110
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.450
live in Napa, you know, their houses, you know,

111
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:41.820
weren't being directly affected. People just in the greater

112
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.549
area across the country just really wanted to help.

113
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.149
They wanted to donate. They wanted to give back

114
00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.940
and help this community. And I think that's really

115
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.559
interesting because I think it speaks to how we

116
00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.679
need altruism to survive as a species, that in

117
00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:04.839
this time of crisis, usually media portrays that as

118
00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.670
a time where people can be really selfish and

119
00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:09.459
You know, we've seen that in a couple of

120
00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.820
movies, but actually in real life, what we see

121
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.820
is like the complete opposite, that, and I'm sure

122
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.940
if any of your listeners have been through some

123
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.339
sort of crisis like that, like they know, they

124
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:23.019
know that when that's happening, they just, you feel

125
00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.420
so deeply that you want to connect with your

126
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.140
community, that you want to help, that you want

127
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.959
to be of service. And it's, it's an interesting

128
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.769
phenomenon that's, you know, being studied. Um, SOME scientists

129
00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:37.890
wonder like, do you need a crisis for that

130
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.730
to happen? And I kind of, you know, explore

131
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.929
that idea in the book. Um, BUT unfortunately, what

132
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.970
scientists do find is that that does fade. So

133
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.450
that is kind of in the immediate wake of

134
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.769
a crisis, but it usually fades as people return

135
00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:53.829
to their everyday normal lives.

136
00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:58.350
And can we prevent it from fading over time?

137
00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:01.809
I mean, does a sort of sense of caring

138
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.549
also, can it work outside of moments of crisis?

139
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.950
Can we maintain it?

140
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.339
That's one of the biggest questions I raised in

141
00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:15.470
my book. Um, I think I did have one

142
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.589
natural disaster scientist tell me like, you know, you

143
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:23.750
don't need it, but usually people are rallying around

144
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.769
some sort of Um, issue in their community. So

145
00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:32.210
whether they're like disenfranchised or um like we find

146
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.450
in immigrant communities, people who are living in poverty,

147
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:38.250
like they do sometimes have a stronger sense of

148
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:44.450
bounded solidarity. Um, AND yes, so I don't know

149
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.289
if it can if it can persist. I think

150
00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:51.780
in some ways it can, and I did. I

151
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.859
did show that in the book. For example, after

152
00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:58.539
the wildfires, um, a group of teen boys, they

153
00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.270
started Trying, you know, they wanted to help their

154
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.169
community, so they were going to different evacuation centers,

155
00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:07.270
asking how we can help. The first evacuation center,

156
00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:10.309
they were turned down, but they kept going. They

157
00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:12.630
went to another evacuation center. They were like, How

158
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.390
can we help? We can't just sit in our

159
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.190
homes and like watch our community burn down. And

160
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.469
the second evacuation center told them like, You can

161
00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:23.590
help us deliver supplies around town to people who

162
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.789
need it. And so they kind of started their

163
00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:29.219
own. Their own, you know, service for the rest

164
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.140
of the week. And I mean that was in

165
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.419
2017, and they still have created a nonprofit. It's

166
00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:38.729
called the Hero Foundation. And basically after like any

167
00:09:38.729 --> 00:09:41.890
crisis in the community, they're on the ground, they're

168
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.169
helping, and they've recruited more teens, and I think

169
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.799
it's, yeah, really amazing. They do like diaper drives,

170
00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:51.969
they do like river cleanups around the Napa River.

171
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.369
So that is just one example of how that

172
00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:58.830
can persist. I heard of a similar story after

173
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:05.130
the LA wildfires that a teen created like Um,

174
00:10:05.469 --> 00:10:07.630
like a shop where people could just come and

175
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.789
get free clothes, and now she has like a

176
00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:13.190
permanent location in LA after that so people can

177
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.909
go and just get like free supplies. It's like

178
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:20.909
a totally like gifting store. Essentially people can donate

179
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:22.429
their stuff and then people can go when they

180
00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:24.900
need something. So I think in like very small

181
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.590
ways we can see it sustained, but I think

182
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.929
that immediate feeling that people have after a crisis.

183
00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:36.330
It does, it does fade, and it's because we

184
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.570
live in a capitalist society. It's because we live

185
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.169
in a society where we put profit over caring

186
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:47.770
and giving for others, um, and because we very

187
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.929
much live in like a scarcity mindset, and those

188
00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:53.809
are just a few reasons I was told like

189
00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:56.890
why it doesn't sustain for a longer period of

190
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.210
time.

191
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.320
In recent times, people have talked a lot about

192
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.739
the loneliness epidemic. Do you think that it is,

193
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.500
or it could be an impediment to a culture

194
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.179
of caring in non-crisis times?

195
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.500
I think the loneliness crisis is actually a result

196
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.020
of living in a culture that doesn't prioritize caring

197
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.419
for others and doesn't prioritize connection. We've seen so

198
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:31.820
many of our everyday interactions become automated by technology.

199
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.390
We can order our groceries online. We can I

200
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.580
mean, you can order anything online, um, even like

201
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.419
the news media that we consume is very individualized

202
00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:49.429
now. And as a result, that's taken away everyday

203
00:11:49.429 --> 00:11:53.340
moments where we can connect with other people. And

204
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.750
it doesn't mean like having A new best friend.

205
00:11:56.859 --> 00:12:00.270
It's just people you interact with in your everyday

206
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.789
life. And one professor at UCLA when I was

207
00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.989
talking about this with him, gave me an example

208
00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:08.830
that how, you know, it used to be that

209
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.489
you would go to your butcher, local butcher, and

210
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.969
you went, you know, however many times a week

211
00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:20.000
and just through Purchasing meat and, and food from

212
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.159
him, you would learn about his life and you

213
00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.159
would maybe learn, you know, one day that his

214
00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:27.280
kid was sick. And you would be able, because

215
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.599
you're developing, you know, consistently that relationship with him.

216
00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:34.320
You're not best friends, but you're interacting with him

217
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.640
every day and he's somewhat of, you know, an

218
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.359
important figure in your life. Um, YOU'RE, you're getting

219
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.260
to know him, you know, his kid is sick,

220
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.979
so you care about him. So maybe then you,

221
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.619
that gives you an opportunity to do something nice

222
00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:48.979
for that butcher to like ask, you know, hey,

223
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.419
can I help you with this, or maybe you

224
00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:54.840
bring like a little stuffed animal for his son

225
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.669
and his, you know, whoever's struggling. And That is

226
00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:01.880
the moment where you're given the opportunity to be

227
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.840
kind to someone and show that you care for

228
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.750
someone, and that is good for your health. Um,

229
00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:10.280
WE don't have as many opportunities like that in

230
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.460
everyday life right now. So we really need to

231
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.000
focus on creating more of those. And yeah, I

232
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.080
think the loneliness epidemic is in part, and there

233
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.799
is research to show this. As a result of

234
00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:27.780
the automation of all of the rise in technology

235
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.440
that we've seen.

236
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.950
So when it comes to altruistic acts, we can

237
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.799
do, there's many different kinds of things from random

238
00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:42.190
acts of kindness, kindness to group volunteering. Um, ARE

239
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.190
the benefits the same across all kinds of altruist

240
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.950
acts and activities, or do they vary?

241
00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:54.750
So they vary. Science shows that I say like

242
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.710
the peak optimal thing that you can do is

243
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.190
um volunteer for something that you care, you know,

244
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.140
deeply about. Regularly, and, you know, maybe once a

245
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.739
week. Um, AND it's, you know, you're kind of

246
00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:12.179
returning to a group and a cause that you

247
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:15.580
care about and you're, you're making a routine out

248
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.859
of that. That is probably how you would see

249
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:23.340
like the optimal health benefits of volunteering, but not

250
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.320
everyone has the time to do that. And so,

251
00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:29.460
In my book, I talk about how people go

252
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.580
through seasons of giving, seasons of receiving, and seasons

253
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.940
of witnessing. So even just like witnessing acts of

254
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.340
kindness is good for our health. Um, AND you're

255
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.099
not going to experience the benefits of giving if

256
00:14:45.099 --> 00:14:47.530
you're not in the season of giving. And what

257
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.419
that means is like, do you have actually like

258
00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:54.780
the time and space to volunteer regularly? If like

259
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.559
I'm A mom of two young children right now,

260
00:14:57.599 --> 00:15:00.280
and unfortunately, I don't have the time and I

261
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.200
work. So I'm not in a season of giving.

262
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.719
I've been in seasons of giving where I've regularly

263
00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:08.150
volunteered and it's been wonderful and I wish so

264
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.320
badly I could be doing that right now, but

265
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.359
I can't. So, you know, you kind of have

266
00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:15.200
to dial it back. But I think that when

267
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.549
you have to dial it back and do what

268
00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.669
fits your life, it's like Trying to make an

269
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:24.469
impact in your direct community and people who you

270
00:15:24.469 --> 00:15:28.390
are interacting with on a daily basis. So, like

271
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.369
one example I have is like I have a

272
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.190
group of moms that I'm really, you know, friendly

273
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.510
with and I'm always talking to other parents. So

274
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.030
it's just, I have an 8 month old and

275
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.309
it's little things like when he's grown out of

276
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:42.950
his clothes, I, you know, shoot a text to

277
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.789
another mom, hey, like I have these clothes, can

278
00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.590
I come over and drop them off if, you

279
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.250
know, they'll be helpful to you. So small things

280
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.809
like that. But yeah, I mean the research shows

281
00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:56.090
that definitely in-person volunteering is, I guess you could

282
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.729
say like better than just donating money. At the

283
00:15:59.729 --> 00:16:03.409
same time, donating money in the wake of a

284
00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:07.070
crisis, like let's say if you're Online, there's another

285
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.400
wildfire in California and you're like watching all of

286
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.229
these, you know, all of this destruction happening on

287
00:16:14.229 --> 00:16:18.000
your phone and you're like it's going to evoke

288
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.320
anxiety in you. You're going to feel anxious, you're

289
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.640
going to probably go into fight or flight. It

290
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.309
might bring up feelings of climate change for you,

291
00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:28.000
but if in that moment you come across like

292
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.640
a GoFundMe to help a family and you donate,

293
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.919
in that moment, that's going to give you a

294
00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:36.679
sense of purpose and feeling like you're doing something

295
00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:39.000
instead of feeling like you're sitting amid all of

296
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.039
this chaos and feeling like everything's out of control.

297
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:47.830
And why is kindness and volunteering so powerful for

298
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.619
its participants? I mean, what kinds of psychological effects

299
00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:54.049
does it have on them?

300
00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:58.190
Mhm. Well, what I say is that, I mean,

301
00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:01.960
first, it is a way to build resilience in

302
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.868
us. I think it's a way to, for people

303
00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:09.388
to experience transformation. And going back to the self-care

304
00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:15.029
industrial complex and the wellness industrial complex, people, I

305
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:17.749
think, are seeking some sort of transformation, some sort

306
00:17:17.749 --> 00:17:22.239
of greater feeling of satisfaction in their lives. Um,

307
00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:24.708
AND that's why, you know, a lot of like

308
00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:27.933
why You say happiness in quotes, because I don't

309
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:31.813
think people are chasing happiness. They're chasing, they want

310
00:17:31.813 --> 00:17:34.453
some sort of transformation, some sort of, like I

311
00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:38.234
said, greater feeling a greater satisfaction in their lives.

312
00:17:38.573 --> 00:17:42.234
And so altruism is really a way for us

313
00:17:42.234 --> 00:17:47.000
to Connect with other people on a more vulnerable

314
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.770
level, and through that, it can help us build

315
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.380
resilience to face future crises in our lives. And

316
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.219
that kind of explains the connection to why I

317
00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:00.800
researched, you know, this idea of bounded solidarity in

318
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.219
the wake of a crisis, because it doesn't matter,

319
00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:07.949
you know. Who you are your entire life, you're

320
00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:10.709
going to have some sort of crisis happen. Things

321
00:18:10.709 --> 00:18:12.589
are going to happen. There are going to be

322
00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:16.109
very difficult moments in life. That is life. Nothing

323
00:18:16.109 --> 00:18:18.310
is going to stop that from happening, but what

324
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.790
you can do is build your resilience to facing

325
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.510
that. And so altruism, like I said, it being

326
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.739
kind to another person, showing that you care about

327
00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:33.839
another person. That helps you build a different level

328
00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:38.439
of connection with someone, instead of just like seeing

329
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:42.319
them once a week at some sort of hobby

330
00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:45.810
you're involved in, which is great, but people remember

331
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.520
when they're on the receiving end of an act

332
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.459
of kindness. So then when you're in a crisis,

333
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.880
your community is going to show up for you.

334
00:18:54.369 --> 00:18:57.810
And like I said before, when your community is

335
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.609
in crisis and you're of service to them, that

336
00:19:00.609 --> 00:19:02.800
gives you a sense of purpose, that, and it,

337
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.770
it really is good for your health. Now, more,

338
00:19:04.849 --> 00:19:07.150
you know, kind of what happens with the body

339
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.329
is that when we are in a state of

340
00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:13.670
fight or flight, Like, you know, really big, we're

341
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.270
really feeling anxious about something. Our frontal lobes of

342
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.849
the brain, they shut down. Our higher order shuts

343
00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:24.670
down. And acts of kindness and altruism can be

344
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.869
a way to bring that back online. It can

345
00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:34.489
reset the parasympathetic system. So that's one way that

346
00:19:34.489 --> 00:19:37.270
we know, that's kind of like the big way

347
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.170
that that it helps. And another way is, you

348
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:45.010
know, there are other research shows that helping others

349
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.930
can possibly slowly decline aging, or it can help

350
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.369
you age better. We know that research shows that

351
00:19:53.369 --> 00:19:57.689
people who volunteer regularly have fewer hospital visits as

352
00:19:57.689 --> 00:20:00.760
they age, um, which is, you know, and they're

353
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.550
actually living longer. Um, WE know that it can

354
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:10.000
also slow the decline of disease acceleration, and that

355
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.750
comes from really having a sense of purpose, um,

356
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.479
and also kind of slowing down that parasympathetic nervous

357
00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:21.280
system. So, yeah, there's a lot of research out

358
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.180
there that shows that there's, it can really improve

359
00:20:26.439 --> 00:20:31.010
your health and And give you, yeah, you know,

360
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.359
good physical health, mental health, psychological health, emotional health.

361
00:20:36.489 --> 00:20:38.930
You mentioned the brain. Tell us a little bit

362
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.650
more about the neuroscience of altruism. How, what do

363
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.050
we know about how altruism works in the brain?

364
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.349
Mhm. Yes, so one way that it works is

365
00:20:51.349 --> 00:20:56.439
that I call it, it's like nature's fire extinguisher,

366
00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.160
and that's because of the love hormone called oxytocin.

367
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.939
And that is one way that it can calm

368
00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:09.209
our stress response and it makes connection possible. Um,

369
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.349
SO we know that there have been like experiments

370
00:21:11.349 --> 00:21:15.589
where scientists gave oxytocin to mice that had never

371
00:21:15.589 --> 00:21:19.349
been around babies before, and suddenly when they were

372
00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:24.469
given oxytocin, those mice were like nurturing these pups.

373
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.280
So It really, like when you experience oxytocin through

374
00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:32.369
the act of giving or and caring for others,

375
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.579
and it doesn't have to be like caring for

376
00:21:34.579 --> 00:21:38.180
kids, um, it does make you want to be

377
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.500
kinder. And we do have research that shows that

378
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.829
like Even if you witness an act of kindness,

379
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.810
that makes you more likely to give and be

380
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.349
kinder in your life, like moving on from witnessing

381
00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:56.089
that act. Um, ANOTHER part of the neuroscience is

382
00:21:56.089 --> 00:22:00.579
that Altruism, it can, you know, there's emerging research

383
00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:02.660
to show that it can be like a muscle,

384
00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:07.119
um, and studies on compassion meditation show that when

385
00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:11.199
people practice it regularly, that the brain regions linked

386
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:15.900
to empathy and emotional regulation, they actually like grow

387
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.000
stronger. Um, SO, I mean, in a way, it's

388
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.469
like maybe you can, by practicing kindness and altruism,

389
00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:27.160
you can actually kind of like build that muscle

390
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.800
in your brain. Um, AND like I said too,

391
00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:33.989
one of the big ways is that You, you

392
00:22:33.989 --> 00:22:36.790
know, when you're in fight or flight mode from

393
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.739
like chronic stress, you're just feeling chronically stressed, um,

394
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:43.989
that sends you into fight or flight mode. It

395
00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:46.550
shuts down, you know, the frontal lobes of your

396
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.750
brain, and kindness can really be an antidote to

397
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.109
that. I mean, I have, I had neuroscientists tell

398
00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:56.589
me like, kindness and altruism is not like a

399
00:22:56.589 --> 00:22:59.750
nice fluffy thing to have for good brain health.

400
00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:02.369
It's actually a must-have for good brain health.

401
00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:08.089
Uh, ONE very interesting benefit of a culture of

402
00:23:08.089 --> 00:23:10.530
caring you talk about in your book is that

403
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.130
people can become more resilient, which is, which I

404
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.250
think is very interesting because since we, and by

405
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.729
we I mean we in the West live in

406
00:23:20.729 --> 00:23:25.354
these more individualistic cultures, um. We tend to think

407
00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:29.594
that people have, have to become more resilient by

408
00:23:29.594 --> 00:23:33.494
themselves, I mean individually, but actually it seems that,

409
00:23:33.505 --> 00:23:35.755
I, I mean at least according to the research

410
00:23:35.755 --> 00:23:38.875
you present in the book that they can also

411
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:43.574
do it through connecting and caring for other people,

412
00:23:43.954 --> 00:23:44.314
right?

413
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.479
Mhm. Yes, exactly. I mean, and I think we

414
00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:51.420
see that in, you know, like we were talking

415
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.280
about in the wake of a crisis, um, You

416
00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.500
know, disaster resilience professors say. Like hiding in your

417
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.619
house after a crisis and like removing yourself from

418
00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:07.770
society is not going to help you survive. What's

419
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.739
going to help you survive is building like a

420
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:14.660
mutual aid program where you know which neighbor has

421
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.694
canned food. Where you know which neighbor has toilet

422
00:24:17.694 --> 00:24:21.775
paper or paper goods, and you can create, you

423
00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:24.175
know, like a system where people are giving and

424
00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:26.334
sharing and helping each other, and I think that

425
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:29.614
really speaks to the strength of living in a

426
00:24:29.614 --> 00:24:32.375
culture of caring. And what I mean by that

427
00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:36.354
is it's a culture that prioritizes caring for others,

428
00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:40.535
and, you know, they do that through policy, they

429
00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:44.189
do that through You know, the different like industries

430
00:24:44.189 --> 00:24:48.550
and systems that exist. It's, it's, you know, if

431
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.949
you're a manager of a business, like prioritizing caring

432
00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:56.270
for your employees, um, and it takes many, I

433
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.670
think it will take many people to make that

434
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.650
happen in the West, but we need to care,

435
00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:05.290
you know, we need to prioritize caring to survive

436
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.989
as a species, and I, you know, multiple scientists

437
00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:12.530
told me that, and I do think that A

438
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.819
lot of the health problems that we do see

439
00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:18.890
in the West are, you know, maybe, I don't

440
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.530
know if they're directly a result, but indirectly a

441
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.170
result of not having a culture of caring, of

442
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.449
prioritizing profit over caring for others, of living in

443
00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:33.150
this individualized society. I mean we very much live

444
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:39.410
Thinking, oh, survival of the fittest, but actually research

445
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.989
shows that survival of the kindest, kindest might be,

446
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.729
you know, actually what's going to help humans survive

447
00:25:47.729 --> 00:25:48.530
and live longer.

448
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:53.489
What is it that you call systemic caring? What

449
00:25:53.489 --> 00:25:54.329
is that?

450
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.560
Yeah, so systemic caring is what I just said.

451
00:25:58.609 --> 00:26:03.930
It would just be creating a culture that prioritizes

452
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:08.010
the act of caring for others, that it, it

453
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.359
doesn't, it's Not exactly. I mean, I wouldn't say

454
00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:15.800
like, I wouldn't say it's not a capitalist society,

455
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.640
but it's a culture that there's a general consensus

456
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.800
that being kind and caring for others is a

457
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.640
priority, is the priority. And yeah, it's very vague

458
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.119
in general, but I mean I think it's like

459
00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:33.439
approaching your everyday life or wherever you know you

460
00:26:33.439 --> 00:26:37.479
are in your everyday life and and living by

461
00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:40.880
that mindset. And I talk about this in the

462
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.140
book, it's a mindset of being like a steward

463
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.130
for this world, for other people. And It can

464
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.250
look like universal healthcare, it can look like offering

465
00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:58.709
paid sick leave, it could be offered like look

466
00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:01.040
like universal basic income, which I know these are

467
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.560
like very can be seen to some people as

468
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.650
like very radical progressive policies, but I actually think

469
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.609
that they're reflective of a culture that cares about

470
00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:15.089
people, the people who, you know, live in the

471
00:27:15.089 --> 00:27:19.069
society, so. Yeah, that's what a culture of caring

472
00:27:19.069 --> 00:27:23.270
is and I'm very interested in exploring it. In

473
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.270
my book, it was important to me that I

474
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.430
found people who are trying to build that right

475
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.709
now. So I did find, I know it might

476
00:27:31.709 --> 00:27:36.089
seem To some people, like, oh, that's very far

477
00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:38.780
away, but there are people in America who are

478
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.760
building and focusing on that right now.

479
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.819
And how can such a culture of systemic caring

480
00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:49.819
be created? I mean, what steps should people take?

481
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.890
I don't have exact steps, um, but I think

482
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.949
it's like I said, just having a mindset that

483
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.130
caring is a strength, caring for others and caring

484
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.410
for society is a strength, and it's not a

485
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.650
weakness. I think we first need to kind of

486
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:13.569
like deconstruct how we value and see the act

487
00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:16.790
of caregiving in our society. You know, it's very

488
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:21.290
gendered right now. It's typically associated with being unpaid,

489
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:26.609
and it's not seen as quote unquote strong. Um,

490
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.329
SO I think you know, first kind of deconstructing

491
00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:33.180
that is one way to take a step to

492
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:38.310
actually prioritize caring for others and caring for our

493
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.689
society, caring for our planet. Um. And but first

494
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:44.699
I think we need to kind of, you know,

495
00:28:45.089 --> 00:28:50.030
deconstruct how we value and see the active caregiving

496
00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:51.829
as a whole in our society.

497
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.040
Uh, BUT if being altruistic and helping others is

498
00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.280
so good for us, then why is there burnout

499
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.920
among caregivers?

500
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.920
Yes, that's a very good question and one that

501
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.959
kind of like it haunted me as I was

502
00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:11.140
writing this because I'm like, how can I write?

503
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:15.089
This book and say, Oh, caring for others is

504
00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:16.650
so good for you. It has all these health

505
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.290
benefits and we need to build a culture of

506
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.849
caring when like report after report comes out and

507
00:29:20.849 --> 00:29:24.550
says like, caregivers are so burned out, they're lonely.

508
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.369
I can't write this book and tell unpaid caregivers,

509
00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:30.319
actually, to feel better, you need to care for

510
00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:34.550
others more. And so I was trying, you know,

511
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.449
that was kind of a question that I was

512
00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:38.410
constantly trying to answer and kind of parse out.

513
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.900
And basically what I landed on is because we

514
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.300
live in a society where caregivers aren't cared for.

515
00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:49.770
They are forced to caregive alone with no resources,

516
00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:53.780
they get no breaks, no rest, and that's a

517
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.449
huge problem. If you're forced to caregive like that

518
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.579
all the time, of course you're going to be

519
00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:01.760
burned out and you're going to be lonely. So

520
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.369
you know that's why I write in the book

521
00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:08.000
as well, that like The benefits of giving of

522
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
altruism, you're not going to experience that unless you're

523
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.400
in a season of giving. I would actually say

524
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.540
like right now, unpaid caregivers, they're in a season

525
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.439
of receiving, actually. I mean, yes, maybe they're taking

526
00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:25.000
care of like an elderly parent or they're parenting.

527
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.540
But they really need a lot of support too.

528
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.060
And when we bring it back to building a

529
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.699
culture of caring, we need to make sure that

530
00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:36.500
we're building a culture that cares for caregivers and

531
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.489
that caregivers are given like paid leave to caregive,

532
00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:43.900
that they can have protection to go back to

533
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:49.199
their jobs, that we have policies or systems in

534
00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:54.020
place where caregivers can have breaks. So maybe that's

535
00:30:54.469 --> 00:30:58.199
building a more, you know, family-friendly society where there's

536
00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:03.520
like more Ah, you know, childcare, universal childcare. Oh,

537
00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:07.810
well, you know, what an idea. Uh, FOR, you

538
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.280
know, taking care of elderly, elderly elderly or, or,

539
00:31:12.449 --> 00:31:15.449
you know, sick family members, you know, we, we

540
00:31:15.449 --> 00:31:18.089
need more support for people to do that, more

541
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:21.410
accessible support, um, in our society.

542
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.540
So one final question then, what can people do

543
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.819
if they are not in a circumstance where they

544
00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:34.099
can give to others? I mean if they just

545
00:31:34.099 --> 00:31:37.520
do not have the resources or the time or

546
00:31:37.819 --> 00:31:41.619
whatever whatever it is needed to or whatever they

547
00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:43.790
need to give to others.

548
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.550
I think that first of all, it's OK. Like

549
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.270
you don't have to give and be in a

550
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.150
position to give to others at every moment in

551
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.760
your life. So just give yourself permission to be

552
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.800
like, I'm in a season of survival right now.

553
00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:02.035
I'm in a season of receiving. And witnessing. But

554
00:32:02.035 --> 00:32:04.694
I think there can be some sort of like

555
00:32:04.694 --> 00:32:08.964
universal contract where then when you get to a

556
00:32:08.964 --> 00:32:12.444
place where you can give and care for others

557
00:32:12.444 --> 00:32:16.155
and prioritize that in your life, you, you are

558
00:32:16.155 --> 00:32:19.819
doing that. But also, caring for others doesn't have

559
00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:22.420
to be like a big grand thing. It can

560
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.420
be very small as well. And I think that

561
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.250
everyone, no matter where they are in their life,

562
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.739
will feel good after doing a small random act

563
00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:35.660
of kindness to someone in their life, because Caring

564
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.219
for others and being of service to others is

565
00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:41.540
a basic human need that we need. As a

566
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.380
human, you want to feel that purpose and that

567
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.660
connection with other people. It is like a very

568
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.939
basic part of being human. So even if you're

569
00:32:49.939 --> 00:32:53.319
not in a season where you can volunteer or

570
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:56.699
do something, you know, that you would really like

571
00:32:56.699 --> 00:32:58.099
to do, but you just really don't have the

572
00:32:58.099 --> 00:33:03.199
time and resources, just Asking someone, just listening to

573
00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:07.709
someone, listening without reaction, I say. Just being there

574
00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:10.739
for a friend, picking up the phone and checking

575
00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:14.390
in on someone. How are you doing? Um, OR

576
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.589
even if you see someone you know on a

577
00:33:17.589 --> 00:33:19.989
walk that needs help in some way or looks

578
00:33:19.989 --> 00:33:23.709
a little distressed, how are you? Or introducing yourself

579
00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:27.390
and just being an ear, someone to listen. Research

580
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:32.500
shows that listening Without reaction actually helps you build

581
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.020
empathy. And it's also, I say, an act of

582
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.939
caring to just listen to someone.

583
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.810
OK, so the book is again Your Brain on

584
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.839
Altruism, the Power of Connection and Community during times

585
00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:49.609
of crisis. I'm of course leaving a link to

586
00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:52.449
it in the description of the interview. Uh, AND

587
00:33:52.449 --> 00:33:55.369
Nicole, just before we go, uh, would you like

588
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:57.969
to tell people where they can find you and

589
00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.530
your work on the internet?

590
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.920
Yes. Um, I have a website, Nicolemcarlos.com. I'm on

591
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.958
Instagram at Nicole Carlos, and I actually just started

592
00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:13.360
a sub-stack called A Culture of Caring, where I'm

593
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.179
trying to keep the conversation going from my book

594
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.280
and explore the ways that we can build a

595
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.159
culture of caring.

596
00:34:20.438 --> 00:34:22.839
