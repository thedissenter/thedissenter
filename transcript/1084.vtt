00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.829
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.029
today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.949
Patrick Hasan. He's a senior lecturer at the School

5
00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.710
of English Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University. I'm

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.989
leaving a. To our first interview in the description,

7
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.670
which was about his book, Nietzsche's struggle against Pessimism.

8
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.610
And today we're talking about the philosophy of suicide.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.319
So, Doctor Hassan, welcome back to the show. It's

10
00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.450
always a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.459
Thank you very much for having me back.

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.080
So, what is then the philosophy of suicide? What

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.099
kinds of questions do you explore

14
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:46.299
there? Yeah, so the, the philosophy of suicide is

15
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.540
an attempt, uh, just like in, in other fields,

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.139
to understand the phenomenon of suicide. Um, SPECIFIC philosophical

17
00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:00.659
approaches will typically involve questions pertaining to the rationality

18
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.090
of suicide. Can we understand it as a rational

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.709
phenomenon? Um, WHAT kinds of things would motivate suicidal

20
00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:14.059
behavior? Um, AND I'd, I'd say primarily it's been

21
00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:17.800
approached from a, from a perspective in moral philosophy.

22
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.279
So is suicide ever, and, and, and could there

23
00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:25.040
be any circumstances which suicide is morally permissible in

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.959
under what circumstances would it be permissible? Could suicide

25
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.040
ever be morally required, um, which is a, a

26
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.059
stronger claim. um. And I would say that most

27
00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:38.949
of what goes on in, in the philosophy of

28
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:41.900
suicide has, has really worked under the umbrella of,

29
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.750
um, yeah, moral psychology, normative ethics.

30
00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.139
And I mean, the approach that you have in

31
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.330
in the philosophy of suicide, how does it compare

32
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.860
to approaches in other more scientific domains like for

33
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.980
example, psychology, sociology, and medicine slash psychiatry?

34
00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.279
Yeah, it's a good question. Uh, SO, philosophers tend

35
00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:11.440
to emphasize conceptual analysis, but of course, we do

36
00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.850
make use of empirical observation too. I would say

37
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.479
in empirical, strictly empirical disciplines like psychology and sociology,

38
00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.410
um, what they're trying to do there is really

39
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.850
to understand the etiology of suicide. So what I

40
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.039
mean by that is the strictly trying to understand

41
00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.929
the causal mechanisms which give rise to suicide, um,

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.610
Uh, the psychologists, that's to do with, yeah, individual

43
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.449
factors. Uh, SOCIOLOGISTS are looking at broader social networks

44
00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:45.889
in which this phenomenon occurs. Um, Whereas, yeah, philosophers

45
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.770
will, will use uh conceptual analysis. Uh, THEY'RE interested

46
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.649
in normative questions, which psychologists and sociologists might not

47
00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.610
be. Um, BUT I think it's fair to say

48
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.369
that for any comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of

49
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.229
suicide. Uh, ALL of these disciplines need to, to

50
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.059
work together. Uh, THERE needs to be somewhat interdisciplinary,

51
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.830
um, not just sociology, psych uh psychology, but also

52
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.070
probably anthropology and history. I would add to that

53
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.740
as well. Um, So, yeah, philosophers, uh, particularly moral

54
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.889
philosophers are doing something slightly different insofar as they,

55
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.589
they're trying to do a more fundamental conceptual analysis

56
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.970
and ask, you know, are there circumstances in which

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.820
people ought or ought not to commit suicide? And

58
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.860
that, that ought, the normative concept there is typically

59
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.460
one that strictly empirical disciplines, um, are not going

60
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.270
to analyze.

61
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.139
But the suicide have a specific definition in philosophy?

62
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.830
Does it differ in any way definitionally from how

63
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.789
it is approached in other areas of knowledge? I

64
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.229
mean, what do you have to say about that?

65
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.440
Yeah, I would say that philosophers are typically a

66
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.910
little bit more attentive to how we define this,

67
00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:07.639
um, as might be expected. Uh, THERE'S, there's huge

68
00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.520
disagreement about even how to define this, um, before

69
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.830
analyzing whether it's, you know, morally permissible or not

70
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.470
and under what circumstances. So, Um, I would say

71
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.250
that that attention to the definition of suicide only

72
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.250
really becomes, um, something which, which gets a lot

73
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.850
of attention in the sort of 20th century and

74
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.880
contemporary, contemporary kind of uh uh philosophy of suicide.

75
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.010
I think a general first pass at trying to

76
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.609
define what this would, what this actually is would

77
00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:44.929
be something like self-caused death. Um, BUT once you

78
00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:47.829
start thinking about some counterexamples, it becomes quite clear

79
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.970
that that's not going to be adequate. So just

80
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.549
to give you a couple of examples, um. Say

81
00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:57.739
something like death from a drug overdose or from

82
00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.549
uh years and years of smoking or something like

83
00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:04.690
this. Uh, WELL, it's self-caused and it results in

84
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.829
death in some cases, but we wouldn't really want

85
00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:10.019
to call it suicides, which suggests that it lacks

86
00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.000
that definition lacks some kind of essential feature. In

87
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.589
those cases, probably something like intention, intention to die.

88
00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.369
Um, DIFFERENT kinds of cases, you could point to

89
00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:24.290
this phenomenon called suicide by cop, where this is

90
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.779
a kind of method of attempting to kill oneself,

91
00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:32.809
where one provokes, uh, law enforcement or anyone armed

92
00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:36.170
basically, uh, by presenting yourself as a threat. So

93
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.329
they, um, they, they shoot the, the person in

94
00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:42.980
question. And die as a result. Um, THAT looks

95
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.910
like there's an intention to die, but it's not

96
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.899
self-caused. So these kinds of counterexamples pose problems for

97
00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.420
just a sort of an intuitive account of, of

98
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.970
suicide as self-caused death. So what that might suggest

99
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.100
is that a general kind of understanding of what

100
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.359
this might be, could be something like. Um, A

101
00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:07.970
self-caused death where there's an intention to die, and

102
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.760
that one's actions, one predicts that, uh, those actions

103
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.390
will lead to that death, that desired to death.

104
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.709
Um, IT'S not a perfect definition, so some people

105
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.470
have also built in other kinds of, uh, conditions

106
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.959
for this. For example, some people think that it

107
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.989
also has to be freely chosen or freely willed,

108
00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.679
uh, to distinguish from cases where someone might be

109
00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.209
coerced. Uh, INTO suicide. So, you know, it's very

110
00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.829
controversial, for example, whether Socrates committed suicide, right? He

111
00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:40.070
was ordered by the judiciary of Athens to, to

112
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.910
commit suicide. He drank the hemlock, um, but whether

113
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.220
this was a freely chosen action is, is, uh,

114
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.160
controversial. So, There's, there's a little bit of controversy,

115
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.519
but I think certainly up within the 19th century

116
00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.880
and prior to that, there was a kind of

117
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.040
general understanding of this claim, uh, that suicide is

118
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.640
really just self-caused death where where there's an intention.

119
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.079
To die. Um, I think there's, it's worth maybe

120
00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:10.589
pointing out a qualification about this, so. One point

121
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.750
is that some people have tried to define suicide

122
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.549
in this way that we've been talking about by

123
00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:18.390
pointing to necessary and sufficient conditions and whether they

124
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.869
obtain in some circumstances rather than others. Another approach

125
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.589
would be to take what would be a sort

126
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:29.559
of uh Wittgensteinian approach to defining it in terms

127
00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:32.589
of family resemblance. So it's not that it, it

128
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:35.309
satisfies certain conditions, but rather there's a kind of

129
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:39.679
general family of related um Things which have to

130
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.119
be present in order for us to consider something

131
00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.279
suicide doesn't mean that all of them have to

132
00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.559
be present at one time, um, but maybe some

133
00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:51.320
of them, not others. Um, SO Wittgenstein famously has

134
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.480
this approach to a number of concepts, um, like

135
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.750
games, for example, doesn't think that we can really

136
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.230
have a central definition of what a game is.

137
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.239
Maybe it's a family resemblance concept. Some people have

138
00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:05.000
thought about gender this way too. So that's another

139
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.339
way of thinking about it that's rather different. But

140
00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:10.820
another qualification which probably should be mentioned is that

141
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.209
the term suicide carries with it a negative connotation,

142
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.579
right? It has, there is an evaluative side to

143
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:20.339
this term, um, that might affect how we conceive

144
00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:24.070
of some actions of suicide rather than others. Um,

145
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.750
SO, when people who are considered morally vicious, villains,

146
00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:34.909
uh, when they have. Committed suicide, like the case

147
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.080
of Hitler, for example, no one really denies that

148
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.159
that's a case of suicide. Uh, BUT in cases

149
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.359
where people are morally admirable, they're perhaps martyrs or

150
00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:46.349
heroes in some way, they might be more reluctant

151
00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:49.760
to do that precisely because this is the thought

152
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.359
anyway, precisely because there's the built in negative connotation

153
00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:55.840
to the term, um, that makes it quite hard

154
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.880
to separate out our evaluative starting points from a

155
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.200
purely descriptive definition. Uh, SO that might be one

156
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.159
intrinsic difficulty to, to giving a, a just a

157
00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:09.150
strictly impartial, neutral, evaluatively neutral definition of the term.

158
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.880
But yeah, I would say that the, the sort

159
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.119
of generally accepted starting point would be self-caused death

160
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.559
where there's an intention to die.

161
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.219
How long have philosophers been thinking about suicide? I

162
00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:26.140
mean, how, how old is the philosophy of suicide?

163
00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:30.690
Um, IT'S, it's, it's ancient really. I mean, I

164
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.039
would say at least in the Western traditions, people

165
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.520
have been thinking about the philosophy of suicide at

166
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.039
least as far back as Plato. Uh, SO Plato

167
00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:42.400
generally has a negative view of suicide, but allows

168
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.520
it to be permissible in certain circumstances that he

169
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.580
outlines in the laws. Um, Aristotle barely mentions it,

170
00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:53.609
but he does have a passage where he, he

171
00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:57.140
denies that. Suicide is an injustice to the self,

172
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.340
but rather conceives of it as a sort of

173
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.309
injustice to the state or to society, though he

174
00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:04.570
doesn't quite say a lot about why that is.

175
00:10:05.369 --> 00:10:08.859
Um, THE Stoics, Seneca, Cicero were also interested in

176
00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:11.059
the question of suicide and had a generally more

177
00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.580
positive attitude towards it, that the, the scope for

178
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.820
permissibility with, with suicide was a lot wider than

179
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.539
it was for, say, Plato or Aristotle. Um, THEY

180
00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:23.659
even thought that it might be admirable, right? So

181
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:26.739
in one, in circumstances where what they would describe

182
00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:29.750
as the conditions for a well-lived life, if they're,

183
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:33.080
if they're no longer present, um, Then they think

184
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.640
that it would, they thought that it would just

185
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.150
be wildly irrational to continue living, um, and that

186
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.789
facing your death would actually be noble in those,

187
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.400
those circumstances. So, yeah, people in philosophy have been

188
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.570
thinking about this for a long time, um. In

189
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.940
outside of the Western traditions as well, Confuciuser has

190
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.979
something to say about this, who's writing around the

191
00:10:56.979 --> 00:11:00.659
same time, a little bit earlier than Aristotle. Um,

192
00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:03.599
BUT conceives of the wrongs of suicide is, if

193
00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:06.479
it is wrong, primarily as a violation of duty

194
00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:10.000
to, again, to society or, or more specifically to,

195
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.760
uh, one's family. So there's a, there's a long

196
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.719
tradition of thinking about suicide by philosophers, uh, in

197
00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:17.520
moral terms.

198
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.590
And you mentioned that uh the philosophy of suicide

199
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.719
usually approaches it through a moral lens. I mean,

200
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.039
it's more from the, the point of view of

201
00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:34.059
moral philosophy slash ethics. But how was suicide morally

202
00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:38.280
approached by philosophers and other thinkers before the 19th

203
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.299
century? Because we're we're then going to talk about

204
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.400
a shift that occurred during the 19th century, but

205
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.799
before that, how was it approached from a moral

206
00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:48.640
standpoint?

207
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.760
Yeah, good. Um, SO I think the major change

208
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.479
probably after these, these ancient thinkers, another shift that

209
00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.200
happened, um, in the history of, history of moral

210
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.799
philosophy would be in the, with the rise of

211
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:05.390
Christianity, and particularly in the medieval period where it

212
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.210
really dominates um all intellectual activity. Um, AND there

213
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.119
you see it, as you might expect, an overwhelmingly

214
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.460
negative approach to suicide, uh, moral condemnation of suicide,

215
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.169
um, in, in various ways. So, some people thought

216
00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:23.690
of this as a violation to the self, right?

217
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.840
That we might have duties to ourselves in various

218
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.020
ways, um, and that suicide undermines those, um, There's

219
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.739
also perhaps, as we've mentioned, duties to others. So

220
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:37.419
there's a social uh social sort of aspect to

221
00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:41.250
this. Uh, BY committing suicide, you may be harming

222
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.849
the family, the wider society, the state. Um, AND

223
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.690
also, particularly a Christian way of looking at this

224
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.489
was that it might violate duties to God in

225
00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:55.919
some capacity, that God really has dominion over, uh,

226
00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:58.890
human lives. We don't really have the authority to

227
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.280
be able to check in and out of life.

228
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.409
That's really up to God. Um, AND that by

229
00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:08.409
committing suicide, one deprives God of that right. Um.

230
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.729
You know, Aquinas, Augustine, thinkers within the Christian tradition

231
00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:17.210
made arguments of this kind, um, and others as

232
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.159
well. I mean, another type of theological argument that

233
00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:23.979
was sometimes given was that. Uh, LIFE is, can

234
00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:26.260
be conceived as a kind of gift, right? Life

235
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
is wonderful and good and that we're sort of

236
00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:32.690
honored to be given this opportunity to live, uh,

237
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.340
in this life and that by committing suicide, one

238
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.299
expresses, uh, a kind of ingratitude or something like

239
00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:43.900
that, um, for God's gift of life, um, and

240
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.539
this is a different type of moral wrong, um.

241
00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.380
So I think that that was kind of a,

242
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.059
that was a very dominant way of looking at

243
00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:54.570
suicide for a few 100 years at least. Um,

244
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.780
THINGS started to change in the Enlightenment where people

245
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.989
started to openly challenge arguments the existence of God.

246
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:08.059
Uh, Christianity as an institution started to decline and

247
00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:12.739
influence, um, the rise of secularism was, was the

248
00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:15.750
cause of this. Um, SO you have philosophers like

249
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.289
David Hume who writes this essay of suicide. It's

250
00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:22.570
published posthumously where he really goes after all of

251
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.799
the traditional arguments against suicide, particularly grounded in, um,

252
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:33.150
uh, a theistic worldview. Um, AND really demolishes these

253
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.309
arguments. Um, THAT had a huge impact in how

254
00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:39.260
people thought of the practice. Um, ONE of the

255
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.729
people I'm sure we'll talk about later, Schopenhauer, was

256
00:14:41.729 --> 00:14:44.510
full of admiration for, for this essay and thought

257
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.929
it pretty definitive. But this isn't to say that

258
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:52.239
in the Enlightenment period, it was uniformly um. Sort

259
00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:57.119
of, uh, more, more, um, open to the permissibility

260
00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:00.229
of suicide because a major figure within writing in

261
00:15:00.229 --> 00:15:03.679
the 19th century. Uh, AND the 18th century was.

262
00:15:04.359 --> 00:15:08.190
Emmanuel Kant, who was staunchly against suicide and had

263
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.630
a variety of arguments which didn't necessarily consider it

264
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.010
as, or at least in his best moments, didn't

265
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.309
really consider it a violation to God's authority or

266
00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:19.030
anything like this, but really as a kind of

267
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.150
practical contradiction. Um, THE moral law as he conceived

268
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.710
it emanates from our, our autonomy, uh, our dignity

269
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.770
is rational human beings, and that suicide involved a

270
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.909
kind of practical contradiction in destroying the source of

271
00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:36.659
the moral law. Um, SO he, unlike Hume, um,

272
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.349
thought it had a pretty negative condemnation of suicide,

273
00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:43.630
though, uh, primarily outside of the theological context which

274
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.099
dominated the medieval period.

275
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.280
OK, so as I mentioned in my previous question,

276
00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:52.770
we're going now to talk about the shift that

277
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.929
occurred during the 19th century from when people were

278
00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:59.809
thinking and approaching suicide, mostly from a from a

279
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:03.090
moral standpoint or thinking about it in moral terms

280
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.640
to then thinking about it in more biological and

281
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.099
or psychosociological terms in the 19th century. So, what

282
00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:15.719
changes were brought with this?

283
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.340
Yeah, good. This is definitely an important shift in

284
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.659
the philosophy of suicide, and I think generally, just

285
00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:26.010
on, from the outset, you can see this shift

286
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.840
occurring in just the terminology that gets used. So

287
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.460
instead of talk of violations of duty, good and

288
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.419
evil, these terms tend to get replaced by terms

289
00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:40.359
like health and sickness, um, which were intended at

290
00:16:40.359 --> 00:16:45.669
least to be. Um, WHOLLY descriptive ways that we

291
00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:48.750
could describe the phenomenon of suicide, which replaced what

292
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.950
were considered these antiquated sort of old fashioned, um.

293
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.770
Sort of, yeah, metaphysically suspect concepts of good and

294
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.369
evil. So there's a major terminological shift, and that's

295
00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:04.089
primarily because there's this explosion of success in the

296
00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:11.930
empirical sciences. Um, THE decline of, um, yeah, as

297
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.689
we've said, the decline of theism, the, the decline

298
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:18.848
of, uh, religious institutions. Um, SO there's this, this

299
00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:21.848
renewed sort of interest in how, how much science

300
00:17:21.848 --> 00:17:25.150
can help us explain this phenomenon. The stagnant debates

301
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.500
about the good and bad, good and evil of

302
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.109
of suicide tend to be, they tend to take

303
00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:33.150
the backseat at this period. And I'd say there's

304
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:37.270
two major types of approach, um, that we can,

305
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.189
we can identify. So one kind of approach, as

306
00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:46.339
you mentioned, is thinking about suicide um in terms

307
00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:51.349
of. Individual health, right, so as a biological phenomenon,

308
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.229
um, as the product of a sort of, uh,

309
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.670
yeah, the bodily or mental decline in some respect.

310
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.849
So. Broadly, you can think about suicide for these

311
00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:05.689
thinkers, um, as a sort of symptom of illness

312
00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:08.719
that needs to be treated, right, in some way.

313
00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:11.290
So, just a couple of examples, for people who

314
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.410
thought of things this way. So the Danish phys

315
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.160
uh physician, uh, uh, Heinrich Callison sort of had

316
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.579
this approach. It was quite influential. Um, Max Nordau,

317
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.489
who was a degeneration theorist, thought that the best

318
00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:27.300
way of explaining suicide was by appealing to this.

319
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.420
Um, CONCEPT of neuroasthenia, which is basically this idea

320
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:38.349
that some individuals were Extremely susceptible um to various

321
00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:42.589
stimuli, just hypersensitive to various stimuli. Um, AND that

322
00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:46.390
in our sort of modernizing hustle and bustle of

323
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.949
contemporary society and civilization, rapidly industrializing civilization, we're just

324
00:18:51.949 --> 00:18:54.439
bombarded with all this stimuli all of the time,

325
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:59.150
information, noise, um, all these different effects on our

326
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.729
senses. And his basic idea is that. Neuroasthenia developed

327
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:07.819
as as a kind of fatigue or exhaustion from

328
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:11.780
oversensitiveness to these stimuli. And that eventually it would,

329
00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:15.140
it overwhelmed these individuals such that everything in their

330
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.819
consciousness registers, registers to them as a kind of

331
00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:22.459
obstacle or chore. And that over time, eventually that's

332
00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:24.400
gonna build up where this person will just be

333
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.329
in the state of, really define existence in terms

334
00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:30.449
of their suffering, and that's what pushes them towards

335
00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:33.880
Thinking about suicide as a way of stopping that.

336
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.140
Um, AND again there's others in the tradition as

337
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.750
well. The English physician George Burrows thinks about what

338
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.530
he thought about suicide is really derived from melancholia,

339
00:19:44.739 --> 00:19:48.459
um, for some similar kinds of reasons. So you've,

340
00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:52.260
one way of thinking about the sort of medicalization

341
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.000
of, of, of suicide or the problem of suicide

342
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.719
is as a kind of Yeah, an illness to

343
00:19:57.719 --> 00:20:02.290
be treated was in these individual terms. A second

344
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.530
way of thinking about it within this kind of

345
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.530
medicalization, um, this kind of broadly scientific approach which

346
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:12.920
dominates the 19th century, is as a social phenomenon,

347
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.770
as a sort of social, um, illness. Something that

348
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.479
is a product of various kinds of breakdowns or

349
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:25.310
or declines of the social order. Um, And I,

350
00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:26.619
I just want to make it clear that I

351
00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:29.300
think these things aren't mutually exclusive, right, so a

352
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.630
lot of people thought that. What explains individual bodily

353
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.530
or mental decline was in some way intrinsically connected

354
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.939
to broader social decline. Um, SO, Some people thought

355
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:45.489
that the Italian physician Enrico Morselli, for example, was

356
00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:48.260
extremely influential here. He thought of suicide really as

357
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.989
a symptom of this effect of the struggle for

358
00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:57.680
existence in very Darwinian terms, social Darwinian terms, um,

359
00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.089
that really what's going on is that as society

360
00:21:01.089 --> 00:21:06.900
evolves and society becomes more civilized. Um, THIS creates

361
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.349
a kind of fight, uh, for resources, fight for

362
00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:13.439
survival, and the people who can't keep up with

363
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.150
this are going to be more susceptible to suicide.

364
00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:20.599
Um, PROBABLY the most famous social account, uh, would

365
00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:25.400
be Durkheim, uh, the sociologist Emile Durkheim looked at,

366
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.189
as did everyone at the time, they looked at

367
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.390
specifically modern society and thought there was a specifically

368
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.640
modern problem here. That what's correlating with rapid industrialization,

369
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:43.140
um, urbanization was. A sharp rise in the rates

370
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.459
of suicide, and he tried to explain this in

371
00:21:45.459 --> 00:21:48.420
terms of this concept of annoy, which is the

372
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.530
kind of. Uh, A social condition which is really

373
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.609
defined by a breakdown of the social norms which

374
00:21:55.609 --> 00:22:00.449
facilitate understanding, uh, and sort of communal interaction between

375
00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:03.680
the members of a society. Um, HE thought that

376
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.599
when this happens, when there's too much regulation, too

377
00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:09.640
many rules, or too little, this kind of state

378
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.270
of enemy, this kind of sense of aimlessness, meaningless,

379
00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:17.260
directionless, uh, behavior, a lack of being able to

380
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.280
predict or expect particular outcomes, this would arise and

381
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.079
that this is the actual primary cause of suicide.

382
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.780
Um, SO when we talk about psycho-sociological approaches to

383
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.560
suicide in the 19th century, this medicalization of the

384
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.219
view, I think these are the two main strands

385
00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:38.619
which have interplay in various ways. The suicide is

386
00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:42.739
a symptom of individual decline, mental illness, and suicide

387
00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:45.099
is a symptom of some kind of broader social

388
00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:46.380
degenerational decline.

389
00:22:47.689 --> 00:22:50.109
OK, but then also in the 19th century, we

390
00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:53.469
have to talk about pessimism with figures like Arthur

391
00:22:53.469 --> 00:22:57.099
Schopenhauer. So, but before we get into Schopenhauer himself,

392
00:22:57.349 --> 00:23:01.829
how does pessimism and pessimist philosophy relate to the

393
00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:03.430
phenomenon of suicide?

394
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.550
Yeah, so as you mentioned, this was a dominant

395
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:14.209
philosophical dispute in 19th century Germany in particular. And

396
00:23:14.209 --> 00:23:17.599
pessimists, but the general definition that became the de

397
00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:21.150
facto definition, uh, that these, these figures were working

398
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.180
with. Is that pessimism is the view that life

399
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.260
is not worth living, that it would be better

400
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.739
if we were never born at all. Uh, AND

401
00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:31.579
one of the primary justifications, not the sole justification,

402
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:34.630
but a primary justification for this view, this provocative

403
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.060
view, was that suffering was ubiquitous and inevitable, and

404
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.500
it was always going to outweigh any pleasures, the

405
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.890
minimal pleasures that we have in life. Um, And

406
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.209
as you mentioned, Schopenhauer really developed this into a

407
00:23:49.209 --> 00:23:51.849
philosophical theory, and it was, it was developed further

408
00:23:51.849 --> 00:23:55.839
by his interlocutors and followers at a later time.

409
00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:59.969
And this interacts with the philosophy of suicide, because

410
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:02.569
you might think, look, obviously, if life is really

411
00:24:02.569 --> 00:24:06.449
that bad, um, if there's inevitable suffering that we

412
00:24:06.449 --> 00:24:10.349
can never really alleviate to any significant degree. Um,

413
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.520
DOESN'T suicide start to look very rational? Doesn't it

414
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.479
start to look like it's the best course of

415
00:24:15.479 --> 00:24:19.250
action? Um, AND that might even be required, uh,

416
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.800
you know, precisely because we just, things cannot get

417
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.719
better. So wouldn't it be better for us to

418
00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:29.160
commit suicide if something like pessimism is true? And

419
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.680
that question animated quite a lot of the pessimism

420
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.959
dispute. Does pessimism really entail suicide? Does it really

421
00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:40.780
um. Sort of push us in that direction. Um,

422
00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:43.420
SO that was, I think that's the primary relationship

423
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.900
between these two, phenomena.

424
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:53.030
Uh, AND I mean, does pessimism actually entail suicide?

425
00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:56.780
Does suicide necessarily follow from pessimism or or not?

426
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.069
Uh, SO a lot of the pessimists at the

427
00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:02.829
time, and, uh, think that the answer to that

428
00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:06.599
is no, that that suicide just is not entailed

429
00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:11.989
uh by a pessimistic worldview. Um, AND a lot

430
00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:14.349
of this will depend upon other philosophical commitments that

431
00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:16.750
they had because they were quite diverse in, in

432
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.709
what they thought and why they thought it. But

433
00:25:19.069 --> 00:25:22.859
I think the general view, um, is that, uh,

434
00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:26.670
yeah, suicide is not entailed by pessimism precisely because

435
00:25:27.229 --> 00:25:31.390
Um, there might still be moral reasons, uh, to

436
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.030
avoid suicide. So even if it's. Prudentially better that

437
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.189
we might, it was better that we just were

438
00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:39.630
never born at all. Once we're born into the

439
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.459
world and we're part of a kind of network

440
00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:44.930
of other human beings. They, there might be moral

441
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.900
reasons to avoid, avoid this practice. And in fact,

442
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.890
most pessimists in the dispute, um, did in fact

443
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.709
think that it, that suicide was not, uh, not

444
00:25:55.709 --> 00:25:59.449
always, um, going to be, uh, the right course

445
00:25:59.449 --> 00:26:01.810
of action. There might be some circumstances where it's

446
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.050
permissible, but they offered moral arguments against the practice,

447
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.569
as well as practical ones.

448
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.680
And that includes people like Arthur Schopenhauer and Edward

449
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.189
von Hartmann, who you also mentioned in your work,

450
00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:15.670
right?

451
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.800
That's right, yeah. So, um, Hartman has a particular

452
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.680
kind of moral argument against suicide, which in some

453
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.359
ways is quite um traditional. So we mentioned earlier

454
00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:31.640
these arguments, sort of rooted in Aristotle, uh, but

455
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.239
others pick it up. This idea that suicide violates

456
00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:38.319
uh a duty of concern and care for others

457
00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:41.239
in one's community or family, uh, one's in a

458
00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:45.839
social circle. And that suicide is immoral because it's

459
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:50.359
ultimately an egoistic action. One weighs up how much

460
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.079
value there is in their life and the value

461
00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:54.709
of continuing their life. And if they opt for

462
00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:57.560
a negative answer to that, they commit suicide as

463
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.079
a means of stopping their own pain and suffering.

464
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.540
He thinks it's understandable, and he wants to take

465
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.270
out some of the highly charged emotional venom, which

466
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.109
he thinks infects a lot of the sort of

467
00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:11.719
medieval ways of thinking about suicide. So he thinks

468
00:27:11.719 --> 00:27:14.579
of it as a more understandable phenomenon. But he

469
00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:18.750
does think that. In most cases, where there, where

470
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.790
there are uh people who are involved in a

471
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:27.270
particular social uh network in a particular society, suicide

472
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.430
is wrong or immoral because it precludes the fulfilling

473
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.790
of obligations to others and might even harm others.

474
00:27:34.869 --> 00:27:37.310
So he has a very social way of cashing

475
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.109
out the morality of suicide. Yeah.

476
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.199
And what did these pessimists uh think about the

477
00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:46.119
medicalization of suicide?

478
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:52.849
So, generally, uh, I, my interpretation of people like

479
00:27:52.849 --> 00:27:56.979
Hartmann and and and Schopenhauer, who also resisted, um,

480
00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:02.369
resisted, uh, condemning uh suicide as this kind of

481
00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:07.060
ultimate criminal. Uh, CRIMINAL act, um, well he did

482
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.790
want to, to, to say that there are modest

483
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.579
moral reasons for rejecting it, but he was also

484
00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:15.540
like Hartmann. Very interested in in trying to resist

485
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.380
this condemnation of it as this ultimate moral wrong.

486
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.550
Um, THEY both recognize that, look, there might be

487
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:29.349
some cases in which. Things like insanity, um, and

488
00:28:29.349 --> 00:28:33.140
medical issues can lead to cases of suicide. Um,

489
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.939
THEY both explicitly recognize that this is a possibility,

490
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.790
but they were resistant to the idea that medicalization

491
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.349
could be a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of

492
00:28:41.349 --> 00:28:44.670
suicide, that all cases could be understood in a

493
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.750
quite simplistic way as symptoms of illness or social

494
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:54.300
ills, um. They, for that reason, tend to deny

495
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.910
that suicide is really a specifically modern problem at

496
00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.640
all. They think that this has always been discussed

497
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.319
by philosophers. This is a deeply human existential problem

498
00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:07.949
to face. It's not just something which arises given

499
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.199
rapid industrialization and urbanization. So, on the one hand,

500
00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:16.359
they, they're interesting because they accept that. Advances in

501
00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:18.550
the in the sciences can help us understand this

502
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.959
phenomenon, and they also think that these advances are

503
00:29:21.959 --> 00:29:26.500
right to um move away from this kind of

504
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.369
very strong emphasis on, on, on suicide as being

505
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.719
uh one of the, the worst crimes imaginable, like

506
00:29:34.719 --> 00:29:36.119
one of these things that you find in the

507
00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:39.189
Christian traditions, for example. They write to emphasize that,

508
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.000
but they. Move away from thinking this can be

509
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.280
comprehensive. They, they sort of think that we can

510
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.439
still philosophize about the morality of suicide, and we

511
00:29:47.439 --> 00:29:50.680
can still offer at least modest reasons for thinking

512
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.800
that there's an ethical issue at play here.

513
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.979
And where do you place the 19th century German

514
00:29:57.979 --> 00:30:03.969
pessimists in relation to the more traditional or progressive

515
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.430
approaches to suicide?

516
00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.949
Yeah, I think this is a, a really interesting

517
00:30:09.949 --> 00:30:11.869
question. And one of the things which I, I

518
00:30:11.869 --> 00:30:14.979
try and argue for is that the pessimists represent

519
00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:18.430
an interesting middle ground. Um, SO as I was

520
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.819
saying, I mean, on the one hand, they agree

521
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:26.270
with these 19th century empirical approaches insofar as they

522
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:33.430
say, look, uh, these Sort of general condemnations of

523
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.349
suicide in the harshest terms, um, and especially the

524
00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:41.430
arguments that have underpinned them, these theological arguments, um,

525
00:30:41.469 --> 00:30:45.060
these arguments of violating duties to the South. Um,

526
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.130
MOST of these are hopelessly implausible, and they're, they're,

527
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.469
they're probably motivated by sentiment more than anything else.

528
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.500
So Schopenhauer makes this claim explicitly. He thinks that,

529
00:30:55.989 --> 00:31:00.400
you know, Hume demolished these arguments, um. And what

530
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.469
he exposed is that the arguments are so poor

531
00:31:03.469 --> 00:31:06.750
and they're so frail, that they have to be

532
00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:12.160
sort of supported by and buttressed by sentiments of

533
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.680
disapproval and sentiments and of of condemnation. In other

534
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.040
words, priests and priestly philosophers who sympathize with them

535
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.640
implicitly or explicitly have had to condemn suicide in

536
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.920
the strongest terms to make up for the fact

537
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.739
that the arguments against it aren't particularly good. Um,

538
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.609
AND Schopenhauer thought, well, why are they doing that?

539
00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:33.449
I mean, he has this interesting explanation where he

540
00:31:33.449 --> 00:31:38.849
says that look, Christian approaches are broadly optimistic. They

541
00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:40.880
think that the world is good and and wonderful,

542
00:31:40.949 --> 00:31:44.609
and that we should be celebrating its value. But

543
00:31:44.609 --> 00:31:46.250
the problem is, is if you have people committing

544
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.390
suicide, it looks as if something's wrong, right? So

545
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.170
not not all is well in the Garden of

546
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:55.719
Eden, right? Um, SO he's saying that. Suicide has

547
00:31:55.719 --> 00:31:57.560
to be condemned by people on that side of

548
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.930
the, on that side of the debate, because otherwise

549
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:05.459
suicide itself is a kind of condemnation against optimistic

550
00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:09.910
presumptions. So on the one hand, people like Schopenhauer

551
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.689
and the other pessimists want to say, these empirical

552
00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:14.920
approaches are real advancements in that they show the

553
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.869
poverty of traditional moralizing about suicide, um. They understand

554
00:32:20.869 --> 00:32:24.520
suicide as something which, you know, should be decriminalized,

555
00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:27.280
it should be something which we should evoke pity

556
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.530
and compassion rather than condemnation. And in that sense

557
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:34.369
that Schopenhauer and the pessimists are quite progressive. But

558
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:37.750
they also have 1 ft in the previous century,

559
00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:40.280
insofar as they don't want to give up moralizing

560
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.439
altogether. They do want to give some kind of

561
00:32:43.729 --> 00:32:49.920
um moral argument or arguments against um. Uh, THE,

562
00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:52.959
the, the practice of suicide. And for Schopenhauer, he

563
00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:56.319
has quite peculiar arguments against this. So one is,

564
00:32:56.359 --> 00:33:00.760
is strictly practical, that, um, suicide doesn't really deliver

565
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.560
what the suicidal person wants it to, that really.

566
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.349
They don't give up their willing, which is the

567
00:33:07.349 --> 00:33:09.750
cause of suffering, their intense desiring. They just don't

568
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.300
really like the circumstances in which they've come to,

569
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.189
come to experience. And in that sense, they still

570
00:33:15.189 --> 00:33:18.229
affirm their will. But the moral argument that he

571
00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:23.420
gives, which is, again, quite peculiar, is that he

572
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.140
thinks that suicide precludes reaching the highest good. The

573
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.369
the summon bonham, the highest ethical good that there

574
00:33:30.369 --> 00:33:33.319
is, suicide prevents the attainment of that. And that

575
00:33:33.319 --> 00:33:39.449
highest good for Schopenhauer is what he calls salvationism,

576
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.500
kind of redemption from life, where one gives up

577
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.900
the will completely. And here he's drawing upon a

578
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.449
number of Indian traditions, Buddhism and Hinduism to show

579
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:52.170
that Craving and striving and desiring is the source

580
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.619
of suffering, and that once you break that will,

581
00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:56.619
once you give up that source of craving and

582
00:33:56.619 --> 00:34:00.020
desiring, suffering will diminish. Uh, YOU become in the

583
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.260
state of, I guess you would call enlightenment, where

584
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.939
you have this sort of distance to sublime experience

585
00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:09.179
of life, uh, where you've completely detached from it.

586
00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.580
Um, THERE is an interesting question about how to

587
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.780
the extent to which we can characterize that argument

588
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.408
as moral. Um, BUT he certainly thinks that he

589
00:34:17.408 --> 00:34:20.489
describes it explicitly as the only relevant moral reason

590
00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:23.928
against suicide. So, I think the general answer to

591
00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.208
your question is that the pessimists represent an interesting

592
00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:28.809
middle ground insofar as they accept elements of this

593
00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:33.339
kind of progressive. 19th century empirical approach. Uh, BUT

594
00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:35.259
they still have the 1 ft in the previous

595
00:34:35.259 --> 00:34:37.299
century in so far as they, they want to

596
00:34:37.299 --> 00:34:40.779
give moral justifications against the practice as well. Albeit

597
00:34:40.779 --> 00:34:43.618
milder ones, they still have this kind of normative

598
00:34:43.618 --> 00:34:46.938
framework and metaphysical framework for thinking about the morality

599
00:34:46.938 --> 00:34:47.618
of suicide.

600
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.469
So in your work, you also talk about James

601
00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.699
Sully's psychological reduction of philosophical pessimism. I mean, a

602
00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:00.909
view where he claims that pessimism, quote, is not

603
00:35:00.909 --> 00:35:03.989
really a philosophical theory at all, but rather a

604
00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:07.949
psychological state, a mood or disposition which is the

605
00:35:07.949 --> 00:35:12.310
product of socioeconomic circumstance, end quote. So, could you

606
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.689
tell us about that and what are your thoughts

607
00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:15.179
about it?

608
00:35:16.149 --> 00:35:19.020
Yeah, absolutely. So, um, yeah, James Sully was this

609
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.889
English psychologist who is not particularly well known now,

610
00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:25.580
but was at the forefront of developing psychology as

611
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.409
an independent discipline towards the end of the 19th

612
00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:32.780
century. Um, YOU know, he was very admired by

613
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.659
Freud and and others in the discipline for his

614
00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:39.850
insights. And he wrote this book called Pessimism. A

615
00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.489
history and a criticism, which is a sort of

616
00:35:41.489 --> 00:35:47.360
500 page uh attempted demolition of philosophical pessimist, pessimistic

617
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.889
arguments. And there's a whole chapter dedicated there to

618
00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:56.090
explaining what gives rise to pessimistic sentiment and an

619
00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:00.459
attempt to reduce philosophical pessimism to the sentiments which

620
00:36:00.459 --> 00:36:03.530
produce it. So his basic idea, which was not

621
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.489
original to him, right, this is a very common

622
00:36:05.489 --> 00:36:09.110
view. In the 19th century, and I think still

623
00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:14.350
persists today, um, is this idea that pessimism really

624
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:19.229
just is an expression of sentiments of disappointment, of

625
00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:24.270
personal suffering. Um, THE German, uh, way of cashing

626
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.729
this out was that pessimism is just this. Experience

627
00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:31.489
of Welschmertz, this kind of phenomenon of sort of

628
00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:34.689
pain of existence, this kind of experience of the

629
00:36:34.689 --> 00:36:38.739
world is really just suffering and misery, um. And

630
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:41.459
Sully's trying to motivate this view by saying, look,

631
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.939
there's something particularly interesting going on is that the

632
00:36:44.939 --> 00:36:49.060
rise of philosophical pessimism in the 19th century, he

633
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.260
claims, correlates with huge amounts of misery and economic

634
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.379
deprivation, um. And what he's trying to, to claim

635
00:36:58.379 --> 00:37:01.189
is that the best explanation for this correlation is

636
00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:04.790
that it's causal, that really philosophical pessimism just arises

637
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.860
from the circumstances of the time. People are suffering

638
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:13.600
in various ways, um. And they're also frustrated and

639
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.679
disappointment, disappointed by, uh, not being able to reach

640
00:37:17.679 --> 00:37:20.070
these ideals that were promised to them by various

641
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.000
social justice movements, you know, greater works for right,

642
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.080
for, uh, greater rights for workers, um, you know,

643
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.780
greater freedoms for citizens, etc. Um, THESE weren't really

644
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.060
realized, and so this creates disappointment and suffering, and

645
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.479
that pessimism is really just an expression of these

646
00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:42.489
sentiments. That's the best explanation for what's going on.

647
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.580
Um, AND as I said, this is a particularly

648
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.080
popular argument at the time, um, but I think

649
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.699
there are problems with this view, um, and I

650
00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:57.479
think some of these problems were anticipated by. Um,

651
00:37:57.889 --> 00:38:02.050
19th century pessimists themselves, uh, although maybe they didn't

652
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.959
quite develop them in the ways that they could

653
00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:07.489
have, but they presented some quite serious challenges to

654
00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:08.290
this argument.

655
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.020
And what would be some of those challenges or

656
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.959
at least tell us about the main ones.

657
00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:17.020
Yeah, so maybe I could just briefly give you

658
00:38:18.149 --> 00:38:21.080
three of these arguments that that have been discussed,

659
00:38:21.209 --> 00:38:25.500
um. So one way to challenge this idea that

660
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.290
Sully's presented us with is to. Basically challenged this

661
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.679
correlation that he's giving us, right? He's part of

662
00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:36.479
one of his premises is to, to say. 19th

663
00:38:36.479 --> 00:38:40.120
century Germany was full of suffering. Um, PEOPLE were,

664
00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:43.040
you know, and that he has some evidence for

665
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.199
this, right? There was the founders crash which caused

666
00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:50.280
huge immiseration. You know, life expectancy was not particularly

667
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.360
high. Um, VARIOUS wars are going on, right, with

668
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.719
the French, with surrounding states. Um, THERE'S religious persecution

669
00:38:58.719 --> 00:39:02.739
of, of various kinds, so. He has some evidence

670
00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.020
to point to, but one way of challenging this,

671
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.780
this reduction of uh pessimism to feelings of Welchmertz

672
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.780
or, or just feelings of despair and suffering, was

673
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.060
that actually the 19th century was characterized by this

674
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.100
feeling of hope, hopefulness rather than suffering and and

675
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.399
despair. Um, SO Schopenhauer himself makes this point in

676
00:39:25.399 --> 00:39:28.429
a letter to a friend of his, he says.

677
00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:32.000
You know, some people have accused me, even at

678
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.399
the time, they've accused me of really just being

679
00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:36.739
a product of my time, that everything was miserable

680
00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:39.919
at the time and that pessimism, my pessimism just

681
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:43.189
evolves out of this horrible circumstance that I find

682
00:39:43.189 --> 00:39:44.760
myself. And that, you know, if I lived 100

683
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.649
years prior, um, I would have, I would have

684
00:39:47.649 --> 00:39:50.600
been as optimistic as Leibniz. And he sort of

685
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.790
makes fun of this view by saying that actually,

686
00:39:53.909 --> 00:39:57.189
Germany at his, at his period was hopeful about

687
00:39:57.189 --> 00:40:01.310
progress. It was hopeful about the possibility of various

688
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.629
kinds of social revolution that will bring more freedom,

689
00:40:03.709 --> 00:40:06.790
bring more rights to people, uh, bring independence for

690
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.550
Germany, not being such a dependent state, not being

691
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.250
a fractured state, but unifying. Um, So he makes

692
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.889
this claim that actually, this idea that 19th century

693
00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:21.439
Germany is characterized by despair is just not true.

694
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.540
And if that's right, it would create problems for

695
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.820
Sully's argument. Um, Nietzsche also makes this same claim

696
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.729
in the gay Science. Uh, HE says, well, what,

697
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.919
what explains why pessimism is so popular now? Um,

698
00:40:34.929 --> 00:40:38.939
IT'S not because people are miserable, because People are

699
00:40:38.939 --> 00:40:42.820
actually extremely enthusiastic, and he's really referring to Bismarck's

700
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.739
unification and this idea about military prowess and. You

701
00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:52.739
know, people chanting Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles, right? It's

702
00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:56.050
extreme patriotism that captured the spirit of the time.

703
00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:59.620
Uh, SOMEONE who's written about this in more contemporary

704
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.179
terms, uh, Frederick Beyer, who's written a book called

705
00:41:03.179 --> 00:41:07.810
Welschmertz. It's all about the, the pessimistic tradition. Uh,

706
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.620
HE makes the same argument. He says, actually, the

707
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.250
19th century was characterized by Um, huge advances in,

708
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.919
in the empirical sciences, in medicine, in, in workers'

709
00:41:19.919 --> 00:41:22.439
rights, and people's well-being. So this is really a

710
00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:25.590
time for celebration and happiness rather than despair. So

711
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.719
if, if these kinds of claims are true, then

712
00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.959
it creates a problem for Sully's argument that this

713
00:41:30.959 --> 00:41:32.840
is really a product of its time, because the

714
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.949
time seems to be a little bit more optimistic

715
00:41:34.949 --> 00:41:37.959
than Sully's giving it credit for. That's one kind

716
00:41:37.959 --> 00:41:42.379
of challenge. Um, A second kind of challenge which

717
00:41:42.379 --> 00:41:45.280
is to, to say that, well, look, pessimism is

718
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.879
not as historically peculiar as Sully seems to be

719
00:41:48.879 --> 00:41:51.949
proposing in, in at least some of his arguments,

720
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:56.709
um. Because, you know, pessimists themselves made this point.

721
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.040
They said that look, this isn't something new. We're

722
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.719
actually just trying to capture philosophically, a view that

723
00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:05.639
has been embedded for thousands of years in different

724
00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:09.199
human traditions. Um, IN Buddhism, for example, they think

725
00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:12.350
they have the exact same worldview. In early Christianity,

726
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.040
they think that it's essentially a pessimistic view at

727
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.010
its core, that life is something we need to

728
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.820
be saved from. It needs something we need to

729
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.399
be redeemed from. Um, AND the, the, if you

730
00:42:23.399 --> 00:42:25.750
accept that claim, if you think that pessimism is

731
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:29.030
far more established in human history and is actually

732
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.860
far more adhered to, then rather than just a

733
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.590
a few peculiar individuals, um, then it looks a

734
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.010
lot harder to explain or to reduce pessimism to

735
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.300
sentiment in the way that Sully wants to do,

736
00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:44.989
because there isn't this kind of neat correlation as

737
00:42:44.989 --> 00:42:48.040
a peculiarity in a particular history of time. So

738
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.560
the pessimists are just gonna say to Sully, you're,

739
00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:54.320
you're begging the question here because pessimism is not

740
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.360
this new fad or phenomenon, right? It's something that's

741
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.360
deeply embedded in the history of human thought that

742
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.340
millions, they claim, have adhered to in some form

743
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:07.000
or another. Maybe not in strict philosophical terms, but

744
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.840
maybe in allegorical religious dress. Yeah. And I think

745
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.350
that um a 3rd, the 3rd kind of response

746
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.959
that could be given, and I think is pretty

747
00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:23.199
convincing. IS to challenge the inference from the origins

748
00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:27.159
of pessimistic sentiment and belief to the essence of

749
00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:30.439
what philosophical pessimism is. So in other words, there

750
00:43:30.439 --> 00:43:32.520
could be a kind of genetic fallacy going on

751
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.530
here that OK, you might grant to Sully that

752
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.639
these feelings of despair and Welchmert's suffering can lead

753
00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:44.399
one to endorse philosophical pessimism as a, as a

754
00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:46.750
theory, but that doesn't really say anything about the

755
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.639
reasons why we should accept pessimism. They can be

756
00:43:49.639 --> 00:43:52.679
rationally defended and, you know, they could be undermined

757
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:54.040
or they could be affirmed, but it's still a

758
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.199
rational issue. Even if it's true that a psychological

759
00:43:58.199 --> 00:44:01.800
condition can lead one to accept those reasons, right?

760
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.879
Um, SO. One of the things that's interesting there

761
00:44:06.879 --> 00:44:10.649
is that. What this does is it allows pessimists

762
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:13.350
to say that. If there is this kind of

763
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.070
distinction, then yes, you know, there might be a

764
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.110
correlation in the 19th century between this kind of

765
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.520
sentiment and pessimistic belief, but that doesn't really undermine

766
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.429
pessimism's status as a theory, right, as a, as

767
00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:29.780
having a theoretical foundation. And in fact, philosophers like

768
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:35.179
Olga Plumacher, um, explicitly made this challenge to Sully.

769
00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:40.600
They said, you know. Uh, Schopenhauer himself was a

770
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.790
man of Welchmertz. He was completely dominated by feeling,

771
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.570
right? Other pessimists thought of Schopenhauer as. Really corrupted

772
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.679
by his emotions. He gave in to them too

773
00:44:50.679 --> 00:44:53.850
much. They didn't reject pessimism on that basis, but

774
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.659
rather they thought that his pessimism could be improved

775
00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.129
by divorcing those sentiments from his theories. But they

776
00:45:00.129 --> 00:45:04.209
both, you know, Hartmann and Plumarker, they recognized Schopenhauer

777
00:45:04.209 --> 00:45:07.715
as Offering a genuine theory, raising pessimism up to

778
00:45:07.715 --> 00:45:11.455
a genuine theory, even if he was led to

779
00:45:11.455 --> 00:45:14.875
think in this way by these feelings, his peculiarities

780
00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:17.294
of his personality and so forth. So that would

781
00:45:17.294 --> 00:45:19.935
be the third challenge, to try and divorce the

782
00:45:19.935 --> 00:45:24.064
origins of pessimistic belief from its status as a,

783
00:45:24.135 --> 00:45:25.975
as a, as a rational theory.

784
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.080
And and what do you think that someone like

785
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.260
Schopenhauer would have replied to Sully's argument?

786
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.060
Yeah, I think along along these terms, I mean,

787
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.270
either one of these three, I think actually all

788
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.399
three of these, um, someone like Schopenhauer and certainly

789
00:45:44.399 --> 00:45:49.830
Pluemarker um at least developed initial responses along these

790
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.370
lines, um. To be fair to Sully, I think

791
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.899
he gives a lot, a lot more sophisticated a

792
00:45:56.899 --> 00:46:01.510
version of this argument than some of his contemporaries,

793
00:46:01.629 --> 00:46:04.459
uh, and colleagues. So he, one way of interpreting

794
00:46:04.459 --> 00:46:07.919
what he's doing is to say, These kinds of

795
00:46:07.919 --> 00:46:13.919
psychological reductions work only when we have established, we've

796
00:46:13.919 --> 00:46:16.909
sort of antecedently established that the reasons to accept

797
00:46:16.909 --> 00:46:20.459
pessimism as a theory aren't convincing. And it's then

798
00:46:20.459 --> 00:46:23.239
and only then we can start to speculate about

799
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:27.070
why people should come to endorse this peculiar theory.

800
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.320
So by analogy, for example, um, you could say.

801
00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:36.709
Look, we have excellent reasons to reject the idea

802
00:46:36.709 --> 00:46:39.709
that the earth is flat, right? But lots of

803
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:42.510
people still seem to believe this. Once we've given

804
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.590
those reasons for thinking that the earth is not

805
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.790
flat, we can then ask, OK, well, what kinds

806
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.739
of things lead people to believe this, right? One

807
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:54.540
way you might interpret what Sully's doing is something

808
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.550
along those lines, like how we, how we think

809
00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:00.260
about conspiracy theories. He might say, look, we've got

810
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.669
good reasons to think that the arguments that Schopenhauer,

811
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:06.780
Hartmann, Pluemarker give are maybe not convincing, and then

812
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.959
we can, we can ask the question, what sentiments

813
00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:12.459
have produced this? Like, if the theory doesn't work,

814
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.350
why have people been led to believe it? I

815
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.949
think that's a charitable way of reading what Sully's

816
00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:20.620
doing. And if, if something like that is correct,

817
00:47:20.709 --> 00:47:26.070
I think that Schopenhauer and Pluemarker have a a

818
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.989
more difficult task in trying to respond um to

819
00:47:29.989 --> 00:47:32.429
this, this kind of charge. The primary way of

820
00:47:32.429 --> 00:47:35.310
doing that is by, I think, if that's the

821
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:39.070
case, to try and bolster their arguments in some

822
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.149
way for the, the rational propositions they're putting forward.

823
00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:44.639
So, If we can only really ask about the

824
00:47:44.639 --> 00:47:49.199
psychological status of pessimism, once we've established that the

825
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:52.040
arguments in favor of the theory don't work, then

826
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.719
Schopenhauer and Plumarker have to make real sure that

827
00:47:54.719 --> 00:47:57.879
those arguments, um, really are convincing, that the evidence

828
00:47:57.879 --> 00:48:01.479
that they've provided, both conceptual and empirical, um, are

829
00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:04.080
going to convince someone like Sully that, OK, we

830
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.719
can't really ask the psychological question because it's still

831
00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:10.000
controversial whether life really is worth living, whether there's

832
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.770
more suffering than than happiness and so forth. Um,

833
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:19.110
BUT insofar as this kind of More general, um,

834
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.439
dismissal of pessimism as a mere psychological phenomenon. I

835
00:48:23.439 --> 00:48:26.040
think that the three challenges that we've, we've talked

836
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.080
about just moments ago, um, I think those are

837
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.760
pretty, um, uh, pretty plausible ways of trying to,

838
00:48:32.879 --> 00:48:33.520
to respond.

839
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.459
OK, so one last question, maybe a topic then.

840
00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:42.199
uh, WE'VE talked about uh the philosophy of suicide

841
00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:46.580
up until the 19th century. How about the philosophy

842
00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.629
of suicide nowadays? I mean, what does it look

843
00:48:49.629 --> 00:48:52.540
like? And when it comes to the several different

844
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.310
approaches to suicide, we've Gone through, like, for example,

845
00:48:56.389 --> 00:49:00.820
the moral approach, the psychosociological approach, the biological approach,

846
00:49:01.149 --> 00:49:04.100
which uh do you think are, is the most,

847
00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:06.750
if there's one that is more dominant than the

848
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.389
others, which is the most dominant nowadays?

849
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.860
Yeah, it's a good question. Um, I, I, my

850
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.320
view of this is that contemporary um. Philosophy of

851
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:24.479
suicide is far more interdisciplinary uh than any of

852
00:49:24.479 --> 00:49:27.840
these previous approaches, so it's not strictly one or

853
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.989
the other that we've considered today. But rather, it

854
00:49:30.989 --> 00:49:33.949
takes into account that we need a sort of

855
00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:38.030
more unified and comprehensive understanding of, of suicide, which

856
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:44.020
builds in empirical considerations, psychological, sociological, anthropological approaches, as

857
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:49.620
well as philosophical analysis, which engages with, yeah, conceptual

858
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.790
discussion, um, and these, these, these moral questions have

859
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.469
never really gone away. They've just kind of become

860
00:49:56.469 --> 00:49:59.659
a bit more sophisticated. They've morphed into, you know,

861
00:50:00.159 --> 00:50:03.620
Uh, particular traditions of approaching suicide, so you still

862
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.870
find people who have broadly Kian approaches to thinking

863
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.310
about the philosophy of suicide, the morality of it.

864
00:50:09.719 --> 00:50:13.760
Um, YOU still have humans who deploy his arguments,

865
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:18.169
uh, or refine them in various ways. Um, SO

866
00:50:18.179 --> 00:50:20.419
you have figures like Michael Cholby who does a

867
00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:23.620
lot of work in this area, who's explicitly interdisciplinary

868
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.879
in this respect and. A lot of people who

869
00:50:27.169 --> 00:50:29.939
have developed the philosophy of suicide into thinking about

870
00:50:29.939 --> 00:50:37.719
adjacent um. Adjacent uh phenomena, uh, for example, Um,

871
00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:42.780
experiences of grief, um. The and different kinds of

872
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.780
ways in which suicide can affect people um in

873
00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.810
various ways. So, uh, my, my view is generally

874
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.409
the state of the philosophy of suicide now is

875
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.429
far more comprehensive and interdisciplinary, and that we've moved

876
00:50:56.429 --> 00:51:02.620
away from this exclusively, specifically this exclusively medicalized um

877
00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.699
approach to the uh to the phenomenon, which I

878
00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:07.540
think is a a welcome response.

879
00:51:09.189 --> 00:51:12.850
Great. So just before we go, would you like

880
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.570
to tell people again where, where they can find

881
00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:17.439
you and your work on the internet?

882
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.540
Uh, YES. So, uh, all my work is, is

883
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.580
posted on my website, which is Patrick Hassan.com. Uh,

884
00:51:24.699 --> 00:51:26.260
YOU can also find links to my work on

885
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.219
the department website at Cardiff University. Um, AND some

886
00:51:30.219 --> 00:51:33.100
of the issues that we've been talking about, uh,

887
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.379
one is appearing, has appeared in the British Journal

888
00:51:36.379 --> 00:51:39.580
for the History of Philosophy, James Sully's Psychological reduction

889
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.189
of pessimism, um, and some of these issues about

890
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.739
the philosophy of suicide in the 19th century and

891
00:51:45.739 --> 00:51:49.260
how pessimists responded. Uh, SOME of my thoughts about

892
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.129
that are forthcoming in a chapter, um, in the

893
00:51:52.129 --> 00:51:55.159
Oxford Handbook to the Philosophy of Suicide, edited by

894
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.290
Paolo Stellino and Michael Cholby. So that should be

895
00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.929
out, uh, this year, I think.
