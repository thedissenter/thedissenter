00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.079
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:06.099
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.300
today I'm here with the return guest, Doctor Alexander

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Rosenberg, and we're talking about his latest book, Blunt

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.620
Instrument, Why Economic Theory Can't Get Any Better, Why

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.420
We Need It Anyway, and that is the nice

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.250
book cover. So Doctor

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.680
Rosen instrument, you can see it on the cover.

9
00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.680
Yes, it certainly is so, Doctor Rosenberg, thank you

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.959
so much for coming again on the show. It's

11
00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.500
always a pleasure to talk with you.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.240
And with you, Ricardo.

13
00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.270
So I mean, let me first ask you, why

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.209
do you think we need to know about economic

15
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.790
theory?

16
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.139
So it's not that we need to know about

17
00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:51.990
economic theory in general it's that. The people who

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.529
consume economic theory professionally, um, policy planners, legislators, um,

19
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.349
uh, those who are involved with the public institutions

20
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:11.250
of our society need to understand the, Uh, the

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.769
way in which these institutions interact with individual rational

22
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.290
egoists, uh, uh, those among us who are always

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.129
looking out for number one, ready to cut corners,

24
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:28.550
take shortcuts, take risks, and otherwise game the system.

25
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.209
There are a few people in society that do

26
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:39.510
this continually and at um uh a considerable cost

27
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.089
to the rest of society. There are some people

28
00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:44.730
in our society who never do this, and most

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.879
of us do it some of the time. So,

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.809
um uh it's at least one portion of economic

31
00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:56.010
theory that is absolutely indispensable to designing social institutions

32
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.650
in such a way as to save our civilization.

33
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.000
And that's the part of economic theory called game

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.250
theory, the most badly named. Um, Uh, DISCIPLINE in

35
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.449
the social sciences because it's not about games, it's

36
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:16.809
about strategic interaction, and everybody always is engaged in

37
00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.250
strategic interaction with other people.

38
00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.970
So we're going to talk about game theory later,

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.690
but I mean, I've heard people discussing this many

40
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.449
times, but is economics a science?

41
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:40.529
Well, uh, insofar as it, uh, aims to explain

42
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:46.279
and predict human behavior, um, it at least, um,

43
00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:54.050
endorses the demands made on sciences, um. Uh, WITH

44
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.089
regard to their methods and their, uh, approach, but

45
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.169
unfortunately, as we've seen over the last 250 years,

46
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.330
economics is very bad at predicting, and therefore we

47
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
have no idea whether any of its explanations do

48
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.589
anything more than simply reduce human feelings of curiosity.

49
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.929
Um, AND for those two reasons, it's hard to

50
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.320
identify economics as an empirical science, despite the Nobel

51
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.910
Prize that the Swedish central bank has erected in

52
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.309
order to give it the prestige associated with the

53
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:35.360
other sciences, and certainly also despite the relatively sophisticated

54
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.639
appearance of mathematics that it um bears by comparison

55
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.250
to the other social sciences. So, the short answer

56
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.929
is, in my opinion, it's not a science. It's

57
00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:50.130
a tool that we use for coping with one

58
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.529
another's behavior, and it's a pretty blunt tool, one

59
00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:59.089
that has been unimprovable in at least 150 years

60
00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.610
since it took its current form in the work

61
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.559
of the marginalist economists among whom John Stuart Mill

62
00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:05.589
was the most important.

63
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.910
And that's the title of the book, right?

64
00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.619
Yes, well, it's a blunt instrument, and it hasn't

65
00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.600
gotten any better and it can't get any better.

66
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.738
Mhm. So, and explain why, because this is something

67
00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:24.720
you talk about in your book, why economics is

68
00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:29.700
a theory drive theory driven, sorry, and not data-driven,

69
00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:32.179
and is that a problem or

70
00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:37.279
not? Well, it's theory driven because the economist, uh,

71
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.959
pursues a research program that involves, um, uh, elaborating

72
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.459
on. Uh, uh, RATIONAL choice theory and its implications

73
00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:54.559
in, uh, particular initial boundary conditions, um, and the

74
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.450
method of choice is the thought experiment. There are

75
00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:04.140
relatively few cases where the economic theorist is actually

76
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.500
confronting, Ah, data and the revising theory in the

77
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.420
light of data. I need to say, um, when

78
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.500
I use the word economist here, I'm being, ah,

79
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.579
a little loose. I'm talking about economic theory. There

80
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.380
are many important, uh, components of economics, subdisciplines of

81
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.649
economics that are entirely empirical in their character, um,

82
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.415
and their. Some of the greatest work by economic

83
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:37.774
economists in the last several decades has involved empirical

84
00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:40.095
work. So for example, the Nobel Prize was given

85
00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:43.674
to 2 economists, 3 economists about 3 years ago

86
00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:51.190
for, Contriving natural experiments, brilliant natural experiments that shed

87
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.589
tremendous light on the inadequacies of conventional economic theory,

88
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.029
for example, the claims about the impact of of

89
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.149
minimum wage laws on supply and demand of labor.

90
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.109
So what I'm talking about is, as the subtitle

91
00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:11.350
says, economic theory, not economics as a whole, macroecon

92
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.380
um excuse me, econometrics, um. Uh, uh, uh, ECONOMIC

93
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.179
statistics, um, these are important areas of research which

94
00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:28.809
shed real light on phenomena. It's economic theory. Particularly

95
00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:32.250
economic models of the sort we learn in 1st

96
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.709
and 2nd courses in microeconomics, and now in macroeconomics,

97
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.609
since there's no such thing really as macroeconomics, it's

98
00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:43.209
just more micro that I want to say is

99
00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.769
a blunt and unimprovable instrument.

100
00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.589
Let me ask you now about the idea of

101
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:54.519
homo economicus. I mean, just to be really straightforward

102
00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:58.119
here, I've talked with several economists on the show

103
00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:02.500
already about this idea and uh I don't remember

104
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.760
any of them telling me that it still makes

105
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.440
any sense. I remember, for example, an interview that

106
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.200
I did back in 2019 with the late great

107
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.489
Doctor Herbert Ginttis and he did with His collaborators

108
00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:22.410
several experiments across different cultures and societies, and he

109
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.369
told me that he didn't find homo economicus anywhere.

110
00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:32.130
So, uh, do you think that this idea can

111
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.730
make sense in any way? And if not, why

112
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.529
doesn't economics give it up?

113
00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:42.429
So Ginters and a number of other important cognitive

114
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:46.410
social psychologists have given us excellent evidence in cross-cultural

115
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.450
experiments, generally using game theory, interestingly enough, or setting

116
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.799
up experiments using the guideline of game theory that

117
00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:56.010
have demonstrated that we do not behave in the

118
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.690
way that the rational choice theory models suggest humans

119
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.489
behave, and that's probably a very good thing in

120
00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:05.890
the long run for all of us, um. Uh.

121
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.049
The question therefore is why does economic theory continue

122
00:08:12.049 --> 00:08:16.429
to employ rational choice theory that is homo economicus,

123
00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:19.149
and of course the reason is that it's required

124
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:23.290
in order for the econo economic theorists to build

125
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.119
the proof of the Pareto optimum. Of a general

126
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:33.280
equilibrium in competitive exchange, the first theorem of welfare

127
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.440
economics, has nothing to do with welfare, it has

128
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.719
to do with, um, maximizing human preferences, tells us

129
00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:43.960
that the perfectly competitive market is always one that

130
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.914
reaches a general equilibrium that is parade. Optimum, and

131
00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:50.934
that is a guide that is used by economic

132
00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:55.015
theorists in prescribing and advising on the way in

133
00:08:55.015 --> 00:08:58.835
which the real economy, real markets should be revised

134
00:08:58.835 --> 00:09:02.864
in order to more closely approach perfectly competitive ones,

135
00:09:03.114 --> 00:09:05.275
since those are the ones for whom, for which

136
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:08.330
we have the proof of Pareto optimality. To get

137
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.690
this proof, they need rational choice theory, and that's

138
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.969
why rational choice theory continues to be central to

139
00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:17.849
all of economic theory, and the imperviousness of economic

140
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:21.729
theory to behavioral economics over the past 30 years

141
00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:26.520
since people like Kahnman and Tversky began to, To

142
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.559
expand its uh uh uh illumination on actual human

143
00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:34.219
behavior and since Richard Thaler began to try to

144
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.359
find some way in which it might penetrate economics,

145
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.960
the imperviousness of economic theory to behavioral economics is

146
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.440
another reflection of the indispensability. To their aim of.

147
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:51.590
Keeping this theorem as the watchword of institution design,

148
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.479
um, of rational choice theory, homo economicus.

149
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.599
Why isn't macroeconomic theory sensitive to even the biggest

150
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:08.880
economic upheavals? I mean, we've gone through so many

151
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.140
economic upheavals. Why is it that macroeconomic theory seems

152
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.559
to not be sensitive to that?

153
00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:19.770
So it was, uh, or at least it aimed

154
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.849
to be during the period after its invention in

155
00:10:22.849 --> 00:10:28.919
the 1930s by, uh, Frisch and Tinbergen, on the

156
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:34.130
mathematical side and Keynes conceptually. And over the period

157
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.460
until the 1970s it devoted itself to understanding the

158
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.340
actual character of the business cycle and the causes

159
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.159
of recessions and depressions as well as runaway inflations.

160
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.700
But then it became a cropper on the stagflation

161
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.580
of the 1970s, and economists, interestingly enough, instead of

162
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:06.000
responding to the, Crisis that arose for macroeconomics by

163
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.229
trying to improve on the theory and figure out

164
00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:15.010
how revisions might enable it more adequately to cope

165
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.640
with um stagflation, they simply turned their backs on

166
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.609
it and returned to classical microeconomics. And ah imposed

167
00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:26.989
the demand on macro theory that it assume, assume

168
00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:30.450
that markets cleared and that agents are rational, and

169
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.650
by doing that, it hollowed out the entire of

170
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.929
Keynesian economics, and converted macroeconomics into, To just another

171
00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.250
version of microeconomics. And if you look at contemporary

172
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.090
models like ah dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium theories, you'll

173
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:51.049
see they start with the rational economic agent, homo

174
00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:51.900
economicus.

175
00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:56.469
Right, I mean, in the book you argue that

176
00:11:56.469 --> 00:12:02.330
standard economic theory cannot explain the labor market nor

177
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.869
the financial market. Can you tell us about that?

178
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.270
I mean, can you explain that point you make

179
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.510
in the book? Interestingly enough, these are the two

180
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.349
most important markets for working stiffs like you and

181
00:12:14.349 --> 00:12:17.059
me. A working stiff as a person who earns

182
00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:20.020
their money and saves for their retirement, um, and

183
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.219
these two markets are the most important for us

184
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:24.739
because the labor market is the only market in

185
00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:26.979
on which we are all, almost all of us

186
00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:30.140
sellers and not buyers. Every other market we are

187
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.340
buyers and deal with, uh, imperfect competition, uh, monopoly

188
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.140
of various kinds. On the labor market, we are

189
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.179
all sellers and deal with monopsony and, um, various,

190
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:49.239
um, versions of monopsony. Ah, as such, um, the

191
00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:51.619
employer is always in a position to rent seek

192
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.820
because there are a small number of employers and

193
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.280
a large number of employees, and the employers are

194
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.419
easily able to solve their collective action problem of

195
00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:06.520
setting up, um, uh, uh, Wage rates and conditions

196
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.159
of labor that we can't bargain to, uh, a

197
00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:18.070
um, a competitive price-taking equilibrium for. We are inevitably

198
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.359
subject to exploitation by, um, the wage setters, by

199
00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:25.289
the employers, simply because there's a small number of

200
00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:28.320
them who can solve their collective action problems to

201
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.280
rent seek and a large number of us who

202
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.500
cannot solve our collective action problems to rent seek.

203
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.880
Interestingly, the financial market. Ah, reflects some of the

204
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.119
same market failures, um, and is of equal importance

205
00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:46.960
because the financial market is the most important market.

206
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.090
For the growth of the economy as a whole.

207
00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:54.770
All of us working stiffs are, uh, investors. We

208
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.400
are the people who provide our postponable consumption, our

209
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.440
savings, um, to financial institutions. There are huge numbers

210
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.130
of us providing savings to financial institutions in order

211
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:14.280
to secure, um, ah, ah retirement, um, support. There

212
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.640
are a relatively smaller number of large corporations that

213
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.619
need to borrow this money in order to um

214
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.039
uh build capital goods, whether it's highways or airplanes

215
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:31.159
or condos, um, and between the large numbers of

216
00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:36.000
sellers of loanable funds, us, who can't solve our

217
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.900
collective action problems, and the relatively smaller number of,

218
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.210
Ah, lent a borrowers, the large corporations that need

219
00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.270
quantities of money while they build things that won't

220
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.500
be online for years after they start building them,

221
00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:56.510
between, A small number of sellers of, of uh

222
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.150
loanable funds and the and the slightly larger number

223
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.190
of buyers and the and the relatively small number

224
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.380
of buyers of loanable funds, there's the middlemen, the

225
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.260
financial institutions, the bankers, the uh mutual funds, the

226
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.909
insurance companies, the venture capitalists, the investment banks, and

227
00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:20.109
they of course are the smallest in number, and

228
00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:24.809
they, Most easily solve their collective action problems in

229
00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:28.690
setting up, um, um, institutions that enable them to

230
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.929
cream off the top, uh, on both sides of

231
00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:37.419
the transaction, both, um, Uh, uh, rent seeking in

232
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:41.440
the ways in which they accept loanable funds from

233
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.020
us little guys, and rent seeking in the way

234
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.799
that they lend the large packages that they put

235
00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:49.280
together to the big guys who need the big

236
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.260
loans. And so these two markets are the ones

237
00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:56.159
that fail the most and most pressingly, and yet

238
00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:58.119
they're the two most important markets for most of

239
00:15:58.119 --> 00:15:58.440
us.

240
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.229
OK, so earlier you referenced the fact that economic

241
00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:09.429
theory seems to be very bad at uh predicting

242
00:16:09.609 --> 00:16:14.289
events at prediction generally. Uh, WHY is it then

243
00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:20.130
that economics still takes uh it so seriously?

244
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:26.690
Well, As I said uh before, the, the part

245
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.919
of the economics that's really important. Is game theory,

246
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.080
and game theory is all of the economic theory

247
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.299
that we need in order to deal with those

248
00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:42.280
cases of market failure in which rent seekers find

249
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.719
an opportunity to rip the rest of us off.

250
00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:47.840
And since the perfectly competitive market, on the one

251
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.960
hand, is the only completely incentive compatible market, the

252
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.205
perfectly competitive market, because everybody's a price. TAKER can

253
00:16:56.205 --> 00:17:00.364
never um allow for the kind of rip-off rent

254
00:17:00.364 --> 00:17:03.835
seeking that I'm talking about, but it doesn't exist

255
00:17:03.835 --> 00:17:07.064
in reality, and therefore every market is in fact,

256
00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:10.483
to some extent either small, in the case of

257
00:17:10.483 --> 00:17:13.444
the gas stations in your neighborhood or large in

258
00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.364
the case of the financial institutions that you lend

259
00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:21.550
your money to engaged in rent seeking. And everybody's

260
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.989
disadvantage and what governments and, er, voters need to

261
00:17:26.989 --> 00:17:34.880
do is identify, Revisions, reforms, changes to the institutions

262
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.640
that regulate the market in order to make them

263
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.479
more incentive compatible. Now, doing that is always an

264
00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:46.199
arms race because every time we rearrange rules to

265
00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:50.560
make the market um more incentive compatible, to harness

266
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.020
people's selfish. To produce uh uh welfare producing ends,

267
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.709
um, some smart lawyer or accountant figures a new

268
00:17:58.709 --> 00:18:00.829
way around it. So if you look at the

269
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:04.670
history of financial regulations from Glass-Steagall to to Frank

270
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.430
Dodds, you'll see that every time we try to

271
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.390
close the barn door, somebody's figured out how to

272
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:16.329
get the horse to escape, um, ah. The function,

273
00:18:16.449 --> 00:18:19.969
the, the, the need for economic theory, in particular

274
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:23.310
for, for game theory is to figure out how

275
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.609
to improve institutions in this never ending arms race,

276
00:18:28.849 --> 00:18:32.130
um, and there are some wonderful examples um of

277
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.290
how to do that. Alvin Roth, the great economist

278
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.300
who won the Nobel Prize for his design of

279
00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:45.040
kidney transplant, um, uh, networks and uh uh. Medical

280
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.300
school, hospital matching systems, um, he made a significant,

281
00:18:50.719 --> 00:18:53.979
ah, contribution to human welfare by showing us how

282
00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:56.579
economic theory, in particular game theory can be used

283
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.189
to, ah, fashion, to craft these kinds of incentive,

284
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:08.280
incentive compatible institutions that classical economic theory, um, has

285
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.420
no grip on because it, uh, uh, Is driven

286
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.219
by the perfectly competitive model.

287
00:19:16.859 --> 00:19:19.699
OK, so I don't think this is something that

288
00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:23.300
at least you address directly in your book, but

289
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.420
since I've had this conversation with uh economists on

290
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.969
the show, and on the show I've had people,

291
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.099
economists who are more, who lean more toward uh

292
00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:37.609
capitalism, others that are more soci that are perhaps

293
00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:40.522
a little bit more on the socialist. Of things

294
00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:44.503
like Dr. Richard Wolff and others. But in late,

295
00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:48.422
in late 2022, I had a very interesting conversation

296
00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:52.583
on the show with an economist, Clara Mattei. She's

297
00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:57.103
from the New School for Social Research, and she

298
00:19:57.103 --> 00:20:00.552
wrote a very interesting book titled The Capital Order

299
00:20:00.552 --> 00:20:04.046
where she explores the history of the. Of Italian

300
00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:09.145
fascism and links it to austerity measures, that is

301
00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:14.656
liberal measures in response to the uh the Great

302
00:20:14.656 --> 00:20:19.306
Depression in the late 1920s, early 1930s, and one

303
00:20:19.306 --> 00:20:21.265
of the things, one of the points that she

304
00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:23.426
makes in the book, and I also allowed her

305
00:20:23.426 --> 00:20:26.910
space to make in that interview is that. She

306
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.670
and other people think that we should be aware

307
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.219
of the fact, at least this is her point,

308
00:20:32.589 --> 00:20:38.750
that, uh, economics is not ideology-free, and she thinks

309
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.630
it is, uh, of course, that's her position that

310
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:47.270
it is uh dominated by uh capitalist or as

311
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.135
some Marxist. LIKE to call it nowadays neoliberal capitalist,

312
00:20:52.474 --> 00:20:56.864
uh, position. I mean by a neoliberal capitalist, uh,

313
00:20:56.875 --> 00:21:00.555
approach to economics. I mean, do, do, uh, I'm,

314
00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:03.354
I'm not sure if you agree with that specific

315
00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:07.275
point, but with the broader point that economics is

316
00:21:07.275 --> 00:21:11.055
not ideology-free. What do you make of it?

317
00:21:11.755 --> 00:21:17.469
Um. I'm frequently heard to say that economic, that

318
00:21:17.489 --> 00:21:20.050
that capitalism is the worst of all economic systems

319
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.640
except for all the others. Um AND uh there's

320
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.829
nothing like the 20th century to show the problems

321
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:33.119
associated with state central planning and uh other institutional

322
00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:39.280
arrangements for driving a large, um, urban, uh, technologically

323
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.650
driven economy. um. So I'm not a particular fan

324
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.949
of state socialism, er, and I think by, by

325
00:21:48.949 --> 00:21:51.430
and large nowadays no socialist is. I have never

326
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.560
heard a socialist since uh the eclipse of Clement

327
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.949
Attlee's government argue for the ownership of the means

328
00:21:58.949 --> 00:22:02.650
of production as the solution to the problem of

329
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.900
um er er er plenty, um. We know what

330
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.420
the problems associated with the ownership of the means

331
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.939
of production by the state are, and what we

332
00:22:13.939 --> 00:22:17.579
need, of course, is the social market, a very

333
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:22.140
strong social safety net operating under a market as

334
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.140
close to competitive as possible, but unfortunately we can't

335
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.339
get very close to competitive, and that means we

336
00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:32.930
need a lot of regulation. Um, NOW, ah, Is

337
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.969
the economic theory that we can put our hands

338
00:22:36.969 --> 00:22:42.920
on ideologically driven, um, I think a lot of

339
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:50.359
economists who have advanced our understanding of decentralized incentive

340
00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:57.199
compatible institutional arrangements are very far from ideologues of

341
00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:02.079
right-wing Chicago school capitalism, and I think most prominently

342
00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:05.140
of Kenneth Arrow, who did more to advance the

343
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.469
agenda of economic theory in the 20th century than

344
00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:13.500
any other economist, um. And by economic theory, I,

345
00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:18.750
I mean microeconomic theory, and was very far from

346
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.479
being a, a shill for the capitalist system. Um,

347
00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:27.619
HE was strongly committed to, for example, taking healthcare

348
00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:31.709
out of the market economy, um. And I think

349
00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:36.310
you can take the tools of economic theory that

350
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.420
are useful, um, limited though they are, and apply

351
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.390
them in the design of institutions of the sort

352
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.449
that will address the interests and needs of people

353
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:53.930
that the socialist thinks are ignored by capitalism, um,

354
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:56.329
and I'm not sure that this is a really

355
00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.959
adequate answer to your question, um. Is rational choice

356
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:03.719
theory a matter of ideology? No, I think it's

357
00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:08.520
a matter of using uh the assumption that society

358
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.280
is composed of Hobbes' fool and, and, ah, Hume's

359
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.140
knave, and ah so designing institutions as to protect

360
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.959
us from them, and that's not particularly ideological.

361
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.849
OK. So, uh, but given its track record, do

362
00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:30.270
you think that we should treat the theory that

363
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.729
drives economic explanations as a guide to the future?

364
00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:38.890
We can't. It's been a terrible guide to the

365
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.510
past, and so it's track record deprives of it,

366
00:24:42.569 --> 00:24:44.829
of any standing as a guide to the future,

367
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.849
um. The only, uh, I think a reasonable source

368
00:24:49.849 --> 00:24:53.540
of material to guide us in the future is

369
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.930
economic data and our sort of by the seat

370
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.900
of the pants extrapolation from it, from time to

371
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.500
time, um, and the more data is available and

372
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.300
the more artificial intelligence there is for mining that

373
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.760
data, the better we will be at, Uh, extrapolating

374
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.599
to the future from the past, but that extrapolation

375
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:21.650
needs to be heavily theory-free. In my opinion, ah,

376
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.689
otherwise it will simply replicate the defects of past

377
00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:29.290
explanations, and I said when we began, the important

378
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.459
thing to see is, although economic theory looks like

379
00:25:32.459 --> 00:25:36.369
in many cases, ah, that it satisfies our itch

380
00:25:36.369 --> 00:25:40.810
of curiosity in retrospect when it explains past events,

381
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.780
whether the financial crisis, or the dot-com bubble, um,

382
00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:48.719
or, um, Ah, the impact of COVID on the

383
00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:54.000
supply chain, um, economic theory, ah, because it doesn't

384
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.880
have a strong record of predictive improvement, ah, has

385
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.599
no basis for claiming that any of its retrospective

386
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:03.199
explanations are any good at all at doing anything

387
00:26:03.199 --> 00:26:07.839
except reducing our itch of curiosity. And itch, which

388
00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:10.839
is, of course, um based on the fact that

389
00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:13.869
we think of ourselves as rational, look out for

390
00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:15.699
number one, maximizer.

391
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.380
So let's talk then more about game theory. You've

392
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.900
already mentioned it, but how do we get then

393
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.619
to game theory and what is game theory?

394
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.239
So as I said before, game theory, the worst

395
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:37.589
name for a serious enterprise, uh. That I can

396
00:26:37.589 --> 00:26:42.069
think of is the study of strategic interactions, that

397
00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:47.469
is, it's the analysis of how agents choose under

398
00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:50.349
the condition that they know or believe that other

399
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:53.420
agents will be making strategic choices and that the

400
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.709
outcome of their choice is contingent, at least in

401
00:26:56.709 --> 00:26:59.900
part on the choices that other agents make. So

402
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.140
for example, The monopolist can set prices wherever the

403
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.500
monopolist wants to, but the monopolist won't maximize revenue

404
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.420
unless he can figure out what the highest price

405
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.420
is that the consumer is willing to pay, and

406
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.260
if the consumers can solve their collective action problem.

407
00:27:18.785 --> 00:27:22.464
Withholding purchase, they can have an impact on how

408
00:27:22.464 --> 00:27:26.484
much the monopolist, um, will be willing to charge,

409
00:27:26.824 --> 00:27:30.025
and so in the simplest case of, you know,

410
00:27:30.104 --> 00:27:35.739
monopoly or monopsony, ah, microeconomic theory almost never, Uh,

411
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.449
expresses the fact that the demand curve that both

412
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:44.010
parties need to, uh, identify the shape of in

413
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.530
order to figure out what price they should actually

414
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.449
charge or what price they can reasonably be expected

415
00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:52.810
to hold out for, that demand curve can never

416
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.709
be determined. You have never seen a real demand

417
00:27:55.709 --> 00:27:59.109
curve in an economics textbook, you only see nice

418
00:27:59.109 --> 00:28:02.930
downward sloping lines, and that reflects the fact that

419
00:28:03.109 --> 00:28:08.219
in a price setting situation, Both parties have to

420
00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:11.859
engage in experimentation to figure out what the best

421
00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:15.150
price they can charge or what the highest price

422
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.099
they will be um uh able to accept, turns

423
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:22.859
out to be. And this kind of strategic interaction

424
00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:27.089
problem between agents in a market is characteristic of

425
00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:31.729
all exchanges, and game theory provides us with the

426
00:28:31.729 --> 00:28:37.380
only tools, Uh, for identifying the optimal strategies in

427
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.660
these exchanges, so in the labor market, the optimal

428
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:48.430
strategy for, um, um, Employers is to establish a

429
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.430
coalition of employers that depresses wages, and the optimal

430
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:58.270
strategy for workers is to join unions and demand

431
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:03.709
wages on the basis of of union negotiation. And

432
00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:09.260
if the employers can lobby state legislatures to pass

433
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.199
a right to work laws that give non-union workers

434
00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:16.750
exactly the same advantage as union workers in in

435
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.910
the workplace, then they will effectively have used the

436
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.800
tools of game theory in order to destroy the

437
00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:27.829
collective action problem solution that has been characteristic of

438
00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:30.270
labor over the last 150 years.

439
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.579
And so in your view, you think that game

440
00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:41.859
theory when compared to uh the dominant standard economic

441
00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:46.420
theory, it uh can explain, predict and correct real

442
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.020
markets better?

443
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:51.380
Well, I'm not sure that it can predict because

444
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:56.020
of the arms race uh issue that uh every

445
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.219
move on the part of one strategic agent in

446
00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:05.410
a uh strategic interaction will often result in changes

447
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.380
in the moves of other agents, and so you're

448
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.739
in a dynamic situation that is constantly moving along

449
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:17.099
an arms race trajectory. And that makes prediction difficult,

450
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.619
but at least it makes medium-term and short-term responses,

451
00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:26.079
ah, sensitive to the actual situation and likely to

452
00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:28.719
at least in the short run, secure the objectives

453
00:30:28.719 --> 00:30:33.650
of the participants. Now, retrospectively, I think game theory

454
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.790
is wonderful at explaining things. There's a wonderful paper

455
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.209
by a uh a cultural anthropologist named Mackey in

456
00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:44.170
which he uses game theory to explain foot binding

457
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.689
in China over 1000 years. And that explanation has

458
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:54.130
tremendous, uh, um, uh, insight, far greater than cultural

459
00:30:54.130 --> 00:31:00.329
anthropology, social history, um, or Freudian psychodynamic, uh, explanations

460
00:31:00.329 --> 00:31:04.010
of foot binding. Um, BUT I think, you know,

461
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.800
prediction is a mug's game when it comes to

462
00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:11.310
the interaction of relatively small numbers of people over

463
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:16.239
lengthy periods of time. It's, Much more feasible with

464
00:31:16.239 --> 00:31:21.310
large quantities of economic data and uh search engines

465
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.589
that enable us to identify trends.

466
00:31:24.719 --> 00:31:29.439
Isn't that Chinese foot binding something that you explore

467
00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:32.680
in your book, how history gets things wrong? I

468
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.880
mean, I, I think I remember talking with you

469
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.400
about that in our first interview.

470
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.920
That's right, and I, and it was, it was

471
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.819
thinking about that when we, uh, when I wrote

472
00:31:41.819 --> 00:31:44.640
that book that eventually got me started on writing

473
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.920
this book, um, yeah, about economic theory, that and

474
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.189
the fact that I've been. Talking about economic theory

475
00:31:52.189 --> 00:31:55.469
for a very long time in the last century,

476
00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:57.910
but the economists always ignored what I had to

477
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.069
say, so I stopped and started doing philosophy of

478
00:32:00.069 --> 00:32:03.589
biology, um, but ever since the financial crisis, people

479
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:06.109
have become much more interested in what the matter

480
00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:07.290
is with economics.

481
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:14.140
So if economic theory has all of these uh

482
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.800
shortcomings, why can't we do without it?

483
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:28.439
Well, We can do without. Um, Microeconomic theory as

484
00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:33.319
a tool for explaining and predicting uh aggregate behavior,

485
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.439
which means effectively we have to do without what

486
00:32:36.439 --> 00:32:41.069
contemporary economists call macroeconomics because it's just disguised microeconomics.

487
00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:44.050
Um, WHAT we can't do without. Of course, is

488
00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:49.270
the assumption of homo economicus, rational choice theory, in

489
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.380
conditions of market failure where both parties to the

490
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.250
market exchange have a strategic interaction problem to solve,

491
00:32:56.589 --> 00:32:59.609
because the only tools we have for understanding. Ah,

492
00:32:59.619 --> 00:33:04.930
strategic interaction problems and designing, ah, playing fields so

493
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.890
that they become anywhere close to level in the

494
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.569
interaction between the strategic agents is given by game

495
00:33:12.569 --> 00:33:16.010
theory, and by extensions of game theory. So here's

496
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.199
a wonderful example, um, ah, An economist won the

497
00:33:20.199 --> 00:33:24.209
Nobel Prize for showing that in auctions it's much

498
00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:27.209
more efficient to arrange the auctions so that the

499
00:33:27.209 --> 00:33:31.530
winner, the, the buyer who bids the highest price,

500
00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.170
only has to pay the price offered by the

501
00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:39.050
2nd highest bidder. Now that is such a counterintuitive

502
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.750
idea, and yet the game theory. Can show you

503
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.550
why setting an auction up to do that as

504
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:49.189
federal bandwidth auctions for telephone bandwidth in the 20

505
00:33:49.189 --> 00:33:52.589
or 30 years ago did. Only a game theorist

506
00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:56.750
can show you why doing that makes the seller

507
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:02.150
of the auctioned item better off than setting up

508
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:08.510
a uh uh highest bidder wins auction. It's counterintuitive,

509
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.639
but it's, it's, it's wonderful.

510
00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:15.040
Yeah, and related to my previous question in the

511
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.610
book, at a certain point, you say that the

512
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:22.429
quote, what we really need economic theory for is

513
00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:24.830
institution design. Can you explain that?

514
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.800
Sure. So, uh, I think it was the Nobel

515
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.239
Prize winning economist Leonid Hurwich, who introduced the concept

516
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:36.149
of incentive compatibility. Um, AND institution design in his

517
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:39.469
own work in economics at the University of Minnesota

518
00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.330
in the 1950s, and he had to reach the

519
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.188
age of 90 before finally he got the Nobel

520
00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:50.639
Prize for this work, but, um, uh. Mechanism design

521
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:54.918
is the label economists give to the problem of

522
00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:59.520
designing the rules of exchange and of competition that

523
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.850
will harness people's selfish interests to deliver the socially

524
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.919
desired outcome. Um, AND, ah, the socially desired outcome

525
00:35:09.919 --> 00:35:13.879
is one which can only be attained by harnessing

526
00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:18.729
people's incentive to be selfish and self-interested. And to

527
00:35:18.729 --> 00:35:22.610
misrepresent their preferences and their expectations. So what we

528
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:27.199
need to do is design laws and rules and

529
00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:30.810
practices that force people in their actual behavior to

530
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.729
reveal their actual preferences and their actual beliefs. That's

531
00:35:35.729 --> 00:35:39.850
what incentive compatible institution design is, and it has

532
00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:45.350
been an important, um, and insightful dimension of economics

533
00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.790
ever since Hurwich first drew economists' attention to this

534
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:53.669
problem, and of course Arrow was one of those

535
00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:57.629
who early saw the importance of Hurwich's insight and

536
00:35:57.629 --> 00:36:02.270
together with him advanced our uh sensitivity to these

537
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.810
problems.

538
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.939
But what kinds of institutions do we need to

539
00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:09.070
construct?

540
00:36:09.689 --> 00:36:13.080
All right, so, uh, I mentioned Alvin Roth, a

541
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.790
while ago. Here's a great example. Pretty famous now.

542
00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:20.850
Hospitals in the 1940s and 1950s used to want

543
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.610
to get the best medical students they could, and

544
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:28.639
medical students wanted to get, Their first internships at

545
00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:32.080
the best hospitals they could, but each hospital being

546
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.239
so concerned about getting the best, and each medical

547
00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:37.959
student being so concerned about getting the best, would

548
00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:44.419
make time-limited offers of positions and have to decide

549
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:47.280
on the, the hospital would make time-limited offers, and

550
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.239
the medical student would have to decide whether to.

551
00:36:49.314 --> 00:36:51.675
Accept this offer or wait for the offer they

552
00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:54.635
really want that's better, OK, and as a result,

553
00:36:54.715 --> 00:36:59.715
both hospitals and medical students, ah, ended up making

554
00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:03.875
significantly suboptimal choices, ah, and these suboptimal choices were

555
00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.945
bad for the hospital and bad for the medical

556
00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:10.594
students. So, ah, ah, using, ah, a theorem in

557
00:37:10.594 --> 00:37:15.909
game theory, ah raw. And McKelvey and I can't

558
00:37:15.909 --> 00:37:20.209
remember the name of the third economist, uh, designed

559
00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:23.709
the match system in which, um, the hospital ranks

560
00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:28.989
its favorite candidates, uh, uh, the, uh, medical students

561
00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:34.310
rank their favorite hospitals wherever, uh, 11 medical student

562
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.405
in one hospital. Find that they've rated one another

563
00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:41.425
#1, that pair is put aside, nobody says anything

564
00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:44.784
to anybody, and both the hospital and the hospitals

565
00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:47.745
go to looking for their second choice, and if

566
00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:53.465
somebody has ranked the hospital as their first, having

567
00:37:53.465 --> 00:37:55.774
removed the number 1 candidate, we now go to

568
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:58.264
the 2 candidate and we do exactly the same

569
00:37:58.264 --> 00:38:00.300
thing. And then we go all the way down

570
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.229
to all the candidates and all the hospitals before

571
00:38:04.229 --> 00:38:06.959
anybody is told anything, and at the end of

572
00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:12.139
that process, the matches are revealed, and they maximize

573
00:38:12.399 --> 00:38:15.679
the chances of each medical student getting their most

574
00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:18.310
preferred hospital and each hospital getting their most preferred

575
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.899
medical student. And the result, of course, is an

576
00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:26.699
incentive compatible outcome that benefits everyone. And um what's

577
00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:29.300
interesting is the hospitals had started and medical schools

578
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.679
had started to do this in the 19 late

579
00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:34.899
1940s in a limited way, and then the game

580
00:38:34.899 --> 00:38:39.064
theorists. Showed them that if they all could adopt

581
00:38:39.064 --> 00:38:42.024
this scheme, all of the hospitals and all of

582
00:38:42.024 --> 00:38:46.304
the medical schools in advising their interns, everybody would

583
00:38:46.304 --> 00:38:49.185
end up better off. It's a beautiful example of

584
00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:53.239
designing an incentive compatible institution. It was then applied

585
00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:56.760
to matching kids with schools in Boston and New

586
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.320
York, um, during a time in which there was

587
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:05.580
huge strife regarding the school choice problem er in

588
00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:11.129
a large metropolitan school districts. Uh, Roth eventually applied

589
00:39:11.129 --> 00:39:16.389
a similar device to enabling kidney transplants to be

590
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:22.570
more efficiently offered to individuals before they died from

591
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.290
kidney failure.

592
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.080
OK, so I think you've already at least partly

593
00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:32.290
answered my next question, but what functions do these

594
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.719
institutions serve then or should serve?

595
00:39:35.919 --> 00:39:39.860
Well, we know, for example, that the Sherman Antitrust

596
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.860
and the Clayton Antitrust Acts served the purpose of

597
00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:48.520
reducing the market power of monopolists and increasing the

598
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.600
efficiency of markets. They didn't work very well, they

599
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.560
were probably better than nothing. They provided incentives to

600
00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.679
manufacturers. And um sellers and their lawyers and accountants

601
00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:03.590
to find ways of getting around them, but, um,

602
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.899
insofar as all markets are to some extent inefficient,

603
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:13.239
all markets reveal some amount of market failure, all

604
00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:19.000
markets would do well to be improved, and the

605
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.280
only way, the only tools for improving these markets

606
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.320
are the tools of game theory.

607
00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:30.129
And is it possible for us to design institutions

608
00:40:30.129 --> 00:40:33.239
that prevent perverse incentives?

609
00:40:34.189 --> 00:40:39.310
Well, there's one institution in which perverse incentives can

610
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.290
never take hold, and that is the perfectly competitive

611
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.229
market. Unfortunately, I mean, on the perfectly competitive market,

612
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.379
everybody's a price taker, there's no room for stratagems,

613
00:40:49.669 --> 00:40:53.610
there's no room. For price setting, there's no room

614
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:58.169
for strategic choice. Unfortunately, the perfectly competitive market is

615
00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:02.129
an idealization which exists only when 5 or 6

616
00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:08.949
different completely unrealistic assumptions obtained. All we can do

617
00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:12.830
is try to move real markets closer to the

618
00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.070
perfectly competitive market in the hope that by doing

619
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:20.389
so we reduce the scope for rent seeking and

620
00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:25.919
ah ah for market failure, um. Will we ever

621
00:41:25.919 --> 00:41:30.780
succeed? No, because as I said before, every design

622
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.500
that brings us closer to the perfectly competitive market

623
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.699
where everyone is a price taker and there's no

624
00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:40.939
room for rip off rent seeking, every move in

625
00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:46.699
that direction simply um. Uh, INCENTIVIZES somebody to try

626
00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:50.360
to find a way around it, a shortcut, or

627
00:41:50.419 --> 00:41:54.060
even to violate the rule, accepting the risk associated

628
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.300
with the punishment, and if the punishment isn't high

629
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.719
enough, then inevitably you'll get that kind of, um,

630
00:42:01.179 --> 00:42:05.020
uh, rule breaking, cheating. Uh, WHAT do we do

631
00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.830
about that? Well, um, We have to make systems

632
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:14.290
more efficient in their detection and in their punishment

633
00:42:14.669 --> 00:42:20.449
of rule violation. How likely is that in the

634
00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:24.699
real world? Well, with lobbyists and regulatory capture, probably

635
00:42:24.699 --> 00:42:25.699
not very likely.

636
00:42:27.209 --> 00:42:29.929
OK, so I have one final question then. I

637
00:42:29.929 --> 00:42:34.429
mean, uh, I haven't uh written down this question

638
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:37.530
in preparation for the interview, but since I asked

639
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.350
you earlier about whether or not you think that

640
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:45.100
economic theory is ideology-driven, I would like to ask

641
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.969
you now. Because I think that this can tell

642
00:42:47.969 --> 00:42:53.969
us also something about uh how economic theory can

643
00:42:53.969 --> 00:42:59.090
be used and whether or not it should be,

644
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.649
uh, let's say neutral in ideological terms. So, uh,

645
00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:06.989
Uh, I mean, I, I get that, uh, many

646
00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:13.659
people, political activists, particularly both, uh, capitalist, socialists, right-wing,

647
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:18.510
left wing, many times they appeal to economics and

648
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:23.370
economic theory to make arguments in favor of their

649
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.590
preferred policies. I mean, do you, uh, you are

650
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:31.602
a philosopher. I guess that uh and many of

651
00:43:31.602 --> 00:43:34.021
the things we talked about here today would fall

652
00:43:34.021 --> 00:43:38.122
under the rubric, the rubric of epistemology because we

653
00:43:38.122 --> 00:43:41.981
are interested in, in here in trying to understand

654
00:43:42.281 --> 00:43:45.481
what is, uh, true or what is not true

655
00:43:45.481 --> 00:43:49.912
and how we can arrive at truth, through economics,

656
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:55.493
uh, uh, about, um, proof about people's economic. Behavior

657
00:43:55.493 --> 00:43:58.404
through economics, I mean, do you think that from

658
00:43:58.404 --> 00:44:04.894
an epistemological perspective it is legitimate for people to

659
00:44:04.894 --> 00:44:08.614
use economic theory for political lens?

660
00:44:08.894 --> 00:44:10.474
All right, so I need to go back to

661
00:44:11.073 --> 00:44:14.013
to our discussion of ideology. Um, WE have to

662
00:44:14.013 --> 00:44:18.033
separate the motivation, uh, for someone endorsing us, uh,

663
00:44:18.053 --> 00:44:21.406
a set of beliefs from the. Truth or falsity

664
00:44:21.706 --> 00:44:25.545
or applicability, predictive, explanatory or otherwise of this set

665
00:44:25.545 --> 00:44:29.535
of beliefs. It's very clear that there's an ideological

666
00:44:29.535 --> 00:44:35.375
motivation for endorsing uh uh conventional microeconomic theory because

667
00:44:35.385 --> 00:44:40.575
it looks like an excellent rational justification of laissez-faire

668
00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:44.825
capitalism and for that reason it is widely endorsed

669
00:44:44.825 --> 00:44:49.919
by. Uh, CAPITALISTS by the rich, by those who

670
00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:54.250
benefit from, uh, the status quo, and from the

671
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.649
description of the status quo as the competitive market,

672
00:44:58.129 --> 00:45:03.969
um, That needs to be separated from whether the

673
00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:08.260
theory as such is true or false, useful or

674
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.340
not, and what are the domains in which it

675
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.540
is useful or not. Now it seems to me

676
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.280
that the theory is false because people aren't rational,

677
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:21.340
uh, max uh rational preference maximizer, but, uh, can

678
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.649
a false theory be nevertheless, Important and applicable and

679
00:45:26.649 --> 00:45:31.060
a useful tool um for areas of human interest

680
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.739
independent of the scientific, for example, can it be

681
00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:37.939
a useful tool in designing institutions, even though it's

682
00:45:37.939 --> 00:45:40.659
false of reality? Well, the answer to that question

683
00:45:40.659 --> 00:45:44.764
is sure, it can be um. And maybe it

684
00:45:44.764 --> 00:45:49.864
should be, um, particularly if it's assumptions about human

685
00:45:50.195 --> 00:45:55.584
individual motivation are at least right about some people

686
00:45:55.804 --> 00:46:00.245
whose behavior can have an unfortunate impact on the

687
00:46:00.245 --> 00:46:06.260
rest of us. Right, um, free riders, psychopaths, er,

688
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:12.139
uh, really selfish people, the, uh, the, those people

689
00:46:12.139 --> 00:46:15.699
who pretend to be entrepreneurs, but actually have never

690
00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:19.540
spent any time at the laboratory research bench inventing.

691
00:46:19.725 --> 00:46:22.685
Something really new and we will leave the name

692
00:46:22.685 --> 00:46:25.604
of who I'm thinking of, uh, out of our

693
00:46:25.604 --> 00:46:29.524
discussion, uh, for the moment, you know, uh, investing

694
00:46:29.524 --> 00:46:32.324
in PayPal at an early point in your life

695
00:46:32.324 --> 00:46:34.665
is not a basis on which to accord you

696
00:46:34.665 --> 00:46:39.725
special, uh, entrepreneurial genius, but in any case, um,

697
00:46:40.004 --> 00:46:47.090
uh. The ideological motivation for indoctrinating everybody with standard

698
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:51.949
off the shelf microeconomic theory is very great. But

699
00:46:51.949 --> 00:46:55.929
we can prescind from that ideological motivation in asking

700
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.419
whether there's any value to this er institution economic

701
00:47:00.419 --> 00:47:03.389
theory at all, and a lot of very smart

702
00:47:03.389 --> 00:47:06.510
people who have no particular ideological ax to grind

703
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.469
have spent their lives and labored their genius on

704
00:47:10.469 --> 00:47:15.350
this subject, right, er, and it can't be, er.

705
00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:21.840
Worthless hand waving or uh uh merely ideological mystification,

706
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.219
it's gotta be good for something, and that's what

707
00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:27.500
I tried to figure out, uh, what it's good

708
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.919
for in this book, having spent my entire career

709
00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:36.719
um. Being skeptical about economic theory, uh, I finally

710
00:47:36.719 --> 00:47:40.419
found the. Uh, WHAT I think is a stable

711
00:47:40.419 --> 00:47:44.739
equilibrium in thinking about its weaknesses and at the

712
00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:46.419
same time, its usefulness.

713
00:47:48.209 --> 00:47:51.610
Great. So I'm getting uh mindful of your time,

714
00:47:51.729 --> 00:47:55.820
Doctor Rosenberg. So let's perhaps uh wrap up our

715
00:47:55.879 --> 00:47:59.570
conversation here. The book is again Blunt Instrument, Why

716
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:03.489
Economic Theory Can't Get Any Better, Why We Need

717
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:05.709
It Anyway, and there is the cover again. I

718
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.209
really love the book, by the way, Doctor Rosenberg,

719
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.530
and thank you so much for taking the time

720
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.570
to come on the show again. It's always a

721
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.590
really big pleasure to everyone.

722
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.520
So, let's do this again in 4 years when

723
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.209
I dream up my next book. Thanks a lot,

724
