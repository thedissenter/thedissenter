00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.130
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.690
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.369
I'm joined by Doctor Elise Zipkin. She's Red several

4
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.689
distinguished professor and director of the Ecology, Evolution and

5
00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.610
Behavior Program in the Department of Integrative Biology at

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.084
Michigan State University. And today we're going to focus

7
00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:25.235
on topics such as animal population dynamics, species distribution,

8
00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:31.524
biodiversity, human activities, conservation, invasive invasive species, and climate

9
00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:34.634
change and some other related topics. So, Doctor Zipkin,

10
00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:36.485
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

11
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.724
everyone. Thank you so much for the invitation.

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.900
So, perhaps, uh before we get into more specific

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.549
things, let me just ask you about two or

14
00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.950
three concepts here for people to understand what we're

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.349
going to talk about. So, one of the things

16
00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:57.790
you study is animal population dynamics. So, what is

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.369
that and what kinds of questions do we, do

18
00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.509
you explore

19
00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.098
there? Yeah, good question. So basically my lab is

20
00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.819
interested in understanding the abundance and distribution of species,

21
00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:13.219
mostly animal species, although we do work on some

22
00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.179
plants, and I'm sorry about that. Um, SO we

23
00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.259
work on estimating the abundance of distributions of species

24
00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.228
and how they change with things like other other

25
00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:27.418
environmental change, uh, climate change, and other kinds of

26
00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:31.849
human and natural disturbances. So what we're interested in

27
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.889
is why are populations changing? What causes populations to

28
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.900
and communities of species to change through time? I

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.260
mean, first, to understand that we need to understand

30
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.660
what's a baseline. What do we see now, what

31
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.699
have we seen in the past, and Then we

32
00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:48.809
try to look at, all right, what, what do

33
00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.699
we also think about might happen in the future

34
00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.739
under different kinds of environmental change that we may

35
00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.970
have or um you know, even things that are

36
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:00.339
are possibly a little bit less likely, but we

37
00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:02.330
still want to know what the possibilities might look

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.580
like.

39
00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:07.589
But in your specific case, do you focus only

40
00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:12.509
or mostly on anthropogenic activities and how they impact

41
00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.389
species population dynamics, or do you also focus or

42
00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:22.339
try to study how those dynamics change through natural

43
00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.869
processes?

44
00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.639
Yeah, we also try to understand how populations change

45
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.410
through natural processes like with there were no kinds

46
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.309
of human interventions or human disturbances. And the reason

47
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.639
you have to do that, if you, if you

48
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.160
were focused only on wanting to understand, you know,

49
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.229
the effects of anthropogenic activities, you would still need

50
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.360
to know what are the kind, how does the

51
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.139
population, you know, what would you expect naturally to

52
00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.535
happen. Happen. So there's no real way to study,

53
00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:50.705
you know, what's going on with the effects of

54
00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.585
human intervention if we don't really understand, you know,

55
00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.985
what, what we would expect to see with the

56
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.095
population. So most of the models that we're doing,

57
00:02:58.304 --> 00:03:01.065
you know, we're incorporating both of those things or

58
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.785
the things that we think are relevant for that

59
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:07.315
specific population or community of species, um, to get

60
00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.304
the, the full picture. Mhm.

61
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.190
And what the species distribution mean? What is? That

62
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.330
is

63
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.460
such a good question. You send that question. I

64
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.860
thought, you know, that's very insightful question because the

65
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.779
truth is, you know, it's really hard to understand

66
00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.740
it. So in the, in the, you know, kind

67
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.020
of broadest sense, what we really want to understand

68
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.860
is, where does this species exist and where does

69
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.203
it not exist? And You can think of kind

70
00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:36.832
of like a range. OK, this species occurs in,

71
00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:39.723
you know, the western part of North America. But

72
00:03:39.723 --> 00:03:42.942
of course, within that, it's not occurring at every

73
00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:47.123
location within there, right? And these processes are dynamic,

74
00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:50.042
you know, so they're not, um, really, you know,

75
00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.682
static through time. There's something that are kind of

76
00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.785
always changing. So it is a really It was

77
00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:58.856
a really, really good question. It's a useful concept

78
00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:01.945
for us, right, because we, if we constantly were

79
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:04.055
thinking about all the nuance, it would be difficult

80
00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:07.865
to ever get things done. But so in, in

81
00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:10.026
the broadest sense, right, it's just like where that

82
00:04:10.026 --> 00:04:12.705
species is existing, you know, a delineating kind of

83
00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.326
that area, but once you really dig down deep

84
00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:17.906
into it, it, it becomes really complicated.

85
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.640
But uh when it comes to species distribution, uh,

86
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.799
do you, are you trying to understand what are

87
00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:28.239
the factors that play a role in a particular

88
00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:32.209
species being able to live and adapt to different

89
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.010
sorts of ecological conditions? Is that it?

90
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.200
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.

91
00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.519
I mean, so basically we want to understand those

92
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:43.040
factors that are in particular locations, how much they're

93
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.000
affecting, you know, the species either occurring there or

94
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920
how many of that you see there. Like, let's

95
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.000
say it was some sort of, you know, bird

96
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.429
species, a species that we think of typically as

97
00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.239
inhabiting forest, um, you know, forest habitat, but the

98
00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:59.559
forest itself has a lot of, you know, nuance

99
00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.000
and variation. There might be differences in the canopy.

100
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.592
Cover what the tree looks like, what the understory

101
00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:06.742
looks like, you know, how much brush there is.

102
00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:09.511
And so it's not the same throughout. So we're

103
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:11.712
trying to understand, you know, those factors. OK, maybe

104
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.471
it's a forest bird and we expect it to

105
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.032
be here, but is it in certain locations at

106
00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.872
higher and lower densities because of the kind of

107
00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:21.201
habitat that we see in those areas?

108
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.381
Uh, AND so I would imagine that it also

109
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:30.533
includes factors like, I don't know, temperature. And latitude

110
00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:34.544
and the different kinds of food that each species

111
00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:37.503
will have available and can consume all of those

112
00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.544
sorts of environmental factors, right?

113
00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:42.623
Yeah, so there are all sorts of things that

114
00:05:42.623 --> 00:05:45.223
would affect like where, you know, where a species

115
00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:46.824
would occur, right? The kinds of things that we

116
00:05:46.824 --> 00:05:49.264
all think about, you know, that every, um, you

117
00:05:49.264 --> 00:05:52.544
know, animal needs food, needs shelter, you know, other

118
00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:56.015
types of resources, those sorts of things, um. And

119
00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:57.895
so we are always including it, but you bring

120
00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:00.246
up a really good point, which is, we may

121
00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:02.895
think something's really important, but we may not have

122
00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:06.436
the data available to actually include it, right? Um,

123
00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:08.175
SO you said something about the food. Well, we

124
00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:11.436
might know broadly how the food of an organism,

125
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:14.175
you know, is distributed, but we don't know, we

126
00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:16.055
may not have the data really to know that

127
00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:19.436
at a very fine granular level. So that's also

128
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:21.895
like what, what makes this process really complicated.

129
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:27.290
And so perhaps the question that most people would

130
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.089
be interested in here in this conversation, because, of

131
00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.119
course, environmentalists also talk a lot, talk a lot

132
00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.970
about it. What is biodiversity? What does that mean

133
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.369
in the context of biology and environmentalism?

134
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.019
Yeah, so bioversity is just simply, you know, the

135
00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.619
variety of life on Earth, and you could think

136
00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:51.929
about it sometimes we're thinking about it the whole

137
00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.739
globe. What does that biodiversity look like across the

138
00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:57.380
planet, but also sometimes we're thinking about it on

139
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.420
a smaller scale, you know, what is the biodiversity

140
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.140
look like in these particular areas, um, and the

141
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.559
reason we care about that. Right, is because biodiversity

142
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.720
and higher biodiversity is linked to all sorts of

143
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.720
things that are beneficial to both, you know, humans

144
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.079
and natural and managed ecosystems, right? So, um, biodiversity

145
00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.359
is linked to, you know, things like, um, clean

146
00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:25.070
water, clean air, um, the, the production of food.

147
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.420
So even in managed habitats like. Even in agricultural

148
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.339
fields, we can see that higher biodiversity of certain

149
00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.779
kinds of insects or even plants in between those,

150
00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.980
you know, row crops can lead to better outcomes

151
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.179
for, um, you know, crops for managed crops. So

152
00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:45.019
there's all sorts of reasons why biodiversity has many

153
00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:48.320
benefits, um, both the natural systems and to people

154
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.809
as well.

155
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:55.200
But is it always better to have more biodiversity

156
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.679
or, I mean, how should we think about it

157
00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:01.920
exactly? That's also a really good question. Um, I

158
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.920
mean that's something that ecologists debate, right? Is, is

159
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.190
higher biodiversity always better, um, and, you know, it's,

160
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.920
it's, it's pretty nuanced. I would say that, you

161
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.489
know, Some places on the globe, right? Like if

162
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:17.940
you think about the equator, there's more, you know,

163
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.540
there's higher biodiversity in areas around the equator and

164
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.059
tropical ecosystems compared to like, let's say polar regions,

165
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.220
the Arctic or Antarctic. So we can't like naturally

166
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.260
say, OK, it's better, you know, the, the area

167
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.359
around the Um, um, equators better than, you know,

168
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:38.409
the areas around, um, the poles, right? Because they're

169
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.849
really different kinds of ecosystems, and they would sustain

170
00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.109
life in really different ways and there just would

171
00:08:44.109 --> 00:08:48.090
be maybe a lower carrying capacity for organisms in

172
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.049
Arctic systems, um. So I can't say that it's

173
00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:54.729
always better. What I would say is that, you

174
00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:58.049
know, as as for for people, one of the

175
00:08:58.049 --> 00:09:00.429
things that's probably the best is to think about

176
00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:05.330
trying to maintain or restore amounts of biodiversities that

177
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.979
have historically been in the regions that, you know,

178
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.400
that we're that we're thinking about, right? So, um,

179
00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:15.010
thinking about populating with native species that have been

180
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.969
in areas, you know, since the last ice age

181
00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.530
kind of a thing. That's that's probably. The best

182
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.039
way I think to think about it. So it's

183
00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:24.809
not just more is better everywhere, we want everywhere

184
00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:26.849
to have the most. We want, you know, to

185
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.369
think about what kind of native plants and animal

186
00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:34.000
species, and fungi and um bacteria, you know, there

187
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.369
are in um different parts of the globe for

188
00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:37.250
different reasons.

189
00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:42.169
So, since I mentioned the environmentalists, I guess that

190
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:44.799
one question that people would have at this point

191
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:49.700
is, why then should we care about biodiversity?

192
00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:53.900
Yeah, so as I was saying, like the biodiversity

193
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.479
is really what maintains life on Earth, right? So

194
00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.919
in addition to all the things about, um, you

195
00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:03.119
know, cycling nutrients in our systems, um, producing, helping

196
00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.450
to produce clean water, um, also, you know, there's

197
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.119
all sorts of issues like all of our, um,

198
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.840
medicines basically are derived from natural compounds, you know,

199
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.974
we, we We are constantly exploring. I mean, scientists

200
00:10:15.974 --> 00:10:19.895
are constantly exploring, um, you know, the medicinal properties

201
00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:22.695
of plants, for example, and those end up being

202
00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.885
part of, you know, the important medications that we

203
00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:30.244
all use. So really, um, you know, reduced biodiversity

204
00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:33.054
is going to make our lives harder and there'll

205
00:10:33.054 --> 00:10:35.294
be some thresholds where it will make it, you

206
00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:38.294
know, in reality where it would be very difficult

207
00:10:38.294 --> 00:10:41.140
for people to exist, you know, so, um. So

208
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.250
it has a lot of properties I think that

209
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.900
that humans rely on whether we're not we're thinking

210
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.739
about it every day.

211
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:51.719
Right. So, uh, I mean, I, I, I hope

212
00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:54.510
that this is not too broad a question, but

213
00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:57.960
what gives rise to biodiversity and what are the

214
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.260
kinds of factors that play a role in how

215
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.190
it increases or decreases over time?

216
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.320
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's a really hard question

217
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.159
too, and again, that's like whole fields that people

218
00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:10.200
study, but I would say, you know, it's this

219
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.440
interaction of ecology, which is how um Popular species

220
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.690
interact with their environments and other different species, each

221
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.549
their own population, their own individuals within their species,

222
00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:26.229
and also um individuals outside of their their species,

223
00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:30.080
and also evolutionary processes, right? So maybe some of

224
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.119
your audiences heard of things like natural selection, which

225
00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:36.260
is the process by which, um, you know, uh,

226
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.719
organisms speciate through time. So new new individuals happen.

227
00:11:39.914 --> 00:11:41.924
So 10, we tend to think of that through

228
00:11:41.924 --> 00:11:47.234
some random processes of mutation, um, and maybe movement

229
00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:50.955
of um species and also related to, you know,

230
00:11:51.114 --> 00:11:55.715
what the environmental process um is like in particular

231
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.330
locations. But one thing I think that's really important

232
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.039
to note is that the process of creating species,

233
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.250
right, is much, much slower than, for example, the

234
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.690
process by which we are currently losing species. So

235
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.770
there's no way, right, we, we think of speciation

236
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.710
as, you know, something. That happens on geological time.

237
00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:20.739
Whereas right now, you know, the loss of biodiversity

238
00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:24.599
that we're experiencing those rates are comparable to, you

239
00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:27.609
know, the five mass extinctions that we've seen in

240
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.520
in the past in the fossil record, um, for

241
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.030
biodiversity. So it's not like we're gonna be able

242
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.880
to In a short time frame, easily replace biodiversity

243
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.679
that we've lost, um, but obviously on geological times,

244
00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:48.710
you know, that will, um, Kind of the there'll

245
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.739
be more life on earth and more variety of

246
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.549
of of life on Earth, but of course we

247
00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:53.700
don't know what that looks like.

248
00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:57.750
Right. But what kinds of human activities tend to

249
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.239
have an impact on things like species distribution and

250
00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.469
biodiversity?

251
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.419
So really I would say, you know, you could

252
00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.099
kind of think of it as almost everything we

253
00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.820
do has an impact. That's not to say that

254
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.500
it's a negative impact, right? But when we're, you

255
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.099
know, when we're obviously like, you know, if we're

256
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.580
doing things like removing habitats, so that's a big

257
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.539
one, where we build our houses, where we build

258
00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:23.859
our cities, even in rural areas where we modify

259
00:13:23.859 --> 00:13:27.260
landscapes, um, that's gonna have an impact on, you

260
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.119
know, the other. Organisms that live in that area.

261
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:34.369
And even things about, um, though, you know, areas

262
00:13:34.369 --> 00:13:36.599
that we keep for parks or areas that we

263
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:39.250
should keep natural, um, you know, the kinds of

264
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.409
management we do also has impacts on biodiversity in,

265
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.650
in maybe positive or negative ways, right? And, and

266
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.799
not all biodiversity is necessarily gonna respond, you know,

267
00:13:48.969 --> 00:13:53.900
to, to, to, um. The kinds of, I'll say

268
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.489
disturbance, but it could be, you know, changes that

269
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.330
that humans make in the same way. Some kinds

270
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.500
of um some species, you know, we may uh

271
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500
put in lawns in our, in our yard. For

272
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.729
the most part, lawns, for example, are um decrease

273
00:14:08.909 --> 00:14:11.619
biodiversity, right? Decrease the amount of species that we

274
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:13.820
see there, but some species are going to increase

275
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.770
in those kinds of monoculture, you know, environments, so.

276
00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:22.070
Things will always respond differently, uh, you know, different

277
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.150
species will respond differently to different stressors and different

278
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.140
changes that we see.

279
00:14:26.979 --> 00:14:31.030
And what about the specific case of agriculture? How

280
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.869
can it affect uh different animal species?

281
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.000
Yeah, agricultural is a really good one because obviously

282
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.289
it's hugely important, right? I mean, we all need

283
00:14:40.289 --> 00:14:43.950
agriculture everywhere around the world. It's not going anywhere

284
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.390
and um it has a huge benefit for humans.

285
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.919
But there's a ton of research, tons of research

286
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:52.479
at my university at Michigan State, but also All

287
00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:54.840
over the world where people are trying to think

288
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.479
about, all right, how do we implement agriculture in

289
00:14:58.479 --> 00:15:01.080
ways that are both good for the environment, good

290
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.919
for the native species that are there in the

291
00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:07.159
region, and also can increase crop yields. So agriculture

292
00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:10.340
is a really interesting one, you know, um. Historically

293
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.840
we might think about like, OK, people come into

294
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.059
an area, they clear the area, they plant their

295
00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:17.859
plants, but what we found through time, right, is

296
00:15:17.859 --> 00:15:20.700
that um if you try to continually do that

297
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.179
and just plant, you know, um. Uh, SPECIES for

298
00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:27.169
food through time, we see that the productivity of

299
00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:29.780
that land can go down, right? So it becomes

300
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.020
really important to let those lands be fallow or

301
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.489
to um think about managing them in a way

302
00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:39.900
that can promote biodiversity, and, and we've seen in

303
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.010
some situations that that can really lead to much

304
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.299
higher yields, especially through time. So there's lots of

305
00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:49.549
research being done on, you know, crop rotations, um,

306
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.739
putting in prairie strips around agriculture that can improve

307
00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:56.869
biodiversity, but those outcomes also end up being really

308
00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:59.989
good in many situations for the production of crops.

309
00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:03.119
So tons of research. THAT, um, especially in the

310
00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.159
Midwestern US where, you know, there's a lot of

311
00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:09.520
agricultural land, um, that's, that's a big, big area

312
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.880
of research. I think that's both impro improving food

313
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.960
production and improving, um, you know, biodiversity, natural biodiversity

314
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.719
in those areas.

315
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.830
Mhm. Because there are also some wild species that

316
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.239
can have a positive role in agriculture,

317
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.429
right? Right. Exactly. There can be a lot. I

318
00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:30.549
mean, there are, of course, pests. I mean, we're

319
00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:32.989
also thinking about people are also thinking about ways,

320
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.159
yeah, how do you prevent, let's say you're growing

321
00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:37.849
blue blueberries, which is something popular in the state

322
00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:40.429
of Michigan. How do Prevent, you know, birds from

323
00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:42.789
eating them. So, I mean, we, we understand that

324
00:16:42.789 --> 00:16:44.909
side of it too. But it's not like you're

325
00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:47.030
gonna want to remove all the birds from the

326
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.030
system, right? Because on the other hand, other birds

327
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.229
are eating, um, insect pests, right? That are problematic

328
00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:56.070
for the blueberries. So it becomes kind of this

329
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.760
complicated game where you're trying to figure out, all

330
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.989
right, what's the best approach. For getting the outcome

331
00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:04.670
that we want, but also for um maintaining a

332
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.630
healthy ecosystem so that people into the future are

333
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.829
going to be able to use this land, you

334
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.608
know, effectively. We don't want to just do something

335
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.108
and then, oh, OK, this, this area is, is

336
00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:16.598
it good to be used now for 10 or

337
00:17:16.598 --> 00:17:19.339
15 years while it regenerates. That's, that's not good

338
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.618
for people either, you know.

339
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.180
Mhm. So, but with uh things like environmentalism and

340
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.229
climate change in mind, what is conservation and what

341
00:17:30.229 --> 00:17:34.739
are the kinds of approaches and tools that conservationists

342
00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:36.290
have at their disposal?

343
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.390
Yeah, so conservation is just, I would call the

344
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.670
smart use of natural resources. So the use of

345
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.709
natural resources in some way where we're not depleting

346
00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:49.060
it, we're thinking about the future for for us,

347
00:17:49.229 --> 00:17:52.699
for other species, you know, um, and we're trying

348
00:17:52.699 --> 00:17:55.790
to use our resources in a way that's sustainable

349
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.829
through time. Um, SO what was the second part

350
00:17:58.829 --> 00:17:59.619
of the question?

351
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.910
Uh, THE kinds of approaches and tools that conservationists

352
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.689
have at their disposal. Right,

353
00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:07.510
so I would say, you know, in a lot

354
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.790
of ways, anybody who's doing any kind of land

355
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:15.410
management, anybody who's doing, you know, agriculture, um, you

356
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.189
know, let's say, um, tree logging, tree farming, everybody,

357
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.109
I almost think of all those people as, you

358
00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:24.229
know, uh, conservationists or at least very involved with

359
00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:28.130
conservation because They want, they don't want, nobody wants

360
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.849
to develop something and then have that area or

361
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:34.109
land that you've been using, you know, burn out

362
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:37.489
within a short time. So really everybody, I think

363
00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:41.160
that that is thinking about natural resources is doing

364
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.050
this in a way that they at least want

365
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.170
it to be sustainable for for themselves. Then they

366
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.050
may not be thinking about the sustainability of broadly

367
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:54.219
of, you know, for example, broader um biodiversity, um.

368
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.810
Issues, but lots of times, you know, people are

369
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.900
still doing it for their own service. So Um,

370
00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:02.229
so that, that's a big one. I would, one

371
00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:05.430
of the big things that conservationists, I would say

372
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.469
really do now is we try to think about

373
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:13.849
um protecting areas that are sort of natural already.

374
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.119
So that's a big one where both, you know,

375
00:19:16.229 --> 00:19:20.910
I would say private sectors, um, government, um, you

376
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.270
know, all sorts of of groups of people are

377
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.290
thinking about or how do we Protect the area

378
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.089
that we currently have that's sort of a natural

379
00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:32.189
or at least, um, you know, managed like parks,

380
00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:35.609
um, ecosystems. And then the other piece I think

381
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:38.520
that's really, um, big that people think about is

382
00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:42.050
restoration. All right, how do we make an area

383
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.969
that has been degraded, um, better again for the

384
00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:49.160
native species and biodiversity in that area. So those,

385
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.079
those I think of as kind of kind of

386
00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:53.479
the 22 ways that people are thinking about it.

387
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.469
But there are many other, um, many, many other

388
00:19:56.469 --> 00:20:00.630
ways that people think about, uh, uh, conservation. And

389
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.650
it really just depends, like, are you focused on

390
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.150
individual species? Are you focused on the community of

391
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.869
species? Are you focused on the ecosystem processes? What

392
00:20:08.869 --> 00:20:11.229
exactly are you trying to conserve through time? And

393
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.469
so, yeah, so there's a lot out there and

394
00:20:13.469 --> 00:20:15.900
a lot of innovative ways that people are, um,

395
00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:17.030
thinking about it.

396
00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:20.880
And are there any particular ways for us to

397
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.839
decide or determine uh that we should try to

398
00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:29.270
conserve a particular species and not uh another one,

399
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.390
or how do we do that?

400
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.280
That's a really good question. I mean, so that's

401
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.479
a really good question. I will say that in

402
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:41.160
practice it really does happen by what people care

403
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.640
about, right? Like we find out that, um, you

404
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.189
know, whether or not one species is getting Um,

405
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.920
Conservation status and, you know, in a in locally,

406
00:20:53.109 --> 00:20:59.270
regionally and nationally or um conservation inter interventions really

407
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.430
ends up depending on what people think about or

408
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.349
what people care about. So there's this concept that

409
00:21:05.349 --> 00:21:09.675
we call charismatic megafauna. Charismatic species, and the idea

410
00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:12.464
is that there are certain species, usually they're big,

411
00:21:12.714 --> 00:21:15.795
um, not always, um, that people really care about,

412
00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:19.385
you know, you think about something like pandas or

413
00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:22.125
lions or even the monarch butterflies, one in North

414
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:25.505
America, um, but iconic species that people really love

415
00:21:25.505 --> 00:21:27.939
that. And I think a lot of decisions get

416
00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:32.060
based around that, um, what the public cares about.

417
00:21:32.219 --> 00:21:34.660
But also I would say what scientists are thinking

418
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.609
about, um, and people who are working on conservation

419
00:21:37.819 --> 00:21:40.500
is they're also thinking about, all right, what are

420
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.709
the species or Or processes that really matter. So

421
00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:47.790
another concept in ecology is the idea of keystone

422
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.280
species, and that would be a species by which

423
00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:53.550
if you remove them thing, you know, the entire

424
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:58.650
ecosystem may change, right? So, um, If we took

425
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.160
out, for example, you know, wolves in North America

426
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.939
as one, right, when, when we removed the top

427
00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:07.579
predator in there, we've seen high increases of things

428
00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:11.780
like deer, elk, browsing, ungulates, and that's led to

429
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.140
low loss of um a lot of different um

430
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:19.540
herbaceous species and really big changes then to ecosystems.

431
00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:22.135
So, so there could be, you know, that's of

432
00:22:22.135 --> 00:22:24.305
some of what we're thinking about, um, when we're

433
00:22:24.305 --> 00:22:26.694
thinking about what, what's the best thing to do

434
00:22:26.694 --> 00:22:31.714
from, um, an ecological standpoint, how do we, um,

435
00:22:32.094 --> 00:22:35.535
keep this ecosystem intact and functional to the best

436
00:22:35.535 --> 00:22:38.094
of our ability, but that doesn't always match with

437
00:22:38.094 --> 00:22:40.194
the policy or what the public wants. So I

438
00:22:40.194 --> 00:22:43.204
think, you know, um, in practice what happens is

439
00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:45.694
not really the decision of scientists.

440
00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:48.859
Yeah, because I would imagine that it's much easier

441
00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:53.900
for people to empathize with mammals, for example, animals

442
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.300
that are closer together and that are acuteer, let's

443
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.380
say, but then, uh, other kinds of animals like

444
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.760
insects or, or even. Fish and even plants, fungi,

445
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.790
and other species like that.

446
00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:09.250
Right, that's right. And the thing about it is,

447
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.670
is, you know, we fail to consider that like,

448
00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:15.119
all right, those insects, they're performing very, very important

449
00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:20.369
ecosystem services, um. You know, and so it's important

450
00:23:20.369 --> 00:23:23.239
that we're thinking broadly and not just about those

451
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:25.130
species, you know, that we that we like or

452
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.209
visit in the zoo or that sort of thing,

453
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.560
but that that's tricky, you know, and and it

454
00:23:29.569 --> 00:23:31.890
it's a value judgment in some ways, not it's

455
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.530
not always an ecological decision, certainly what gets conservation.

456
00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:40.609
So, and what is an invasive species?

457
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.079
So we talked a little bit about native species,

458
00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:46.199
and those are species that historically have lived in

459
00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:50.300
an area. So non-native species are species that within

460
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.729
a recent some sort of time frame are not

461
00:23:52.729 --> 00:23:55.260
species that have been there, so they've been introduced

462
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.500
in some ways. Usually we think about this as

463
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.050
the facilitation of people introducing them, um, which is

464
00:24:02.094 --> 00:24:04.635
What is happening, uh, you know, around the globe.

465
00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:08.525
So in some instances, non-native species can move into

466
00:24:08.525 --> 00:24:11.084
an ecosystem and they don't really change things that

467
00:24:11.084 --> 00:24:14.305
much. But in some cases, and those are species

468
00:24:14.305 --> 00:24:19.239
that we call invasive species, um. There are cases

469
00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:23.400
where the species comes in and it really, really

470
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.119
changes in ecosystem, right? So, um, and it can

471
00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:29.790
lead to all sorts of things. So for example,

472
00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:33.439
there is a um fungal pathogen that we call

473
00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:36.390
BD and it has been transported around the world

474
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.680
really by facilitated by humans, and that's led to

475
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.189
the loss of um Uh, amphibians, frogs in many,

476
00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:48.989
many locations, um, across the Americas, but also in

477
00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:52.349
other parts of the world as well. So sometimes

478
00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:55.069
we see something like happen, there's classical examples of

479
00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:57.810
that, um, you know, kind of with, with rats

480
00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.229
everywhere with rats being introduced and coming in and

481
00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:05.030
changing ecosystems, um, lots of, there's lots of um.

482
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.589
YOU know, stories out of Australia. So for example,

483
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.680
cane toad. I don't know if you've heard about

484
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.400
cane toad, but that's a species that was introduced

485
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.770
into Australia quite some time ago to control something.

486
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.319
I don't remember what they introduced it for. So

487
00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:23.599
people came, brought it, but it's very poisonous and

488
00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:26.625
others. Species. It didn't never control the pests that

489
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:29.425
they wanted to control. And then it's very toxic.

490
00:25:29.545 --> 00:25:32.185
So other species would eat it and and die.

491
00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:35.185
So really, and it's spread throughout Australia, right? So

492
00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:38.655
there's lots of examples of where, um, you know,

493
00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:41.625
species have come in and then very, very much

494
00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:47.079
changed the ecosystem, um. So in those cases, it

495
00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:50.560
tends to become pretty important to do active management

496
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.400
to try and mitigate the negative impacts of an

497
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.439
invasive species into um some region.

498
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.199
And I would imagine that many times the sort

499
00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:05.790
of process of introducing new species in a particular

500
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.550
ecology where they would be invasive or have some

501
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.699
detrimental effects on the ecosystem there would be, uh,

502
00:26:13.709 --> 00:26:18.189
done unintentionally, right? So even just people traveling or

503
00:26:18.189 --> 00:26:20.869
moving around, uh, I mean, we carry at the

504
00:26:20.869 --> 00:26:22.550
very least bacteria with us,

505
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.130
so. Yeah, I would say certainly now, right? People

506
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.020
are really, it's it's it's you, there aren't so

507
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.020
much. Um, OR you don't see, you know, I

508
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.939
would say the last 50 years or something like

509
00:26:33.939 --> 00:26:37.619
that, this kind of management where you're, oh, let's

510
00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:39.859
just bring this species into this area and dump

511
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:42.579
it there, right, because people know how much that's

512
00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:46.420
backfired at places around the world. But um it

513
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.569
happens all the time where they get moved in.

514
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.680
So for example, there's a fish called sea lamprey,

515
00:26:51.969 --> 00:26:55.410
and it preys on um native fish. It's, it's

516
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.959
actually an ocean fish, and it, it's a really,

517
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.880
it's actually a really prehistoric fish. I encourage, uh,

518
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.369
your watchers to look it up. It, it, it's

519
00:27:03.369 --> 00:27:05.420
got these rows of teeth, it sucks onto a

520
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.410
fish. Anyways, it's made it through the Great Lakes,

521
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.050
right? Because we made all these canals and series

522
00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.030
of waves so that the lakes would reach out

523
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.890
to the ocean and boats could move back and

524
00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.050
forth. Well, it's in all the great lakes and

525
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.880
it's caused a huge loss, a huge decline in,

526
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.530
um, native fish in those areas. And people, you

527
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:29.150
know, Both commercially and recreationally, um, you know, fish

528
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.939
eat those fish, right, rely on that sustenance. So,

529
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:35.030
so it could have really, really big effects, um,

530
00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:36.609
and most of the time I would say yeah,

531
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.349
now, um, you know, it's something that's done unintentionally.

532
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.949
And if we've already introduced invasive species into a

533
00:27:46.949 --> 00:27:50.670
new ecosystem and new environment, what different kinds of

534
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.339
ways do we have to control them?

535
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.709
Unfortunately, if there's a species that's so sometimes it

536
00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:00.510
happens, right, that you introduce a non-native species and

537
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.939
again it's not so bad, but once we start

538
00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:06.630
introducing species that have really negative consequences and invasive

539
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:11.530
ones. It's almost impossible, impossible to remove them, um,

540
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.160
and we see this over and over again. Um,

541
00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:17.170
SO the main thing that people try to then

542
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.140
do is just slow the spread, um, so there's

543
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.010
this Asian carp that's coming up through the Mississippi

544
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.530
River, um, and they're working really hard to, you

545
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.719
know, prevent it from coming into the Great Lakes.

546
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.089
So the idea is to spend as much time

547
00:28:31.089 --> 00:28:34.530
as we can to control, to control where it

548
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.385
is rather than erratic. IT. It's almost impossible. I

549
00:28:37.385 --> 00:28:38.864
mean, you could think about that kind of with

550
00:28:38.864 --> 00:28:41.905
coronavirus, right? Like, once it gets to a certain

551
00:28:41.905 --> 00:28:45.584
size, you can't really contain it, um, but you

552
00:28:45.584 --> 00:28:48.305
can have strategies maybe to mitigate its spread or

553
00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:50.905
something like that. So it's, it's, it's a little

554
00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:54.989
bit like that, um. But there's really very, very

555
00:28:54.989 --> 00:28:58.829
few situations, um, during, during which way you could

556
00:28:58.829 --> 00:29:02.170
really, you know, um, get rid or or could

557
00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:07.579
seriously control a invasive species without a lot of

558
00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:11.150
active management all the time. Um, SO there's a

559
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.589
uh an example right now where in the United

560
00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:17.680
States. The government is planning, I don't know if

561
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.239
they're still planning to do this, but they were

562
00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:24.079
talking about planning a killing, um, really thousands of

563
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:26.880
barred owls, and the reason for that is because

564
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.119
they're moving in, they're they're, they're invasive, they weren't

565
00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:33.119
naturally in the western part of the US, but

566
00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:36.160
they've moved in probably. Um, THEY moved in by

567
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.160
themselves. They weren't moved by people, but they were

568
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.160
facilitated by the development of people that have come

569
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.839
around, and they're outcompeted and endangered species there called

570
00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:49.319
the spotted owl, um. But the problem is, I

571
00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:51.839
mean, one, there's obviously an issue that people have

572
00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:53.800
to contend with with do we really want to

573
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.719
kill thousands of birds, but second, I think is

574
00:29:56.719 --> 00:30:00.560
the, the real very, very real possibility that it

575
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.520
won't really be effective, right? And even if it

576
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.880
was effective for a short time, you'd have to

577
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.020
keep Killing a lot of birds, a lot of

578
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.500
the barred owls to, um, you know, prevent them

579
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.579
from out competing the spotted owls, which are, are

580
00:30:15.579 --> 00:30:19.140
smaller and use the same habitat, um, so that's

581
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.219
kind of an example where, you know, it's just,

582
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.859
it's just really, really hard to control once once

583
00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:26.300
they're established.

584
00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:30.939
And if we try to control invasive species, could

585
00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:35.300
it happen that sometimes it backfires and it so

586
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.469
how? That's a, yeah, yeah, I think the the

587
00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.800
backfire line is from a paper that I wrote.

588
00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.790
This is actually in my master's, um, my master's,

589
00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:47.140
one of the first papers that I worked on

590
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.989
where um small mouth bass had been introduced to

591
00:30:50.989 --> 00:30:52.910
northern lakes, so that used to happen in the

592
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.750
US quite a lot. People like to fish them.

593
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.510
They don't necessarily eat them as much anymore, but

594
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.510
they'd introduce them to all these northern. And they

595
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.060
kind of take over. They were one of those

596
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.810
evasive species, although brought in by people where, um,

597
00:31:05.979 --> 00:31:09.140
they really changed the ecosystem. They changed, you know,

598
00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:12.500
they outcompete in native trout species, um, and they

599
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.859
changed kind of the whole dynamics of biodiversity in

600
00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:18.579
the lake. So one of the problems that we

601
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:21.619
worked on is, um, uh, uh, this was a

602
00:31:21.619 --> 00:31:25.270
collaborative team at Cornell University, where they were trying

603
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.040
to, OK, can we remove them, right? Using certain

604
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.479
size nets and electroshock fishing, can we remove them

605
00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:34.530
and what's gonna happen? So what ended up happening

606
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.849
is it became, you know, you can't really right

607
00:31:36.849 --> 00:31:38.829
away you realize, OK, you can't get all the

608
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.209
small bass out of the lake. Even this is

609
00:31:41.209 --> 00:31:42.890
a closed lake, wasn't that big. I think it

610
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.829
was like 271 hectares, so not huge. Um, BUT

611
00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:48.270
right away you start to realize, OK, we can't

612
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.030
get rid of all of them. But what we

613
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.869
actually found is when we, when they, when they

614
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:54.390
went around and took out kind of some of

615
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.109
the bigger ones, the ones that you catch, the

616
00:31:57.109 --> 00:31:59.660
next year and then the subsequent years after that,

617
00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:03.099
there were more individuals than there previously had been,

618
00:32:03.189 --> 00:32:05.069
and they were all kind of small, so they

619
00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:08.550
were tiny small uh um size class. What had

620
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.550
happened is those very, very big individuals that are

621
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.910
really hard to catch basically can just Produce tons

622
00:32:15.189 --> 00:32:18.790
of um of offspring, and then we would see

623
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.670
more individuals than we had prior to um the

624
00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.229
initiation of the removal. Of course there was less

625
00:32:25.229 --> 00:32:27.670
biomass cause you were removing some of those medium

626
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.949
sized bigger groups of fish, but But there were

627
00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:34.959
more overall individuals, right? And that it really becomes

628
00:32:34.959 --> 00:32:37.000
this game of, OK, how do you, how do

629
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.160
you keep this up, right? Uh, IT'S, it's very,

630
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:41.829
very difficult. So again, one of those stories where

631
00:32:42.479 --> 00:32:47.119
controlling invasive species, if it's very difficult to do,

632
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.079
and if you do it, you're probably gonna be

633
00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:53.079
doing it forever. Um, YOU can't really stop.

634
00:32:54.199 --> 00:32:58.099
But uh since we're going through climate change, uh,

635
00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:00.390
I need to ask you, I mean, what are

636
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:04.560
perhaps some of the most negative effects that climate

637
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:11.400
change can have on biodiversity, species distribution, and other

638
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:11.640
things?

639
00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:15.079
Yeah, this is a really, really good question. I

640
00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:17.599
mean, again, so we talked about this idea that

641
00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:20.719
there's always some winners and there's always some losers.

642
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.020
And what we've been seeing with climate change is

643
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.459
there really are more losers than they are winners

644
00:33:26.459 --> 00:33:29.099
in a lot of instances. So, um, you know,

645
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.500
the temperatures change, the precipitation changes, um, that changes

646
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.699
all sorts of what's available for resources, the plant

647
00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.260
communities, and what we find is that in a

648
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.699
lot of cases in the community, whether it's birds,

649
00:33:42.739 --> 00:33:47.130
it's butterflies, um, amphibians, um, other kinds of species,

650
00:33:47.219 --> 00:33:50.050
you know, mammals. Um, A lot of times we

651
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.739
find is that has that tends to have a

652
00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:55.969
negative impact on most species. So most species end

653
00:33:55.969 --> 00:33:59.010
up declining, um, and we see, you know, fewer

654
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.369
of them or they restrict their range, they move

655
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:04.530
to different areas. So and we see that a

656
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.329
lot, but on the flip side, there are a

657
00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:10.300
few species that are really winners, um, and they,

658
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.570
they tend to have certain kinds of traits, you

659
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.250
know, they could be more adaptable, you know, they,

660
00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.929
they have a wider range, um, maybe of a

661
00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:24.219
temperature, um. Uh, ABILITIES to be in different, different

662
00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.860
temperatures, and, uh, maybe they can make use of

663
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.860
different kinds of habitat or resources, some sorts of

664
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.820
generals flexibilities. So some of those species then will

665
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.540
increase. We'll find that some of those increase. And

666
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.978
then what we see kind of through time is

667
00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:42.820
what we call and space, time and space is

668
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.255
what we call biotic. Homogenization. And that is that

669
00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:48.746
areas that used to be really different, that used

670
00:34:48.746 --> 00:34:52.025
to have all different sorts of species might become

671
00:34:52.025 --> 00:34:55.686
more similar through time. And, um, I mean, one,

672
00:34:55.696 --> 00:34:58.025
there's this intrinsic value, right to the variety of

673
00:34:58.025 --> 00:35:00.815
Earth. I think across the world, right? People love

674
00:35:00.815 --> 00:35:04.625
to see different kinds of beautiful species of butterflies

675
00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.632
and birds. And and enjoy that, you know, um,

676
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:10.711
that variety of life. But also what we find,

677
00:35:10.882 --> 00:35:12.961
you know, so there's that, but also we find

678
00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:16.761
is we can lose specific functions. So, you know,

679
00:35:16.922 --> 00:35:20.162
different, different types of birds play different roles in

680
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:24.001
the ecosystems. Some eat um fruit, you know, some

681
00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:27.402
eat fruit, some eat seeds, some eat, um, you

682
00:35:27.402 --> 00:35:29.771
know, other birds, some eat, uh, insects, you know,

683
00:35:29.922 --> 00:35:33.431
there's all different variety and those have really important.

684
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.159
Ros that make it ecosystem function. So when we

685
00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:40.790
see this biotic homogenization, we see more and more

686
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.949
of the same and places around the globe, um,

687
00:35:43.959 --> 00:35:46.760
looking more similar to each other than they used

688
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.209
to be. And that loss, you know, that that

689
00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:51.000
could be a big loss for people through time,

690
00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.739
right? Because that could lead to things like Lower

691
00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:58.409
food production, um, less, um, opportunity to find medicines

692
00:35:58.409 --> 00:36:01.500
and, you know, in plants and, um, all sorts

693
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.860
of other things that, that might be repercussions of

694
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:09.149
that, right? Inability of, you know, water to, um,

695
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.030
To to get uh cleaned, you know, there are

696
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.110
natural ways by which um ecosystems uh help preserve

697
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.389
clean water um and clean air, and so we

698
00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:23.050
could see, you know, those functions diminishing and it

699
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:27.550
becoming harder to uh maintain those kind of all

700
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.449
those things that we really take for granted that

701
00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:30.669
biodiversity gives us.

702
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.830
So at the end of the day, even we,

703
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.229
if we have a few winner species, that is

704
00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:41.389
not uh good enough to compensate the fact that

705
00:36:41.389 --> 00:36:44.790
we are losing all the other species or some,

706
00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:46.989
some of the other species or, or is it?

707
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.850
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to say how it

708
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.889
will play out everywhere and through time, but in

709
00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:59.810
general people benefit from a wide variety of biodiversity,

710
00:36:59.889 --> 00:37:03.320
right? Because it basically gives us more options, right?

711
00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:05.679
If, if we're trying to look for a new

712
00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:07.929
medicine, you know, for a new disease that comes

713
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:11.129
up, we want to have more options available to

714
00:37:11.129 --> 00:37:14.530
us, right? We don't want to inadvertently having made

715
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.510
that specific plant go extinct, right? So, um, You

716
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.830
know, in some cases, maybe it won't matter too

717
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.870
much, you know, in in specific locations at specific

718
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.350
times that that will have the functions that we

719
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.750
need through the biodiversity that's there. But in other

720
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.350
cases, I mean, we already see that that can

721
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:36.520
cause huge rippling. Affects, right? So the loss of

722
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.919
some species groups or some types of species can

723
00:37:39.919 --> 00:37:41.959
impact other species that lead to these kinds of

724
00:37:41.959 --> 00:37:46.800
cascades where you're having um really important biodiversity loss

725
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.399
that you may not even really be able to

726
00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.669
measure because you never knew what the baseline was

727
00:37:50.669 --> 00:37:53.219
there, um, and that happens, you know, in, in

728
00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:55.889
the tropics or other areas where there's lots of

729
00:37:55.889 --> 00:37:58.949
species we don't even necessarily know. So I would

730
00:37:58.949 --> 00:38:00.750
say, you know, it's kind of like the precautionary

731
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.989
principle. If you, if you're not sure it's gonna

732
00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:06.270
be good right into the future, you want to

733
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.110
be a little bit careful about what you do,

734
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.110
and that's kind of how I think of biodiversity,

735
00:38:10.189 --> 00:38:13.070
right? Um, IT'S this amazing kind of resource that

736
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.639
we have on the planet. Um, THAT sustains life,

737
00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:19.770
um, not just for those organisms that are there,

738
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.649
but for all of us, all the people and

739
00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:24.209
everything, so we want to be careful about, you

740
00:38:24.209 --> 00:38:26.250
know, what we do to to lose that. It

741
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.489
may have really big impacts for us and our

742
00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:30.449
children, um, down the road.

743
00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:34.560
So, my last question will be then and this

744
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.719
is circling all the way back to our first

745
00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:41.669
question. So, I mean, uh uh is it possible

746
00:38:41.669 --> 00:38:44.719
with the knowledge, the scientific knowledge we have and

747
00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:48.120
the tools we have at our disposal to predict

748
00:38:48.479 --> 00:38:54.189
how particular uh populations, specifically animal populations will react

749
00:38:54.189 --> 00:38:55.439
to climate change.

750
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.110
Yeah, so that is one thing that we're working

751
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.879
on a lot, you know, how to, what's the

752
00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:02.080
future gonna look like, and the reasons we wanna

753
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.959
know that is because we wanna know what kinds

754
00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:06.239
of interventions or things that we should or can

755
00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:10.010
do that might make things better, right? Um. And

756
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.610
I would say, OK, the short answer is no.

757
00:39:12.689 --> 00:39:14.770
It's not possible to predict what's in the future,

758
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.689
and the reason for that is, right, we don't

759
00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:19.320
know what climate change itself is really gonna look

760
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.050
like, right? So there's lots of different models out

761
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.969
there that show, all right, here's what we think

762
00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:28.189
may be happening if, you know, we see um.

763
00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:32.354
1 °C 2 °C, you know, all those sorts

764
00:39:32.354 --> 00:39:35.725
of things, but we don't really know how it

765
00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:38.635
will play out, how it will play out across

766
00:39:38.635 --> 00:39:40.995
the globes, and even those, those are called global

767
00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:44.955
circulation models, GCMs that are trying across the world

768
00:39:44.955 --> 00:39:48.399
to, you know, predict what The climate might look

769
00:39:48.399 --> 00:39:51.560
like and weather patterns might look like under different

770
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.560
climate change scenarios. But each one of those models,

771
00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:56.280
you know, there's different groups around the world that

772
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.280
take a ton of competing powder, computing powder, each

773
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.760
one of those around the world is making predictions

774
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.679
that they're not the same, right? Because there's all

775
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.639
different kinds of nuance that are difficult to bring

776
00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:08.409
in. And then the same thing about, you know,

777
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.040
so there's one, there's this uncertainty about what the

778
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.110
environment will look like in the future. And then

779
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.719
the other thing is we have an uncertainty about

780
00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:17.870
what we know for the animals, you know, for

781
00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:20.889
for species and for biodiversity can only You know,

782
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.959
data are just data. They're not, they're not, um,

783
00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:26.449
perfect. And same thing with our models. If it

784
00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:28.010
was, you know, if we could create a model

785
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.649
that was reality, we would just call it reality,

786
00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:34.129
right? So the model by by definition is going

787
00:40:34.129 --> 00:40:36.489
to be wrong. It's an imperfect description that we

788
00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:38.810
have of of the environment and what we think

789
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.570
is going on. Um, SO we know it won't,

790
00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:44.570
it won't be correct and and we can kind

791
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.550
of try to understand. Which we do all the

792
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.709
time, where or what are the pieces that we

793
00:40:49.709 --> 00:40:52.659
think we don't know that well. So really, I

794
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.540
would say with the prediction, what we're really trying

795
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.500
to do is have this uncertainty about what that

796
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.139
future climate looks like, plus this uncertainty about our

797
00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:05.659
understanding of how species respond to environmental variables, and

798
00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:07.500
we can put that together and we can give

799
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.260
you what we think about is not predicting the

800
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.209
future, which is impossible, but predicting out what probabilities

801
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.540
of different things that we might see. Is there

802
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.360
a high probability? That this population will decline into

803
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.969
the future in these areas under certain conditions or

804
00:41:23.969 --> 00:41:26.250
not. So that's kind of the thing that we

805
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.889
try to look out, not necessarily what the future

806
00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:32.800
will be, but how much confidence do we have

807
00:41:32.969 --> 00:41:35.810
in these possible different scenarios. The species is fine,

808
00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:39.129
the species increases, the species decreasing, right? That sort

809
00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:42.810
of thing, under different scenarios. So we'll never know

810
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.780
what the future holds, but we try to think

811
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.399
about what could happen. Under different scenarios. And if

812
00:41:48.399 --> 00:41:50.959
we could say, all right, look, 70% chance this,

813
00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:54.479
this trajectory is going to happen, even if we

814
00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:57.560
see different climate scenarios, that's useful, right? And then

815
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.199
we can think about into the future, how do

816
00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:03.189
we plan for that? Um, KNOWING it's not certain,

817
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.719
right? Knowing it's not certain with some flexibility in

818
00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.320
there, but how can we plan for that and

819
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.750
think about where might we want to do conservation?

820
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.879
What would be the best approaches, what's likely to

821
00:42:13.879 --> 00:42:15.040
work, that sort of thing.

822
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.860
Great. So just before we go, would you like

823
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.300
to let people know where they can find you

824
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.139
and your work on the internet?

825
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:30.580
Yeah, so I have a website, um, www.zipkinlab.org, um,

826
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.080
and there's more information there. All our papers, the

827
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.399
peer reviewed papers that we publish are free on

828
00:42:35.399 --> 00:42:38.679
there, so anybody can, um, you know, access the

829
00:42:38.679 --> 00:42:41.479
work that we do. We also publish all the

830
00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:43.620
code. All our models do. There's a link on

831
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.219
there to our GitHub repo, because one of the

832
00:42:46.219 --> 00:42:48.540
things that I think is really important is open

833
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.419
science and that what we do is reproducible and

834
00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:53.300
can be used by others to make it better

835
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.379
into the future, you know. So, um, that's another

836
00:42:56.379 --> 00:42:58.860
thing I think, you know, that can help this

837
00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.669
process along.

838
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.270
Great, so I'm leaving the links in the description

839
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.639
of the interview below. So Doctor Zipkin, thank you

840
00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:08.679
so much again for taking the time to come

841
00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:10.750
on this. It's been a real pleasure.

842
00:43:11.199 --> 00:43:13.399
Yeah, thank you so much. Yeah, it's been really

843
00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:13.600
interesting.
