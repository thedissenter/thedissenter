00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.989
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:09.409
the MG by Doctor Deborah Liberman. She's professor and

4
00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.840
has served as Associate chair for undergraduate affairs and

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.800
Research in the Department of Psychology at the University

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.825
of Miami. She's also the author of Book, objection,

7
00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.055
disgust morality and the law. And today we're going

8
00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:26.504
to talk about, uh, from an evolutionary perspective, of

9
00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:32.615
course, about emotions, disgust, gratitude, and emotional tears. So,

10
00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.345
Dr. Lieberman, welcome to the show. It's a big

11
00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:36.494
pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:38.794
Thank you very much. It's great to be here.

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.790
So let me start perhaps with a more, with

14
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.509
a broader, more general question. So, from an evolutionary

15
00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:52.939
perspective, how do you approach emotions? What are emotions,

16
00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:56.189
and do you personally, do you approach them as

17
00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.740
adaptations or as something else?

18
00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:04.440
That's a great place to start. So, My perspective

19
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.680
on emotions is that they are programs. They are

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.599
somehow kind of neurally instantiated algorithms that help guide

21
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.470
behavior. I don't see them as different than cognition,

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.559
so oftentimes we hear about emotion versus cognition. But

23
00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.760
when you talk about the kinds of problems that

24
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.360
we solve and the information processing structure of, of

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.330
the mind, the brain, Uh, somewhere in all of

26
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.290
that emotions are just like other aspects of cognition,

27
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.370
information processing programs, um, but these are well coordinated

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.849
to take advantage of elements of, of, you know,

29
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:44.730
psychology and physiology to coordinate the mind and the

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.769
body in a way that would have allowed for

31
00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.849
the solving of an adaptive problem. So my approach

32
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.559
to emotions is thinking about. The past environment, uh,

33
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.639
the kinds of problems we would have had to

34
00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:00.129
solve across the entire life stage, both sexes, what

35
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.769
kinds of programs would have somehow offered an advantage

36
00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:08.380
to survival and reproduction. And so that's how I,

37
00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.210
that's how I, I typically tend to start, um.

38
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.759
Thinking about What the emotions could be and what

39
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:16.589
they might look like.

40
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.279
Uh, BUT so they are adaptations in your perspective

41
00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.029
or not?

42
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.429
Um, I think, well, I, I try to test

43
00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.979
whether they are. Um, THE question is whether there's

44
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.699
any type of evolved, uh, functionality and specialization to

45
00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.289
solving a problem. The more evidence that you have

46
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.220
in the direction that something does look very tailored

47
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.899
to solving a particular problem, the more evidence you

48
00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.740
have in favor of it being an evolved adaptation.

49
00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.639
Um, AND so I think that you're always being

50
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.410
cautious, throwing that term around, but, uh, in general,

51
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.630
I think that the suite of emotions, uh, are,

52
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.160
you know, they, they constitute a suite of adaptations,

53
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.190
but, but trying to understand, uh, what, uh, their,

54
00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.539
their components and so forth, that, that's a matter

55
00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.360
of, of hypothesis testing.

56
00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.149
So when it comes to the functions of emotions,

57
00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.520
if I understand it correctly, I think we have

58
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.240
to approach them on a case by case basis

59
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.399
because different emotions sort of uh different functions. But

60
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:26.320
generally speaking, are there functions that emotions in general

61
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.789
serve? I mean, what do we need the emotions

62
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:29.089
for?

63
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.039
Uh, SO emotions, I would say are just a

64
00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.759
particular type of program that are that's capable of

65
00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:41.039
coordinating the activation, deactivation of a series of other

66
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.039
psychological or physiological components. So what makes an emotion

67
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.429
program my perspective. Uh, AN emotion program is, is

68
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.990
how the extent to which it coordinates across the

69
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.860
entire, you know, system, uh, you know, all human

70
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.139
systems. So when you have a system that's capable

71
00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.199
of, um, of regulating memory, attention, Uh, physiology, heart

72
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.520
rate, for instance. I mean, these are things that

73
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.839
require some type of top-level coordination signal, and to

74
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.119
me, emotions are that type of signal that cascade

75
00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.290
throughout the mind and body and are capable of

76
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.160
activating, deactivating whatever programs were necessary in order to

77
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.529
solve a particular problem. So I, I just see

78
00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.920
emotions as coordinating systems and coordinating devices. So in

79
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.410
that sense, they're just a higher level cognitive program,

80
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.600
if you will, but Um, but in any case,

81
00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:38.089
no, I take them as discrete. Discrete types of

82
00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:41.929
programs. Certainly, they can blend into one another in

83
00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:43.529
terms of what they look like and what they

84
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.329
feel like. But my, the way I at least

85
00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.209
approach each emotion is that it's going to have

86
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:53.529
a particular information processing structure with, with specified and

87
00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.489
knowable inputs, ways information gets integrated, and then, you

88
00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:02.390
know, knowable pre predictable outputs. Um. So that's one

89
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.070
way I, I start with it. So emotions to

90
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.049
me are just very interesting complex mental apps. Mhm.

91
00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:15.750
And how do emotions connect to morality? What is

92
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.660
the link there and how is it established?

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.309
You've gone there very quickly. Um, AND so I

94
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:33.809
would say emotions to morality. Um, Uh, WELL, You

95
00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.609
want me to bridge an is aught gap in

96
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:38.489
the first few minutes of our conversation here, so.

97
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.149
Um. I would say that emotions make salient and,

98
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.440
and, and register certain events as being fitness promoting

99
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.149
from uh fitness enhancing, goal fulfilling or goal not

100
00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.920
fulfilling, and I think that These outputs of value,

101
00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.429
um, that indicate whether or not you prefer to

102
00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.839
engage in a particular behavior, associate with particular people,

103
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.410
um, Inform our way of viewing the world as

104
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.170
to what seems right and wrong. So if I

105
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.049
can just say that at the outset and maybe

106
00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:17.989
leave the rest for when we get maybe particularly

107
00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.250
to disgust, I can talk a little bit more,

108
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.540
maybe how disgust is involved in that. Certainly not

109
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.470
the only emotion that informs our, our moral sense.

110
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.410
But, uh, if I can give you a general

111
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.869
answer like that for now. Or uh

112
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:32.980
yeah, of course.

113
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.519
So, uh, so what do you want to jump

114
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.369
into a particular emotion to kind of get at

115
00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:46.940
maybe how um How it might inform morality. I

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.899
mean, we have to define what morality is, and

117
00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.850
that it might take a little bit longer than

118
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.940
than an hour, but uh but I'll leave it

119
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.019
to you. Do you wanna, do you want to

120
00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.019
jump into disgust?

121
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.700
Oh, OK. Is there any way that you could

122
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.285
give us Uh, just a brief definition of morality

123
00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:07.404
then to, then for people to understand then how

124
00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.864
the link is established. And then perhaps we can

125
00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:12.285
get into the emotion of these guest, which is

126
00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:14.364
one that you have explored a lot in your

127
00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:14.924
work, so.

128
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.910
Let's do the second part first, and then the

129
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.950
first part after only because defining morality. I don't

130
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.549
know that I have the street cred to do

131
00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:26.869
that, but at least I can talk about social

132
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:30.869
value, uh, as it pertains to disgust. And so

133
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:33.190
I can let the, the listeners draw their own

134
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.190
conclusions about what they consider morality to be after

135
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.549
I kind of paint that picture and tell them

136
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.269
what maybe I think is going on here. But

137
00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:43.940
in terms of what, you know, what morality is,

138
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.730
uh, I think that there's There are a lot

139
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.679
of possible ways to, to explore that. Um, I

140
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.910
definitely take a biological approach to understanding, um, morality

141
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.290
and why we feel certain things are right versus

142
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.649
wrong. Uh, YOU change a couple circuits in our

143
00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:02.329
brain, and we would very much feel that different

144
00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:05.130
kinds of behaviors were right versus wrong. And so

145
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.450
the way I like to talk about it, or

146
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.010
at least begin to talk about it is through

147
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.929
the emotion of disgust. So let's maybe get to

148
00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:11.890
discuss first.

149
00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:17.529
OK, let's go into this gust then. So, what

150
00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.619
is this, I mean, I have a couple of

151
00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:23.019
questions here. Uh, WHAT is this gust? How has

152
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:26.140
it evolved since we're tackling things here from the

153
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.380
perspective of evolutionary psychology and what functions does it

154
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.779
serve?

155
00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.989
Well, as you know, there's been a lot of

156
00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:37.750
work on Disgust. So I'm far from the first

157
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.190
researcher to, uh, to take a look at the

158
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.150
functions, the evolved functions of Disgust. Paul Rozin, Jonathan

159
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.070
Haidt, and a whole bunch of their colleagues have

160
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.390
done a lot of, uh, great work thinking about

161
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.890
what disgust is. I had worked early on with,

162
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:55.849
uh, Josh Tiber, and he and I started to

163
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.669
Think about whether the way that uh Rosin and

164
00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:05.580
Height had kind of cut up discussed was the

165
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.260
best way when thinking about evolved function. Certainly they

166
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.219
identified a whole bunch of discussed solicitors. Uh, THE

167
00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.979
question is how, how best to account for all

168
00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:18.229
of that. And working with Josh, we initially thought

169
00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:21.750
about disgust as a pathogen role that it serves

170
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.419
a sexual role and then a moral moral role.

171
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.830
And, um, my thinking has evolved a little bit

172
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.750
since then. So, uh, because in some of our

173
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.229
papers we've talked about that kind of, and we

174
00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:37.549
have a scale measuring the three domains of disgust,

175
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.270
pathogens, sexual, and moral. And I don't, I don't

176
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.909
think that, uh, is, is probably far from what's

177
00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:46.299
going on. But since then, Carlton Patrick and I,

178
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.280
who co-auth co-authored the book Objection, um, that you

179
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.750
mentioned at the, at the top. We started to

180
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.750
think about uh disgust, breaking it down a little

181
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.710
bit differently. So, I think disgust evolved to solve

182
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.030
three separate problems. What to eat, what to touch,

183
00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:06.309
and with whom to mate. And so those particular,

184
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.260
you know, the consumption, the contact, and sex are,

185
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.419
I think the three native. Primary functions of disgust.

186
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.419
And the order that that this evolved in, uh,

187
00:10:19.469 --> 00:10:21.859
I think is an interesting question. But in terms

188
00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:26.409
of functionality, it looks like disgust is the output

189
00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:30.460
of a consumption psychology that registers whether or not

190
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.239
any particular piece of matter, any morsel. Uh, IS,

191
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.159
you know, what's the expected fitness value of consuming

192
00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:39.719
anything in the environment at any one time across

193
00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.719
the life stage and, and so forth. And so

194
00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:45.479
this is a, a critical problem that our ancestors

195
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.950
and all animals would have had to have solved.

196
00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:50.719
And the question is, what does that programming look

197
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:56.280
like? And so, As Carlton and I um started

198
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.650
to talk about this, also, Josh Tiber, uh, was

199
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.940
part of this discussion early on as well. We

200
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.849
basically tried to come up with what a system

201
00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:10.390
would look like, and We evaluate morsels of food

202
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.039
based on a bunch of criteria through a bunch

203
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.989
of senses, right? So how much sugar, how much

204
00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:18.789
salt, uh, you know, protein, um, fats, and so

205
00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:22.630
forth. And we have a system that detects their

206
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.539
presence based on cues, so sweetness versus bitterness, uh,

207
00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:29.000
for toxins that we want to tend to avoid.

208
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:32.440
And it generates, uh, as an output, kind of

209
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.950
this scrumptiousness sense, right? So either something is yucky

210
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.080
and you don't want to eat it versus it's

211
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.349
really scrumptious, and you do want to eat it,

212
00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:43.799
but disgust seems to be on the tail end

213
00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:45.929
of that, on one continuum, on one side of

214
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:48.789
the. Continuum preventing us from eating things that would

215
00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:51.109
have, would have been harmful. But I should say

216
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:53.539
that, of course, there's a lot of things and

217
00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:56.460
a lot of input the system has to take,

218
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.580
and it a lot should matter. So not only

219
00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:04.719
the cues of sugar presents, salt presence, Um, you

220
00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:07.559
know, protein and fat and so forth. Those are

221
00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.559
the things that we tend to seek out. But

222
00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:12.640
also, we want to make sure that we're not

223
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.320
consuming, uh, in too much, in too much quantities,

224
00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:20.510
toxins and, and, and microorganisms. And so we have,

225
00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.799
you know, sour and bitter, which are there in

226
00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.909
order to help us detect the presence of plant

227
00:12:25.909 --> 00:12:28.780
toxins, which could have been quite poisonous, and then

228
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.760
microorganisms which can take over our entire system. And

229
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.429
so, in addition to those inputs, though, you have,

230
00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:38.799
you know, developmental inputs. So what stage of developments

231
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:42.039
are you in? And so plant toxins are particularly,

232
00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:45.280
uh, harmful to young kids. This is why young

233
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.219
kids don't like eating their vegetables, um, because a

234
00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:50.349
lot of the brain growth isn't done yet, and

235
00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:53.909
plant toxins can interrupt a lot of the neurogenesis.

236
00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:57.440
And so there's, there's developmental stage. But then there's

237
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.679
also experience in your priors with any particular food

238
00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.640
substance, which should, of course, update and inform whether

239
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.909
or not you're going to eat something again. Um,

240
00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:07.919
ALTHOUGH it doesn't seem to happen with tequila, does

241
00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:10.070
it? Right? So you can drink tequila once and,

242
00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:12.440
you know, get really sick and then suddenly two

243
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.400
months later, you're like, Ah, sounds like a great

244
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.840
idea again. So, for whatever reason, tequila seems to

245
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.700
be an interesting exception to this rule. Um. But

246
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.010
that's neither here nor there right now. And so,

247
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.539
uh, but what, what is interesting also is that

248
00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:30.340
cultural norms should inform the system too, right? So

249
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.780
the idea that you are going to be told,

250
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.260
no matter what society you're born into, what's appropriate,

251
00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:39.719
what's inappropriate to consume, and that should also generate

252
00:13:39.979 --> 00:13:42.979
and uh help regulate the things that you find

253
00:13:42.979 --> 00:13:46.659
repetitive versus aversive. So, the food, just food psychology

254
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.549
is a really complex system. Oh, I should also

255
00:13:49.549 --> 00:13:54.099
mention probably that your health status should update what

256
00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:57.159
you find, uh, yummy to eat as well. So

257
00:13:57.159 --> 00:13:59.510
when you're sick, you tend to seek out plants.

258
00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:03.229
Uh, AND so sometimes the secondary compounds of, of

259
00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:07.469
plants could be adjuvant therapies for, for disease organisms.

260
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.289
A while I had seen and had written about

261
00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:12.609
how even chimps kind of seek out particular plants

262
00:14:12.609 --> 00:14:14.530
and they'll, they'll roll it up, kind of like

263
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.690
dip and just kind of suck on the juices.

264
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.369
They won't eat it, chew it up or eat

265
00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:20.130
it, but they will kind of extract some of

266
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.890
the, the compounds of the plants. Perhaps this was

267
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.330
kind of a, an early stage or early form

268
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.419
of, of medicine. But in any case, A lot

269
00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:32.659
of factors should influence our food psychology, our consumption

270
00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:35.179
psychology, and I think disgust is, is certainly part

271
00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:39.500
of that. Uh, AND then I think touching things,

272
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.979
so contacting things that could have potentially been dangerous

273
00:14:42.979 --> 00:14:47.619
sources or contaminants, uh, is something also disgust regulates,

274
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.929
but then sexual disgust, who you find attractive as

275
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:54.369
a, as a mate. So the idea that Discussed

276
00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:58.200
as a system is already sensitive to pathogen presence.

277
00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:01.530
It doesn't make it all that, uh, far a

278
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.330
leap to think that, you know, you can up

279
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.010
regulate it or down regulate it. So the idea

280
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.169
that, you know, another person represents an entire different

281
00:15:10.169 --> 00:15:13.450
planet of microorganisms, right? So how, how does sex

282
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.849
even happen if we have a disgust system that's

283
00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:19.969
sensitive to the microorganisms and pathogens of others? Well,

284
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.729
instead, Of up regulating other factors cause disgust to

285
00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:26.770
down regulate in order for sexual attraction to take

286
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.049
hold. Uh, THAT would have been, uh, how disgust

287
00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:33.650
enters into the sexual, uh, sexual psychology. So either

288
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.570
up regulating to prevent someone from being motivated to

289
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.969
seek someone out sexually, or, um, or kind of

290
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:43.690
having that reduction in disgust. And there's great individual

291
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.000
differences in, in these systems and so forth. So

292
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.599
I think that Uh, it's a very long-winded answer

293
00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:52.969
to your question, what is discussed, but so consumption,

294
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.479
contact, and sex, I would say are, are some

295
00:15:55.479 --> 00:15:58.479
of the, the three main areas, uh, over which

296
00:15:58.479 --> 00:15:59.429
disgust reigns.

297
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.900
OK. So this is a question that I've already

298
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.590
discussed with several different evolutionary psychologists on the show.

299
00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:10.989
Uh, I, I think that, uh, I mean, I

300
00:16:10.989 --> 00:16:14.739
started the show almost 7 years ago, and I've

301
00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:17.070
been discussing this from the very beginning. So I'm

302
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.270
not sure if over time, things have changed when

303
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.989
it comes to this discussion with this, when it

304
00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:26.349
comes to this specific discussion, but is there such

305
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:28.869
a thing as moral disgust?

306
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.719
It's a good question. Um, I started out thinking

307
00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:38.450
that there was, um, and I will tell you

308
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.250
that the first run through of the book Carlton

309
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.210
and I wrote really reflected three different areas, a

310
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.719
pathogen disgust, a sexual disgust, and a moral disgust.

311
00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:51.739
Um, AND until it came time to write moral

312
00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:54.809
disgust, it seemed really clear to understand consumption and

313
00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:58.150
contact and sex and write out information processing systems,

314
00:16:58.289 --> 00:17:02.150
inputs, how things are integrated, outputs. And when it

315
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.118
comes to moral disgust, it was just a big

316
00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:08.439
old question mark, like, what, how, where, who? Like,

317
00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:13.739
how does this work? Um, AND it's, it caused

318
00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:18.469
me to pause and think whether moral disgust was

319
00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:22.949
indeed a primary domain, uh, or whether it was

320
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:28.010
derived. And so, It, it really went, I went

321
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.130
back to the drawing board, literally, because I, I

322
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.089
enjoy trying to map out the inputs and how

323
00:17:34.089 --> 00:17:36.319
things get put together. You know, if you could

324
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:38.709
have a scheme schematic that you could hand over

325
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:41.170
to the MIT, you know, Imagineers to build it

326
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.969
into their, their robots, what would you give to

327
00:17:43.969 --> 00:17:46.729
them? And when it came to morality, I had

328
00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:50.609
nothing but vague kind of like magical like magic

329
00:17:50.609 --> 00:17:53.760
happens here, who knows, and then this output of,

330
00:17:53.890 --> 00:18:01.959
you know, punishment, uh, and so. Obviously, early researchers

331
00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:06.569
identified that when people are asked to nominate what

332
00:18:06.569 --> 00:18:09.560
disgusts them, a large swath of the items that

333
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.640
people will nominate have to do with morality, lying,

334
00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:16.560
cheating, stealing, and so forth. Um, AND so it

335
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.199
would, of course, seem that this is one important

336
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:24.329
domain. How does it work? Well, my thinking was

337
00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:27.489
that if we just change, if we can possibly

338
00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:29.810
drop the term morality for a second, I can

339
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.489
let you think it, you can think it, but

340
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:33.010
I'm not gonna say it for a minute because

341
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.569
I'm gonna stay in more safe grounds here. It

342
00:18:36.569 --> 00:18:40.410
seems as if disgust, what it does is it

343
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.469
updates our sense of social value of others. Um,

344
00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:47.550
SO folks in the, in evolutionary psychology have come

345
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.790
up with a, uh, a term of art welfare

346
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.869
trade-off ratio that we generate a, an idea of

347
00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.670
how much other people care for us, how willing

348
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.910
they are to trade off their, their welfare for

349
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.050
us. And we have an idea of how willing

350
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.250
we would be to trade off our welfare for

351
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.770
them. So we have a welfare trade-off ratio that

352
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.930
we can generate, uh, on the fly for any

353
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.770
given person in a, in a given context. And

354
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.680
we use this to guide our social interactions. And

355
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.319
so, I like to think about this as more

356
00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:21.000
of a general social value, that for every person

357
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.160
that we interact with, we have a sense of

358
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.880
their social value. What's the expected value of interacting

359
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.839
with this person. Um, AND so, my question was,

360
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.550
does disgust influence our social value of other people?

361
00:19:35.949 --> 00:19:38.640
And is that the way that it gets into

362
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.719
morality? So when you think about my, you know,

363
00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:47.449
so Consumption, contact, and sexual psychologies, that all regulates

364
00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:49.729
first person behavior. That's like what I want to

365
00:19:49.729 --> 00:19:51.589
prefer, what I, you know, prefer to do and,

366
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.530
and, and have happen in my world. Um, HOW

367
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.989
does, how does that information, because if that was

368
00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:59.290
it, disgust, you know, what disgusts me, that's it.

369
00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:01.329
And there's, that's the end of the, the sentence.

370
00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:03.839
There's a period and, and everyone else does what,

371
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.130
you know, why do I care what anyone else

372
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.189
does? And so the question is, does my assessment

373
00:20:09.189 --> 00:20:11.329
of what other people are doing influence how I

374
00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:14.979
perceive them? And I think the answer is yes.

375
00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:17.630
And at least as it relates to disgust, because

376
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.430
I think other emotions are obviously going to be

377
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.030
involved in morality. Uh, BUT as it relates to

378
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.189
disgust, it looks as though People tend to evaluate

379
00:20:27.189 --> 00:20:33.060
the foods other people eat. The matter and physical

380
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.089
world that people tend to contact and interact with,

381
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.849
and the sexual behavior of other people, that registers

382
00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:44.339
in our mind as, you know, as having a

383
00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:47.540
certain type of value. Think about it. If you

384
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.300
had someone eating your favorite meal and drinking your

385
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.130
favorite wine or whatever it is, You, that would

386
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.030
be your new best friend, right? So someone who

387
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.250
especially is really proficient at making these things and

388
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.040
procuring all these great things to eat. I mean,

389
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:05.969
this is someone you want to associate with often.

390
00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:09.079
On the other hand, if someone's eating things that

391
00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:12.680
you personally find foul, don't, doesn't taste well, for

392
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.719
whatever reason, a history of not knowing what it

393
00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:17.869
is, um, and so not, not be, you know,

394
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.160
never having tasted it, or literally just doesn't taste

395
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.630
right to you. Uh, THESE are not people you're

396
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.420
not, you're gonna want to associate with. And so,

397
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.150
Just consumption can influence the value that we place

398
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.030
on the behavior of other people when it comes

399
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.430
to what they're eating. And you, you know, a

400
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.910
lot of food taboos, a lot of food laws

401
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.030
uh seem to, to take, to take advantage of,

402
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:48.449
of this. So If it's the case that what

403
00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:52.410
you're eating influences my sense of your value to

404
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.280
me, that might be one way that suddenly now

405
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.640
disgust jumps the fence and goes now from personal

406
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.369
decisions to more social third party decisions as to

407
00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:05.410
whether I want to interact with you. There's still

408
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.839
more to come in terms of how you get

409
00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:10.390
to the, you know, maybe full-blown. Morality, sorts of

410
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.109
behavior, moral behaviors. But I think that's the first

411
00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:15.760
step. The idea that what you're touching, what you're

412
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.510
eating, who you're having sex with, it registers to

413
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.310
me as, is this something that I find for

414
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.390
me, uh, something that is behavior that I would

415
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.469
engage in or I find of high value. Right?

416
00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:31.349
So I think that's the first step there. And

417
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.680
you have cases where people who, you know, so

418
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.040
in India, the untouchable cast, it's literally untouchables, like

419
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.520
people who are seen as lower status, or they're

420
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.160
doing jobs that bring them more into contact with

421
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.890
contaminants. These are, these are things that cause them

422
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.520
to have a lower social value to an entire

423
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.079
society, potentially. Um, BUT people who eat particular types

424
00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:57.800
of foods, people who engage in insects that you

425
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.020
wouldn't find necessarily attractive, That's, those are other reasons

426
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.380
why people might have lowered social value for different

427
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.939
groups. So that's kind of the first step in

428
00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:13.589
as to how disgust starts to To color and

429
00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:16.109
shade our social world in terms of things that

430
00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:19.150
we, you know, people we prefer, people we, we

431
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.829
don't prefer to associate with. Um, BUT then the

432
00:23:22.829 --> 00:23:25.349
question becomes, uh, if you want me to continue

433
00:23:25.349 --> 00:23:29.869
on the story here, then the question becomes. Stop

434
00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:35.089
me whenever you want. No, no problem. OK. How

435
00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:37.930
is it that we get from, so, who cares,

436
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.089
right? So I see you eating. Um, THERE'S very

437
00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:43.810
few foods that I actually don't really like, but

438
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.250
like, like parkle, which is, I think like fermented

439
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.079
shark. So forgive me if you've ever tasted this

440
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.530
and enjoy it, but that's the only type of

441
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.489
food that has almost really in a restaurant made

442
00:23:56.489 --> 00:24:03.199
me just yuck, and so. Mm Why is it

443
00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:07.160
that if I saw you eating fermented shark? Why

444
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.599
do I care? To me, I should say, you

445
00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:12.439
eat it all, because the more you eat of

446
00:24:12.439 --> 00:24:14.959
it, the more of the other good food that's

447
00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:18.680
left for me. So, have at it and leave

448
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.040
all the good scrumptious stuff, uh, for me to

449
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.920
eat. So it would seem like it's almost strange,

450
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.920
right? So, disgust tells me, you know, OK, that's

451
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.670
not what I prefer, but if you prefer it,

452
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.400
hm, have at it. Who cares? So the real

453
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.500
question is, why do we care? Why not live

454
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.619
and let live? And so I think that in

455
00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:40.020
order to get to the answer for that, you

456
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.060
have to think about a couple of different systems.

457
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.859
So leaving disgust behind for a second, um, Carlton

458
00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:52.050
and I talked about in the book Objection, what

459
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.099
might happen. And so, and it was based on

460
00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:57.380
a lot of thinking. I should also mention that

461
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.390
this wasn't at all, uh, original, uh, To us,

462
00:25:02.609 --> 00:25:05.449
but we had used other sources and other people

463
00:25:05.449 --> 00:25:07.520
who had really thought long and hard about this.

464
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.609
And this includes Lita Cosmides, John Touby in their

465
00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:13.770
great paper Groups in Mind, but also Peter Dholi

466
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.640
and Rob Kurzban, who had written a lot about

467
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.479
morality too. So we were trying to come up

468
00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:22.959
with a specific answer, and I, we came up

469
00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:30.449
with the idea that, look, humans are concerned about

470
00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:34.329
resources, right? So the ability to control resources would

471
00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:37.290
have been very important, particularly to males. So to

472
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.449
the extent that females prefer males or prefer to

473
00:25:40.449 --> 00:25:43.170
mate with males who have access to resources because

474
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.199
what limits a female's reproductive success. And the ability

475
00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:51.270
for females to rear offspring, uh, at least ancestrally,

476
00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:54.839
was her, her access to resources. So preferring males

477
00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:58.869
who are capable of providing resources and defending them

478
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.079
would have been really important. And this has shaped

479
00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:05.030
male psychology, of course. To want to acquire resources

480
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.790
and defend them. And so you have a lot

481
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.989
of uh intersexual sexual competition, males fighting for one

482
00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:15.709
another, uh, in order to, uh, in order to

483
00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:18.229
control resources and females are very sensitive to all

484
00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:23.670
of this. So I don't think it's a um

485
00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:27.069
I don't think it's controversial to say that males

486
00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:31.390
seek resources, females prefer males with resources. So I

487
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.589
don't think that's going to get me in hot

488
00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:34.589
water. I think later it gets me in hot

489
00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:39.069
water. And so, um, so the, so if you

490
00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:41.949
take that as a kind of a baseline condition

491
00:26:41.949 --> 00:26:46.839
here. That sets the stage for being concerned about

492
00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:50.650
who has access to resources and who is controlling

493
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.920
resources, because any resource that you have, I do

494
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.209
not. So it is a zero-sum psychology in, in

495
00:26:57.209 --> 00:27:02.150
some sense. But if you couple that now with

496
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.800
the human, almost, it's not unique to humans, but

497
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.160
it's certainly we're certainly one of the very few

498
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.199
species that's capable of physically coordinating. So, so humans

499
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.689
now have the ability based on additional cognitive features

500
00:27:15.689 --> 00:27:18.880
and adaptations that allow us to mentally and physically

501
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.959
coordinate with one another. Shifting the leverage of dyadic

502
00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:28.800
interactions to multi-group interactions, such that, normally, if we're

503
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.479
in a context contest over resources, it's you and

504
00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:34.119
I are going to meet, we're gonna see who's

505
00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:37.119
bigger, who's stronger, who's healthier at the moment, who

506
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:39.750
can take who and who's gonna get the resources.

507
00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.989
Um, AND so, you know, they'd go to you.

508
00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:47.589
And so, uh, but they'll get come to me,

509
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.900
however, if I now meet you with a whole

510
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.949
bunch of my friends. And I don't mean little

511
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:56.140
kids. Right? But I mean people who could actually,

512
00:27:56.349 --> 00:27:58.910
you know, really tilt the leverage in terms of

513
00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:01.189
Uh, you know, and the, and the formidability in

514
00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:03.829
my favor, and then I get all that. So

515
00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:07.060
the ability for humans to form, uh, these coalitions

516
00:28:07.349 --> 00:28:10.579
would have shifted the way that resources, uh, were,

517
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.510
were allocated. And so with that in mind, males

518
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.310
who have a sensitivity to resource, the resource allocation

519
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.410
of structure in the environment, who has what, uh,

520
00:28:22.449 --> 00:28:24.670
and then the ability to form these coalitions in

521
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.709
order to ensure that they have the one, they're

522
00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:30.170
the ones who get the Uh, resources and outcompete

523
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.329
others. Suddenly now you have that type of psychology.

524
00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:40.430
Thinking about, well, who is worth competing against in

525
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.390
order to ensure that I have more resources? Are

526
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.329
you going to fight to the death your kids

527
00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:50.150
for resources or friends, or, you know, tight cooperators?

528
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:52.439
Of course not, right? These are people who have

529
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.020
fitness value in other in other ways. And so,

530
00:28:56.189 --> 00:28:58.020
uh, and I should say, you're not thinking about

531
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.069
this consciously, right? So the idea that I feed

532
00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:02.310
my child is not because I'm consciously thinking, hey,

533
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:04.295
you're Are, you know, you're, you're related to me.

534
00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:07.094
R 0.5, have, have like, you know, this amount

535
00:29:07.094 --> 00:29:10.064
of food today. I know. I just, I love

536
00:29:10.064 --> 00:29:12.224
him. I want him to do well, and I

537
00:29:12.224 --> 00:29:16.175
feed him. And so, uh, so I'm really talking

538
00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:18.954
about the logic as to how these systems, uh,

539
00:29:19.135 --> 00:29:21.125
why these systems might be the way they are

540
00:29:21.125 --> 00:29:23.734
and sensitive to the information that they are, not

541
00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:28.979
necessarily our, our explicit motivations. And so, But the

542
00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:31.780
idea that we form coalitions and sensitive to resources

543
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.890
suddenly means now we, you know, we might be

544
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:40.699
surveying the landscape of social groups to determine who

545
00:29:40.699 --> 00:29:44.890
might be in my best interest to prevent From

546
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.489
getting access to resources. Um, IS it a pretty

547
00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:52.569
psychology? No, I don't think it is. But I

548
00:29:52.569 --> 00:29:58.319
think that we have a taste for identifying groups

549
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.849
that are low leveraged and going after them to

550
00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:05.319
marginalize them or exploit them. And so the real

551
00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:07.209
question now is, well, who, who do we go

552
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:11.520
after? Um, And I think that's where emotions like

553
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.430
disgust come into play, because disgust is one emotion

554
00:30:15.719 --> 00:30:18.880
that informs our value of other people, right? So

555
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.319
if you find a group of people, it, it,

556
00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:23.880
it just generates disgust in what they're eating, what

557
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.680
they're touching, who they're having sex with, then it

558
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.969
just puts it out there for other systems to

559
00:30:29.969 --> 00:30:32.400
say, if I'm searching for a group to go

560
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.920
after, this is, it would make sense to go

561
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.680
after folks like this, not people I value and

562
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.069
want to keep around. So, again, it's, it's not

563
00:30:42.069 --> 00:30:46.270
a, this isn't the, the sunny sunny side of

564
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.229
human nature. It's very much the dark side. But

565
00:30:49.229 --> 00:30:51.910
I think it's one that's important to understand and,

566
00:30:51.989 --> 00:30:55.189
and, and know about because it informs why we

567
00:30:55.189 --> 00:30:58.670
might think, think and try to coordinate other people

568
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.380
against other groups using sometimes the language of morality.

569
00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:06.959
So, um, so I guess that's, that's, that's. Where

570
00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:08.479
I want to kind of draw the line in

571
00:31:08.479 --> 00:31:10.189
terms of how far I'm willing to go here,

572
00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:13.839
but the idea that disgust informs the social value

573
00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:17.150
of others, kind of putting it, uh, you know,

574
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.150
flagging it to other systems that might be ready

575
00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:24.439
to form coalitions to exploit marginalized low leverage groups.

576
00:31:25.979 --> 00:31:29.739
OK, but then at what point, if there's a

577
00:31:29.739 --> 00:31:32.869
specific point, of course, does such a thing as

578
00:31:32.869 --> 00:31:35.750
moral condemnation come online?

579
00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:42.119
I think that, so if, if you cross out

580
00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:43.969
the word moral for a second, cause you'll see

581
00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:49.729
that it, it almost doesn't add much. So, uh,

582
00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:53.250
but when does condemnation come online? I think condemnation

583
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.729
comes online when you start to have a group

584
00:31:55.729 --> 00:31:58.250
of people who can come together and mentally and

585
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.060
physically coordinated that this is a group. That should

586
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:07.209
be marginalized and prevented from acquiring and controlling resources.

587
00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:11.140
So, um, you know, I, this is in stark

588
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.979
contrast to, so this will open up a can

589
00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:16.540
of worms. So stark contrast to the idea that

590
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.060
morality, morality is cooperation. So it's, it's often thought

591
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:26.300
that morality is this wonderful This wonderful world of

592
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.699
cooperation. And I just question whether all of it

593
00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:31.579
is. I think that's perhaps the best way of

594
00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:35.099
saying it. It seems to me that cooperation looks

595
00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:37.660
different than some of the things that I see

596
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.030
coming out of the, the moral sphere. For instance,

597
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.790
um, laws against homosexuality, they, they're quickly disappearing. But

598
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.250
at one point in time, there were, there were

599
00:32:50.589 --> 00:32:52.750
pretty harsh laws against, and in some parts of

600
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.150
the world, they're still there, pretty harsh uh laws

601
00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:01.349
um against homosexual homosexuality. And the question I have

602
00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:07.390
is, why? Why care? So, theoretically, one hypothesis could

603
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.310
be, if you're a heterosexual male, and that there

604
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.530
are a whole bunch of other men who are,

605
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:16.750
um, basically taking themselves, self-selecting out of the mating

606
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.140
pool, right? They're saying, I'm not interested in women.

607
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.010
And so that leaves for heterosexual men, far more

608
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.099
women. Uh, uh, A far more target rich environment

609
00:33:28.099 --> 00:33:30.619
for them, right? And so the idea that, you

610
00:33:30.619 --> 00:33:36.819
know, why aren't heterosexual men Championing, championing and celebrating.

611
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.739
Gay men, right? Why aren't there parades, annual parades

612
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.819
thrown by heterosexual men? Like, that, that are just,

613
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.650
you know, celebrating the range of, uh, of sexualities.

614
00:33:48.719 --> 00:33:52.020
And you just don't see that. And the question

615
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.219
is, why? Cause from on one hypothesis, again, maybe

616
00:33:55.219 --> 00:33:57.189
you can easily debunk it and, and, and shoot

617
00:33:57.189 --> 00:33:59.729
plenty of holes in it. But on one hypothesis,

618
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.229
you know, to the extent Men are not interested

619
00:34:02.229 --> 00:34:04.550
in women, that leaves far more, you know, women

620
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.510
for the heterosexual men who are there. Wouldn't that

621
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.909
be of benefit? Why not see that as a

622
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.389
benefit? Why not try to turn all men gay?

623
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.228
Right? So, I mean, that would be in one

624
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:19.188
universe, one possible set of behaviors, right? So the

625
00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:22.389
question is, why we're not in that universe, so

626
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:26.050
what can we infer from that? And so, um,

627
00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.340
the story that I have put together about if

628
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:34.020
heterosexual men find homosexuality disgusting, this puts it very

629
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.129
low on the social value scale, and therefore, potentially,

630
00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.379
at least at one point in time, made this

631
00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:42.739
group of individuals when they appeared to be low

632
00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.969
leveraged, by which I mean a uh a minority,

633
00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:50.469
um, in the sense of numbers. Uh, MADE them

634
00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.629
easy targets. But now, in today's world, you know,

635
00:34:53.708 --> 00:34:56.909
you see numbers growing and growing and growing, and

636
00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:00.169
perhaps to our psychology, it suggests that, hey, listen,

637
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.149
this is not a low leveraged group. This is

638
00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:05.270
a high leveraged group and quite formidable, and therefore,

639
00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:07.750
it actually would be too costly to try and

640
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.905
fight, uh, in, in that. Same way. And so,

641
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:13.514
perhaps this is one reason why you have seen

642
00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:17.064
laws and morality kind of change, uh, very quickly,

643
00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:19.875
um, to, to these types of groups. But now

644
00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:22.114
there's other types of sexual groups that are suffering

645
00:35:22.114 --> 00:35:24.425
the same kind of faiths that, that, you know,

646
00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:27.034
that gays and lesbians had been, had been suffering

647
00:35:27.034 --> 00:35:29.705
for quite some time. So it's a very interesting,

648
00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:33.594
it's a very interesting dynamic, I think. But my

649
00:35:33.594 --> 00:35:36.844
sense is that disgust is informing our social value,

650
00:35:37.274 --> 00:35:43.320
which is informing. Our sense of what groups do

651
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.510
we or can we target.

652
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.020
OK, so trying to avoid the word moral here,

653
00:35:51.429 --> 00:35:55.159
let's talk about, let's talk about just social condemnation.

654
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.540
So how do we go, how do we go

655
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:04.189
from emotions and social condemnation to something like social

656
00:36:04.189 --> 00:36:06.629
norms and then laws?

657
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:11.449
Well, I think that once you have, so it's

658
00:36:11.449 --> 00:36:13.250
a really good question. I don't even pretend to

659
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.520
have all the answers here, but I would say

660
00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.209
that once you have a group of people who

661
00:36:17.209 --> 00:36:21.310
are interested in Controlling resources and targeting a particular

662
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.550
group for whatever reason. It creates a really interesting

663
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.679
landscape. Uh, WELL, this is kind of to your

664
00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:29.709
question, but I'll get more directly to your question

665
00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:32.020
in a second. But it creates a landscape, uh,

666
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.350
for individuals very quickly, right? It's almost self-reinforcing. So

667
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.830
as soon as you're an individual and you come

668
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.270
into this world and you say, oh my gosh,

669
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.629
look at these coalitions, and look what they're saying

670
00:36:40.629 --> 00:36:44.110
is disgusting and worth uh condemning, well, you know,

671
00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:46.294
If it's a behavior that I that I like.

672
00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:49.864
So I happen to enjoy foie gras. California made

673
00:36:49.864 --> 00:36:53.264
foie gras illegal at some point. And so, um,

674
00:36:53.385 --> 00:36:55.905
you know, but as someone, you know, would I

675
00:36:55.905 --> 00:36:58.264
hold a banner, you know, walking in, you know,

676
00:36:58.385 --> 00:37:01.294
down, downtown LA or in San Francisco saying, you

677
00:37:01.294 --> 00:37:03.584
know, give me your foie gras, you know, foie

678
00:37:03.584 --> 00:37:06.524
gras lover here. Um, YOU know, that would be

679
00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:12.100
quite dangerous. Um, AND so. The idea that once

680
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.939
you understand the norms and the groups that are

681
00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:18.860
out there and what they condemn, you have to

682
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.620
kind of be very careful about the types of

683
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.899
behaviors that you engage in, and you could actually

684
00:37:23.899 --> 00:37:27.370
use disgust to identify, say, listen, you know, I,

685
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.610
I'm not on the wrong side of this issue

686
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.879
or this behavior. Take your sights off of me.

687
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.070
I'm not someone you want to condemn. Try and

688
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.110
find somebody else. So I think that that's almost

689
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.110
self-reinforcing, right? The idea, it's reinforcing the norm because

690
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.770
you want to make sure, even if, you know,

691
00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:45.389
you, you loved foie gras and you were part

692
00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:47.850
of the council that, you know, that, that Made

693
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.929
it illegal at some point, um, you would perhaps

694
00:37:50.929 --> 00:37:53.649
be very concerned about, uh, voicing all of that.

695
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.810
And this should sound familiar, because this has to

696
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.909
do with the ASH study, right? The idea that

697
00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:00.489
conformity is really important, especially when you're in a

698
00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:03.129
group. And what's scary is that Ash found that

699
00:38:03.129 --> 00:38:07.209
people are nervous about disagreeing with a group over

700
00:38:07.209 --> 00:38:12.879
line lengths. Like, what is, I mean, a species

701
00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:17.159
that's concerned about disagreeing and going against 6 other

702
00:38:17.159 --> 00:38:21.530
people, or however many other people. To disagree about

703
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.590
the perceptual facts of line lengths tells me, yeah,

704
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.610
there's probably little hope about going against other sorts

705
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.570
of norms that have a lot more, you know,

706
00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:36.290
at stake here. So, uh, but certainly knowing about

707
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.770
this process. Might, might help. And certainly knowing that

708
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.139
having one other person in the room helps uh

709
00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:46.530
embolden people to, to kind of go against uh

710
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.399
groups, so that kind of sense of increasing leverage

711
00:38:49.399 --> 00:38:52.409
as you start to enter into these group dynamics.

712
00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:56.260
But in any case, How does condemnation start to

713
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.820
get into law? Sometimes it does and sometimes it

714
00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.110
doesn't. It's a matter of kind of how much

715
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.530
of a fervor is whipped up to, you know,

716
00:39:03.699 --> 00:39:08.810
to get people all excited about passing a law.

717
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.250
And so, I think that there are multiple reasons

718
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.560
why the laws we have exist. One of, I

719
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.949
mean, I like to think about very extreme cases.

720
00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:23.199
And so, one of the extreme cases that you

721
00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:26.679
could think about is, if, I mean, right now,

722
00:39:26.879 --> 00:39:30.840
so killing people, eating them, these aren't things that,

723
00:39:30.919 --> 00:39:33.120
you know, these are, they're good laws against this.

724
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.040
And so I like these laws very much. But

725
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.479
I'm not a psychopath, right? If I were a

726
00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:42.830
psychopath and I was a cannibal, or so forth,

727
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.639
I would see these as an infringement on my

728
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:47.949
desires, the things that I would like to do

729
00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:51.810
with my life. And so, you could imagine a

730
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.379
bunch of psychopaths in, in, uh, in control, right?

731
00:39:55.479 --> 00:39:58.560
A bunch of psychopaths making the laws. And what

732
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.879
kind of laws then would you would expect, right?

733
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.600
And so, would you expect the same group of

734
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.879
laws, or would it be OK to go after

735
00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:08.840
someone? Would it be OK to, you know, to

736
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.949
form a coalition and intentionally, you know, deceive, lie,

737
00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:14.199
and gas light, all this different, right? I mean,

738
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.689
what would be What would be the laws if,

739
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:22.449
uh, psycho psychopathy were the majority? But pick any

740
00:40:22.449 --> 00:40:28.159
other type of behavior, right? So if OCD was

741
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:31.120
the norm, right? And so suddenly now, you know,

742
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.560
gloves, everyone would have to wear gloves in society,

743
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.649
right? I mean, you could imagine such things. And

744
00:40:38.649 --> 00:40:44.030
so, How do things get from, you know, preferences

745
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.159
to third party regulation to laws? And I think

746
00:40:48.159 --> 00:40:50.669
there's quite a road and things have to travel.

747
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.919
But I do believe one of those roads to

748
00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:59.080
that endpoint is discussed how we value things, and

749
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.800
the extent to which you can get other people

750
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.864
to agree, right? So, um, getting other people. On

751
00:41:04.864 --> 00:41:08.465
board with certain projects is going to be critical

752
00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.064
as to whether or not you can get other

753
00:41:10.064 --> 00:41:14.175
people to actually start enacting laws and uh have

754
00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:18.945
the, you know, more systematic punishment and condemnation using

755
00:41:18.945 --> 00:41:20.955
all of the power of the state. So it's,

756
00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:23.495
it, I think it, things do happen that way.

757
00:41:23.584 --> 00:41:25.465
It is, it is more rare and it tends

758
00:41:25.465 --> 00:41:27.425
to be the things that on which we, the

759
00:41:27.425 --> 00:41:28.625
majority agrees.

760
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.090
Mhm. So just to illustrate, uh, some of what

761
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.070
we've been talking about and and also keeping in

762
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:42.070
mind all of these intermediary steps from an emotion

763
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:46.550
like these guests to laws. Uh, COULD you give

764
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.550
us perhaps a couple of examples, one or two

765
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:54.510
examples of how these guest manifests in terms of

766
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.899
law?

767
00:41:56.139 --> 00:41:57.540
I, yeah, I gave you one. I mean, the

768
00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.260
laws against homosexuality were are one of them, right,

769
00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.639
very clearly, um, and so, uh, you have, you

770
00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:07.620
know, so some of the food laws that you

771
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.649
find overseas might reflect some of the religious. Rules

772
00:42:11.649 --> 00:42:15.530
about what's considered disgusting, uh, and, and for different

773
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.189
reasons that prevent not only the person, you know,

774
00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:21.679
but whoever's in that society from consuming, uh, those

775
00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:25.040
particular foods. So I think, uh, when it comes

776
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:35.750
to disgust, the The Many of the things Items

777
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:40.030
that are prohibited. In law that relate to disgust

778
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.879
will tend to be the food contact and sex.

779
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.750
So that's, that's what I would suggest is, you

780
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.229
know, anywhere you see, you know, things about consumption,

781
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.110
things about, not all things, but disgust will be

782
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.989
among, uh, the good candidates for why those ended

783
00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:59.669
up there about consumption, contact, and sex. Uh, AND

784
00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:01.340
so those are the ones that are kind of

785
00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:05.689
Originating potentially from a discussed psychology. And then the

786
00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:09.090
question is, you know, what is the role of

787
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.290
disgust in law? Ought it be present? Should we

788
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.330
be evaluating some of our laws as to why

789
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.810
it is we forbid certain acts if it has

790
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:21.250
to do with consumption, contact, and sex? And so

791
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.149
that's, those are additional questions. Some people, um, so

792
00:43:25.149 --> 00:43:27.209
Leon Cass was one who said that, you know,

793
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.129
disgust is a good compass as to what should

794
00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:32.979
be, you know, prohibited. Uh, BUT other folks, you

795
00:43:32.979 --> 00:43:36.179
know, Martha Nussbaum included, was very wary about, you

796
00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:39.010
know, having discussed pres present in the law, and

797
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.260
I, um, I too am concerned about having discussed

798
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.629
present in the law only because if, if they

799
00:43:46.629 --> 00:43:49.600
if. If any of what I've just talked about

800
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.070
has a hint of truth to it and ends

801
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.429
up being correct as to what disgust is, how

802
00:43:54.429 --> 00:43:56.899
it informs our social value, and how that might

803
00:43:56.899 --> 00:44:00.070
influence, uh, our group dynamics and what we want

804
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.699
to go after and how that's codified in law,

805
00:44:03.149 --> 00:44:06.229
then we might want to rethink it. Um, AND

806
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:09.350
so, I mean, it's, these are some really good

807
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.810
questions that you can ask your philosophers that you

808
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.110
have.

809
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:16.189
Yeah, I was going to say that, that perhaps

810
00:44:16.189 --> 00:44:19.429
this kind of discussion as to, to what extent

811
00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:23.189
perhaps we should extract the things that our laws

812
00:44:23.189 --> 00:44:26.760
that derived from these guests at their bases from,

813
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.350
uh, the code from the legal code, uh, to

814
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.389
what extent we should remove them from their, I

815
00:44:33.389 --> 00:44:35.669
mean, that, that's some. I think that perhaps it's

816
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:40.030
better to discuss with maybe legal or moral philosophers

817
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.189
and legal scholars. But, I mean, perhaps there's another

818
00:44:43.189 --> 00:44:44.870
kind of question that I could ask you. Do

819
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:50.310
you think that evolutionary psychology, science, more broadly itself

820
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.399
can inform these kinds of more ethical discussions?

821
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.810
I do. I do. To the extent that ethics

822
00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.580
relates to humans and their brains and how they

823
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.379
behave, then understanding humans and how they behave and,

824
00:45:06.419 --> 00:45:09.219
and the evolved adaptations, uh, that we all come

825
00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:11.500
equipped with, uh, I think that would be important

826
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:16.620
to understanding ethics, for sure. So I I think

827
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.379
that Whereas you'll never bridge completely an is from

828
00:45:21.379 --> 00:45:24.419
an ought, right? An ought from an is. The

829
00:45:24.419 --> 00:45:27.750
idea that we might want and find that we

830
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.639
should have particular types of laws for particular reasons,

831
00:45:31.939 --> 00:45:34.340
that, that might not have anything to do with

832
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.530
our evolved psychology, right? We might actually identify what

833
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.860
is and say, it therefore is incredibly something that

834
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.820
we want to make sure isn't uh present in

835
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.739
our, in our laws and our, our moral moral

836
00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:50.909
code. But I think a first step is understanding

837
00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:52.550
who we are, right? So if you do want

838
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.629
to guide behavior, you do want to change behavior,

839
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:57.270
you do want to make people um more cooperative

840
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:00.070
and have societies that work far better together and

841
00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.030
with each other. Understanding, you know, these evolved adaptations,

842
00:46:04.189 --> 00:46:06.270
I think is critical, uh, only because it's at

843
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.520
least good to know. What you're fighting against potentially,

844
00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:10.889
and what you're fighting with. Uh, AND, you know,

845
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.729
what, what's going to be aiding you in the

846
00:46:12.729 --> 00:46:16.290
ability to, to shape human behavior, uh, in more

847
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.560
successful ways. And so, but obviously, defining success is,

848
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.939
is not unproblematic, um, but just using the word

849
00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:25.350
harmonious, I think gets me out of trouble. But

850
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:29.530
again, understanding evolved psychology, I think it's critical to

851
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.969
any enterprise that's trying to understand ethics and morality.

852
00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:37.520
Great. So let's move on to another kind of

853
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:45.290
emotion now. What is gratitude? That was tough.

854
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.719
So.

855
00:46:48.459 --> 00:46:54.189
What is gratitude and what situations elicit gratitude?

856
00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:57.909
OK. Whew. I'm glad we're not, this is good.

857
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.760
OK, so gratitude. Thank you for starting this. So,

858
00:47:02.379 --> 00:47:06.500
gratitude is an interesting emotion and for researchers of

859
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.979
emotions, they will remember that there's this set of

860
00:47:09.979 --> 00:47:12.939
universal emotions that we were all taught about and

861
00:47:12.939 --> 00:47:15.399
gratitude doesn't show up on this list, right? It's

862
00:47:15.445 --> 00:47:18.425
It's not an emotion that people typically talk about,

863
00:47:18.675 --> 00:47:20.514
uh, when it comes to what are the, you

864
00:47:20.514 --> 00:47:23.725
know, the standard, you know, the standard operating equipment

865
00:47:23.725 --> 00:47:26.745
of all, of all humans. Usually, gratitude is left

866
00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:29.794
off the list of, of universal emotions. Uh, BUT

867
00:47:29.794 --> 00:47:33.074
I think erroneously. So much like anger, gratitude should

868
00:47:33.074 --> 00:47:36.475
be up there. And, um, the question I ask

869
00:47:36.475 --> 00:47:38.435
people when I start talking about gratitude is what

870
00:47:38.435 --> 00:47:41.274
would be lost if we didn't have any gratitude?

871
00:47:41.284 --> 00:47:43.074
If you just pluck that little system right out

872
00:47:43.074 --> 00:47:46.590
of our brain. And nobody, there was no sense

873
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:49.310
of gratitude, no thank you, no anything. What would

874
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.830
be lost. And so, if you think about it,

875
00:47:51.989 --> 00:47:53.429
I mean, it, it's it would be, it would

876
00:47:53.429 --> 00:47:56.189
be a pretty big hole in our social interactions

877
00:47:56.189 --> 00:47:58.070
if there was no gratitude, you know, someone holds

878
00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.709
a door for you and no thank you, although

879
00:48:00.709 --> 00:48:03.074
this is South Florida. That happens often. Uh, BUT

880
00:48:03.074 --> 00:48:05.435
you know, someone hands you money or someone picks

881
00:48:05.435 --> 00:48:07.625
up your wallet and returns it to you, and,

882
00:48:07.715 --> 00:48:10.034
you know, the person didn't say thank you. You

883
00:48:10.034 --> 00:48:12.915
know, you're, you're fed something and or whatever, someone

884
00:48:12.915 --> 00:48:15.344
helps you and saves your life, no thank you.

885
00:48:15.594 --> 00:48:19.955
Um, AND so, what would be lost? It would

886
00:48:19.955 --> 00:48:23.260
seem that The key feature that would be lost

887
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.989
is opportunities to form a bond with that other

888
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:29.340
person, right? To be able to continue that interaction

889
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:34.530
into the future. Gratitude is an emotion that appears

890
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:37.419
to be a positive reinforcement of the benefits other

891
00:48:37.419 --> 00:48:41.370
people have on offer. So if you do something

892
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.850
nice for me, my gratitude is basically saying, hey,

893
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.570
that action that you there just did, I found

894
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.969
to be of benefit. And boy, golly, it would

895
00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:51.919
be great if you were to continue doing those,

896
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.610
those kinds of things again into the future, um.

897
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.750
With the promise that I might be willing to

898
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.300
repay that down the line. And so it, it

899
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.379
is it is a bid for a cooperative relationship,

900
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.790
one that can grow into this mutually valued kind

901
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.949
of snowball into these very deep engagements, uh, that

902
00:49:10.949 --> 00:49:12.830
John Toy and Leda Cosmides have talked about in

903
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:17.159
the evolution of, of friendships. And so, but gratitude

904
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.590
is one of the starting points for that. I

905
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.389
don't know that it is the only starting point

906
00:49:22.389 --> 00:49:24.389
for that, uh, because I can get you to

907
00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:28.919
be nice to me. Through threat of, you know,

908
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.330
injury. Like I can say, if you're not nice

909
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.169
to me, if you don't cooperate with me from

910
00:49:33.169 --> 00:49:35.969
here on out, you know, I can, I can

911
00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:37.409
act like the mafia, and I can just be

912
00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:39.399
like, I'm gonna take you out. I'm gonna, you

913
00:49:39.399 --> 00:49:42.790
know, bash your knees in. And so, I, I

914
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.270
mean, I could do these kinds of things, uh,

915
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.389
and ensure that you are going to be nice

916
00:49:48.389 --> 00:49:50.780
to me and cooperate with whomever I, I say.

917
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.080
Uh, BUT one way to do that outside of

918
00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.070
dominance, if I'm not dominant, and I have to

919
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.469
try and get other ways to get people to

920
00:49:56.469 --> 00:49:59.510
cooperate is to get you to value the qualities

921
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.780
that I have that you might find a benefit,

922
00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:03.389
and that we can kind of find some type

923
00:50:03.389 --> 00:50:06.989
of mutual, uh, engagement in, in that way. And

924
00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:09.750
so gratitude can jumpstart this. So you do something,

925
00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:13.379
you Ricardo, going about your day, or doing the

926
00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:16.689
things that you just enjoy. But some of those

927
00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:19.080
things I might find a benefit in my world.

928
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.550
So let's just say you are, you know, we're

929
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.610
neighbors and you're neat, and you like to pick

930
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.889
up the garbage from your front lawn and make

931
00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:28.290
sure that, you know, everything is tidy and there's

932
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.850
no weeds and then there's no animals feeding on

933
00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:32.649
your lawn, and it's, it's all very nice and

934
00:50:32.649 --> 00:50:35.370
tidy. I appreciate that. And so to the extent

935
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.340
that I said, Hey, thanks for doing all that.

936
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.290
I think you do a great job. I'm actually

937
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:42.239
sending a signal of, I value you for this,

938
00:50:42.649 --> 00:50:48.409
right? And so, it's You wouldn't be cheating, or,

939
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.540
uh, you wouldn't be engaging in any cheating in

940
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.540
any reciprocal altruism kind of way if you didn't

941
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.250
return the favor, or if you started growing weeds.

942
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.330
And so, you're not cheating. All, all it is

943
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.540
is my signal to you is, I value you

944
00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.929
for this. What hopefully that does in your brain

945
00:51:03.929 --> 00:51:06.629
is, huh, that values me for this kind of

946
00:51:06.629 --> 00:51:09.620
behavior. Um, OUT of the other people in my

947
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.219
world, that's kind of like an interesting indication that

948
00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:14.560
she among everyone. KIND of values me and likes

949
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.520
having me around in this local environment. It would

950
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.989
be well worth my while potentially to make sure

951
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:22.879
that she sticks around, you know, valuing me. So

952
00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:25.830
you can value me for valuing you. And so,

953
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.120
again, I don't think it registers like this. It's

954
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.719
just a sense of liking. Like, oh, she said

955
00:51:30.719 --> 00:51:33.439
something that made me feel good. Um, I like

956
00:51:33.439 --> 00:51:35.600
her. And so I want to make sure that,

957
00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:37.320
you know, oh, her mail, her paper was on

958
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.560
her front door, or her lawn. Let me bring

959
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.600
that up to her door for her. And so

960
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.149
you can have Uh, very interesting initiation of, of

961
00:51:46.149 --> 00:51:49.629
favors or exchanges that are just based on the

962
00:51:49.629 --> 00:51:51.870
idea that I value you for the unique attributes

963
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.350
and things that you do. But gratitude is one

964
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.949
way for this to all get jumpstarted. And so

965
00:51:56.949 --> 00:51:59.110
I've worked with uh a bunch of folks, so

966
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:02.870
Mike McCullough, uh, Adam Smith, Eric Peterson, Danny Forster

967
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:07.645
on gratitude. Um, AND we've identified that gratitude is

968
00:52:07.645 --> 00:52:09.925
very similar to anger in a lot of respects,

969
00:52:10.044 --> 00:52:13.125
just the opposite. Um, AND so with Joseph Billingsley,

970
00:52:13.205 --> 00:52:14.844
one of my former students, we were trying to

971
00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:18.685
determine whether or not anger, so Aaron Cell, you've

972
00:52:18.685 --> 00:52:21.945
probably talked to on this program, and so he

973
00:52:21.945 --> 00:52:24.324
has done a lot of great work, uh, with

974
00:52:24.324 --> 00:52:25.875
anger. Have you talked to him yet?

975
00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:28.840
Yeah, yes, yes, I have. Yeah.

976
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:35.050
So he, um, he's talked about the architecture of

977
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.850
anger. And it looks like anger occurs when someone

978
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.570
has not valued your welfare as high as you

979
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.250
expect them to, right? So, you do something bad

980
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.250
to me, and I thought that you should have

981
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.330
treated me better. My anger is, you know, is

982
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:53.780
a Function of how poorly you treated me compared

983
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.020
to how much I expected. And it functions to

984
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.899
basically reach into your brain and say, hey, that

985
00:52:58.899 --> 00:53:01.820
dial of value, social value, you might want to

986
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.489
increase it a little bit more for me. Otherwise,

987
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.340
there might be a cost coming your way for

988
00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.820
not doing so. And so gratitude, it seems like.

989
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:12.840
It is similar in the sense of it notices

990
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:18.340
not decrements in value. It notices increases in value.

991
00:53:18.459 --> 00:53:21.020
So if I determine that, you know, you're strangers,

992
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.820
why should you value me, but suddenly you do

993
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.699
something really nice for me, that registers as an

994
00:53:25.699 --> 00:53:28.139
increased signal of, hey, this person values me, and

995
00:53:28.139 --> 00:53:31.199
that's what triggers seems to trigger gratitude. That you

996
00:53:31.199 --> 00:53:34.949
are over, not overvaluing me, you are valuing my

997
00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:38.110
welfare more than I thought. Um, AND so this

998
00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:41.479
is something to reinforce positively rather than anger and

999
00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:45.530
reinforcing it negatively. So it looks like that's what,

1000
00:53:45.629 --> 00:53:47.250
uh, gratitude responds to.

1001
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.560
Do you think that an emotion like gratitude would

1002
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.689
connect to an evolutionary mechanism such as reciprocal altruism

1003
00:53:57.689 --> 00:53:58.379
in any way?

1004
00:54:00.469 --> 00:54:04.639
I do. I think that um I think it

1005
00:54:04.639 --> 00:54:08.989
can. When you go, so reciprocal altruism, just, you

1006
00:54:08.989 --> 00:54:12.229
know, social exchange that we tend to see in

1007
00:54:12.229 --> 00:54:15.969
a standard format. If you have a particular grocery

1008
00:54:15.969 --> 00:54:17.810
store, or, you know, you go to Starbucks and

1009
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.770
there's a particular person behind the, you know, the

1010
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.409
your barrister of, you know, choice here, you know,

1011
00:54:22.489 --> 00:54:24.689
you see them, you engage in a social exchange,

1012
00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:26.169
you know, give me my latte, I'll give you

1013
00:54:26.169 --> 00:54:28.729
my money. Um, BUT the thing is, is that

1014
00:54:28.729 --> 00:54:31.169
you can now, and, and as an exchange, it

1015
00:54:31.169 --> 00:54:32.850
might be just a one-off, and then you're done,

1016
00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:35.090
right? So it's a win-win situation, and then there

1017
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:37.620
you both go on, on your merry way. Uh,

1018
00:54:37.699 --> 00:54:40.570
BUT the thing is, I can value you for

1019
00:54:40.939 --> 00:54:42.969
the way that you make my latte, or the

1020
00:54:42.969 --> 00:54:44.899
smile, or the other kinds of things that kind

1021
00:54:44.899 --> 00:54:46.899
of come along, or you're always open, you're open

1022
00:54:46.899 --> 00:54:48.739
at the time, like, so there's additional things that

1023
00:54:48.739 --> 00:54:52.429
I can value this exchange for. And I, and

1024
00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:54.979
that's a way to, to start to cultivate value.

1025
00:54:55.310 --> 00:55:00.500
So even anonymous interactions on the web and exchange

1026
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.870
and, you know, e-commerce, I can prefer and start

1027
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:07.229
to derive value from a particular company because of

1028
00:55:07.229 --> 00:55:09.500
their Customer service because of the, the way that

1029
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.639
they are so responsive to my questions or how,

1030
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.620
how good their products are at the price and

1031
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.729
so forth. So outside of an exchange, which is

1032
00:55:18.729 --> 00:55:21.260
really just a, you know, tit for tat kind

1033
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.310
of exchange in the moment. If I, I can

1034
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:26.689
start to value the person who is the source

1035
00:55:26.689 --> 00:55:30.340
of that supply, um, and want to keep them

1036
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.300
around, and I think that's where you start to

1037
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.300
get into, uh, you know, it's the gratitude, right?

1038
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.379
Because think about it. If, if I, if you

1039
00:55:37.379 --> 00:55:40.090
cheat me, that's anger, right? Or if you, if,

1040
00:55:40.139 --> 00:55:42.540
if my latte is cold or the cup is

1041
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.100
like has a hole in it, the lids leak.

1042
00:55:45.905 --> 00:55:47.625
You know, name any type of thing that tends

1043
00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:50.155
to happen, like, that gets you angry, right? Versus,

1044
00:55:50.304 --> 00:55:52.665
you know, the absence of all those things, even

1045
00:55:52.665 --> 00:55:54.745
just the absence of all those things these days

1046
00:55:54.745 --> 00:55:57.665
can cause gratitude. Like, oh, thank God this place

1047
00:55:57.665 --> 00:55:59.294
knows how to put a lid on a cup.

1048
00:55:59.544 --> 00:56:03.225
And so you can value anyone for anything. And

1049
00:56:03.225 --> 00:56:08.050
so gratitude absolutely can reinforce these social exchanges. I

1050
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.330
think that we have a psychology, so Leda Cosmides

1051
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.889
has done a lot, obviously, in, in social exchange

1052
00:56:12.889 --> 00:56:15.570
and showing that we're very sensitive to cheater, cheater

1053
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.090
detection, and so forth. And I think that, you

1054
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:20.449
know, within, um, you know, just that type of

1055
00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:24.360
interaction doesn't require any gratitude, right? Oh, I mean,

1056
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.570
I don't think it requires any gratitude, but now

1057
00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:28.050
you're going to make me think about that, because

1058
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.570
the idea is that to the extent that you

1059
00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.889
and I come, you know, face to face, ready

1060
00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:35.469
to exchange something. The idea that you are not

1061
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:37.860
hitting me on the head or shooting me dead

1062
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.370
to take whatever it is I have on offer.

1063
00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:43.239
I kind of like you now, right? So the

1064
00:56:43.239 --> 00:56:46.139
idea is, you're willing to even engage in exchange.

1065
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.840
So whether, so whether or not that rises to

1066
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.300
the, the visceral, you know, the quality of like

1067
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.550
gratitude and my, my feeling of strong indebtedness, I

1068
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.110
don't think it should necessarily. But no doubt, it,

1069
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.800
it certainly marks you as someone of higher social

1070
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.909
value, didn't kill me. Like, don't, don't ever underestimate

1071
00:57:05.909 --> 00:57:07.719
the fact that we're tracking the things that don't

1072
00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:10.770
happen. And as much as the, as we're tracking

1073
00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:13.770
the things that do happen. But a social exchange

1074
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:19.050
requires people to have restraint, right? And so, to

1075
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.320
the extent that that is the case, there's already

1076
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.929
a maybe a gratitude kind of implicit or a

1077
00:57:24.929 --> 00:57:27.969
value there, uh, because you're already showing me that

1078
00:57:27.969 --> 00:57:31.739
you value me greater than a mortal enemy. So

1079
00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:33.110
I, I don't know, you, you raised a good

1080
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.389
question. I'll think about it. Uh, BUT I do

1081
00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:39.219
obviously think that gratitude is tied to social exchange,

1082
00:57:39.469 --> 00:57:43.189
either initially, uh, like I just mentioned, or certainly

1083
00:57:43.189 --> 00:57:45.459
as it can snowball, uh, later on.

1084
00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:51.570
And what is interpersonal valuation and how does it

1085
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:53.370
tie to gratitude?

1086
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.770
Well, I, I, so that's the social value that

1087
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.850
I talk about, right? So you know, how do

1088
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.439
you, um, sorry, I use multiple terms, so inter

1089
00:58:03.449 --> 00:58:08.090
interpersonal valuation, um, that's journal speak, um, so I

1090
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:12.610
would say that, you know, When I assess how

1091
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.939
much you socially value me. So when we meet,

1092
00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:18.260
if I didn't, if I didn't know you and

1093
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.540
we just met on the street, I might have

1094
00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.850
a baseline expectation of how you should treat me.

1095
00:58:23.939 --> 00:58:27.070
I might have a baseline expectation of how everybody

1096
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.540
should be treating me, right? And so, as you

1097
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.860
know, I'm sure you know people, some people walk

1098
00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.179
in the room and they feel like everyone should

1099
00:58:34.179 --> 00:58:37.600
be treating me well. And if you fall below

1100
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.090
that mark, you're not gonna get gratitude. You're gonna

1101
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.439
get some kind of anger, whether it's kind of

1102
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:45.479
a, an overt aggression or a passive aggression. But

1103
00:58:45.479 --> 00:58:47.679
then there are some people who have very low

1104
00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:49.800
self-esteem and feel like they shouldn't be treated well

1105
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.439
at all. So anyone who's nice to them, you

1106
00:58:52.439 --> 00:58:54.639
know, and so forth. So we're all different in

1107
00:58:54.639 --> 00:58:57.000
our settings, and we're also all different in the

1108
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.419
types of relationships that we have. So, I would

1109
00:59:00.419 --> 00:59:03.939
say social valuation or interpersonal valuation is associated with

1110
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:07.899
gratitude in the sense that If I have a

1111
00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:11.409
prior value for how I expect you to treat

1112
00:59:11.409 --> 00:59:15.830
me. Then any action that you engage in towards

1113
00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.270
me, and any, believe it or not, any lack

1114
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:22.830
of action. So, you're either working for me full

1115
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:26.750
time or not. And so, I mean, right now,

1116
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:32.479
Ricardo, you could be. Ordering my groceries, right? You

1117
00:59:32.479 --> 00:59:34.340
could be, uh, you know, you could be doing

1118
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.239
all sorts of things for me. You're not doing

1119
00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:41.100
them. And the idea is, I know that, right?

1120
00:59:41.149 --> 00:59:43.320
But the thing is everyone's not doing that for

1121
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.149
me, so it doesn't really register. But if I

1122
00:59:45.149 --> 00:59:47.310
expected you to be going above and beyond, that

1123
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:49.110
might make me very angry that you're not kind

1124
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.709
of doing all the tasks that I have to

1125
00:59:50.709 --> 00:59:54.080
do today for me right now, as I expect.

1126
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.229
And so, the point is, is that I think

1127
00:59:57.229 --> 00:59:59.429
we, we all have a very different level of

1128
00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:03.719
expectation of other people. But we take Actions that

1129
01:00:03.719 --> 01:00:06.439
people engage in, but the lack of actions as

1130
01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:10.800
well sometimes, to indicate how another person is evaluating

1131
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.510
us and treating us, regarding us in the moment.

1132
01:00:13.719 --> 01:00:15.679
And if it comes in as higher than we

1133
01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:20.439
expect, then that activates and prompts typically gratitude to

1134
01:00:20.439 --> 01:00:22.800
the extent that this is someone you value and

1135
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.959
wish to kind of continue on in this cooperative

1136
01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:28.449
relationship with. Um, AND if it comes in lower,

1137
01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.739
this could activate anger in the sense of trying

1138
01:00:30.739 --> 01:00:32.379
to get the person to value you a little

1139
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.379
bit more. So gratitude very much, uh, is regulated

1140
01:00:36.379 --> 01:00:42.080
by incoming information about how people value you. Mhm.

1141
01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:48.389
So, perhaps, I would like to change topics now

1142
01:00:48.389 --> 01:00:50.909
again. I think that we've already talked about the

1143
01:00:50.909 --> 01:00:55.070
main things associated with gratitude. So we've also done

1144
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.469
work on tears. Uh, FIRST of all, how do

1145
01:00:58.469 --> 01:01:03.110
you approach such a topic tears from an evolutionary

1146
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:03.830
perspective?

1147
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:10.659
Well, As, uh, in my role as editor in

1148
01:01:10.659 --> 01:01:13.379
chief of evolution and human behavior, I got a

1149
01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:18.879
paper on tears from Amir uh Grassman, and he

1150
01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:22.899
had a great paper talked about. How tears uh

1151
01:01:22.899 --> 01:01:26.580
affect perception of different emotions in different contexts. And

1152
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.620
I was reading through this paper, and it dawned

1153
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.879
on me that there really wasn't a satisfying evolutionary

1154
01:01:33.879 --> 01:01:37.439
explanation of tears. Tears seemed to do something socially.

1155
01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.439
And a lot of evolutionary psychologists, um, who you've

1156
01:01:41.439 --> 01:01:43.780
interviewed on your program have talked a lot about

1157
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.979
this welfare trade-off ratio, the idea that, you know,

1158
01:01:45.989 --> 01:01:49.610
and what I'm calling social value or interpersonal valuation.

1159
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.780
And it seems to me that tears must be

1160
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.010
part of the story about social value as to

1161
01:01:57.419 --> 01:02:01.419
how we regulate our social value of others and

1162
01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:04.699
how we use tears to regulate others' social value

1163
01:02:04.699 --> 01:02:07.419
of us, um, and how they, they value us.

1164
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.719
And so together, Amir, Dan, uh, Sneezer and I

1165
01:02:11.719 --> 01:02:15.570
started to think about what are these tears, um,

1166
01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:18.979
what is going on here? And it looks like

1167
01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:24.699
tears are one way, one communicative method of, of

1168
01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:29.340
establishing and signaling value. Value of any sort of

1169
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.010
action or a piece of matter or a person,

1170
01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.610
what have you. And so, Tears allow us to

1171
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:42.010
communicate positive value and negative value. They are similar

1172
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:44.699
to shouting or screaming, or just raising the voice

1173
01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:47.330
in in any, any other type of, of way.

1174
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:53.020
It's a mechanism that illustrates amplitude. So, I can

1175
01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.780
indicate to you the value I place on a

1176
01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.820
particular act that you are. Um, THAT you are

1177
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.239
engaged in that is targeting me, I can use

1178
01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:06.639
my tears to illustrate to you how much I

1179
01:03:06.639 --> 01:03:10.959
value that particular act. Again, positively or negatively, right?

1180
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.320
So if it's an incredible act of kindness, right?

1181
01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:16.639
And so you've just given me, you know, your,

1182
01:03:16.689 --> 01:03:19.719
your, your fortune, right? So that, that might kind

1183
01:03:19.719 --> 01:03:23.080
of elicit tears, um, or you've, uh, you've, you

1184
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.719
know, stayed my execution, you've prevented, you know, you're

1185
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.570
no longer going to, you know, You're no longer

1186
01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:31.370
gonna hang me. Like, I, I might also show,

1187
01:03:31.409 --> 01:03:33.969
you know, cry tears of joy, or, you know,

1188
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.479
intense love or intense pride. These kinds of things,

1189
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.090
tears can signal the intensity of the value of

1190
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.000
a particular act. Uh, POSITIVE, and then, of course,

1191
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.149
negatively. And It is a strategy that all can

1192
01:03:50.149 --> 01:03:53.969
use. Uh, SOME people use it intentionally and explicitly,

1193
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.620
um, so with crocodile tears and being able to

1194
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.989
manipulate people, but for the most part, most people

1195
01:03:58.989 --> 01:04:03.129
don't use them in those ways, um, and, uh,

1196
01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:08.060
use them to communicate. To communicate value of some

1197
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.699
sort. And so, this is the kind of research

1198
01:04:10.699 --> 01:04:12.979
that I've been engaged in with, with Daniel and

1199
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:15.540
Amir, and we have indeed found that tears are

1200
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.070
associated with the intensity of the benefit conferred or

1201
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.459
or cost imposed, uh, by a particular person. So

1202
01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:25.699
that's additional, uh, new work. But tears are a

1203
01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:29.459
very interesting communicative device. I mean, obviously there's tears

1204
01:04:29.459 --> 01:04:32.409
that protect the eye that lubricate the The eye

1205
01:04:32.409 --> 01:04:35.290
to make sure that uh the optics all work

1206
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:37.969
well, but it's also, you know, evolved the secondary

1207
01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:41.969
function of being used to communicate the intensity of

1208
01:04:41.969 --> 01:04:45.219
value perceived. Mhm.

1209
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.629
Uh, SO, and those are their functions, the functions

1210
01:04:49.629 --> 01:04:52.379
of emotional tears, correct?

1211
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.370
That's what we're proposing. So I think far more

1212
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.110
research is required, but, you know, that's the, the

1213
01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:03.010
path where we're plotting down. Um, AND so the

1214
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.810
question would then be, you know, can we test

1215
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:08.399
it? Who cries? Because tears would seem to be,

1216
01:05:08.479 --> 01:05:13.110
uh, Tears would seem to be a strategy that

1217
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:17.669
could be used by people with lower leverage, right?

1218
01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:21.070
So the idea that you have, who tends to

1219
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.590
cry in situations. Well, in interactions and in conflict

1220
01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:27.510
between men and women, women tend to cry. Between

1221
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:30.189
adults and children, children tend to cry, not all

1222
01:05:30.189 --> 01:05:32.989
the time, but just the tendency. And the question

1223
01:05:32.989 --> 01:05:36.189
is, why isn't it the opposite? Right? So what's

1224
01:05:36.189 --> 01:05:38.350
going on here? And it seems to suggest that

1225
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.040
for Ability and leverage are part of the equation

1226
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.760
is to determine, uh, who, who uses tiers and

1227
01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.949
when they use tiers, uh, as a communicative signal

1228
01:05:47.949 --> 01:05:52.360
and ability to manipulate other people into either continuing

1229
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.600
the benefits that they're delivering or halting the costs

1230
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.959
that they're imposing.

1231
01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:00.760
And uh I mean, and this I think will

1232
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.360
be my last question. So how do tears connect

1233
01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.850
to emotional expression and do they connect or tie

1234
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:12.479
to specific emotions?

1235
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:17.040
So, uh, so I haven't been the one to

1236
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.479
do this research, as Mirra, one of our co-authors

1237
01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:23.439
on this paper has. And, uh, my understanding is

1238
01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:26.360
that tears help kind of identify and accentuate the

1239
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.040
emotion that's being perceived. But I would say tears

1240
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.899
only really arise in these social emotions. And so,

1241
01:06:35.219 --> 01:06:36.780
one of the examples that I've used to kind

1242
01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.340
of find the boundaries, so one of the things

1243
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.780
I like to do is think about boundary conditions

1244
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.899
when something holds, but more importantly, when it doesn't

1245
01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.699
hold. And so the hypothesis that tears are this

1246
01:06:45.699 --> 01:06:52.379
communicative, uh, uh, device that can relay value to

1247
01:06:52.379 --> 01:06:55.939
another agent, then you shouldn't see tears where there

1248
01:06:55.939 --> 01:06:59.860
are no agents. Um, AND so, you know, I

1249
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.780
have a hamburger in front of me, and, you

1250
01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.899
know, I see. A bug on it, or I

1251
01:07:05.899 --> 01:07:07.830
see maggots crawl out of it or something really

1252
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:12.250
gross, like, I'm not gonna cry. Like, I will,

1253
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.969
I mean, I will cry to the extent that

1254
01:07:14.969 --> 01:07:18.090
there's another person around who I can communicate the

1255
01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:23.530
value of this burger to. Um, BUT I am

1256
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.810
not crying for the purpose of communicating to the

1257
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:29.929
burger. Like, you're not treating me well. Like, it's

1258
01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:33.489
not, so it's not a pathogen disgust kind of

1259
01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:36.370
emotion. But I would say it is a sexual,

1260
01:07:36.399 --> 01:07:38.860
like, it can actually apply to other realms of

1261
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.399
disgust that bring in other agents, other people who

1262
01:07:42.399 --> 01:07:46.260
could improve your life, um, for sure. And so,

1263
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.060
that's, so that's what I, I, I would, would

1264
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.219
suggest is that tears are very much a social

1265
01:07:51.219 --> 01:07:58.530
emotion. They aren't necessarily activated. In response to non-agents.

1266
01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.100
Now, if someone is crying in response to a

1267
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.409
non-agent, I, my hypothesis would be they're thinking about

1268
01:08:04.409 --> 01:08:06.929
someone, right? There's someone in their mind that they're

1269
01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:09.570
crying to, uh, and so forth, but it's not

1270
01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:11.929
the actual stimulus of, of, um, uh, of a

1271
01:08:11.929 --> 01:08:14.469
physical, like a tree branch isn't gonna make me

1272
01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:17.685
cry, right? And so pain might make me cry,

1273
01:08:17.895 --> 01:08:20.015
uh, in order to signal, but usually I won't

1274
01:08:20.015 --> 01:08:22.325
cry until there are other people around to actually,

1275
01:08:22.415 --> 01:08:26.174
you know, hear that signal. Um, SO, uh, in

1276
01:08:26.174 --> 01:08:28.654
any case, I think tears are very much tied

1277
01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:32.375
to our social, um, our social psychology and how

1278
01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:34.915
we get along with other people and how we,

1279
01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:37.975
how we manage the cooperative relationships that we have.

1280
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.750
Uh, BUT I'm in tears, they do not always

1281
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:46.950
serve a social signaling function, right? Because sometimes we

1282
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:51.350
just cry alone and, and sometimes we even want

1283
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:55.859
to avoid that other people see us crying,

1284
01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:59.370
right? Yes. So I think that is, those are

1285
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:03.299
also really interesting features of the entire system. Like,

1286
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.620
because crying would suggest that I'm low leveraged, right?

1287
01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.379
So that I, I like my tears, and so

1288
01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:13.979
it's like, don't see me cry, right? So, because

1289
01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:15.620
I don't want to put out that I'm someone

1290
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.180
who's easily, you know, overpowered or, you know, less

1291
01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.770
formidable potentially. That would be a really bad signal

1292
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.430
to put out there, uh, unnecessarily. Um, AND so,

1293
01:09:26.048 --> 01:09:28.389
I, I do find that very interesting. But your

1294
01:09:28.389 --> 01:09:32.238
question of, you know, tears are for signaling, so

1295
01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:34.788
people can cry alone. But I also think that

1296
01:09:34.788 --> 01:09:38.457
our ability to simulate events and simulate, you know,

1297
01:09:38.828 --> 01:09:41.068
bring up memories of people. I mean, that's one

1298
01:09:41.068 --> 01:09:44.707
reason. So, listen, as an evolved adaptation, there's going

1299
01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:47.028
to be the functional response of it in the

1300
01:09:47.028 --> 01:09:49.332
situation. For which it evolved. And then there's going

1301
01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:52.683
to be all of these other reasons why, um,

1302
01:09:53.053 --> 01:09:55.723
why you might find tearing a curve, right? So,

1303
01:09:55.933 --> 01:09:57.373
I mean, you find this with all sorts of

1304
01:09:57.373 --> 01:09:59.953
adaptations, like we evolved to be upright, you know,

1305
01:10:00.132 --> 01:10:03.373
and walk bipedally and have balance. And so that

1306
01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:05.612
explains a lot of our walking, but it doesn't

1307
01:10:05.612 --> 01:10:08.542
necessarily, it explains why we can skateboard and surf

1308
01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:10.755
and do all. Sorts of other interesting things, but

1309
01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:12.636
we didn't evolve to do those sorts of things,

1310
01:10:12.715 --> 01:10:14.315
but now are part of the repertoire of things

1311
01:10:14.315 --> 01:10:17.186
we can do given this adaptation. So I think

1312
01:10:17.186 --> 01:10:21.076
that identifying the things for which this adaptation evolved

1313
01:10:21.076 --> 01:10:24.155
is, is important and obviously part of the science

1314
01:10:24.155 --> 01:10:27.065
and part of the the research that's required, uh,

1315
01:10:27.085 --> 01:10:28.996
and then identifying the things that it can do

1316
01:10:28.996 --> 01:10:30.395
by virtue of the fact that it's here.

1317
01:10:32.359 --> 01:10:35.669
Right, so, I mean, is there anything else about

1318
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:39.279
gratitude or tears that I might have missed that

1319
01:10:39.279 --> 01:10:41.629
you would like to have just before we go,

1320
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.189
or?

1321
01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.910
Um, That's a good question. I'm sure there is,

1322
01:10:48.029 --> 01:10:49.990
but right now, I think I'm just gonna say

1323
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:52.189
that, uh, you know, a lot of these emotions

1324
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:54.350
that I've been dealing with really do have a

1325
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.910
lot to do with the rest of the research

1326
01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.029
that's coming out of evolutionary psychology on, on social

1327
01:11:00.029 --> 01:11:03.950
value. And I think it's important to understand for

1328
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.830
all people interested in, you know, who we are

1329
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.160
as a species and, and how the mind works,

1330
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:12.229
um, so that we can, like I said, hopefully,

1331
01:11:12.959 --> 01:11:16.680
Hopefully enjoy far greater cooperative relationships and, you know,

1332
01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:19.399
quality of life. So, yeah, I think I'll just

1333
01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:20.350
in there.

1334
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.910
Yeah, let's send on that note. So just before

1335
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.339
we go, would you like to tell people where

1336
01:11:26.339 --> 01:11:29.020
they can find you and your work on the

1337
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.319
internet?

1338
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:34.299
Um, RIGHT now, the University of Miami website is

1339
01:11:34.299 --> 01:11:36.259
the best place to, the best place to find

1340
01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:39.180
me, um, and also it's a good email to

1341
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:43.729
reach me at my miami.edu address. Uh, BUT other,

1342
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:46.470
other than that, no, just, uh, publications, Google.

1343
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.240
OK, great. So, Doctor Lieberman, thank you so much

1344
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.870
for taking the time to come on the show.

1345
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.049
It's been fun and it's been a very fun

1346
01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:57.529
and informative conversation.

1347
01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.569
So, Thanks, Ricardo.

1348
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:03.160
Hi guys, thank you for watching this interview until

1349
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.339
