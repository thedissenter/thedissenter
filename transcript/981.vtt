00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.839
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.619
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.140
I'm joined by Doctor Mi Bac Coen. He's Professor

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.409
Emeritus of Comparative Literature in France, at the UN

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.510
in French, at the University of Washington in Seattle.

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.149
And today we're focusing on his book, Freud's Thinking

7
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.629
and introduction. So, Doctor Bia Capson, welcome to the

8
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:25.069
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.149
It's a pleasure for me too.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.809
So tell us first. Um WHAT is the premise

11
00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.279
of this book actually? Because I know that you've

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.880
written more uh uh other books on Freud uh

13
00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:42.000
his work, uh he as a person, what were

14
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.319
you trying to achieve with this one?

15
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.599
Well, this book is a little different from the

16
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.619
other ones that I wrote on Freud because it

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.560
was actually a commission from a French uh publisher

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.939
uh edit Ellipse. Uh And uh they have a,

19
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.250
it's, it's a, it's a publisher that is specialized

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.730
in uh academic textbooks. And so they have a,

21
00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:20.069
a series with that is uh intended for uh

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.669
students in philosophy. Uh AND they have a series

23
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.239
of monographs on philosophers, Plato Aristotle, Kant Nietzsche. And

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.459
so forth and they wanted me to write a

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.589
book on uh a little book, a textbook on,

26
00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.949
on Freud because as you may know, in France,

27
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.199
uh Freud is taught as a philosopher. Uh And

28
00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.000
so usually I would not, you know, uh I

29
00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.449
would not accept such an invitation for that after

30
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.589
having thought little about it, I thought it was

31
00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.239
an interesting project. Would I be able to write

32
00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:03.989
a user friendly uh textbook on Freud? Uh TAKING

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.879
into account everything that has been written on him,

34
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.630
uh taking into account the, the critical studies Freud

35
00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.160
studies from the, you know, the late this the

36
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.389
last 40 years. And so, uh it was a

37
00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.970
challenge in a way. Uh And finally I accepted

38
00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.800
it and that, that was a project. And so

39
00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.460
the question of course, with which I start, the

40
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.949
book was Freud, a philosopher stems from the fact

41
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.250
that it was, you know, intended, this book is

42
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.960
intended for students in philosophy or students in philosophy

43
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.240
in France and then it was translated into English.

44
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.800
So it's um you know, and, and that accounts

45
00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.649
for the fact that the book is structured like

46
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.919
a textbook, you know, you have all the, the

47
00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:59.839
main concepts and I try to explain this concept

48
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.520
as better as best as I can without putting

49
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:10.149
forward my own ideas, my own pet ideas about

50
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.539
Freud and psych analysis. Mhm

51
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.589
No, I, I mean, if you, if you will

52
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.970
allow me to be a little bit provocative here.

53
00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.750
It's very interesting that you mentioned that in France

54
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.179
they teach him as a philosopher because here in

55
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.839
Portugal we have anthro some anthropology degrees where they

56
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.410
also teach. Right. So, it's very interesting because either

57
00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.050
he was a poly or people can interpret his

58
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.970
work whatever way they want. So I'm not

59
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:47.750
sure. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I agree. And, and

60
00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.259
of course, if you, you know, I used to

61
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.589
teach in, in the US and uh and then,

62
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.750
you know, Freud is not taught at all any

63
00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.669
longer in psychiatry or in psychology. Uh BUT in

64
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.279
literary uh departments. Yes.

65
00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.320
Yeah. So we might come back to this question

66
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.630
about exactly what kind of intellectual Freud was uh

67
00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.529
toward the end of our conversation. But let's go

68
00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.928
here through some of the, some of his main

69
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.989
ideas slash theory. So, of course, one of the

70
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.350
biggest ones and probably the one is uh most

71
00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:31.250
well known for is the unconscious. But what were

72
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.790
Freud's ideas about the unconscious? What was the unconscious

73
00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:35.989
for

74
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.589
him? It is a big question. It's a uh

75
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:48.410
anyway, uh uh people usually think that Freud discovered

76
00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:55.500
the countries. Um NOW that's incorrect. He didn't discover

77
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.190
the unconscious. He may be, he constructed something that

78
00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.929
I would call the Freudian unconscious, which is a

79
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.709
very specific way of uh uh understanding uh the

80
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.329
unconscious. But the the idea of the unconscious stems

81
00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:19.730
from uh from other sources, notably, uh in the

82
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:25.109
19th century or all kinds of speculations and theories

83
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:30.250
about what was called the cerebral unconscious. And that

84
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.540
was uh a very important uh concept uh in

85
00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:41.559
uh 19th century neurophysiology stems from the discovery of

86
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.709
the reflex arc, uh you know, the the reflex

87
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.559
function of the spinal cord and uh which of

88
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.250
course is an unconscious uh uh automatic uh uh

89
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:06.029
function. And some people uh extended that uh idea

90
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.230
to uh not to the final uh court, but

91
00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:15.459
to uh other psychic, psychical functions. And so you

92
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.820
had this idea that is shared by all kinds

93
00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:24.220
of people. Shao Mosle Bernheim, et cetera. You have

94
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.420
the idea that the, the, the main psychic activity

95
00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:35.850
is a reflex, automatic uh activity, which they called

96
00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:42.100
the, the psychological automatism and consciousness or the ego

97
00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:45.260
as it was called at the time, uh It

98
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:54.959
emerges from these unconscious reflex uh uh psychical uh

99
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:03.200
acts uh by inhibiting it uh inhibiting them. Uh

100
00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:08.869
So, the, the, the there was a whole paradigm

101
00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.769
uh which I would call the reflex paradigm uh

102
00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:19.570
that uh is based on the contrast between reflex

103
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.929
and inhibition, consciousness is based on an inhibition of

104
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.880
the automatic reflex activity of the mind. And so,

105
00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:37.649
um the, the, so this is the concept of

106
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.660
the unconscious at the time when Freud goes to

107
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.859
uh Paris and studies with uh Shaco, who was

108
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:49.260
one of the main advocates of this whole uh

109
00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:57.720
reflex uh paradigm. Uh AND it's quite clear that

110
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.269
at the beginning of his career until I would

111
00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:05.690
say 1892 and 83 This is the concept of

112
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.600
the unconscious that Freud deals with. And then at

113
00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:15.250
one point, uh we can talk about it later.

114
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.480
He, he, he, he, he shifts to this idea

115
00:08:19.489 --> 00:08:28.309
that the unconscious, it is not just inhibited normally

116
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.229
by the country's ego. It is actually created by

117
00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:39.989
what it calls a repression. Uh We passionate at,

118
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.690
at first is just another name for inhibition. Uh

119
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.119
But that is when Freud really comes into his

120
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.090
own and comes up with this idea that the

121
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:58.059
unconscious is a repressed, incon uh we have ideas,

122
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.960
fantasies, uh etcetera that are repressed by the country's

123
00:09:03.969 --> 00:09:08.494
ego by consciousness, something that is called the unconscious.

124
00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:13.164
So basically, that's, that's the beginning of Freud's idea

125
00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:15.554
of the unconscious. And then you have to add

126
00:09:15.565 --> 00:09:20.885
to that that because uh the unconscious is repressed

127
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:28.525
according to Freud, uh you have to um to

128
00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:36.530
decipher uh symptoms, lapses of the tongue, uh Freud

129
00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:40.059
and slips, et cetera in order to get access

130
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.950
to what is repressed. So, uh the Freudian country

131
00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:48.840
is not only a repressed unconscious, uh It is

132
00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:53.640
also uh an unconscious that can only be known,

133
00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:56.840
made conscious through interpretation.

134
00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:03.020
Mhm And, and so since you're already mentioning repression

135
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.900
and how it is associated, at least in Freud's

136
00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:11.150
theorizing with these ideas about the unconscious. Um Is

137
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:14.929
it that the other defense mechanisms that he proposed

138
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.859
are also associated with how the unconscious works

139
00:10:21.229 --> 00:10:25.090
well. Yeah, I mean, all the other defense mechanisms

140
00:10:25.619 --> 00:10:30.140
that he lives are basically forms of repression that

141
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.289
are different techniques are used by the L to

142
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:41.320
repress according to him, uh uh some ideas uh

143
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.409
but they, they basically all come down to uh

144
00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:52.440
making sure that the unconscious doesn't become conscious. And

145
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.929
he, he, he has several statements to that effect

146
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.590
is that, that's, that's basically what all these defense

147
00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:03.849
mechanisms are about. And he, he also calls uh

148
00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:09.359
repression to the cornerstone of psychoanalysis. It's really the,

149
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.969
you know, uh if, if you remove that idea,

150
00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:15.460
then there is no psychoanalysis any longer.

151
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.880
And what were his ideas about uh trauma? Because

152
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.330
he also talked about trauma a lot. What was

153
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.469
trauma for him? And what sort of psychological effects

154
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.650
did it supposedly have?

155
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.760
Ok. Uh His idea of trauma stemmed directly from

156
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.359
Charcot, Jean Martin Charcot items. Again, uh Freud went

157
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:46.049
to study in the Charcot in Paris at the

158
00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:50.489
Hospital of La Salle Petrie. And Jacque was at

159
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.960
the time uh studying uh his theoria uh and

160
00:11:56.969 --> 00:12:02.950
the hysteria for him was a uh neurological uh

161
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:11.340
disease um that basically consisted in a regression to

162
00:12:11.349 --> 00:12:16.010
use a fraudulent term to the famous reflex, automatic

163
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.479
uh uh activity of the mind. Uh And Jacco

164
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:27.159
listed various agent provocateur as you call them uh

165
00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:34.010
provoking agents or trigger events that would cause people

166
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.729
to uh to uh go from, to, to, to,

167
00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:43.340
to regress again uh to an automatic reflex, psychological

168
00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:49.419
activity. Uh And one of these agent provocateur was

169
00:12:49.489 --> 00:12:54.789
a physical shock, more nervous shock as uh shaku

170
00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:59.409
uh put it. So people would have a fall,

171
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.489
they would be knocked out by something and suddenly

172
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.869
they would, you know, uh become some kind of

173
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:14.169
psychical autometer. Um And this is what uh uh

174
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:18.190
shako called traumatic hysteria. So it was a special

175
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.650
kind of hysteria caused by a physical trauma. And

176
00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:27.570
then he also called uh mentioned some psychological traumas.

177
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.179
But the idea that there is a shock that

178
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:35.109
caused the the the mind to split to dissociate

179
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.390
as uh shock could put it and, and then

180
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.349
you had, you know, uh hysteria. So

181
00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:45.830
sorry for interrupting, but just to ask you, but

182
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.710
hysteria was attributed only to women, right?

183
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.890
No, no, no, no. OK. OK. OK.

184
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.919
So go, go ahead because that's interesting.

185
00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:02.289
Yeah, I know. I actually shao I thought that

186
00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.750
uh you also had a male hysteria and he

187
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.500
was very adamant about the fact that hysteria was

188
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:14.309
not a female malady due to the uh female

189
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.859
sexuality. He, he thought it was both a male

190
00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:24.119
and a female. Yeah. Um And of course your

191
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:29.950
question uh uh stems from the fact that Freud

192
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.349
uh who was not a psychiatrist, not a neurologist,

193
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:40.989
uh a hospital uh clinician, but a private neurologist.

194
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.099
Uh uh THEY have arts as I said in,

195
00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:48.390
in German, his clientele at the beginning was mainly

196
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.549
female. And so that's why people usually associate concept

197
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.820
of hysteria with, uh, with, uh, women. But it's,

198
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.900
it's, it's not, uh, you know, in Shao it's

199
00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:02.659
not the case

200
00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:06.419
but, but in Freud it's also not the case

201
00:15:06.429 --> 00:15:07.289
or is

202
00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:11.280
it? No, it's not the case either. He was

203
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.679
from the very beginning. He was a true coach

204
00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:18.440
and no, he, he had uh he had uh

205
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:26.450
male patients uh deemed uh hysteric uh hysterical. But

206
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.849
uh no, it's just that his, his main clientele

207
00:15:30.859 --> 00:15:36.390
at the beginning was uh uh women, the uh

208
00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.190
upper class women. Mhm.

209
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.979
And so going back to drama then, uh what

210
00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:45.440
were rights ideas about it?

211
00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:50.640
So at, at first, uh he starts with Shao's

212
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:56.719
uh ideas. Uh SO, uh and after a while,

213
00:15:57.099 --> 00:16:01.109
um so he, he, he based his whole uh

214
00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:09.000
therapy at the beginning uh on this idea of

215
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:18.780
dissociation. Uh HE assumed that his hysterical patients, female

216
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:22.789
and male patients uh had been subjected to some

217
00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:26.559
kind of trauma that had caused them to regress

218
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.219
to an automatic reflex kind of psychical activity. And

219
00:16:31.229 --> 00:16:36.599
so he uh he started uh using hypnosis as

220
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:43.450
Jacque had done uh to um access the dissociated

221
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.789
part of the psyche. So you hypnosis for Shau

222
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.130
and also then for, for Freud was a way

223
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:56.250
to get access to the cyclical the, the automatic

224
00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.349
reflex uh part of the, of the mind And

225
00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:05.108
um, and so he, he, he shock, we had

226
00:17:05.118 --> 00:17:07.390
this whole idea that he build in his history

227
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.709
were actually the same thing. And so use as

228
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:15.128
hypnos, please puts uh his patients in a state

229
00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:19.979
of some embolism and as it was uh called

230
00:17:19.989 --> 00:17:23.489
at the time, uh and then he tried to

231
00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:27.458
desist as he puts it, the, the trauma, the

232
00:17:27.468 --> 00:17:30.529
memory of the trauma, which is actually the cause

233
00:17:30.538 --> 00:17:35.369
of the uh of the uh the whole hysteria

234
00:17:35.649 --> 00:17:39.550
uh uh is, is so to speak, uh uh

235
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.760
removed through suggestion. Now I'm not gonna go into,

236
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.359
into details. Basically, it's a kind of brainwashing. Uh

237
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.979
YOU, you, you access the unconscious and you remove

238
00:17:54.989 --> 00:18:00.829
the fixed idea as uh uh Shao and Jan

239
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.119
put it uh that is at the origin of

240
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:11.689
the symptoms. And then he realized uh pretty soon

241
00:18:11.699 --> 00:18:15.199
that this didn't work. I mean, he would uh

242
00:18:15.209 --> 00:18:19.790
put his patients and the hypnosis uh access the

243
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.010
trauma, we try to remove it by suggestion, but

244
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:28.239
it didn't, it didn't, the symptoms would recur would

245
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.640
come back. Um So he, it is then that

246
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.260
he, he, he, he, he came up with this

247
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:40.020
whole idea that uh you know, the, the cause,

248
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:45.130
the real cause of the, the symptoms, hysterical symptoms

249
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:50.739
is not uh just shock, traumatic shock and dissociation,

250
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.739
but it's repression is, is because the conscious ego

251
00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:59.660
decides to, to, to, to push back to inhibit

252
00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:04.760
uh certain traumatic ideas that uh you have uh

253
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:11.579
hysterical symptoms. Therefore, the goal was then to uh

254
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.000
not to, to, to have the, the, the patient

255
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:21.880
forget about the trauma. It was quite the contrary,

256
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.839
it was to uh unearth the memory of the

257
00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:28.650
trauma and bring it back to countries. So that's

258
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.489
the whole point of Freud's new therapy psychotherapy, which

259
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.780
he calls psychoanalysis after a while. And, and so

260
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:46.500
trauma then becomes a traumatic memory. Uh It's a

261
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.739
memory of a trauma which can be physical but

262
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:58.760
mostly psychological uh for Freud. And after a while

263
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:06.910
uh in his uh in his uh uh psychotherapy,

264
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.650
he, he, he, he realizes, no, not, he realizes,

265
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:15.510
he, he, he, he, he, he, he obtains from

266
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.500
his patients, memories of trauma uh that were not

267
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:27.420
just psychological traumas due to some kind of emotional

268
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:36.969
uh uh shock, but memories of very early dramas

269
00:20:36.979 --> 00:20:44.979
in childhood. Mhm Sexual uh sexual uh traumas. And

270
00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:50.150
so that is the beginning of Freud's famous uh

271
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:57.229
theory of seduction, which holds that uh hysteria and

272
00:20:57.239 --> 00:21:03.109
also uh neurasthenia and obsessional neurosis are caused by

273
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:11.800
um uh traumas, sexual traumas uh dating back to

274
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:17.199
uh early childhood. And here I have to, to,

275
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:24.050
to uh add that this takes place at a

276
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:31.180
moment when Freud gets very interested in his friend,

277
00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:35.780
Bill and Flea's series uh which were not at

278
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:41.369
all uh based on uh uh drama, which was

279
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.619
not at all. Neurophysiological uh theories such as Shakos

280
00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:51.969
J and so forth. There were theological theories. Uh,

281
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.329
POLICE had a whole theory about, uh, basically, uh,

282
00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:05.030
life and death based on bios, uh, which is

283
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.910
an idea that he got from, uh, from Darwin

284
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:16.250
and other, uh, Darwin thinkers. Uh, IT'S about, uh,

285
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:24.089
uh, sexual biorhythms, uh, think of, uh, uh, uh,

286
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:31.959
female, uh, women's, uh, uh, um, are called, uh,

287
00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:39.689
anyway, uh, in a sexual cycle, uh, of 28

288
00:22:39.699 --> 00:22:48.300
days. Uh, YES, next time. Uh, AND uh uh

289
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:54.199
please said ideas about another male sexual cycle of

290
00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:59.979
23 days, et cetera. And the whole point of

291
00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:05.310
uh of uh thesis ideas was that basically our

292
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.699
whole life is governed by these sexual cycles starting

293
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:17.290
from early childhood. So he said that for example,

294
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:26.680
teething uh aury diarrheas were governed by these cycles

295
00:23:26.689 --> 00:23:30.619
by AR RMS. And these were sexual in nature

296
00:23:30.829 --> 00:23:37.979
which I implied, for example, that in early childhood,

297
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:46.489
you already had sexual uh events or sexual functions

298
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.699
uh playing a part. So, Freud was quite interested

299
00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:55.939
in all these ideas and that is how I

300
00:23:55.949 --> 00:24:01.010
think he got to a place where he would

301
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.900
uh say that uh traumas, sexual traumas were uh

302
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.479
traumas were sexual in nature and not only sexual

303
00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:14.319
in nature, but uh going back to early uh

304
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:20.790
child uh early child sexual abuse, you see, it's

305
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.439
still, it's still uh keeps this idea that you

306
00:24:25.449 --> 00:24:32.630
have a sexual trauma. Basically, someone abuses a child

307
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.930
which causes a trauma which causes a memory that

308
00:24:36.939 --> 00:24:41.400
is unconscious et cetera. But at one point and

309
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.489
that is the famous uh uh click, you know,

310
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.660
that, that, that is the start the starting point

311
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.219
of mature psychoanalysis. At one point, he, he, he

312
00:24:53.229 --> 00:24:57.959
decides that basically his whole idea of trauma, sexual

313
00:24:57.969 --> 00:25:03.000
trauma in childhood uh is, is bo uh is

314
00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:08.780
uh doesn't hold up. And he then moves to

315
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:17.930
eles biological theory that says that actually, uh if

316
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:23.829
his patients talked about and memories of uh early

317
00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:27.089
sexual abuse, it was not because they had actually

318
00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:33.109
been abused uh traumatized, but it was a fantasy.

319
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:39.869
They wanted to be uh abused by, among other

320
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.589
things, the father. Uh uh And so suddenly you,

321
00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:50.890
you, you, there's a shift from uh this trauma

322
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:58.959
paradigm that uh Freud um uh uh used up

323
00:25:58.969 --> 00:26:03.979
to a certain point. Uh He moved to a

324
00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:11.400
more biologically uh uh uh biological uh paradigm which

325
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.699
he inherits from uh from fleece who himself was

326
00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:23.079
inherited it from uh evolutionary uh thinking. And so

327
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.920
you, you, Freud kept using the, the, the, the

328
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.189
concept of trauma. But for him, after a while,

329
00:26:33.199 --> 00:26:40.339
it became just a trigger, uh maybe traumatized uh

330
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:44.800
uh in real life. Uh But it, it, it

331
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:49.849
triggers actually uh uh your fantasy life and uh

332
00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:55.780
all these uh triggers, all these uh drives biological

333
00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:01.119
drives that um that are fundamentally sexual in, in

334
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.719
nature. So that in a nutshell that is how

335
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:10.560
he moves from uh a shakin uh concept of

336
00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:16.410
trauma to uh to the idea of sexual uh

337
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.790
drives being, you know, uh the, the, the main

338
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.699
cause of uh repression and therefore of neurosis and,

339
00:27:26.709 --> 00:27:29.310
and other mental illness, illnesses.

340
00:27:29.979 --> 00:27:32.500
A and so this is when we get into

341
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:37.439
things like the Odis complex and the castration complex.

342
00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:44.739
Right. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. You know, uh when you

343
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:50.500
read, uh histories of psychoanalysis, you are usually told,

344
00:27:51.150 --> 00:28:01.390
um, that Freud discovered the Oedipus Complex. Uh WHEN

345
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.060
he decided to move around the seduction theory that

346
00:28:07.069 --> 00:28:12.349
held that Children who are actually abused by, among

347
00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:17.660
other things that they, that uh to uh the

348
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:22.739
more mature theory that he holds that uh uh

349
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.400
that in fact, these uh so called sexual traumas

350
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:34.180
were fantasies emanating the uh from the, the inner

351
00:28:34.189 --> 00:28:41.160
biological uh uh activity of the mind. Uh And

352
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:48.770
so you, this is indeed how Freud always described

353
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:54.829
his discovery of the Oedipus complex. He said that

354
00:28:54.839 --> 00:28:59.069
his, his patients had told him that there had

355
00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:01.510
been abused, et cetera and he realized that in

356
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.709
fact, it was just fantasy. But when you, when

357
00:29:04.719 --> 00:29:08.469
you read uh his letters to his friend flee,

358
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.689
uh you which you wrote it at the time,

359
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.469
you see that actually he was already talking about

360
00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:19.410
the ODP, not the ODP complex, but he, he

361
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.439
talked about this whole idea of the prohibition of

362
00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:28.280
incest and parasite uh months before he abandoned his

363
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.449
uh seduction theory. Uh AND, and his, his statements

364
00:29:33.459 --> 00:29:39.449
about, uh, that are purely speculative. Uh, IT is,

365
00:29:39.459 --> 00:29:42.910
he, he has this, I spec, I mean, he,

366
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:49.380
uh, he is, uh, talking about the, the, the

367
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.900
prohibition of incest, the fact that humans usually prohibit

368
00:29:55.459 --> 00:29:59.670
human societies prohibit uh incest. And, and he says

369
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.619
that, ok, this, uh, uh must have to do

370
00:30:04.689 --> 00:30:08.130
with the fact that in order to, for so

371
00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:14.959
society, uh to emerge, you need to, uh, to,

372
00:30:14.969 --> 00:30:18.569
uh, to encourage exo Gammy. That is to say

373
00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:21.579
the fact that you, you don't breathe into your

374
00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:25.949
own kin, you breathe uh uh outside. And so

375
00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:31.089
uh so, and, and this is a purely, you

376
00:30:31.099 --> 00:30:35.270
know, it's speculative idea. He, he speculates about the

377
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.209
origins of, of uh of humanity uh in the

378
00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:45.939
context of his exchanges about uh uh phylogeny and

379
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.489
ontogeny. That is to say to the, to the

380
00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:55.939
uh the individual uh biological development that is supposed

381
00:30:55.949 --> 00:31:01.900
to recapitulate repeat the phylogenetic, that is the evolution

382
00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:07.790
of the species. So these are speculations based on

383
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:14.619
uh heckles ernst heckles, uh so called biogenetic law

384
00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:18.829
that held at the time that indeed the individual

385
00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:25.250
biological development uh repeats, recapitulates the, the various stages

386
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.609
of the evolution of the species. And so it,

387
00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:35.459
it, the AUS complex, it stems from all these

388
00:31:35.469 --> 00:31:40.020
ideas. Yeah, I could go into further details, but

389
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:45.969
it's basically a, an idea speculation based on uh

390
00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:52.560
on, on this biogenetic law. And uh and this

391
00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:59.469
is what then Freud uh uh uh easily uh

392
00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:05.849
imports into his own new theory and, and his

393
00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:10.119
new theory is a theory about the evolution of

394
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.250
human sexuality, right? Uh

395
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.449
But uh before we

396
00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:16.209
get into that, yeah,

397
00:32:16.219 --> 00:32:19.469
before we get into that, uh about the Oedipus

398
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:25.510
complex and this general idea of ones being attracted,

399
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.770
sexually, attracted to their own parents, he, he also,

400
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.459
he also didn't get that at all from any

401
00:32:33.469 --> 00:32:38.329
evolutionary thinkers, right? Because from an evolutionary perspective, uh

402
00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:41.079
of course, back then, in the 19, at least

403
00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:44.400
in the late 19th century, I don't know if

404
00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.619
people were already aware of the Western Mark effect,

405
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.949
for example. And the fact that if you reproduce

406
00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:56.579
uh with uh people that are genetically close to

407
00:32:56.589 --> 00:33:02.030
you, you increase the probability of having uh offspring

408
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.719
with health issues and all of that. But uh

409
00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:07.324
but even if they weren't aware of that, I

410
00:33:07.334 --> 00:33:12.295
don't think that any evolutionary thinker uh uh suggested

411
00:33:12.305 --> 00:33:18.234
that we had evolved to feeling sexually attracted to

412
00:33:18.244 --> 00:33:21.224
one's own uh parents

413
00:33:21.244 --> 00:33:24.295
or you had, you had, you had all kinds

414
00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:30.680
of theories about uh exo and you find this

415
00:33:30.689 --> 00:33:34.979
in Darwin, you find this in Andrew Lang, you

416
00:33:34.989 --> 00:33:39.489
find in other Atkinson, uh all these people, by

417
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.099
the way, uh who would be quoted by Freud

418
00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:47.270
and Lang uh in Oman and Taboo. And so

419
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.890
the, the whole, the problem of how it come

420
00:33:52.109 --> 00:33:58.530
that you, you don't marry your mother uh uh

421
00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:03.849
was very much uh uh there, I mean, people

422
00:34:03.859 --> 00:34:07.780
were thinking about this and trying to give to

423
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:13.290
this whole idea uh uh uh an evolutionary basis.

424
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.649
So it's not, it's not uh by accident that

425
00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:24.830
Freud talks about that. Of course, his whole idea

426
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.739
of an Oedipus complex, uh you know, uh uh

427
00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:37.270
they said that, that we having reached this evolutionary

428
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.840
stage still being, you know, like uh apes wanting

429
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:46.219
to uh to, to uh uh to have sex

430
00:34:46.228 --> 00:34:52.500
with uh our janitor. Uh This is new, I

431
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.449
mean, this is right, of course, this is original.

432
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.719
But, but you have to, you have to understand

433
00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:03.139
that it stems these uh speculations and at the

434
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.830
time. Mhm

435
00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:08.629
So you were about to get into his general

436
00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:12.409
theory of sexuality. So tell us about it now.

437
00:35:13.209 --> 00:35:20.750
So it all stems from his exchanges with Willhelm

438
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.709
flee William Fries, as I said, had a whole

439
00:35:25.649 --> 00:35:28.840
a biological theory. There was not only a, you

440
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.800
know, a, a theory about sexuality, it was a

441
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.949
theory of life and death. It was a very

442
00:35:34.959 --> 00:35:41.020
ambitious and speculative theory. Um But as I said,

443
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.250
he, he, he the implication of his uh theory

444
00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:49.429
uh was among other things that uh there was

445
00:35:49.439 --> 00:35:59.100
a kind of uh um infantile sexuality. So, the

446
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:03.020
implication of the thesis theories was that there was

447
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:08.760
a kind of infantile sexuality. Uh And by that,

448
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:13.800
he just meant, you know, biological cycles that uh

449
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:20.510
were at play already uh in infancy uh fried

450
00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:27.239
and, and Fred developed this. Um And he assumed

451
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:38.870
that the, the ontogenetic development of the individual uh

452
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:46.780
basically repeated uh the phylogenetic evolution of the species.

453
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.370
And so that a baby uh and a child

454
00:36:51.379 --> 00:36:55.590
goes through all the phases of the sexual history

455
00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.620
of the species. Ok. And, and then he comes

456
00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:07.459
up with this idea that repression, which uh uh

457
00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:09.870
he talked about at first as a kind of

458
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:19.790
psychological uh mechanism. Uh REPRESSION was indeed based on

459
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:26.739
the, the evolution of the, the species. Uh He

460
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:33.610
assumed he, he, he, he speculated that uh certainly

461
00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:40.739
sexual sexual zones, uh they were of interest back

462
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.260
then. For example, the anal zone, the oral zone

463
00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:49.909
uh which were part of the, the, the, the,

464
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:57.379
the sexuality of our ancestors. These exosome were abandoned

465
00:37:57.669 --> 00:38:04.850
when humans uh adopted the erect posture. Mm And

466
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.330
so that led according to Freud to all kinds

467
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:15.100
of uh mechanisms discussed shame and so forth that

468
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.199
that had to do with these abandoned erotogenic zones,

469
00:38:21.389 --> 00:38:28.699
oral ale, et cetera. And then he continues by

470
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:36.770
uh assuming that in Children, uh Children go through

471
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.250
the same evolution. So they have at first an

472
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:46.760
oral sexuality, then anal sexuality, et cetera, et cetera.

473
00:38:47.169 --> 00:38:52.649
And then they reach the point of uh the

474
00:38:52.659 --> 00:38:57.969
erection, the erect posture, which is uh the point

475
00:38:57.979 --> 00:39:02.050
uh of what he calls the primary repression or

476
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:08.810
the organic repression uh which uh uh uh consisting,

477
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:14.189
you know, uh repressing all these previous sexual interests.

478
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.520
Uh THAT is, uh, according to Freud, what happens

479
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.239
around the age of five is what he calls

480
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:24.199
the latency period, which was, by the way, a

481
00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:28.429
concept that he got from, uh, from fees. Um,

482
00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.330
AND that is where, uh, the, you have the,

483
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.620
the Oedipus complex. Let's see when there is a,

484
00:39:36.629 --> 00:39:42.590
uh, an interest in genitality. Uh, AND, and that

485
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.570
is also when the whole thing is, uh, repressed

486
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:51.760
and then it, uh, you have this sexual latency

487
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.870
that uh continues until the beginning of uh puberty.

488
00:39:56.889 --> 00:40:01.219
And then you have uh the, you know, access

489
00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:05.800
to normal uh genitality. So, in a nutshell, that

490
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:10.860
is Freud's theory of sexuality, as he uh uh

491
00:40:11.689 --> 00:40:16.389
uh lays it out in his three essays on

492
00:40:16.399 --> 00:40:20.679
the theory of sexuality, which came out in 1905.

493
00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:25.219
And then, you know, uh the theory evolved, there

494
00:40:25.229 --> 00:40:29.510
were other uh additions to, to, to, to the

495
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.899
theory, but that is the core of the whole

496
00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:40.830
theory. It's a biological psycho, biological theory based on

497
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:48.290
uh on, on, on Hans Heckle's uh biogenetic law.

498
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.280
Uh The recapitulation of autogenic by uh uh philo

499
00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:54.570
by Ony.

500
00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.610
And what did they mean by drives? And what

501
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.949
different kinds of drives did they identify?

502
00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:12.389
So, uh the concept of drive, um by the

503
00:41:12.399 --> 00:41:16.280
way, again, it, if you, if you read his

504
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:20.100
correspondence with fleece, you see that this whole concept

505
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:26.489
comes from uh fleece's ideas was also speaking of

506
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.590
drives or impulses as he puts it. So, what

507
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.800
is the drive? Uh Ale in German? A drive

508
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:42.149
is an instinct. That's it. Uh, IN, in, in

509
00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:46.580
German at the time. Uh You used uh uh

510
00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:53.870
two terms instinct, uh tribe uh to, to refer

511
00:41:53.879 --> 00:41:57.080
to the same thing, which is what we usually

512
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.260
think of for the instinct is to say a

513
00:41:59.689 --> 00:42:07.870
biologically uh determined. Uh And here he hereditary, uh

514
00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:15.340
uh uh urge, uh behavioral urge, the sexual instinct,

515
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.989
the, the aggressive instinct, you, you have uh uh

516
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.820
uh behaviors that are uh how do you say

517
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:35.040
that are um automatic? Uh And I use the

518
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:40.709
term automatic uh on purpose because indeed, uh the

519
00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:46.580
whole notion of uh drive of three in Freud,

520
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:51.320
uh it is linked to this whole idea of

521
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:56.479
an automatic uh uh reflex activity of the mind

522
00:42:56.489 --> 00:43:02.840
which itself is based on uh a recapitulation of

523
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:08.120
uh previous phases of uh of uh the, the

524
00:43:08.129 --> 00:43:14.649
human evolution of the species. Uh AN instinct. When,

525
00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:21.790
when you read, for example, uh uh his, his

526
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.969
text uh uh instinct and vicissitudes of instincts that

527
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:31.810
is how it translated into, into English. Uh You

528
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.500
see, he, he, he, he, he, it says very

529
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:41.939
explicitly that an instinct is a reflex. Uh He,

530
00:43:41.949 --> 00:43:44.949
he mentioned the, the, the reflex act to say

531
00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:48.030
that when you have an exaltation that comes from

532
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.580
the outside, uh you have a reflex that uh

533
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.419
tends to put back, push back the excitation uh

534
00:43:56.429 --> 00:43:59.760
uh to, to to the, to the outside, the

535
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:04.909
M and a drive is an instinct. It's the

536
00:44:04.919 --> 00:44:08.580
same term. Uh It, it comes from the inside.

537
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:16.139
It's an internal endo genetic uh put from the,

538
00:44:16.149 --> 00:44:19.419
from the inside. And the problem with these uh

539
00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:23.739
instincts with these drives is that you cannot escape

540
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.899
the internal, therefore, you cannot uh discharge them in

541
00:44:28.909 --> 00:44:32.250
a reflex way, the same, the same way. But

542
00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:37.020
it's a reflex. It's, it's basically something, a reflex

543
00:44:37.479 --> 00:44:44.050
uh that is uh inherited from uh uh from

544
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:49.629
the evolution of the, of the species. Um And

545
00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:55.330
so this is what a drive is. Uh WE,

546
00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.560
we in English, you translate this as, as drive

547
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:06.040
uh rather than uh instinct. Striking the first, you

548
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:11.679
know, uh f for, for translator uh into English.

549
00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:14.280
Actually, he, he used the term instinct and he

550
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:18.850
was right, because there is no reason to translate

551
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.780
a tree uh uh as drive rather than instinct.

552
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:29.790
It's the same thing. Um uh So, but that,

553
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.840
that is, you know, a drive is a push

554
00:45:33.209 --> 00:45:37.459
uh in, in, in German street means comes from

555
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.810
c push to push. Uh It's an, it's an

556
00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.070
urge. Uh So that is what the drive is.

557
00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:52.129
Um And uh iii I insist on this because

558
00:45:52.399 --> 00:45:58.919
uh in a tradition uh interpretive tradition that stems

559
00:45:58.929 --> 00:46:02.919
from Jacques Laco in, in, in France uh c

560
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:07.830
uh uh 10 to, to, to, to say that

561
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.629
uh the Freud, Andre Freud. And uh it has

562
00:46:12.639 --> 00:46:15.010
nothing to do with an instinct is something completely

563
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.580
different. Well, no, uh you read Freud, uh uh

564
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:23.530
that is what, what he's talking about. Uh And

565
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.000
so you, you asked what kinds of vibes there

566
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.949
were? Well, uh at first you have uh two

567
00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:36.229
kinds of drives in, in Freud, which are basically

568
00:46:36.239 --> 00:46:41.780
the same uh drives that everyone was talking about

569
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.570
at the time. Uh IN the wake of Darwin

570
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.330
and other evolutionary thinkers, they used to say you

571
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.500
have the sexual instinct and uh the self preservation

572
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.270
instinct. So uh this s instinct, uh Freud calls

573
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:03.290
it the libido. And uh the uh self preservation

574
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:08.120
instinct is what he calls the ego tribe, your

575
00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:14.669
ego instinct. And then he, his thought evolves. He,

576
00:47:14.679 --> 00:47:18.179
he comes up with other kinds of uh drives,

577
00:47:18.219 --> 00:47:24.520
notably uh the uh the ego libido. Uh At

578
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:31.169
first, he would uh draw a sharp contrast between

579
00:47:31.179 --> 00:47:34.800
the, the sexual instincts and the ego uh drives.

580
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:40.010
The ego drive is the drive that depresses the

581
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.770
uh sexual instinct. But then he comes up with

582
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.479
this idea about ego libido. Uh There is a

583
00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:55.120
sexual instinct or drive uh that is concerned uh

584
00:47:55.129 --> 00:48:02.590
with the ego, the ego. Mm What, what Freud

585
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.719
calls the ego becomes an object of a drive.

586
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:12.629
This is what we call now, narcissist, narcissistic drive.

587
00:48:13.129 --> 00:48:17.030
OK. And then you get to uh the third

588
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.689
theory of the drives uh well known uh the

589
00:48:20.699 --> 00:48:27.229
contrast between uh life drives and uh death drives,

590
00:48:27.929 --> 00:48:33.540
uh which are basically a recapitulation of his whole

591
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:39.260
uh ideas about drives. Um And I'm sure you

592
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.989
want to ask, you want to ask what, what

593
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.969
it means a test drive.

594
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.280
Yeah. Sure. Uh Also because, uh I, I mean,

595
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.520
at least from my point of view since he

596
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.189
was also influenced by evolutionary thinkers, this idea of

597
00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:58.459
uh having a DEA drive, a sort of self

598
00:48:58.489 --> 00:49:03.629
annihilation drive is a bit weird because it contrasts

599
00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:07.969
with the self preservation uh drive. And also, of

600
00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:13.280
course, if people would kill themselves after they had

601
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:18.090
reproduced, evolutionarily speaking, OK, that might have worked. But

602
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.159
if it was before I, I will, I'm not

603
00:49:21.169 --> 00:49:23.709
seeing how it would have evolved. So

604
00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.489
OK. But you see that is because you don't

605
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:34.090
understand what he means by desperate. OK? Because indeed

606
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:39.189
uh the idea, but when you, when you hear

607
00:49:39.199 --> 00:49:43.649
this term death drive, you think that you have

608
00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:49.330
an instinct to die to or maybe to kill

609
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.750
yourself or whatever, that's not what he's talking about.

610
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:58.770
Not all, actually, he is trying to uh in

611
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.090
a very speculative way. He is trying to come

612
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.459
up with a whole theory of life and death

613
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:17.000
still based on biological ideas. And he uh what

614
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:22.840
he calls the delay is quite simply the fact

615
00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:31.989
that all living uh creatures, uh beings uh go

616
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.310
through, goes through cycles. Uh U you are born,

617
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.149
you uh are first a child, then uh an

618
00:50:43.159 --> 00:50:46.929
adult, then you get old and that's why you

619
00:50:46.939 --> 00:50:51.709
die. Ok. That's, it's as simple as that, that

620
00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:55.790
is what he's talking about. The test flight is

621
00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:02.290
quite simply the fact that you tend eventually to

622
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:09.649
pass. Uh And he gives, he, he, he, what

623
00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:13.790
he, he gives uh as, as examples of, of,

624
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:20.060
of this, uh is for example, the uh uh

625
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.409
repetitive cycles. Uh THE fact that you have uh

626
00:51:24.419 --> 00:51:31.100
birds that migrate back and forth, Uh You have

627
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.489
uh uh and, and he cites the, the biogenetic

628
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:41.120
law of uh of Heckle. Uh OUR life is

629
00:51:41.129 --> 00:51:46.719
governed by these cycles. So for him, you have

630
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:53.810
life, the life instinct, self motivation thing, which tends

631
00:51:53.820 --> 00:52:00.659
to prolong as much as it can life. Uh

632
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:04.870
But then at one point, uh you uh you

633
00:52:04.879 --> 00:52:10.459
die. So it's not desk life should not be

634
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.689
interpreted as a desire, a psychological desire to die.

635
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:24.340
It's just biological uh destiny uh of all uh

636
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:29.040
living beings. They are going to die, dust to

637
00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:33.439
dust as they say in the Bible. Um And,

638
00:52:33.449 --> 00:52:36.979
and that's it. So, uh and of course, he,

639
00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:42.909
he, he, he connects this with uh his uh

640
00:52:42.919 --> 00:52:50.439
previous neurophysiological ideas about energy flowing through the uh

641
00:52:50.449 --> 00:52:54.010
through the, the psychical apparatus as he, as he

642
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.050
puts it. Uh And he connects this with uh

643
00:52:58.189 --> 00:53:01.330
the, the, the pleasure principle, which is, you know,

644
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.080
for him, it's the fact that an energy has

645
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.830
to be discharge from the psychical apparatus. Otherwise, it's

646
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.360
gonna cause a displeasure. And so he uh he,

647
00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.989
he, he, he, he, he then comes up with

648
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.850
this idea of uh a repetition, compulsion, repetition, which

649
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.489
is uh beyond uh the pleasure principle. It's a

650
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.250
title of the essay in which he presented his

651
00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:34.310
ideas about this. And, and, and then it gets

652
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.300
very complicated because he contradicts himself. Uh He says

653
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:43.129
basically that this repetition uh is beyond the pleasure

654
00:53:43.139 --> 00:53:48.270
principle. But in fact, uh the desper is the

655
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:54.229
major illustration of the pleasure principle, which is the

656
00:53:54.620 --> 00:54:00.310
the the the the extinction of all kinds of

657
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:06.139
uh of um of excitation. So you see, it's,

658
00:54:06.149 --> 00:54:11.310
it's the desk drive is really a uh it's

659
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:20.350
a purely theoretical um speculative uh concept based on

660
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:25.219
biological ideas.

661
00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:30.030
And so uh how does he develop then the

662
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.979
theory of culture? Why was he also uh I

663
00:54:33.989 --> 00:54:37.739
mean, basically how do do his ideas also apply

664
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:38.739
to culture?

665
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:50.250
Yeah. Uh USUALLY uh he would, he would present,

666
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:55.229
I'm sorry, he would present uh his ideas about

667
00:54:55.479 --> 00:55:02.510
literature, about uh art, about culture in general as

668
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.639
uh applications of psychoanalysis and given, given to, to

669
00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:17.270
go and use it. Um WHICH implies of course,

670
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.669
that first we have something called psychoanalysis, which is

671
00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:28.770
the study of uh uh uh of uh psychological

672
00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:37.129
pathology of pathology. Uh And then you have these

673
00:55:37.139 --> 00:55:43.280
ideas are applied to other fields. Um That's not

674
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:53.060
at all how it works. Uh BECAUSE um psychoanalysis

675
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:59.370
or let's say Freud's theory uh is from the

676
00:55:59.379 --> 00:56:07.810
very beginning. Um A theory about culture. Why? Because

677
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:13.000
culture for Freud, he has a very simple concept

678
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:21.010
of culture. Culture is based on Kago, which means

679
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:27.570
the renunciation of tribes. So OK, for, for, for

680
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.580
Freud culture is the product of repression, what he

681
00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:40.739
calls repression. Uh And remember uh with repression for

682
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:46.100
him is in the final analysis is based on

683
00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:49.570
what he calls the organic repression. The primary repression,

684
00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:53.929
which is the fact that uh uh human beings

685
00:56:53.939 --> 00:56:57.760
uh adopted the, the erect posture and therefore uh

686
00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:04.560
repressed, inhibited. Uh All these previous uh sexual uh

687
00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:09.989
uh drives oral, anal, et cetera. Uh And so,

688
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:15.219
and this idea as, as soon as Freud hits

689
00:57:15.229 --> 00:57:18.310
on this idea in his letter to f to

690
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:26.020
flee, uh he immediately embarks on speculations about the

691
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:32.100
origin of culture. Says at the very first time,

692
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:36.679
he talks about this uh or organic repression to

693
00:57:36.689 --> 00:57:40.659
fleece. He said I am, I think I am

694
00:57:40.669 --> 00:57:45.379
already I have here the origin of, of culture

695
00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:52.139
uh you know, shame, disgust, etcetera. Uh And so

696
00:57:52.909 --> 00:57:55.840
you can see that his, his idea, his, his

697
00:57:55.850 --> 00:58:00.370
theory is not only from the very beginning, psycho

698
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:07.979
biological, it is also socio biological. This is something

699
00:58:07.989 --> 00:58:12.449
that people don't understand. They think that Ro theory

700
00:58:12.459 --> 00:58:16.870
is a, is a psychological uh uh theory applied

701
00:58:16.879 --> 00:58:20.060
to culture, to society. It's a no, it's a

702
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:25.979
social biological theory. He wants to explain not only

703
00:58:26.159 --> 00:58:31.205
the, the psychological development. Our psychological develops how our

704
00:58:31.215 --> 00:58:34.635
mind functions. He also wants to, to, to explain

705
00:58:34.834 --> 00:58:39.235
uh how uh human society functions. Where does it

706
00:58:39.245 --> 00:58:42.864
stem from? Well, it stems from the organic repression.

707
00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:46.784
It stems from the, the, it, it is something

708
00:58:46.925 --> 00:58:52.669
that is uh that is part of uh all

709
00:58:52.679 --> 00:58:59.459
biological evolution society uh is part of us, the

710
00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:02.399
evolution of the species, the biological evolution of the

711
00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:07.919
species. And so, uh it's um uh that is

712
00:59:07.929 --> 00:59:12.370
what his uh theory of culture is about. And

713
00:59:12.379 --> 00:59:16.760
of course, it, it is uh based on uh

714
00:59:16.939 --> 00:59:22.639
on uh his developments uh uh in Toto and

715
00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:27.699
Taboo, which is a book uh devoted to the

716
00:59:27.709 --> 00:59:34.639
origin of uh of uh origin of society, origin

717
00:59:34.649 --> 00:59:38.989
of uh the, the, the incest prohibition, which for

718
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.739
him is the cornerstone of, you know, uh society.

719
00:59:44.399 --> 00:59:48.739
And so, um so that, that, that is the,

720
00:59:49.649 --> 00:59:53.790
the point of his late, you know, uh developments

721
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.850
on society and religion on uh on art and

722
00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.439
so forth. It, it all goes back for him

723
01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:11.060
to the art event the of uh initiated from

724
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:15.629
which then the prohibition of incest stands, which is

725
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.879
what he calls the, the, the murder of the

726
01:00:18.889 --> 01:00:23.840
bridal father, which is actually the killing of a

727
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.429
big ape,

728
01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:33.100
right? And so how does then the super ego

729
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.350
come into the picture? What is the super ego?

730
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.239
Exactly? The super ego is uh again, people usually

731
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:48.979
think that it's kind of psychological uh mechanism that

732
01:00:48.989 --> 01:00:53.310
uh that stems from the what Freud calls the

733
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.179
decline of the Oedipus Complex uh in the evolution

734
01:00:58.189 --> 01:01:03.669
of the China. Um But when you read uh

735
01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:07.429
Freud's essay on the ego and the uh and

736
01:01:07.439 --> 01:01:10.780
the aid in which he presents for the first

737
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:15.100
time, the concept of the super ego. Um He

738
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:18.139
uh you see very clearly that it's uh I

739
01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.110
mean, this is what he says. And at the

740
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.510
end, he said, the super ego is just a

741
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.429
recapitulation uh at the level of, of uh ontogeny

742
01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:36.520
of the individual development of the phylogenics, genetic uh

743
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:42.379
event of uh the killing of uh the father.

744
01:01:43.629 --> 01:01:46.330
The primal thought the killing of the primal father

745
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.489
as you know, is, is uh the, the killing

746
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.260
of a big orangutan who has all the uh

747
01:01:55.270 --> 01:02:01.969
the women uh and the, the brothers, younger apes

748
01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:05.510
decide at one point to, to kill him or

749
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.830
kill it. Um BECAUSE uh they want to have

750
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.949
the, the women too. Um And according to Freud,

751
01:02:14.229 --> 01:02:19.850
they then eat him because they are cannibals, which

752
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.389
is a pure speculation on for his part. But

753
01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:26.280
the fact that they eat him, they ingest him,

754
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:32.270
they do something that uh they incorporate uh him

755
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.469
and then they become the father and they feel

756
01:02:36.479 --> 01:02:41.570
guilty for having killed the father themselves, which is

757
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:45.399
the beginning of guilt, which is the beginning of

758
01:02:45.409 --> 01:02:50.010
the prohibition of uh of incest and which is

759
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.350
the beginning according to Freud of the whole uh

760
01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:02.040
history of, of the mankind. Now, the superhero, how

761
01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:08.219
does it emerge uh at the decline of the

762
01:03:08.239 --> 01:03:13.820
Odis complex? Well, it emerges according to Freud uh

763
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:19.340
uh through an identification of the little child uh

764
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:24.739
with uh the father. So instead of killing the

765
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:30.840
father says, Freud, the child identifies with the father.

766
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.659
And that is the beginning of the superhero. Now,

767
01:03:33.669 --> 01:03:38.639
it's exactly the same, the same mechanism as the

768
01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:42.479
one that uh is at the basis of the,

769
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:46.090
the emergence of the, the, the guilt feeling in

770
01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.679
totem and taboo. And Freud says it explicitly, he

771
01:03:49.689 --> 01:03:53.719
says, well, actually, the, the what happens at the

772
01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.879
decline of the Oedipus Complex is exactly the same

773
01:03:56.889 --> 01:04:00.939
process. It's a repetition of an event that happened

774
01:04:00.949 --> 01:04:03.919
in devolution of uh mankind.

775
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.169
So I have a few final questions to ask

776
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:14.550
you more general questions about Freud himself, how we

777
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.320
approach, approach things in his work and so on.

778
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:22.790
So could we say that he was really a

779
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.899
scientist? Was he approaching things scientifically or was he

780
01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:34.189
uh for example, uh speculating coming up with theories,

781
01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:40.540
explanations and then sort of forcing interpretations onto his

782
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.239
clinical material?

783
01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:45.439
Yeah, that's uh that is a question I tried

784
01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.199
to address in this little book because again, as

785
01:04:48.209 --> 01:04:51.840
I said, the book is intended was intended initially

786
01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:56.060
to uh students in philosophy. It was Freud, a

787
01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:00.229
philosopher again in France, they study him as a

788
01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:05.860
philosopher. OK. Uh And my answer is yes, he

789
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:09.979
was a philosopher, but a bad one. BAD one

790
01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:18.169
because he himself so of himself uh as a

791
01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:22.840
scientist uh and for him to be a scientist

792
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.800
meant that you didn't engage in any kind of

793
01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:34.129
speculations, any kind of uh wild a priori hypotheses

794
01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:38.080
about this or that. Um He, he, he, he

795
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:41.120
claims, you know, from the very beginning, he claims

796
01:05:41.129 --> 01:05:47.909
I'm a scientist, I uh make observations, clinical observations

797
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.659
and on the basis of these uh facts, data

798
01:05:51.669 --> 01:05:56.239
or whatever, uh I come up with a theory

799
01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:01.260
that uh that explains it all. Uh So he,

800
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:06.010
he, he saw him, he saw himself as a

801
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:13.629
scientist in uh in the positivist style. Uh WHENEVER

802
01:06:13.639 --> 01:06:20.310
he engages in epistemological considerations, he refers implicitly to

803
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.260
uh ernst mass theories about uh scientific knowledge. You

804
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:30.020
start with speculations with hypotheses and then you test

805
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:33.889
them and when uh the uh the facts don't

806
01:06:33.899 --> 01:06:38.270
square with your uh hypothesis, then you remove your

807
01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.530
hypothesis and you start uh uh af Freshh. Well,

808
01:06:44.979 --> 01:06:52.310
that is, I would say is uh holds wealth

809
01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:59.600
for natural sciences and it's not, I'm sure. Um

810
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.500
uh But what about uh psychological investigations such as

811
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:12.939
Freud? Uh You uh do you observe uh a

812
01:07:12.989 --> 01:07:16.000
patient, for example, I start a patient the same

813
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:19.610
way you observe a chemical reaction? No, you don't.

814
01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:26.870
You have interactions uh with uh uh the patient

815
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.750
um and the patient reacts in a certain way

816
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:36.399
to what you say what you uh proposes. And

817
01:07:36.699 --> 01:07:39.889
when you uh from a pure historical point of

818
01:07:39.899 --> 01:07:42.040
view, when you, when you look at the way

819
01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:46.320
Freud interacted with his patients, you see that he

820
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.679
didn't just listen to what they were saying. He

821
01:07:49.689 --> 01:07:55.840
was coming up with hypotheses about that case. In

822
01:07:55.850 --> 01:08:01.110
other words, his, his theories and they basically either

823
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.840
they, you know, uh reacted negatively and then they

824
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:11.129
would say they resist or they would, you know,

825
01:08:11.139 --> 01:08:14.739
uh they would say yes, indeed, doctor you, you're

826
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.709
right. Uh I did want to kill my dad.

827
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:20.709
Uh And then he would see this as a

828
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.310
confirmation of his theories. And, and then uh so

829
01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:31.738
Freud thought of himself himself as a theorist as

830
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:37.059
a scientist. In fact, he was not uh because

831
01:08:37.068 --> 01:08:40.068
he was a very, I would say a very

832
01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:44.508
speculative mind who would come with all kinds of

833
01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:48.249
theories that he would just then just test uh

834
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:52.435
on his patients. But his patients would basically uh

835
01:08:52.444 --> 01:08:56.464
throw back at him his own theories. This is

836
01:08:56.475 --> 01:09:00.475
what many of his peers at the time objected

837
01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:04.504
to. They said that you, you basically suggest to

838
01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.734
your patients, your own theories, your theories are based

839
01:09:07.745 --> 01:09:11.415
not on facts but on your own, you know,

840
01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:19.009
suggestions. So um in a nutshell, uh I think

841
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.939
that is why we can uh consider that Freud

842
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:28.770
was not a scientist. Uh He didn't have the,

843
01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.839
the scientists. Um I would say the scientist ethics

844
01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:39.919
consistent trying to disprove, to falsify. As K Papa

845
01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:44.910
would say, uh his, his ideas, he was only

846
01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:49.359
too happy to uh to have his patients, you

847
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:56.790
know, basically uh confirm his wildest uh theories. So,

848
01:09:57.299 --> 01:10:00.319
was he a philosopher? I would say yes, he

849
01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:05.040
was a philosopher in fridge all sets. Uh They

850
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.870
should say someone who speculates a priority and who

851
01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:17.370
doesn't uh take into account the empirical uh data.

852
01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:23.910
Um So, uh and it is, I think as

853
01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:28.109
such, that is right now uh in France, for

854
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:35.080
example, or in uh American uh or Anglo Saxon

855
01:10:35.089 --> 01:10:39.910
uh Departments of Literature and, and Human Sciences. Uh

856
01:10:39.919 --> 01:10:48.379
He's, he has these Wild theories. Um AND he

857
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:53.029
studied like Nietzsche, you know, Nietzsche had also all

858
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.899
kinds of psychological theories uh and also all kinds

859
01:10:57.910 --> 01:11:02.390
of uh very cosmological theories about the eternal return,

860
01:11:02.399 --> 01:11:06.209
et cetera, except that he never claimed to base

861
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:12.669
his ideas on facts. He never claimed that patients

862
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:19.220
had confirmed his ideas. So, uh yes, Nietzsche was

863
01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:25.640
a philosopher. Um A good one, true one who

864
01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:31.200
by the way, um anticipated in many ways of

865
01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:36.430
Freud's concepts. And there is no question that Freud

866
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.350
had read Nietzsche and got a whole lot of

867
01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:47.720
ideas from, from Nietzsche. Uh But again, Nietzsche's ideas

868
01:11:47.729 --> 01:11:53.339
were his own uh Freud's ideas uh were his

869
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:58.890
own, but he attributed them to site, which is

870
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:08.890
so that is why many uh many commentators have

871
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:14.529
uh I've called Freud a pseudo scientist

872
01:12:16.109 --> 01:12:18.870
a and even when it comes to his own

873
01:12:18.879 --> 01:12:23.399
clinical material, his clinical data, isn't it the case

874
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:28.410
that he based uh all, or at least most

875
01:12:28.419 --> 01:12:31.850
of it on just uh a small number of

876
01:12:31.859 --> 01:12:32.839
cases?

877
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:37.169
Yeah, of course, of course. Um You could say

878
01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.310
that's, that's not true because you have many, many

879
01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:44.830
patients, hundreds of them. Um, AS far as we

880
01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:49.430
know. Uh BUT it's true that uh his theories

881
01:12:49.439 --> 01:12:55.040
are based on really a handful of cases that

882
01:12:55.049 --> 01:12:59.220
he published on the rat man, the uh the

883
01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:04.459
wolfman, et cetera, et cetera. And they basically 10

884
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:11.229
of them. Um And that's, I would say that

885
01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.759
that's fine in a way if you could be

886
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:23.040
certain that these cases were only, you know, representative

887
01:13:23.049 --> 01:13:26.620
of a much larger pool patients on which he,

888
01:13:26.979 --> 01:13:32.339
he, he based his theories. Um THAT, that's not

889
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.569
really, so that's not really the point. The point

890
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:43.589
is that that is uh no way of validate,

891
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.970
verifying what he says about even these 10 cases.

892
01:13:49.109 --> 01:13:55.180
Uh WHEN you, when you reads uh closely uh

893
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:59.279
some of these cases, uh you see that uh

894
01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:04.810
not only are they life with, you know, suggestions.

895
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:09.290
Mhm. In, in the book I, I give no,

896
01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:13.620
there's a little vignette on the little Hanson's uh

897
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.629
uh analysis by his father. And you see that,

898
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.390
you know, the poor kid was bombarded with suggestion

899
01:14:23.399 --> 01:14:26.330
all the time. Uh Do you want to kill

900
01:14:26.339 --> 01:14:29.470
your father? Oh, yes, dad. Oh, yes. Uh, DO

901
01:14:29.479 --> 01:14:32.120
you want to sleep with someone? Oh, yes, I

902
01:14:32.129 --> 01:14:34.729
would like. I would love to, I mean, this

903
01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.509
is how it, it, it worked in Freud's, uh,

904
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:47.089
office. And so the, the, the fact that, uh,

905
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.939
there are just a few, uh, uh, case histories

906
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:53.620
or many, it doesn't really matter what matters is

907
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:56.729
the way he, he, he, he got his material

908
01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.140
and the matter and the manner in which he,

909
01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:06.700
he uh his ideas uh emerged within the, the

910
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:11.100
setting of his, of his office. Uh And then

911
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:15.700
there's another point to, to be made, which is

912
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:20.600
not so much that, that there are not many

913
01:15:20.609 --> 01:15:26.359
case histories uh in influence would uh but it's

914
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.640
the fact that uh very often and we know

915
01:15:29.649 --> 01:15:36.390
that now uh very often uh he would hit

916
01:15:36.399 --> 01:15:43.270
on something uh that one patient said and then

917
01:15:43.279 --> 01:15:48.089
immediately come up with a theory which he would

918
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.520
then present as a theory applying to everyone. There's

919
01:15:52.529 --> 01:15:55.680
one example that is not in my book because

920
01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:59.220
uh uh that my book is just about ideas.

921
01:15:59.229 --> 01:16:04.700
It's not about uh his, his practice. Uh There's

922
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:10.290
one example um uh Call me that was a,

923
01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:14.919
an architect in Vienna, famous architect at the time

924
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:19.839
who uh was um uh who suffered from uh

925
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:25.990
what we call manic depression. Uh And he uh

926
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.669
in other words, suffered from what Freud at the

927
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.180
time, like many others called melancholia, deep depression, clinical

928
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:42.120
depression. And then mere was in analysis with him

929
01:16:42.529 --> 01:16:48.979
for just a few, few weeks. Um Freud, and

930
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:53.870
we know this because uh Karl Meyer's wife O

931
01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.270
Mayer had a diary in which she, she, you

932
01:16:58.279 --> 01:17:03.939
know, uh talked about this on a daily basis.

933
01:17:04.259 --> 01:17:09.459
Freud immediately came up with a theory about uh

934
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:15.580
the fact that uh nada had uh uh decided

935
01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:19.140
to, to, to, to, I would say uh to

936
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:22.310
abandon his wife as a love object or an

937
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:27.649
immediate object. And that was for Freud, the, the,

938
01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:34.319
the, the cause of, uh, his, uh melancholia because

939
01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:37.870
Freud has this idea that when you abandon a

940
01:17:37.879 --> 01:17:44.819
love object, you identify with it and then you,

941
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:49.689
uh, attack it, you, and therefore you, you feel

942
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:58.770
depressed, you feel guilty, et cetera fried rights to

943
01:17:59.779 --> 01:18:02.770
come up. Um, ON the very same day he

944
01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.770
gets this idea and said I have solved the

945
01:18:05.779 --> 01:18:12.509
problem when I call you. Mm, clearly, you know,

946
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.839
he just had this idea. He thought that this

947
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:22.040
case proved his point. And then that was the

948
01:18:22.049 --> 01:18:25.790
beginning. That was when he wrote, uh, morning and

949
01:18:25.799 --> 01:18:29.569
melancholia, which is the, the, the, the basis for

950
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.339
the psychoanalytic uh theory of, uh, of uh clinical

951
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:41.160
depression. Mhm. You know, uh, that is not how

952
01:18:41.169 --> 01:18:43.790
you're supposed to, to work. When you come up

953
01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:46.200
with a theory, you cannot base it on just

954
01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:50.520
one interpretation of one person. It does work that

955
01:18:50.529 --> 01:18:51.000
way.

956
01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.879
Right. Right. Well, I, I mean, I guess that

957
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:59.439
uh if we were talking about the contemporary scientist,

958
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:03.180
he would very much be accused of scientific and

959
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:05.359
medical malpractice,

960
01:19:05.589 --> 01:19:10.890
right? I mean, because come on. Absolutely. Absolutely. To

961
01:19:10.899 --> 01:19:14.089
his credit. Uh HE was not the only one

962
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.629
at the time. He was also, you know, a

963
01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:22.899
way of uh of doing before uh all these

964
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:29.359
guidelines, clinical guidelines, right? So he has excuses but

965
01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.220
hey, uh yes, in retrospect, you can say that

966
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:36.410
he was, yeah, a frosted.

967
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.490
Oh OK. So uh one last question then um

968
01:19:41.979 --> 01:19:45.839
how much credit do you think we can attribute

969
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:50.669
to Freud when it comes to the ideas I

970
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.799
basically popularized? Because I mean, you mentioned the fact

971
01:19:55.810 --> 01:20:00.060
that for example, in the US, at least nowadays

972
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.200
people do not teach Freud anymore in, for example,

973
01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:07.060
psychology, when you see it, it's mostly in uh

974
01:20:07.129 --> 01:20:12.709
literary uh courses or stuff like that. But uh

975
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.689
many times you still see, for example, in introduction

976
01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:21.060
to psychology courses, people feel the need to mention

977
01:20:21.069 --> 01:20:24.450
Freud there to put him there as a sort

978
01:20:24.459 --> 01:20:29.689
of important historical figure. But a as we've gone

979
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.430
through here, uh uh I I mean, thinking about

980
01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:39.350
the people he studied under the people he corresponded

981
01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:44.950
with philosophers, biologists he was influenced by, I mean,

982
01:20:44.959 --> 01:20:49.620
do, do you think that if Freud didn't exist

983
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:52.790
at all that uh the uh some of the

984
01:20:52.799 --> 01:20:56.250
ideas like for example, the fact that there are

985
01:20:56.259 --> 01:21:00.080
many things in our minds that apparently operate at

986
01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:03.930
a subconscious level. That's a big one that we

987
01:21:03.939 --> 01:21:06.729
would have missed much.

988
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:16.810
First of all, fraud and psychoanalysis uh uh historically,

989
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.750
extremely important. I mean, the 20th century was the

990
01:21:22.759 --> 01:21:26.169
Freudian century, as they say. And that is because

991
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:33.509
indeed, uh psychotherapy uh and uh at least uh

992
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.120
in some parts of the world. Uh AND at

993
01:21:36.129 --> 01:21:43.799
certain times, psychiatry was fro um and uh I'm

994
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:49.120
sorry, the battery is low, I hope. Um So

995
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:56.049
uh very quickly, um Friday is historically important. Uh

996
01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:59.939
I think that his ideas are basically rubbish or

997
01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:04.930
at least they're not validated. Uh And uh but

998
01:22:04.939 --> 01:22:09.330
they have had effects on, on people in the

999
01:22:09.339 --> 01:22:13.549
20th century. Uh I would say, for example, the,

1000
01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.720
the, the, the, the rehabilitation, if I may say

1001
01:22:17.729 --> 01:22:21.689
of homosexuality, he was not the only ones but

1002
01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.470
the fact that he came up with this frank

1003
01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.990
book idea of, you know, uh bisexuality in early

1004
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.919
childhood that allowed a lot of uh uh gay

1005
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:38.120
people to come out of the closet. So, you

1006
01:22:38.129 --> 01:22:42.520
know, it's not because it's false, that is necessarily

1007
01:22:42.879 --> 01:22:48.310
um not important that that would be my answer.

1008
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:53.649
OK. So the book is again, Freud's thinking and

1009
01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.859
introduction and I'm leaving a link to it in

1010
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:59.750
the description of the interview. And Doctor Bcia Coben,

1011
01:22:59.779 --> 01:23:03.040
would you just like to mention where people can

1012
01:23:03.049 --> 01:23:05.770
find you and your work on the internet?

1013
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:13.020
I know it's probably everywhere. No, I don't know.

1014
01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:16.640
It's, I, I don't have a website. I don't

1015
01:23:16.649 --> 01:23:20.540
do Facebook. Uh, I, I don't do that. So,

1016
01:23:20.549 --> 01:23:23.140
uh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to report. You will

1017
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:25.879
have to go to a library or a bookstore

1018
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:28.779
and get a hold of one of my books.

1019
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:32.339
Ok. So thank you so much again for taking

1020
