00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.980
Center. I'm your host, as always, Richard Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.260
today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.369
Richard Wolf. I'm leaving a link to our first

5
00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.659
interview, which was about socialism, communism, and Trump's second

6
00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.870
term. In the description of this one, and today

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.200
we're going to talk about Trump's tariffs, Elon Musk

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040
and his influence on American politics and the BRICS.

9
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.239
So, Doctor Wolf, welcome back to the to the

10
00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.959
show. It's always an honor to everyone.

11
00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.020
Thank you very much, Ricardo. I'm very glad to

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.500
be here.

13
00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.750
So, let's start with Trump's tariffs. Of course, he

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.139
has just announced uh tariffs for countries all around

15
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.060
the world. I mean, practically every country out there,

16
00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:52.830
uh, for example, he announced 25% tariffs on Canadian

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.990
and Mexican products, 20% on products coming from the

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.972
European. Union where I live, and an additional 10%

19
00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:05.852
on Chinese products, an additional 10% because it adds

20
00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:09.843
to the already existing tariffs. And I've heard many

21
00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:15.053
things, including from American political pundits. I've heard them

22
00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:18.902
saying that this is about fair trade and not.

23
00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:23.496
Exactly trade war that it is a working class

24
00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:27.805
war against the financial system because uh the objective

25
00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:31.475
Trump has in mind is to bring back manufacturing

26
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:34.795
jobs to the US and so on. So what

27
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.155
do you make of these tariffs and what will

28
00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:40.475
be their consequences?

29
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:48.080
OK, um, the basic purpose of these tariffs is

30
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.160
to make the rest of the world pay for

31
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.069
the difficulties that the American economy finds itself in

32
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.129
at this point in its history. We, we have

33
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.290
been telling ourselves here in the United States, and

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.669
I'm speaking to you from New York City, where

35
00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.169
I live and work. Uh, WE have been denying

36
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.649
to ourselves as a nation, the depth of the

37
00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.820
economic problems we have. We have been denying to

38
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.289
ourselves that the American empire created in the 20th

39
00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:26.899
century is now over and declining, as all empires

40
00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.220
eventually do. Uh, WE are going in the same

41
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.259
path that the British Empire did before us and

42
00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.600
so forth. Uh, NONE of this, however, is spoken.

43
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.169
11 is not allowed in this country to speak

44
00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.050
like that. We just had a presidential election in

45
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.029
which neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Biden nor Ms.

46
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.880
Harris ever said a word about a declining empire,

47
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.399
ever said a word about fundamental economic problems. And

48
00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.350
that means this is a country that comes late

49
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.350
to trying to solve them because it has spent

50
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.600
so much of its time denying that they're there.

51
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.449
So, when you have to catch up, you don't

52
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.729
have the time to have a conversation, to work

53
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.250
out an arrangement, to discuss, to debate, none of

54
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.029
that. We are suddenly confronted with a reality that

55
00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.309
has actually already been there. And in case people

56
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.990
are wondering, let me briefly tell you, the United

57
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.300
States lost the war in Vietnam. That was already

58
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.679
back in 1975. We lost the war. The government

59
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.710
of Vietnam became the Communist Party of North Vietnam,

60
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.199
who was the enemy of the United States, excuse

61
00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.089
me, in that war. We then lost the war

62
00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.800
in Afghanistan. The Taliban runs the Afghanistan, that was

63
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.559
the enemy the United States ostensibly was fighting. It

64
00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.630
lost the war in Iraq, and it is now

65
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.770
losing the war in Ukraine. Any empire that keeps

66
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.369
losing wars on its periphery, and remember, these were

67
00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:18.250
all wars between the United States and some of

68
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.929
the poorest countries on earth, like Afghanistan, Vietnam, and

69
00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:28.170
so, and we still lost the war, and you

70
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.440
can dance around it all you want, but these

71
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:40.140
are signs. 12. Over the last 40 years, 50

72
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.579
actually, we have lived through a radical redistribution of

73
00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:50.179
wealth from the bottom and the middle of our

74
00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.920
population to the top. If you do a study,

75
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.700
you will see that the top 10% account for

76
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.500
the entire gain in wealth over half a century.

77
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.720
That is a trauma for any society, but in

78
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.600
a country that prided itself on a big middle

79
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.309
class, on everybody enjoying a high standard of living,

80
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.149
this is double the trauma, and that's why we

81
00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:24.920
have Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump was the anger, the

82
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.589
bitterness, the, the, the rage of a Population that

83
00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.609
had been told they were Americans, and because they

84
00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:39.160
were Americans, they were entitled to the American dream

85
00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:43.640
of prosperity, more for their children than for them,

86
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.049
more even for their grandchildren. This kind of story

87
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:53.320
has been told in America by Americans, to Americans

88
00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.279
for a century. It's all over, and it's been

89
00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.899
over for a while, and now suddenly it's arrived.

90
00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.720
The anger, the bitterness has arrived, and people want

91
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.459
something to happen. And Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris

92
00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.970
promised them more of the same, and they were

93
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.890
rejected. Mr. Trump said he would fix everything overnight,

94
00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.260
and people went and hoped that that might be

95
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.380
true. In under 3 months, Mr. Trump, as the

96
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.829
new president has proved to them, is not true,

97
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.739
it's not gonna happen. But to be fair to

98
00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:44.369
Mr. Trump, he has in fact acted with the

99
00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:50.809
kind of enormity that the situation demands. So what

100
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.989
did he do? He figured out that what sells

101
00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.929
in America politically, and this has been true for

102
00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:02.170
a long time. Is any kind of argument, and

103
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.399
you have this in other countries, Europe, for example.

104
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.480
The idea is to suggest that, oh no, we

105
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.959
don't have terrible problems, but we are determined not

106
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:22.410
to permit foreigners, not Americans, to you know, cheat

107
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.299
in their dealings with us, to take away from

108
00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:29.179
us, the reason we are not able to enjoy

109
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:36.540
the American dream is the fault of outsiders, others,

110
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.209
very dangerous, kind of thing that leads to fascism.

111
00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:45.579
It's our problems are not ours. They are imposed

112
00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:51.130
on us. So suddenly you see an urgent need.

113
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.290
Think of it, we're a country that is built

114
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.489
on immigration. The original people living here were genocidally

115
00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:08.510
removed. And Europeans took their place, and one wave

116
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.589
of European immigrants after another, and then the wave

117
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:17.149
of African slaves, of course, alongside that, done by

118
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:23.940
Europeans. OK. Suddenly, we are not only no longer

119
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:31.380
accepting immigrants because our economy cannot accommodate them. We

120
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.479
are deporting. Somewhere between 2 and 10 million people

121
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:41.929
are scheduled undocumented immigrants to be deported from the

122
00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.669
United States. OK, that's an extraordinary, and how are

123
00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:52.440
they treated? They're dangerous. Mr. Trump refers to them

124
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.119
as murderers and rapists. He talks about them as

125
00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:01.359
invading the country. Look at the language. These are

126
00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:05.630
terrible evil people. Now, let me be a professional

127
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.150
economist with you for a moment. This is a

128
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:16.119
country of 330 million people. Undocumented immigrants, maybe 10

129
00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:21.059
million, maybe 12 million. It's hard to know. But

130
00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:24.109
there is no way on God's green earth that

131
00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:29.380
a poor population of 10 to 12 million explains

132
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.380
the economic difficulties of an enormity of 330 million

133
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.739
Americans. It's silly, but it worked, and it showed

134
00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:48.599
Mr. Trump blaming foreigners and punishing them. Gives the

135
00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:52.960
impression, he hopes to the mass of people that

136
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.380
this is a dramatic act, and it is a

137
00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.609
dramatic act. And the second step after expelling the

138
00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:06.090
evil immigrants, and remember, when I was growing up,

139
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.369
I, I was born in the United States, I've

140
00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:12.390
lived and worked here all my life. It used

141
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.080
to be told to us in the schools, in

142
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.719
the media, that immigrants are wonderful, immigrants are what

143
00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:24.270
made America great. Immigrants came here and worked hard

144
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.239
and all of that. So this is a a

145
00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:32.679
reversal. Everything about the current situation in America is

146
00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:36.000
a reversal of ways of thinking and ways of

147
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.239
acting. It's a measure of how desperate this country

148
00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:48.169
is. Behind all the fakery is an anxiety, a

149
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:53.369
fundamental kind of anxiety. So, Mr. Trump, seeing it

150
00:10:53.369 --> 00:11:00.130
being successful to scapegoat the immigrant, Decided, why not

151
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.570
do this on a bigger scale, Scapegoat the whole

152
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:10.890
world. Everybody's cheating us. Americans were so stupid over

153
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.739
the last 40 years that everybody could take advan.

154
00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:19.760
Yeah it takes quite a a a shaken population

155
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:25.049
to buy into this. So he's punishing everybody. You

156
00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:27.650
are going to have to pay a tax if

157
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.599
you produce something in Europe, you know, a French

158
00:11:30.599 --> 00:11:35.099
cheese and Italian wine, uh, uh, a Finnish telephone,

159
00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:40.010
whatever comes here, you're gonna have to pay a

160
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.369
tax. That's all a tariff is. It's a tax

161
00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:48.299
on imports. Nothing complicated about it. Many countries have

162
00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:51.940
had a tariff, including the United States. The United

163
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.700
States had tariffs before Mr. Trump, but what he's

164
00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.739
done is expanded because he's in a hurry, because

165
00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:05.489
the problems here are very severe. And since he's

166
00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:10.770
a billionaire, and since he's completely surrounded by and

167
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.799
controlled by the billionaires who pay for his politics,

168
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.000
he is not doing anything to change the distribution

169
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.320
of wealth and income. We have a growing population

170
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.719
of poor people and 800 billionaires in this country.

171
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.090
The gap between rich and poor, he's doing nothing

172
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.460
about that. And so my conclusion for you and

173
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.250
for the world is to understand the problem of

174
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.309
this country is its inequality. And what Mr. Trump

175
00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:51.900
is doing, tariffs included, will not change that and

176
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.840
therefore will not solve the problems of this society.

177
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.859
And that means Mr. Trump is likely to fail.

178
00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.539
The odds are overwhelming that he will fail. It

179
00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:11.020
won't bring jobs back. None of those things will

180
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.900
happen. All that we're gonna see is the rest

181
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.299
of the world gathering together, because now the whole

182
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:26.169
world has an enemy. I cannot stress this too

183
00:13:26.169 --> 00:13:31.659
much. We saw over the last 3 days, people

184
00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:34.739
who have been very having a hard time getting

185
00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:39.010
together. The Chinese, the Japanese, and the South Koreans

186
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.659
get together around how to cope with and respond

187
00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:49.400
to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Europe, where you are, which

188
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.349
has been unable to unify and has been declining

189
00:13:54.349 --> 00:13:59.109
economically because of that, may now be able to

190
00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:03.989
unify out of the enmity with the United States.

191
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.960
You know, this is extraordinary historical shift. But the

192
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.150
United States is becoming isolated. It's becoming a rogue

193
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:24.840
nation. It is the nation, everybody else is organizing

194
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.219
their policy against. And the long term consequences of

195
00:14:31.219 --> 00:14:36.570
this situation. ARE beyond what any of us can

196
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.929
imagine. The United States is not the center bringing

197
00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:44.289
democracy to the rest of the world. The United

198
00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:47.489
States is a danger. The United States is a

199
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:53.880
threat. The United States may damage your economy. Americans

200
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.380
are not gonna be able to afford Mercedes-Benz or

201
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.250
BMW cars. And the German economy, which is in

202
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.940
recession now, what will happen to it? And that

203
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.140
was the strongest economy in Europe. If I were

204
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.330
a European, And both my parents, you know, my

205
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.539
father was French and my mother German. I come

206
00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.590
out of the European tradition. I would be very

207
00:15:22.599 --> 00:15:29.020
worried. About what is going on, especially since almost

208
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.859
every European government is led by people who have

209
00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:37.820
been eager to be subservient to the United States

210
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.299
for their entire careers. These are useless people to

211
00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:46.070
deal with a change situation. The first thing you

212
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.179
need to do in Europe, with all due respect,

213
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:52.590
I'm not there now, is to get a different

214
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.309
group of leaders. You have a, a new set

215
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:59.729
of problems. You need people that are not dependent

216
00:15:59.729 --> 00:16:02.830
on the United States, who have not made their

217
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:08.150
whole career by championing the United States. This is

218
00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:13.450
a dead end. As if the conversations between Trump

219
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.929
and Putin weren't enough, you are now assaulted by

220
00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:20.650
a much more dangerous development.

221
00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:23.919
OK, but let me ask you then, would there

222
00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:27.669
be any way that tariffs would work in the

223
00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:31.710
way that Trump claims uh they would or they

224
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.429
will in the sense of, for example, when it

225
00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:39.059
comes to America bringing back manufacturing jobs to the.

226
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.510
US and other potential positive effects like that. I

227
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.869
mean, is there any way that the tariffs in

228
00:16:47.869 --> 00:16:52.989
general and perhaps some targeted tariffs targeting certain specific

229
00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:56.390
kinds of products would help in any way or

230
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:56.710
not?

231
00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:02.309
It's a very low probability. It's not 0, not

232
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:05.510
0, it's not, I'm not saying it could never

233
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.890
happen, but this is It is very strange to

234
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.409
have a policy. Let me explain. The last 10

235
00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:22.030
presidents we've had. Bushes, Clinton, Obama, all of them.

236
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:28.819
Promised when they run for office, to bring manufacturing

237
00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:34.790
back. Everyone promised it, none of them delivered it.

238
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.630
If you look at manufacturing in the United States

239
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.550
over the last 70 years, it's a line that

240
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:46.910
just goes down, right? So there's nothing new about

241
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.619
a president saying, I am going to do support

242
00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:54.949
me, vote for me, I am going to bring

243
00:17:54.949 --> 00:18:00.079
that, this is boring. I, it, it, people should

244
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.560
not believe it, you know, if a person, if,

245
00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:05.319
if a president keeps promising it and they can't

246
00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:08.319
deliver it, that means that there's something going on

247
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.640
that makes it too difficult to do. That's the

248
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.859
first problem. The second problem, and here let me

249
00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:20.530
be a professional economist. For a corporation with a

250
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.890
factory, say, in Mexico, or a factory in Africa

251
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.819
or a factory in China, for them to move

252
00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:31.209
to the United States, which is what the idea

253
00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:34.930
here is, they will come back, they use the

254
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.250
word reshoring, bring them back to our shores. This

255
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.609
is an enormous decision, costs an enormous amount of

256
00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:52.760
money. And takes years to accomplish. It took 30

257
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.199
years for American corporations starting in the 1970s to

258
00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:02.800
move their production en masse out of the United

259
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.199
States to Canada, Mexico, Europe, China, Asia, Brazil, and

260
00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:11.410
so on. It didn't happen in a year or

261
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.000
5 months or anything like that. So you're not

262
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.880
going to see a result. In any time soon,

263
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:25.880
for sure. #2. In order to make that decision,

264
00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:33.890
the corporation has to believe that the tariff will

265
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.250
stay in place. Otherwise, you would be spending an

266
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.930
enormous amount of money to move into the United

267
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:48.989
States, only to have the uh tariff removed. Then

268
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.989
you will be sorry because the wages in China

269
00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:55.640
are still lower than the United States and the

270
00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.250
profits higher. That's why they went there. So they're

271
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.880
not gonna do it, you know why? Because Mr.

272
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:08.550
Trump has shown. Already, for example, with Mexico and,

273
00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:12.550
and Canada, the two major trading partners of the

274
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.229
United States, that one day he will raise the

275
00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:17.689
tariff, the next day he will drop the tariff,

276
00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:21.880
then he will postpone the. The one thing worse

277
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.489
than a tariff is the insecurity of not knowing

278
00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:32.189
whether it will persist. So these corporations, they're not

279
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:37.050
gonna rush over here. That's ridiculous. It's too expensive,

280
00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:40.739
it takes too much time, and it's too uncertain.

281
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.810
When you put that together, Mr. Trump's plan isn't

282
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.770
going to work. If he comes here and he

283
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:55.489
wants manufacturing work, manufacturing work in this country has

284
00:20:55.489 --> 00:21:00.729
been the the least prestigious, the least accepted. Americans

285
00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:06.310
don't want factory jobs. They want office jobs. OK?

286
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:10.369
The way the manufacturing has solved that problem is

287
00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:14.530
to pay uh uh factory workers better than they

288
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:20.229
pay office workers. OK, but then they're gonna come

289
00:21:20.229 --> 00:21:23.680
spend a lot of money, shut the factories where

290
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.750
wages are low. And come here and they're going

291
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.069
to have to pay much higher wages, which means

292
00:21:32.069 --> 00:21:37.689
they're going to be Squeezing their own profits. They're

293
00:21:37.689 --> 00:21:42.589
not gonna wanna do that. And then the worst

294
00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:45.939
of it, by making an enemy of the world,

295
00:21:46.189 --> 00:21:49.880
here's what you're going to see. First of all,

296
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:55.770
powerful countries around the world will be retaliating. The

297
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.560
Chinese, for example, already did this morning. I got

298
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.329
up this morning, I looked at the media, and

299
00:22:04.329 --> 00:22:08.650
right away, the Chinese have matched the Americans by

300
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.969
raising. OK. OK, we're gonna see that Europe is

301
00:22:13.969 --> 00:22:17.290
gonna do something like that and so forth. So

302
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.680
that means the Ameri the coming back to America

303
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.489
means you'll have to pay higher wages than wherever

304
00:22:24.489 --> 00:22:28.449
you are now. And you're gonna have a harder

305
00:22:28.449 --> 00:22:32.180
time selling to the rest of the world because

306
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.569
they're retaliating with their tariffs, and they are angry

307
00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:41.719
at you. Now let me be a politician with

308
00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:46.089
you for a moment. Every country on earth has

309
00:22:46.089 --> 00:22:50.930
economic problems. But now what Mr. Trump has done

310
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:57.329
for every political leadership, no matter how corrupt. They

311
00:22:57.329 --> 00:23:00.329
can go to their people in Asia, Africa, Latin

312
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:05.689
America, Europe, anywhere, and they can blame the United

313
00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:09.369
States. Oh, our problems are because Mr. Trump has

314
00:23:09.369 --> 00:23:15.810
a tariff. Mr. Trump has a sanction. The Russian

315
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.209
people, for example, I pick Russia. Why? Because there

316
00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:23.170
are more US sanctions against Russia than against any

317
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.819
other country. But of course it permits Mr. Putin.

318
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.719
To do what I'm telling you, all politicians will

319
00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:35.760
now do. Whatever the problems Russia has, it's because

320
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.160
of the United States, and there's enough truth to

321
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.030
that argument to make it a very successful political

322
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:50.459
argument. The world is isolating the United States, turning

323
00:23:50.459 --> 00:23:54.329
against the United States. The cost of that is

324
00:23:54.329 --> 00:24:00.930
incalculable. There are organizations in Canada today that are

325
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:06.390
urging Canadians this summer not to do what they

326
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.270
have been doing for the last 100 years. Taking

327
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.109
a vacation with the family south into the United

328
00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:19.469
States. They're so angry at what their politicians are

329
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:22.910
telling them is the damage the United States is

330
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.209
doing with enough truth to it. That they're reacting.

331
00:24:27.569 --> 00:24:32.969
That's gonna cost us jobs, lots of them, maybe

332
00:24:32.969 --> 00:24:37.089
more than ever could be recouped. Only that won't

333
00:24:37.089 --> 00:24:41.810
take several years. That's already happening right now as

334
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.520
I speak to you. Tourism is falling off, the

335
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.180
numbers are already there. So these are policies which,

336
00:24:52.469 --> 00:24:59.349
taken together, are an unmitigated disaster. The only defense

337
00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:03.599
Mr. Trump could mount is to say, and here

338
00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:09.020
he would have some truth. The Democrats operate the

339
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.819
other big party in this country, Republican and Democrat.

340
00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:15.020
The Democrats operate as though we don't have a

341
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.650
problem, which is crazy. We at least face the

342
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.829
problem and are trying to do something big and

343
00:25:23.829 --> 00:25:27.439
massive to deal with it. You know, that's why

344
00:25:27.439 --> 00:25:30.719
they won the election, because they said more or

345
00:25:30.719 --> 00:25:35.160
less that, and the mass of people realized it's

346
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.760
crazy to stay with the Democrats. They have been

347
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.079
unable, supposedly the party of the working class, they

348
00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:46.280
haven't been able to preserve what the working class

349
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.699
has, let alone make it better. They The Democrats

350
00:25:51.699 --> 00:25:55.540
are the slow version of what the Republicans do

351
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.859
more quickly, and it's for the working class, it's

352
00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:06.550
all down. Last point. What most economists, conventional economists,

353
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.869
not critics like me, but conventional economists, what they're

354
00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:13.949
saying right now, what you would find today's New

355
00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:16.630
York Times or The Washington Post or any of

356
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.150
the major media here, they're worried about something even

357
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:28.160
more immediate, inflation. They're very worried that these tariffs

358
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.119
will raise the prices of many, many things in

359
00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:36.869
this country. And we already have a working class

360
00:26:36.869 --> 00:26:42.099
very upset about the last inflation under Biden, that

361
00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:46.969
hurt the standard of living here. Another one. Half

362
00:26:46.969 --> 00:26:51.160
the reason Mr. Trump was elected was anger about

363
00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.969
the last inflation. He promised to solve that problem

364
00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:59.530
like he promised everything else. If we now have

365
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.849
the inflation that most people expect, and we very

366
00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:07.290
well may have that. If we have that, then

367
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.890
you're going to see a level of resistance to

368
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.729
Mr. Trump that is going to make the New

369
00:27:13.729 --> 00:27:19.640
York, the United States headlines in every European newspaper

370
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.500
for a long time.

371
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.810
So, shifting gears a little bit here, you've already

372
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.359
mentioned earlier that Donald Trump has surrounded himself by

373
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:36.290
with uh several different billionaires, and that was very

374
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.209
clear on his inauguration day where people like Jeff

375
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:44.089
Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk were there among

376
00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:48.562
others. But talking specifically about Elon Musk. And what

377
00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:52.843
he's been doing with these so-called Department of governmental

378
00:27:52.843 --> 00:27:59.512
efficiency by targeting things like USAID targeting Social Security,

379
00:27:59.792 --> 00:28:03.593
mass firing federal employees, which is very curious because

380
00:28:03.593 --> 00:28:06.953
if we're talking about efficiency, at least if I'm

381
00:28:06.953 --> 00:28:10.432
not mistaken, the number of federal employees in the

382
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:12.855
US has remained. More or less the same for

383
00:28:12.855 --> 00:28:16.375
the past 60 years, which just means that they

384
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:20.086
have become much more efficient over time to serve,

385
00:28:20.286 --> 00:28:24.345
uh, an increasing number of people. But what, what

386
00:28:24.345 --> 00:28:28.515
do you make of, uh, Elon Musk and his

387
00:28:28.515 --> 00:28:33.916
influence on American politics and perhaps the curse of

388
00:28:33.916 --> 00:28:35.286
billionaires in the US?

389
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.540
Well, Mr. Musk, you know, would be an obscure

390
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.260
character if he weren't, you know, at the right

391
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.140
place at the right time, you know, I, I

392
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.140
am a person who feels that history makes the

393
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.380
person not the other way around, and he's been

394
00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.310
made by uh a particular act that he undertook.

395
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.859
Uh, YOU know, I don't want to take that

396
00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:06.000
away from him. He came up with the electric

397
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.359
car, uh, at a time when the level of

398
00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:13.880
pollution was so extreme, and if you remember, if

399
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.030
you know your ecology a little bit, the largest

400
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.199
single source of air pollution is the automobile. The

401
00:29:21.199 --> 00:29:27.229
automobile is a crazy institution. Uh, I, I will

402
00:29:27.229 --> 00:29:30.439
speak only now about the American situation. I don't

403
00:29:30.439 --> 00:29:31.949
know, it could be a little different in the

404
00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:34.150
rest of the world, although I don't think so.

405
00:29:34.979 --> 00:29:37.239
I have had an automobile all my life. I'm

406
00:29:37.239 --> 00:29:40.239
an American. You have to have it. It the

407
00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:43.510
way our society is organized with the suburbs, which

408
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.439
most, most people don't live in the city and

409
00:29:46.439 --> 00:29:48.079
they don't live in the country. They live in

410
00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:52.199
the suburb around the city and In order to

411
00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:54.160
move around, you have to have a car. There

412
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.239
is no public transportation. If you're lucky, there's public

413
00:29:58.239 --> 00:30:01.479
transportation into the city and back out to the

414
00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:05.310
suburb, but inside the suburbs where most people live,

415
00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:08.459
you have to have an automobile. What does the

416
00:30:08.459 --> 00:30:13.329
automobile do? It sits in the garage, or it

417
00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:16.260
sits in the driveway, or it sits on the

418
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.660
street most of the time, all night and much

419
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.290
of the day. It it is a terribly inefficient

420
00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:28.660
way to move people. That's why in urban areas

421
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.579
where it becomes even more crazy, We have subways

422
00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:37.819
and buses and all the other logical ways which

423
00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:43.329
are called mass transit here. But we tolerated it

424
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.859
until the air was starting to kill too many

425
00:30:46.859 --> 00:30:51.219
people with lung cancer and emphysema and asthma, and

426
00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:55.619
all the other consequences of air pollution. So something

427
00:30:55.619 --> 00:31:00.900
had to be done. Logically, if efficiency mattered, you

428
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.859
would go from the private gas burning car to

429
00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:12.550
mass transit. Street railway, underground railway, uh, buses, vans,

430
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.530
all of those things, cause that would be saving

431
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:21.010
on gas, saving on injury, saving on materials. I

432
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.410
mean, it would be cheaper, better in every way

433
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:29.300
except For the automobile company, because they wouldn't have

434
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:36.540
a mass market. Mr. Musk's achievement was to salvage

435
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:43.189
the private car while addressing the pollution issue, tada,

436
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.979
an automobile run on a battery, not burning oil

437
00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:53.739
and gas, but still the individual car. Historically, that's

438
00:31:53.739 --> 00:31:58.609
not an advance at all. An advance is mass

439
00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:04.459
public quality transportation, like the railroads in Europe, for

440
00:32:04.459 --> 00:32:07.939
example, and the rail system much better than the

441
00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:11.569
United States system or the Japanese, which is better,

442
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.979
or the Chinese, which is best of all. These

443
00:32:14.979 --> 00:32:18.310
things. Is it the, so he came up with

444
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.660
a way for automobile companies to be to remain

445
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.469
profitable, despite having polluted everybody, despite having killed huge

446
00:32:28.469 --> 00:32:32.390
numbers of people. Remember the scandal a few years

447
00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.829
ago. So when Volkswagen got caught cheating on the

448
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:42.589
emissions test with their device, you know, unbelievable behavior,

449
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.589
but he saved them, Mr. Trump, uh, Mr. Musk

450
00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:50.790
did. He gave them the electric car. OK, and

451
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.819
that made him very rich because he was the

452
00:32:52.819 --> 00:32:56.060
first one. Tesla, which is now, by the way,

453
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.020
going right into the toilet because it is no

454
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.560
longer the best car. Uh, THE best car is

455
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.459
made by a Chinese company called the BYD stands

456
00:33:07.459 --> 00:33:12.650
for Build Your Dream. It's a company in China.

457
00:33:12.819 --> 00:33:15.859
It now makes the best electric vehicles at the

458
00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:19.989
lowest price. The tariff in the United States by

459
00:33:19.989 --> 00:33:22.430
Mr. Biden, by the way, not by Mr. Trump.

460
00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:26.760
The tariff in the United States against BYD is

461
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.560
100%. If you buy a BYD car in the

462
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.520
United States, you pay, say, $30,000 to get the

463
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.010
car, and then you have to give another $30,000

464
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.959
100% to Washington as a tax, the tariff. So

465
00:33:43.959 --> 00:33:47.160
nobody has it. In Europe, you see BYD cars.

466
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.829
In the United States, not a one, nowhere to

467
00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:56.300
be seen. OK, this is all crazy stuff for

468
00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:02.089
Mr. Musk's benefit. What did he do? He probably

469
00:34:02.089 --> 00:34:06.729
understood that his near monopoly of electric vehicle, the

470
00:34:06.729 --> 00:34:10.649
Tesla, wouldn't survive very long. Or to say the

471
00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:14.580
same thing in another way, his best hope for

472
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:20.409
supporting his industry was to control the US government.

473
00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:25.100
And he did that by giving officially in the

474
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.668
neighborhood of $300 million 300 million dollars to Mr.

475
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.909
Trump for the election. Crystal clear to everyone in

476
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:43.030
the United States that that's why Mr. Trump won.

477
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.289
He had this enormous pool, all right? What else

478
00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:53.090
does Mr. Musk do? He is in charge of

479
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:58.500
what I would call Political theater. Much of what

480
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:04.179
Mr. Trump does is political theater. All of what

481
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:09.939
Mr. Musk does is political theater. It's captured in

482
00:35:09.939 --> 00:35:15.090
the following uh video, which has gone viral in

483
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.979
the United States. Mr. Musk is seen on a

484
00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:25.290
platform holding a chainsaw. And saying that's what I'm

485
00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:30.300
using to clean out the government. Now let me

486
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.979
explain a little bit about what you hinted at

487
00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:39.679
before. In the United States, the federal government employs

488
00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:45.149
roughly 5 million people. Half of them are military,

489
00:35:45.399 --> 00:35:48.159
the army, the navy, all of that. I'm putting

490
00:35:48.159 --> 00:35:53.120
that aside. The other half is the civilian labor

491
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.040
force employed by the United States government, 2.5 million.

492
00:36:00.129 --> 00:36:04.330
If you wanted to bring efficiency to government in

493
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:09.830
the United States, you would begin by saying, Where

494
00:36:09.879 --> 00:36:14.780
are the government employees? Because government in this country

495
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.350
operates at 3 levels, federal, state, and local. State

496
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.389
governments, that's in all of our 50 states, each

497
00:36:25.389 --> 00:36:30.110
one has a state government. Total civilian employees of

498
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:35.939
state government in this country, 5 million. Double the

499
00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:40.260
number of civilian employees of the federal government. And

500
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.300
then we get to cities and towns, what's called

501
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:50.959
local or municipal government. The employees there, 15 million.

502
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.610
So if you put the local and the state

503
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:58.350
together, it's 20 million public employees. If you put

504
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.629
the federal civilian, it's 2.5, 10 to 1. If

505
00:37:02.629 --> 00:37:06.709
you wanted to do efficiency, you'd go to the

506
00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:10.510
local and the state, because that's the bulk of

507
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:16.139
our public employees. You didn't. He didn't because he

508
00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:20.840
can't. Too much opposition, can't control it. So we

509
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.219
make a theater of the 2.5 million at the

510
00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:27.949
federal, but I'm not done, not at all, not

511
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:35.479
even close. How do you do efficiency? Everybody, including

512
00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:40.939
Mr. Musk. Has tried to get more efficiency in

513
00:37:40.939 --> 00:37:46.100
his bureaucracy. All bureaucracies know that and do that.

514
00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:54.310
There are many specialized firms who do efficiency analysis.

515
00:37:54.899 --> 00:37:57.510
And you hire them, they come and they look

516
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.379
at your processes, they study your workers and how

517
00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:04.909
they work and how they interact with machines, how

518
00:38:04.909 --> 00:38:08.429
they interact with one another, how the hierarchy of

519
00:38:08.429 --> 00:38:11.260
levels works, and then they give you a set.

520
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.639
OF suggestions. Here's you could fire these people, you

521
00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:20.040
could rearrange this over here. That's how you do

522
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.979
it. But they're not doing that. They're just firing,

523
00:38:25.209 --> 00:38:29.189
you know, 10s of thousands at a time. That's

524
00:38:29.189 --> 00:38:33.310
not an efficiency, that's theater. That's not gonna make

525
00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.479
it more efficient. The chaos is already here. That's

526
00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:42.449
why we have hundreds of lawsuits now by workers

527
00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:46.969
and agencies that have been destroyed by this behavior

528
00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:52.389
and are going into court arguing it's unconstitutional, that

529
00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:55.290
the law passed says you must be doing this

530
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:58.179
in the country. They can't do it because you

531
00:38:58.179 --> 00:39:01.889
fired half the people who would be responsible and

532
00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.850
And we don't know how the courts are going

533
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.489
to act, and we don't know how the government

534
00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:09.610
is going to react when the courts act. All

535
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:14.570
of that is bringing more chaos into the United

536
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.810
States than we already have, but I'm still not

537
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:23.439
done. In the 1960s, we had 2.5 million people,

538
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.969
the civilian labor force of the government. Here we

539
00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:30.850
are in 2025, we have 2.5 million people, is

540
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.560
the civilian labor force of the government. Meanwhile, the

541
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.429
population of the United States grew by 100 million

542
00:39:39.429 --> 00:39:45.350
people from 1960 to now. So the same 2.5

543
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:50.729
million. ARE servicing at the federal level, a much

544
00:39:50.729 --> 00:39:55.159
larger population, and as you rightly said, that's what

545
00:39:55.159 --> 00:40:00.520
the word efficiency means. So these people would be

546
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.159
the last ones you pick to attack. There might

547
00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:07.590
be efficiencies you could get there. They usually are.

548
00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:14.250
But there They're the target? That's ridiculous. That's almost

549
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:19.689
insane. Ah, but it's not about efficiency, is it?

550
00:40:19.889 --> 00:40:24.939
Efficiency is the language. Here's the purpose. And very

551
00:40:24.939 --> 00:40:28.780
important for those who don't know America's economic dilemma.

552
00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:35.750
The only major achievement of Mr. Trump's first presidency

553
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.600
was the tax cut he gave to corporations and

554
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:45.709
business in December of 2017, right, eight years ago.

555
00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:51.699
That legislation that gave them huge tax cuts, which

556
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:54.459
by the way, they did not need because of

557
00:40:54.459 --> 00:40:58.300
the redistribution of wealth they had benefited from in

558
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.239
the preceding 30 years. Giving them a tax cut

559
00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:06.320
then was ridiculous. They didn't need it. It was

560
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.679
just for his political popularity, gave them a big

561
00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:14.820
tax cut. Into the law, giving them the tax

562
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.139
cut was a provision that these tax cuts would

563
00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:25.500
expire in the year 2025, 8 years into the

564
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:31.010
future. Well, that's now. His problem is Mr. Trump

565
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:37.290
political. If he doesn't do something, that law will

566
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.770
expire this year, and then all the tax cuts

567
00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:45.330
that business and the rich got go away, and

568
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.489
they will be faced with a big increase as

569
00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:52.199
they go back to the taxes as they were

570
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:57.669
before 2018. He doesn't want that. He wants to

571
00:41:57.669 --> 00:42:02.060
pass laws this year that extend those tax cuts.

572
00:42:02.889 --> 00:42:09.189
Indefinitely forever. But if he does that, And if

573
00:42:09.189 --> 00:42:14.550
he has to keep spending money for all the

574
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:20.469
social programs and for all the wars, remember, we

575
00:42:20.469 --> 00:42:24.979
in America bankroll the war in Ukraine. That war

576
00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:28.739
would have been over many, many, many months ago

577
00:42:28.949 --> 00:42:32.649
if it weren't the United States spending money. Europe

578
00:42:32.649 --> 00:42:36.149
spends also, but the United States is a major

579
00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:41.370
funder. A major provider of weapons, a major provider

580
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.729
of personnel who have been involved with the Ukrainian

581
00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:49.530
army for a long time. We also fund the

582
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:54.669
Israeli activity in Gaza and in the West Bank.

583
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:59.169
So we have and we maintain an immense military.

584
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:04.629
We maintain 700 bases around the world, military base,

585
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.969
with an enormous military budget. About about $1 trillion

586
00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:15.629
a year, huge, unimaginable amount of money. So to

587
00:43:15.629 --> 00:43:20.959
keep spending money like that. You are going to

588
00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:25.449
have to what? If you're gonna maintain the tax

589
00:43:25.449 --> 00:43:28.360
cut for the rich. The only thing you can

590
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.629
do is what we've been doing, borrowing money. That's

591
00:43:32.629 --> 00:43:34.629
the only way to solve the problem. And of

592
00:43:34.629 --> 00:43:38.020
course, who do you borrow from? You borrow from

593
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.790
the rich and the corporations who, because they didn't

594
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.750
have to pay taxes, have the money to lend

595
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.429
to the government, which they do because lending to

596
00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:50.510
the government is a lot better than being taxed.

597
00:43:50.949 --> 00:43:53.629
Because the government gives you that money back after

598
00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:56.870
a few years and pays you interest while you

599
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.030
wait. What rich person wouldn't rather lend to the

600
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.729
government than have the government tax them? We have

601
00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:08.370
a government buy of and for the rich. So

602
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.870
here's how he's going to avoid having to borrow

603
00:44:12.129 --> 00:44:15.610
as much as we have been, by savaging the

604
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:20.800
federal budget, by not just firing all those workers,

605
00:44:21.129 --> 00:44:25.379
but not allowing them to spend money to support

606
00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:30.820
hospitals, schools, and all the And I, I want

607
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.860
you to understand, the United States is now on

608
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:41.209
a trajectory. To do everything to maintain the billionaires

609
00:44:41.209 --> 00:44:44.889
and the whole top 10% of our people, and

610
00:44:44.889 --> 00:44:51.959
to let the other 90% sink into ever deeper

611
00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:58.300
poverty. We are becoming the kind of third world

612
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.780
economy we used to watch on television that is

613
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.649
coming home, and I don't think that will survive.

614
00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:12.034
I think you're going to see Social upheaval, conflict,

615
00:45:12.445 --> 00:45:16.245
violence in this country in a way that will

616
00:45:16.245 --> 00:45:22.165
be as astonishing as watching Mr. Trump put tariffs

617
00:45:22.165 --> 00:45:24.034
on every country on earth.

618
00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:29.050
So let me ask you now about another very

619
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:35.040
important member or element in our geopolitical system. Uh,

620
00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.290
LET me ask you about the BRICS and for

621
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.489
people who might not be aware of it, the

622
00:45:39.489 --> 00:45:43.729
acronym stands for the countries who originally created this

623
00:45:43.729 --> 00:45:48.239
alliance, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa,

624
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:52.840
and now other countries like Iran, Egypt, Egypt, Ethiopia,

625
00:45:52.929 --> 00:45:56.250
and the UAE have joined them. Uh, HOW much

626
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.929
influence do the BRICS have or could have on

627
00:45:59.929 --> 00:46:04.290
the world? And can they compete particularly through the

628
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:09.689
alternative institutions, payment systems, and so on and so

629
00:46:09.689 --> 00:46:12.760
on that they are developing, could they compete with

630
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.729
the US and the West?

631
00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:19.459
I think they already do. I mean, they have

632
00:46:19.459 --> 00:46:22.399
an enormous potential. I won't talk about that. I,

633
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.139
I can't predict the future, but let me talk

634
00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:29.260
simply about what they are now. Uh, THOSE 5

635
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:35.280
countries have now added to themselves another 15 more,

636
00:46:35.629 --> 00:46:38.810
or maybe a bit more, 16 more. The most

637
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.370
recent uh few weeks ago, Indonesia, which people should

638
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.050
understand is one of the largest countries on this

639
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.870
planet. Indonesia, the most recent to join them. Uh

640
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:54.500
To give you an idea of how important they

641
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.610
are. Uh, THE core economy for the BRICS is

642
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.610
China. It is more important than the rest of

643
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:08.159
them, uh, combined. Uh, BECAUSE it has, it, it

644
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:12.020
is such an explosive story of economic growth in

645
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.399
the last 40 years that China is simply is

646
00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:18.879
in a class by itself. But it is very

647
00:47:18.879 --> 00:47:23.949
careful to build this alliance. It is particularly close

648
00:47:23.949 --> 00:47:26.689
to Russia, and that has been true for some

649
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:29.909
years, but became much stronger because of the Ukraine

650
00:47:29.909 --> 00:47:34.010
war for all kinds of reasons. And here's a

651
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:38.500
statistic that will make you recognize the importance. You

652
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.169
can make a study. It's the kind of thing

653
00:47:41.169 --> 00:47:45.500
we do in economics. You can ask what, how

654
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.820
big is an economy, and the number we use

655
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.550
a statistic we look at is called the GDP

656
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:55.979
gross domestic product. It's a rough measure of the

657
00:47:55.979 --> 00:47:59.139
total output of goods and services in a year,

658
00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:02.909
in in a 12 month period. And we say

659
00:48:02.909 --> 00:48:06.419
the GDP of a country is X gives you

660
00:48:06.419 --> 00:48:09.709
a rough idea of how big it is. Well,

661
00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:13.550
I'm gonna add up the GDPs of the United

662
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:18.429
States and the other members of the G7, the

663
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:22.580
group of seven. So that's the United States. Uh,

664
00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:30.669
Canada. France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Britain, and Japan. That's

665
00:48:30.669 --> 00:48:38.189
the G7. That is the old dominant power in

666
00:48:38.189 --> 00:48:43.270
the world economy. Grouped around the United States. If

667
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.260
you add up their GDPs, it works out to

668
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:52.189
about 28% of total output in the world, the,

669
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:57.340
the global GDP. So, this group of seven countries

670
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:03.729
accounts for 28% of total output. Now let me

671
00:49:03.729 --> 00:49:09.520
turn to China and the BRICS. The new member

672
00:49:09.929 --> 00:49:14.889
of a very small club, superpowers in the world

673
00:49:14.889 --> 00:49:18.639
economy. If you add up the GDP of China

674
00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:22.040
and the other members of the BRICS, it's about

675
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:29.780
35% of the global GDP. In other words, the

676
00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.830
BRICS has not only caught up. To the G7,

677
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.439
it has surpassed. By the way, it caught up

678
00:49:37.439 --> 00:49:41.310
in the year 2020, and the gap between them

679
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.360
has gotten only bigger and bigger every one of

680
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:50.080
the last five years. Why? Because those countries led

681
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:56.330
by China. ARE growing faster than the G7. Let

682
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.570
me give you the example of the last year,

683
00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:02.219
2024. I could have picked any year, but I

684
00:50:02.219 --> 00:50:07.139
know the numbers. So for 2024, the fastest growing

685
00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:13.199
economy in the G7. Was the United States 2.8%.

686
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:18.040
There were other members of the of the G7

687
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.729
that did grew less than nothing. They shrank. The

688
00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:27.500
Germans had a recession. Their GDP got smaller, not

689
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.709
only didn't grow, but got smaller. All right, now

690
00:50:30.709 --> 00:50:36.929
what was the Chinese GDP growth in 2024? 5%,

691
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.290
double that of the United States. India's GDP grew

692
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:49.429
at 7%, almost triple. I mean, it is extraordinary.

693
00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:53.850
And that is typical. It's typical for China for

694
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.560
the last 25 years. It hasn't been going on

695
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.800
that long in India, but that's not the point.

696
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.610
The point is the gap is getting wider because

697
00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:07.719
that is now a big part of the world

698
00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:11.600
and very successful. Here's what it means just to

699
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.949
give you an idea. Any government in Asia, Africa,

700
00:51:17.239 --> 00:51:21.320
Latin America, Eastern Europe, that's, that's trying to solve

701
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.929
an economic problem, sell more of what it produces,

702
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.199
buy better inputs for what it produces, uh, get

703
00:51:29.199 --> 00:51:32.479
money, uh, to build a railroad to improve its

704
00:51:32.479 --> 00:51:36.689
education system. TO provide health care for those people

705
00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:40.250
used to go to London or Washington to try

706
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.290
to get help or investment. They still do. They

707
00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.209
go to London, they go to Washington. But after

708
00:51:46.209 --> 00:51:48.590
that, they don't go home. They go to Beijing,

709
00:51:48.729 --> 00:51:51.889
New Delhi, and Sao Paulo, and they ask for

710
00:51:51.889 --> 00:51:55.389
the same help. And what often happens is they

711
00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:58.760
get a better deal from the Chinese than what

712
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.790
they can get from the Americans. So for example,

713
00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:04.469
if you went to Africa now and you asked,

714
00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:09.350
who's building railroads here, the answer is China, all

715
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:13.439
over Africa, China is building a railroad, cause they

716
00:52:13.439 --> 00:52:16.919
will do it. They have the wealth, they have

717
00:52:16.919 --> 00:52:20.689
all the technical, they can offer a better deal,

718
00:52:20.959 --> 00:52:26.110
and that's happening. Step by step, project by project,

719
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.600
country by country, the BRICS and China are now

720
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:37.629
the economic superpower, not only equal to, but bigger

721
00:52:37.629 --> 00:52:40.949
than the United States. And that takes us back

722
00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:47.090
to the beginning of our conversation. The Americans watch

723
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.810
it, they see it, they know these numbers better

724
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.729
than I do, and that's where you get the

725
00:52:53.729 --> 00:52:59.209
sense we have to do something enormous, massive, to

726
00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:03.159
hold on to the position of the United States.

727
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:08.469
Even though they fear, and in their hearts, many

728
00:53:08.469 --> 00:53:13.060
of them know they can't do it. They are

729
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.219
no more able to stop the historical change than

730
00:53:17.219 --> 00:53:22.149
Britain was able to stop being watching its empire

731
00:53:22.149 --> 00:53:26.729
fall apart and watching the United States replace them

732
00:53:26.939 --> 00:53:32.010
on the global scene. Empires come and they go.

733
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.739
Every one of them came and went. The United

734
00:53:37.739 --> 00:53:41.929
States is at the moment of when, and look,

735
00:53:42.909 --> 00:53:46.350
As an American, I'm sad about it. I really

736
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.459
am. The United States is going through a very

737
00:53:50.459 --> 00:53:54.909
hard time. And there's a rule when empires go

738
00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:58.709
down. When they do, the people who are the

739
00:53:58.709 --> 00:54:02.139
richest and the most powerful are in the best

740
00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:06.350
position to hold on for the longest time, and

741
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:10.070
that's what they do. They hold on even as

742
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:13.919
the empire declines. And you know what that means?

743
00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:18.280
That all of the suffering, all of the costs

744
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.120
of a declining empire are pushed onto the middle

745
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:26.770
and the poor who suffer that decline, because they're

746
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:31.419
not in the position to hold on. Mr. Trump

747
00:54:31.419 --> 00:54:35.649
is the president of those holding on.

748
00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:40.020
So, let me ask you then one final question.

749
00:54:40.479 --> 00:54:44.590
During our conversation, you've mentioned several times the collapse

750
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:48.159
of the US Empire. And since I live in

751
00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:51.310
Portugal, which is part of the European Union, I

752
00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:54.679
would like to ask you a question about Europe

753
00:54:54.679 --> 00:54:59.070
itself. So looking at our current position in the

754
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:03.949
geopolitical system and also taking into account that our

755
00:55:03.949 --> 00:55:08.750
relationship with The US is deteriorating and even apart

756
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.469
from the tariffs, we also have the fact that

757
00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:15.229
under Trump, at least it appears that uh the

758
00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:18.629
US is no longer very willing to provide us

759
00:55:18.629 --> 00:55:23.629
with uh military support if needed, and the rise

760
00:55:23.629 --> 00:55:26.590
of the BRICS also. Uh, HOW do you look

761
00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:31.070
at our place in the modern world and how

762
00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.149
should we look at our future?

763
00:55:34.439 --> 00:55:37.090
I think that, first of all, I think what

764
00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:42.129
has happened to Europe. It is historical in the

765
00:55:42.129 --> 00:55:45.570
deepest sense of that word. For much of the

766
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:52.040
last 2000 years, the events of Europe were understood,

767
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.010
at least by the people in Europe, as being

768
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:59.090
the world. You know, we trace our civilization back

769
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.739
to Greece and Rome. We think about the medieval

770
00:56:02.739 --> 00:56:06.969
time, the, the whole dominance of the feudal model,

771
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.899
uh, in Europe, the emergence of the Renaissance and

772
00:56:10.899 --> 00:56:16.675
all the artistic and creative explosion. THE transition from

773
00:56:16.675 --> 00:56:20.905
feudalism to capitalism and then Europe developing so it

774
00:56:20.905 --> 00:56:24.625
can control the whole world in the colonial period,

775
00:56:24.784 --> 00:56:28.625
where Portugal participated for sure. As we know, that's

776
00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:33.215
why people in Brazil speak, speak the Portuguese language

777
00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:36.330
and so on. So Europe is, you know, and

778
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.530
then Europe has the two world wars. Look at

779
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:42.570
the very name. Even though it's mostly Europe, it's

780
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.969
a world because Europe was the now Europe is

781
00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:51.550
becoming a minor secondary player. We just talked about

782
00:56:51.689 --> 00:56:55.979
the G7 and the BRICS. Well, that don't include,

783
00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:59.419
you know, much for Europe. Europe, in that story,

784
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:04.500
is a junior partner of the United States, completely

785
00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.719
dominated and overwhelmed by the United States. Look at

786
00:57:09.719 --> 00:57:15.110
the, the way people Starmer in Britain, uh Macron

787
00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:20.760
in France, uh Mertz in Germany, uh, the woman

788
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.560
in Italy, Maloney. They are all people who defer

789
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:28.149
to the United States, who copy the United States,

790
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:34.010
who integrate their military, their intelligence services. My God!

791
00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.719
All you're discovering now is you're in the terrible

792
00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:43.139
situation when the the entity to which you have

793
00:57:43.139 --> 00:57:49.830
linked your history, the United States. Can't afford to

794
00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:53.449
work with you anymore, and thinks it has to

795
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:59.320
scavenge you. To cannibalize you. That's what they're doing.

796
00:57:59.399 --> 00:58:03.399
They want to squeeze wealth out of Europe and

797
00:58:03.399 --> 00:58:07.639
move it to the United States. Germany is permitting

798
00:58:07.639 --> 00:58:12.919
it. Germany allowed the rupture of getting cheap energy

799
00:58:12.919 --> 00:58:17.320
from Russia, which was central to its important economic

800
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.889
power. They gave it up. And now they're buying

801
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:26.780
expensive energy from the United States while the industrialists

802
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:32.739
there move their production to the United States. That's

803
00:58:32.739 --> 00:58:36.050
I mean it's beyond words what you're doing here.

804
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:41.889
But you are faced with a terrible dilemma. You

805
00:58:41.889 --> 00:58:45.310
either break with the United States and take your

806
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:51.239
chances. Or you're going to be taken down by

807
00:58:51.239 --> 00:58:55.310
the United States, by the policy in in Ukraine,

808
00:58:55.479 --> 00:58:58.840
by the policy of sanctioning Russia, by the policy

809
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.510
of selling expensive energy, and now by the policy

810
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.469
of tariffs on top of all of that. I

811
00:59:05.469 --> 00:59:09.360
mean, can't you see the writing on the wall?

812
00:59:10.209 --> 00:59:14.429
We can, I, it's crystal clear. At our highest

813
00:59:14.429 --> 00:59:20.070
level, our politicians speak a disrespect for Europe that

814
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:25.550
ought to make your hair stand up. Mr. Rubio

815
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:30.459
at the State Department, Mr. Musk. Mr. Headste our

816
00:59:30.459 --> 00:59:35.239
uh defense minister, Mr. Vance, the vice president, each

817
00:59:35.239 --> 00:59:40.709
of them talks, use phrases like I loathe Europe.

818
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:47.340
What? What? Remember, these are people who descend from

819
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.580
Europeans who came to the United States, all of

820
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.219
them. So it's rejecting their own ancestors, rejecting the

821
00:59:55.219 --> 00:59:59.540
European culture, rejecting the fact that they speak English,

822
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.739
which is coming from over there, and on and

823
01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:07.800
on and on. You're a better Europe has to

824
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.739
unify. It, it has been unable to do it,

825
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:13.110
and if it doesn't do it, here's what I

826
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.110
will tell you. The United States will find among

827
01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:22.459
the European countries, those countries who will betray Europe

828
01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:26.149
to cut a special deal with the United States.

829
01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:30.780
He'll sit down with every government, any government. Portugal

830
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.659
too, especially cause you don't have the government you

831
01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:38.379
had from 2016 afterwards, you don't have the, the

832
01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:41.419
left in power the way you did. So they'll

833
01:00:41.419 --> 01:00:43.320
come and they will make a deal. They'll look

834
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.719
around, who can we buy. And they'll buy one

835
01:00:46.719 --> 01:00:49.350
and give them a benefit if they betray the

836
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:55.540
others. It's classic, it's what big powers do. Look,

837
01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:58.459
for a while, it was very helpful to Europe.

838
01:00:58.709 --> 01:01:01.469
You didn't have to have your own military. The

839
01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:03.909
US would take care of it. That allowed you

840
01:01:03.909 --> 01:01:06.389
to let your rich people be rich and still

841
01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:10.189
have enough money to provide social programs for your

842
01:01:10.189 --> 01:01:13.659
people, much better than the American working class, Scott.

843
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.110
Very, but that's not available anymore. The United States

844
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.800
can't do that, can't afford it anymore. Not because

845
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.399
we don't have the wealth that we have, but

846
01:01:26.399 --> 01:01:29.510
we have distributed the wealth in such a way

847
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:34.080
that the billionaires hold on to theirs. And the

848
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.030
rest of the working class is furious, so nobody

849
01:01:38.199 --> 01:01:42.429
is ready to do anything other than rip Europe

850
01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:48.510
off. That's the game. Make you go down in

851
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:53.020
order to hold on a little longer here. Meanwhile,

852
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.989
China and the BRICS outgrows us all.

853
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.899
Right. So, Doctor Wolf, we've unfortunately reached our time

854
01:02:02.899 --> 01:02:05.959
limit. It's always very fascinating to talk with you.

855
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.300
Uh, I will be leaving links in the description

856
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:13.060
to democracy at work, your YouTube channel, your books

857
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.530
like Understanding Capitalism and so on, which are very

858
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.739
fascinating. And thank you so much for taking the

859
01:02:19.739 --> 01:02:22.179
time to come on the show again. It's always

860
01:02:22.179 --> 01:02:23.409
an honor to everyone.

861
01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.820
Thank you very much. I, I don't mean to

862
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.120
depress people. But you know, one of the benefits

863
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.659
of living in interesting times is that they are

864
01:02:32.659 --> 01:02:38.830
very exciting, and there's a certain positivity and understanding

865
01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:42.870
what's going on. Yes. Thank you.
