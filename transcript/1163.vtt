00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.090
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.569
today I'm joined by Doctor Herman Ponzer. He's professor

4
00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.890
of evolutionary Anthropology and Global Health at the Global

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.809
Health Institute at Duke University. And today we're talking

6
00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:21.129
about his book Adaptable, How Your Unique Body really

7
00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:25.290
Works and why our Biology unites us. So, Doctor

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.569
Ponzer, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

9
00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.850
everyone.

10
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.090
Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.430
So in the book you talk a lot about

12
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.990
biological diversity, specifically in humans and where it stems

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.680
from. So, uh, tell us first about that. Where

14
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
does biological diversity in humans stem from and why

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080
do you think it is important to consider it?

16
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.119
Yeah. So, uh, you know, it's the standard nature

17
00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.110
and nurture, uh, story, but I think it's one

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.759
that we don't tell in the right way. And

19
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.240
we kind of, you know, sort of don't, don't

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.279
do it well. And so, uh, you know, the

21
00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:05.239
reason that we're all unique biologically, uh, is that,

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.879
first of all, we've all got our own unique

23
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.279
set of, of genes. So, there are about 20,000

24
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.800
protein coding genes and there's a lot of thousands

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.669
of others that regulate, turn those genes on and

26
00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:19.440
off. And, you know, in any population, there might

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.330
be 4 or 5 versions of each of those,

28
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.330
you know, 20, 30,000 genes. And so the chance

29
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.089
that you have exactly the same set of variants

30
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.410
that I do is basically zero unless we're identical

31
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.970
twins. And then even if we were identical twins,

32
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.010
that's where the, the, where the nurture comes in,

33
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.489
the environment comes in. As we grow up and

34
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:42.050
grow old, um, our life, you know, actually turn,

35
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.160
turns on and off some of those genes that

36
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.660
don't all expressed the same way. Um, OUR bodies,

37
00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.599
even if we had the same kind of genetic

38
00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.959
pathways activated, we're built to learn and we're built

39
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.019
to adapt to our environments as we grow up.

40
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.639
And so, you know, very quickly after birth, uh,

41
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.279
you know, even two identical twins would have, you

42
00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.239
know, slightly different biologies and, and by the time

43
00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.239
they're 4 or 5 years old, it's, it's, it's

44
00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.639
significant. So, um, the genetics and the environment, no,

45
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.720
no two sets are alike, and that, you know,

46
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.699
that ends up making us biologically unique.

47
00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.880
Yeah, and I'm going to ask you about uh

48
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.589
twins and twin studies later in our conversation, but

49
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.839
I mean, how much, uh, because when we talk

50
00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:29.279
about bio bio biological variation in humans, many times

51
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:34.419
people Immediately bring to the table variation between human

52
00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:39.309
populations. So how much biological variation is there really

53
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.080
between any two human populations? Is it, is there

54
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.500
really a lot of variation or not?

55
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.990
Uh, THERE'S some, but in every case, uh, the

56
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.630
difference is smaller between the averages. THAN it is

57
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.460
between any two people. And so, one thing that

58
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.789
we teach a lot in my, you know, in

59
00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:01.830
anthropology is that, uh, something like 90% plus of

60
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.690
the genetic variation that we see across the human

61
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.949
human species is within, within groups, right? And the

62
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.059
other 10% is sort of between groups. And so,

63
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.990
if you think about the sort of bell-shaped distributions

64
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.750
of genetics, you can think about it that way

65
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.059
as kind of a heuristic. Those, the meat, the,

66
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.520
the Means can be a little bit different, but

67
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.199
there's so much overlap, right? That if I had

68
00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.600
to pick two individuals from any one group, I'm

69
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.479
just as likely to get as much genetic difference

70
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.070
as I am, the difference between averages of between

71
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.360
two groups. Yeah.

72
00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.899
So with that in mind, and of course I

73
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:39.270
have to address this issue because you're very well

74
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.509
aware that even nowadays people use these terms and

75
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.869
there are people who still do or try to

76
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:50.270
do race science. So is race a good enough

77
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.490
proxy for biological diversity? I mean, is it even

78
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.369
a scientific concept?

79
00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.800
Yeah, yeah, it's terrible, right? I mean, the, the

80
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.070
one of the reasons I wrote this book is

81
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.720
that the way that we think about genetic diversity

82
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.160
or biological diversity in the US anyway, and I

83
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.869
think this is becoming more and more global, is

84
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.479
we think about it in terms of, of race

85
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.600
categories, right? That somehow, if I know that, you

86
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.199
know, in America, it's black, white, Hispanic, we have

87
00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.858
these, these, these blocks of racial categories. Um, THEY,

88
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.459
they're basically useless, right? Now, people say, well, but

89
00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.899
the skin color is different, right? Between your black

90
00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.220
and white people, for example. Well, that's true. In,

91
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.619
in that one, in that one, trait, you can

92
00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:34.489
see differences on average between groups. Not always, by

93
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:36.059
the way, but you can see differences in, in

94
00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.149
like one trait or another trait. That doesn't mean

95
00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:42.100
that genetically, these whole groups are different or that

96
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.630
they're even coherent groups, right? That, so, there's so

97
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.700
much variation within what we call in the, in

98
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.750
the United States, what we would call white and

99
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.790
what we would call black, that it, it's a

100
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.790
meaningless category. It has no edges biologically to make

101
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.910
any sense. It's a socially constructed category. Uh, AND

102
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.010
so, right, the, the way that we talk about

103
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.059
variation biologically is just nonsensical in the US. It's

104
00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.350
one of the reasons I wanted to get this

105
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.470
book, uh, out there.

106
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.170
Yeah, uh, one very interesting thing that you talk

107
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.130
about in the book that I was sort of,

108
00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.970
uh, not expecting it, and it's interesting because, because

109
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.929
it also ties to some very current, uh, political

110
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.369
issues in the US actually. So, uh, I mean.

111
00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:32.390
During intrauterine development, when does life start exactly? I

112
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.029
mean, from the moment of fertilization, when exactly in

113
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.589
our intrauterine development can we say that life has

114
00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:42.089
started?

115
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.059
Yeah, well, I'm glad you asked the question. Uh,

116
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:47.549
YOU know, the, as I wrote this book, um,

117
00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.540
I wanted people to understand how our bodies work,

118
00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.739
and that's the foundation of how we get to,

119
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.160
to biological variation, and all these big topics. And

120
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.880
I, I formatted the book the way that I

121
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.049
would teach this class, you know, we would take,

122
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.519
if we wanna understand the human body, we'd start

123
00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.519
at the very beginning, we work our way all

124
00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:06.200
the way through. Um, AND as I was writing

125
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.320
these chapters, I realized, OK, we're not gonna be

126
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.119
able to talk about the body and then talk

127
00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.559
about the politics. We're gonna have to talk about

128
00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:15.640
the politics every chapter because everything, you know, whether

129
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.799
it, whether it's brains, whether it's immune systems, whether

130
00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:20.660
it's the heart, whether it's digestive, whether it's embryology.

131
00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:26.279
Every piece of our body carries a socio-political debate

132
00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.160
right now. Um, I don't know if it's always

133
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.100
been that way, but it certainly is these days.

134
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.480
Uh, AND so the embryology story, I think, is

135
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.109
a great way to start. Um, IN the, in

136
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:38.220
the US anyway, there's a lot of, of debate

137
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.230
and, and conflict about, you know, this idea of

138
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.029
when does life begin? Does it begin at the

139
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.040
fertilization of an egg? Does it begin later? And,

140
00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:48.070
you know, one of the points I make in

141
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.899
the book is this, this, it's There's really not,

142
00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:55.040
we, we talk about it as when does life

143
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.049
begin. That doesn't get it quite right because life

144
00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:01.529
is some billions of years old on this planet.

145
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.450
Each of us, every animal, every organism alive today

146
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.410
is a, a part of that unbroken chain of

147
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.049
life that's billions of years old. So when does

148
00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:12.480
life begin? Well, you're a little bit late because

149
00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:16.119
life has started billions of years ago. Yeah. But,

150
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.480
of course, that's not what people are really asking.

151
00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:20.119
What people are really asking is, when does this

152
00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:24.179
clump of cells become a person? Right? And then

153
00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:26.019
that's a much more complicated question because that's no

154
00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:29.660
longer a bio a biology question, right? That's, if

155
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.739
we ask what's a person, then that's um an

156
00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:39.640
ethical, religious, political question. Um, AND those are important,

157
00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:41.420
but to talk about it as though it's a

158
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.200
clean-cut biology question is, is actually not right. Um,

159
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.500
NOW, we can get to the question of when

160
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.329
is it you, when do you become a person,

161
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.839
right? Um, WELL, OK, if If, for example, we

162
00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.760
want to say that uh you are a person

163
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.720
as soon as the egg is fertilized. Well, that's

164
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.350
interesting because the egg, by that point is already

165
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.890
as old as mom is because eggs form in

166
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.929
her embryology, right, when she was in utero, and

167
00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:11.829
the sperm is much more young. So, is that

168
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.410
individual as old as mom or is it as

169
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.609
old as that moment when the fertilization happens? If

170
00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:21.410
personhood happens at fertilization and we start then and

171
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.450
go the clock forward, then when does personhood, does

172
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.679
that fertilized egg to people, if somehow in the

173
00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:33.190
future it's gonna become twins? Right, right. What happens

174
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.070
when we have two fertilized eggs that join together

175
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.789
that happens sometimes, it's called chimerism. Are those two

176
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.979
people that become one person? Right? If that, if

177
00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:47.260
that embryo as it develops, if it, um, you

178
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.979
develop it as a sort of a tube, and

179
00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:50.219
then your head ends up on one end of

180
00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:52.580
the tube, your other side of you, the other

181
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.619
end of you ends up on the other side

182
00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:56.559
of the tube, A funny thing could happen if

183
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.460
if it splits at the head end and you

184
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.909
end up with two heads. Right? But just one

185
00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.650
body, we would call that, we would call that

186
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.489
two people, we call it conjoined twins. If it

187
00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:10.010
happens the other way and you got two sets

188
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.090
of legs and one head, we'd call that one

189
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.770
person with two, so, you know, it's, it's no

190
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.169
clean-cut answer would really work, but I think what

191
00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:24.049
we begin to understand is what we're really talking

192
00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:28.200
about is, is heads. Right? A functioning brain that

193
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.890
can give you a functioning personal, you know, personality

194
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.859
and mind. OK. And I think that's clarifying then

195
00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:37.289
because we're not talking about some clump of cells.

196
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.219
We're actually talking about the ability to do what

197
00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:41.700
you and I are doing at some level, which

198
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.739
is to, to communicate.

199
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.330
OK, and when exactly would that be in intrauterine

200
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.890
development? I mean, what week are we talking

201
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.809
about? We're talking, well, for it's a fuzzy, it's

202
00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:57.130
not a, it's here one day and it's not,

203
00:09:57.289 --> 00:09:58.729
you know, it's not here today and it's there

204
00:09:58.729 --> 00:10:04.080
tomorrow. It's the brain development is continuous. Um, BUT,

205
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.919
you know, in terms of the electrical activity in

206
00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.479
the brain that we can measure that we think

207
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:11.960
means your brain's awake and moving, um, that doesn't

208
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.760
really happen until, you know, somewhere in the 20th

209
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.869
to 30th week is when we begin to see

210
00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:21.799
activity that you might say, OK, that's, that's, uh,

211
00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:24.650
you know, That, that has the kind of activity

212
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.250
that we associate with, you know, at least minimal

213
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.450
function of a human brain. And so, that happens

214
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.429
to be, by the way, around the same time

215
00:10:32.729 --> 00:10:35.549
that, uh, you know, a fetus would be viable,

216
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.450
um, if it's prematurely born, for example, in the

217
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.890
25th, 26th week, that's really early, um, it's still

218
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.690
quite difficult to, to manage and dangerous for the

219
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.690
child. But, you know, that's around the time that

220
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.929
you've got viability. And so that kind of begins

221
00:10:49.929 --> 00:10:52.369
to align with one common way we think about

222
00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:55.809
this is, Whenever the fetus would be viable and

223
00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:58.789
could survive on its own outside of the womb,

224
00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:01.710
maybe that's when we wanna call it, we'll start

225
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.469
it then and that would, that would sort of

226
00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:05.630
line up with the brain uh version, but, you

227
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.630
know, again, to, to pretend there's a sort of

228
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.270
very clean, easy biology answer is not right.

229
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.119
OK, so let me ask you now about height,

230
00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:18.640
because I think that this is a trait that

231
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.599
we can also use as, as an illustrative example

232
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.219
to understand better how we should think about variation.

233
00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:33.020
Among people and population. So, where does, uh, the

234
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.590
variation in terms of height that we see among

235
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.869
people and population stem from?

236
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.349
Yeah, I mean, height is the perfect example of

237
00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:43.630
these, what we call complex traits. Most traits are

238
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.099
what we call complex traits. What a biologist means

239
00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:49.869
by that is there's dozens or hundreds or even

240
00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:53.270
thousands of genes, each of which contributes a little

241
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.359
bit. Right? We, we all know, probably that, you

242
00:11:56.359 --> 00:11:57.840
know, if you have tall parents, you're likely to

243
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.000
have tall kids. If you have short parents, they'll

244
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.909
probably have short kids, right? So we, we intuitively

245
00:12:02.909 --> 00:12:05.119
understand there's some, you know, genes that are passed

246
00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:08.280
down. Well, it turns out it's not one or

247
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.219
two genes that affect your height, it's, it's literally

248
00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:14.739
thousands, maybe over 10,000, uh, genes. Mm, um, and

249
00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:18.239
each contributes a tiny little bit, right? So, um,

250
00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:20.500
the gene variants that you got from mom and

251
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500
the ones you got from dad, that's the hand

252
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.299
you're dealt, you put those together and that's what

253
00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:27.859
your sort of genetic possibility is, your genetic potential

254
00:12:27.859 --> 00:12:31.020
is. But then, because this is, again, the classic

255
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.239
complex trait, you've got all of your childhood development

256
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.820
that's gonna affect your height as well. So nutrition

257
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.940
is the big one. But as a piece of

258
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.020
that, if you're sick a lot as a kid

259
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.380
and you can't, your body is spending energy fighting

260
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.340
infections and can't spend it on uh growth, for

261
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.900
example, those lead to to differences there. Um, BUT,

262
00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:54.820
you know, think about what that gives us, right?

263
00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.409
If we have, um, if we have Look at

264
00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:02.530
a population of people, right, the folks that you

265
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.890
grew up with, right? You probably know short folks

266
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.809
and you know, tall people, right? You know, and

267
00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:09.359
by the way, it's not just height, right? All

268
00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:12.049
of our body shape, it functions this way. So

269
00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:14.409
face shape is the same way, you know, hand

270
00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:16.770
shape, all of the, all of the growth that

271
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.890
gives you your form plays by the same rules.

272
00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:20.479
So height's is the obvious, easy one to measure,

273
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.000
but all of it would be that way. Um,

274
00:13:23.119 --> 00:13:25.679
YOU, you know, growing up, the people in your

275
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.299
population are, some are tall, some are short, whatever.

276
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:33.200
There are average differences between populations. But that's a

277
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.119
much smaller difference, you know, the average height of

278
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.960
people in France versus the average height of people

279
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.739
in, I don't know, Kenya. It's, there's some difference

280
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.020
there, I'm sure, on average, but the variation is

281
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.799
much bigger between any two individuals and between the,

282
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.020
the, the means. Um, AND then you get some

283
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.280
interesting cases where, uh, you do have local adaptation,

284
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.099
uh, where, you know, populations that I've been able

285
00:13:58.099 --> 00:14:00.380
to work in, for example, it's incredibly hot and

286
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.260
dry. You're living in northern Kenya, um, you know,

287
00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:06.250
where it's, there's hardly any rain, it's so, so

288
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.539
hot on the equator. And there's been selection over

289
00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:13.289
time. To favor gene variants that gets you a

290
00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:16.030
bit taller and a bit thinner. But that's very

291
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.789
localized, right? And it's not all Africans, for example,

292
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.229
even though that is an African population, it's population

293
00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:25.219
specific. And so you do kind of have these

294
00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:27.909
population variations in, in heights and, and weights on

295
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:31.049
average, on average, um, but those are sort of

296
00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:34.750
small whispers of selection, uh, usually across the sort

297
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.109
of global variation.

298
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.020
Uh, SO tell us more about, uh, those local

299
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.500
adaptations because I, I imagine that another good example

300
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.700
of that that people many times notice has to

301
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.609
do with nose shape, for example, but, uh, I,

302
00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:55.580
I mean, uh, some populations or people who are

303
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.659
descendants of some pop of some African populations tend

304
00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:03.815
to have a wider nose than. Then the other

305
00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:07.525
people, people who are mostly of, uh, who have

306
00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:09.934
a white skin, let's say, of course this is

307
00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:13.895
just proxies that I'm using, but anyway, uh, I

308
00:15:13.895 --> 00:15:18.594
mean, what explains that sort of variation, for example,

309
00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.534
in the nose shape and the shape of the

310
00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:24.554
head, for example, and other facial traits.

311
00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.905
Yeah, there's great science on this, that people have

312
00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:29.455
sort of mapped the face of, you know, tens

313
00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:31.255
of thousands of people around the globe and then

314
00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:35.030
try to relate that to genetics. Uh, AND the

315
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.349
story is mostly noise. And so, you know, if

316
00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:40.469
you have like a wide head versus a, a

317
00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:43.789
long head, um, if you have high cheekbones, low

318
00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.750
cheek, whatever, the shape of the eyes, as far

319
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.309
as we can tell, um, you know, there are

320
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:50.349
interesting local variations in that we all know, my,

321
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:53.030
my wife, her family is from China, so you

322
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.549
don't have to guess, you know, you know, she's

323
00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:56.539
Asian, if you look at her, right? We, we

324
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.969
humans are very good at, at At noticing patterns.

325
00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:01.710
Um, AND so, you know, I'm not gonna sort

326
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.710
of gaslight everybody and say that that's not real.

327
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.530
You can say, oh, that person looks like they're

328
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.299
from Asian descent, that person looks like they're from

329
00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:11.150
African descent. And that's because of these variations in

330
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.989
shape and, and size, often of facial features, etc.

331
00:16:14.229 --> 00:16:18.609
Yeah. Um, Most of that variation, again, it's just

332
00:16:18.609 --> 00:16:21.950
noise. So, um, you know, if you think about

333
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.570
Uh, you know, think about a big bowl of

334
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.669
M&M's, right? You mix it all up. Um, SO

335
00:16:30.669 --> 00:16:33.869
it's totally mixed. Those are your gene variants around

336
00:16:33.869 --> 00:16:36.190
the globe. The, the, the M&Ms is your global

337
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.070
human variation of genes. But if I were to

338
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.770
pick up one scoop, I'm probably not gonna get

339
00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:45.010
the perfect mix. I'm probably gonna get a clump

340
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.150
of oranges and reds, or I'll get a clump

341
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.229
of whatever, right? So, most variation in our shape,

342
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:54.070
our face shape, Head shape, that kind of stuff.

343
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:57.770
Is this a sort of local clumping for reasons

344
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.270
that just seem to be random and, and not,

345
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:05.209
not meaningful, functionally meaningful around the globe. Um, NOSE

346
00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:07.410
shape is an interesting example of, of a, a

347
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.569
contrary example of that. It does, you can do

348
00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.050
nice statistical tests when people map the face and

349
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.489
then correlate, you know, correlate to the, to the

350
00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:18.199
genes. You can test if there's selection, if there's

351
00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:20.520
been adaptation, and nose shape seems to be one

352
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.050
of these adaptation stories. Um, YOU see big Narrow

353
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.770
nostril noses in cold, dry climates. And it seems

354
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.369
like it's a, and, we know that a big

355
00:17:33.369 --> 00:17:36.250
nose helps you humidify the air and also helps

356
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.869
you lose less humidity when you breathe air out.

357
00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:42.650
So it seems like it's that story. Um, THE,

358
00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:45.969
a, a wider nose is not just an African

359
00:17:45.969 --> 00:17:47.709
adaptation, it's actually, if you look around the globe,

360
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.609
it's places where the air is warm and humid.

361
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.500
And that seems to be selected there. Yeah, yeah.

362
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.160
Um, FACE, you know, head shape, that seems like

363
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.650
it's noise. Um, SKIN color, that's adaptation, right? That

364
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.890
seems to be an adaptation to, uh, how much

365
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.489
sunlight you get, if you get a lot, uh,

366
00:18:07.609 --> 00:18:09.890
then darker skin, that melanin, melanin is, is the

367
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.050
pigment that makes your skin darker. It acts like

368
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.089
a natural sunblock. So you want more of that.

369
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.449
We all make it, by the way, we all

370
00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:18.410
make melanin. But you're selected to make more of

371
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.680
it in a place where the sunlight's intense. You're,

372
00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.719
there, there's less selection to make less of it

373
00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:27.640
where it's sunlight's less intense and you can use

374
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.550
more of that sunlight to make vitamin D. Um,

375
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.239
HEIGHT, there, like I said before, in Kenya, for

376
00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:35.630
example, we see examples of, of local adaptation there.

377
00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:40.290
So, there's some interesting stories. Um, What I would

378
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.030
say is, humans love to tell, we love to

379
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.369
tell adaptation stories. Everything's got an adaptation story, right?

380
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.750
I mean, I, when I was growing up, uh,

381
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.619
my grandparents would tell me all kinds of crazies,

382
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.449
oh, those people look like that because of X,

383
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.430
Y, and Z. It was always some story. Um,

384
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.530
AND it wasn't just sort of white, black, Asian,

385
00:18:59.609 --> 00:19:01.449
it was like, the Irish people look like, you

386
00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:04.530
know, it was a very hyperlocalized set of stories

387
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.849
about these adaptation stories. And, you know, some of

388
00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:11.199
them were mean-spirited, some of them were not, they

389
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:15.130
were just how my grandparents understood the world, that's

390
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.290
how they were brought up. Um, ALMOST all of

391
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.479
those stories are totally bogus, yeah, actual adaptation to

392
00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:25.869
local situations is pretty rare. Yeah.

393
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.310
So uh what would you say is then um

394
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:35.069
the role that the environment plays in biological variation?

395
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.069
Because I mean, one thing that tends to bother

396
00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:41.250
me. At least a bit is when for example

397
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:47.410
the so-called hereditarians look at the average differences between

398
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.569
human populations and they immediately say or assume that

399
00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:55.089
they have to be genetic or there, there have

400
00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:57.310
to be genes involved and I'm not saying that

401
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.569
there's no genes involved, but uh what is the

402
00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:02.439
role that the environment. Yeah.

403
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.140
The environment for almost any trait is an enormous

404
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.739
factor, right? Now, so there's a, there's a deep

405
00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:13.260
history there. That, that question, as you know, right?

406
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.239
It, it, it swallows up a lot of history.

407
00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:19.260
In the late 1800s, early 1900s, the world was

408
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.500
hereditarian. Everybody thought genes was everything, you know. Um,

409
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:26.060
AND so, then, if that's true, if it, if

410
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.699
the environment doesn't matter. Hm. What does that mean?

411
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.170
That means that anything that I see about a

412
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.500
population or a person that I don't like, I

413
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.979
go, well, that's their genes, right? And so, if

414
00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:39.609
that's the case, if that's their genes, well, then

415
00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:41.410
the best way to, to make a world that

416
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.199
I want. IS to make sure those people with

417
00:20:44.199 --> 00:20:47.770
the bad genes don't have kids. Right? And that

418
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.770
goes to some really ugly places. That's, that's the

419
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.329
eugenics movement of the early 1900s that goes direct

420
00:20:53.329 --> 00:20:55.359
line. You don't have to make up any stories.

421
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.449
That is directly what the Nazis used to develop

422
00:20:59.449 --> 00:21:02.569
the policies of the Holocaust. In the United States,

423
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.859
that line of thinking where genes are everything and

424
00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:09.410
environment doesn't matter. LED to sterilizations, um, and all

425
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.410
sorts of terrible, terrible human tragedies here in the

426
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:18.790
US. Um, SO, The pushback against that was. Hey,

427
00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:21.589
look, no, environment really matters. Environment is a, has

428
00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:24.189
a huge factor, you know, the, the first kind

429
00:21:24.189 --> 00:21:27.030
of breakthrough was showing how important the environment was

430
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.790
for IQ, right? Uh, YOU know, people in the

431
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:36.310
1920s wanted to call all IQ variation genetic 1930s,

432
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.099
1940s, 1950s, we realized, no, no, no, no, no.

433
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.750
Genetics plays a very tiny role in IQ and

434
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.489
it's a huge environmental story, how you're raised up.

435
00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:48.719
Right, our, our brains come into the world uncooked,

436
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.160
and we cook them in those first few years.

437
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.140
And the way they get cooked by the environment

438
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.339
is almost the entire signal uh in IQ. Yeah,

439
00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:02.060
OK. Now you've got this interesting pushback, like you

440
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.239
say, there's these hereditarians who wanna say, no, no,

441
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.819
no, the environmentalists have gotten it wrong. Um, I

442
00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:11.520
can prove to you that there's IQ differences that

443
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.300
are, that are, that's related to genetics. And if

444
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.069
I can prove that there's genetic influence in IQ,

445
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.660
then I win the argument, and we're back to

446
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.900
the 1920s, and everything's genetic again. Or, you know,

447
00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:25.660
maybe, maybe they wouldn't go that far. Maybe they'd

448
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.180
say, well, environment matters a little bit, but not

449
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.500
really, you know, not, not, not enough to, to

450
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.839
really shape the story. OK, what? This is an

451
00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.400
interesting time to be doing this kind of science.

452
00:22:39.099 --> 00:22:42.650
We know now from, from really good genetic tests,

453
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.930
uh, genetic studies that there is, I mean, I

454
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.760
don't think this is a surprise to anybody, really,

455
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.439
but there's a genetic influence in IQ. It's small.

456
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.380
But if I have a population of kids, and

457
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.819
I can give them my, the same, you know,

458
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.660
that I raise them the same way, so they're

459
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.380
kind of, you know, from the same school, for

460
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.410
example, same community. Yeah. And I give them the

461
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.420
same test. Some kids are gonna do better than

462
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.949
others. We know this is, we know this. And

463
00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:09.910
we know that it's some piece of that seems

464
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.109
to be due to their genetics, not just the

465
00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:16.550
way they're raised up. Yeah. Yeah. That's true for

466
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.189
sure. And you, and the influence of genetics on

467
00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:23.270
IQ, we, it's a, it's a bit of a

468
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.260
slippery term, but we call it uh heritability. Right?

469
00:23:28.069 --> 00:23:30.109
In how you inherit things, it's a heritability.

470
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.689
OK, so what does heritability mean?

471
00:23:35.199 --> 00:23:40.209
Yeah, heritability means how well, I mean, there are,

472
00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:43.609
there are more than one, but there are mathematical

473
00:23:43.609 --> 00:23:46.949
formulas that, that calculate heritability. So, in some very,

474
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.160
very careful quantitative way, heritability is the answer to

475
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.209
that equation. Uh, WE can get into the equation

476
00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:54.609
if you want. But a better way to think

477
00:23:54.609 --> 00:23:57.189
about it, more useful, uh, and all of the

478
00:23:57.189 --> 00:23:59.849
equations that do heritability get at the same issue

479
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:04.560
is If all I know is your genetics. How

480
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.900
well can I predict? Your IQ in this case,

481
00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:10.790
your height, all right, I can do the heritability

482
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.780
of anything. Mhm, um, AND so all I know

483
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.790
is your genetics. What gene variants you have. How

484
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.369
good of a job do I do at predicting

485
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.869
your IQ? And I could predict 0% of your

486
00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:26.579
IQ, so heritability could be 0. I don't, I

487
00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:29.010
can't predict it at all from your genetics. Or

488
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.010
a heritability could be 100% or 1, right? Mathematically

489
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.410
1 and 100% are the same thing. So it

490
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.609
could go from 0 to 1 or 0% to

491
00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:41.369
100%. 100% means if I know your genetics, I

492
00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:46.810
know your trait perfectly. Yeah. Mhm. There are some

493
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.920
traits like that. So, my blood type, if I'm

494
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.609
A, B, or O blood type, for all intents

495
00:24:53.609 --> 00:24:57.040
and purposes, 100% heritable. If I know your genetics,

496
00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.569
I can do your blood test and I know

497
00:24:58.569 --> 00:25:04.030
they're gonna match. Height. It's, oh, well, we'll get

498
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.459
into twin studies versus um uh modern genetic studies

499
00:25:07.459 --> 00:25:09.229
if we want, but we could say height's about

500
00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:12.550
50 or 60% heritable, maybe up to 70% in

501
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.270
some populations. In other words, I can do better

502
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.969
than, I, I'll do better than guessing your height

503
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:20.849
if I know your genetics, but I still won't

504
00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:25.599
probably get it exactly right for everybody. The modern

505
00:25:25.599 --> 00:25:30.469
approach to measuring IQ heritability says. That inheritability for

506
00:25:30.469 --> 00:25:33.390
those traits, for, for mental traits, not just IQ

507
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.829
but also things like your likelihood of, of depression,

508
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.650
your personality type. Mhm. Uh, THOSE heritabilities in the

509
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.329
modern approach of, of modern genetic science. ARE about

510
00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:51.630
10%, maybe up to 15% sometimes. Um, YOU know,

511
00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:53.300
people, people are gonna write in and say, no,

512
00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:54.660
I think it's higher, no, I think it's lower.

513
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.060
But if you look across the data sets that

514
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.099
we have available, it's, I'm not too far off.

515
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:05.300
It's around 10, 15%. OK. Um, THAT means that

516
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.819
90% of the variation, I'm not catching with genetics.

517
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.069
Right? So that's, that's the sort of scale of

518
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:14.920
things here. So are the new hereditarians right? That

519
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.089
if I have a genetic component, then everything's genetics.

520
00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:20.869
No, no. Actually, what the new genetics says is

521
00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:23.569
most of it's not genetics. Now, here's the other

522
00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:25.890
little thing that they never talk about, that the,

523
00:26:25.939 --> 00:26:27.719
the hereditarians that I, as far as I'm concerned,

524
00:26:27.729 --> 00:26:31.689
I've, I've never seen talk about seriously, uh, on,

525
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.130
in, you know, in the social media space or

526
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:38.410
whatever. Those tests, a heritability test, only works within

527
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.140
a population. I can only calculate it within a

528
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:48.630
population. Yeah. It does not port. If I know

529
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.349
that genetics accounts for about 10% of the variation

530
00:26:51.349 --> 00:26:54.060
within this group, and I can prove that. That

531
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.959
doesn't mean That genetics accounts for 10% of the

532
00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:01.400
difference between this group and that group that I

533
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.709
never measured, or even that I measured but in

534
00:27:03.709 --> 00:27:05.119
a, on a different day with a different, you

535
00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:10.079
know, setting. It doesn't work that way. It's, it

536
00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:16.459
just doesn't. Um, AND so, the, the gotcha, ha

537
00:27:16.459 --> 00:27:20.469
ha, there's a genetic component to IQ, and that

538
00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:22.750
means that every, you know, the differences between, for

539
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.219
example, in the States, again, we're talking about, like,

540
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.689
student performance with white students and black students. Mhm.

541
00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:31.430
Right? That's a big thing that comes up all

542
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.579
the time. Yes, people, and, and, you know, the,

543
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.900
the hereditarians will say, see, look, there's a difference

544
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.540
here. Black students don't do as well. And we

545
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.770
know from these careful studies within these populations that

546
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.619
it's hereditary, yeah, that there's a, there's a genetic

547
00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:49.810
signal, and therefore, Those group differences are, are, no,

548
00:27:49.969 --> 00:27:52.489
actually, you can't do that. That is not what

549
00:27:52.489 --> 00:27:55.729
the test measures. It's a completely inappropriate use of

550
00:27:55.729 --> 00:28:01.339
that, of that outcome. Um, AND so, Yeah. On

551
00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:03.979
the other hand, you get people who are so

552
00:28:03.979 --> 00:28:06.339
afraid that there would be any genetic component to

553
00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:09.660
the IQ at all. The, the, the serious environmentalists

554
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.739
that don't wanna believe there's any genetic influence, and

555
00:28:11.739 --> 00:28:13.900
they are, they are, those folks are around as

556
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.339
well. That they push back so hard against the

557
00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:20.540
modern genetics work that you can't even have the

558
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.349
conversation because you have to be able to say,

559
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.270
no, no, no, there is a genetic component, there's

560
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.770
something. But it doesn't explain the difference. And so,

561
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.839
that's, I, I took a long time to answer

562
00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:30.819
that question, but that's, I think it, it deserves

563
00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:33.290
some, some nuance because it is a multi-part sort

564
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:33.900
of answer, right?

565
00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:37.099
No, this is very interesting and it's good that

566
00:28:37.099 --> 00:28:40.619
you explained, explained all of those aspects because it's,

567
00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:42.800
I think it's important for people to get the

568
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.579
full picture of this issue because they, I mean,

569
00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:51.180
particularly on social media, the discussions are completely messy

570
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.219
and all over the place and people push for

571
00:28:54.219 --> 00:29:00.099
really extreme and sometimes dangerous views about population differences,

572
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.500
so. Um, LET me ask you now about another

573
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.739
topic. So, um, and this is, I want to

574
00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:09.180
ask you about this because many times people on

575
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.859
the internet and elsewhere have discussions about what we

576
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:17.660
as humans have evolved to digest, and then we,

577
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.660
and then we hear terms like paleo. Diet or

578
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.040
natural diet or the kind of diet that our

579
00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:29.420
uh Homo sapiens ancestors have back in the savannah

580
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.819
or someplace else so I mean uh what have

581
00:29:33.819 --> 00:29:37.140
we really evolved to digest and uh is a

582
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.560
term like paleo diet scientific.

583
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.949
Yeah, that's, that's a great set of questions. Well,

584
00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.109
you know, I've had the, the great fortune in

585
00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:50.660
my career, uh, to be able to work with

586
00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.310
hunter-gatherers in Northern Tanzania to actually live with, you

587
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.459
know, the Hadza uh community there for, you know,

588
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.030
and do work with them. Uh, WE work in

589
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.150
Northern Kenya now, so I've been, I've had been,

590
00:30:02.229 --> 00:30:04.189
had the chance to be on the ground. You

591
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:06.910
know, living with folks who are living, if anybody's

592
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.729
living a paleo diet, right? It must be, uh,

593
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.630
hunter-gatherers who are hunting wild foods, hunting wild game,

594
00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:17.579
and gathering wild plants. And what's immediately obvious to

595
00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.859
anybody who's ever had a chance to see these

596
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:23.060
groups is it doesn't look like You know, the,

597
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.260
the Twitter version of the Paleo diet, right, at

598
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.140
all. Um, LOTS of carbohydrates in the Hatta diet,

599
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.579
including honey, which is just sugar. Um, AND it's

600
00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:37.300
not just a sort of meat-centered kind of, a

601
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.890
thing that you often see talked about as a

602
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:44.060
paleo diet. Uh, WHAT'S wonderful is if you go

603
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.540
back to the ethnographies of a lot of these

604
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.859
groups. So there's a, you know, there's a history

605
00:30:47.859 --> 00:30:50.900
of people. Exploring the world, uh, writing down what

606
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.180
they see, this goes back to at least the

607
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.500
1600s or earlier. And so, um, you know, you

608
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.099
get these wonderful accounts of these early explorers talking

609
00:30:59.099 --> 00:31:00.739
about what people were eating because, of course, you

610
00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:03.500
know, it was, it, they, they noticed and it's

611
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.729
a human thing to think about food and And,

612
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.760
you know, some of the stories are pretty boring,

613
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.790
but a lot of them are, like, will curl

614
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.510
your hair, the kinds of things people will eat.

615
00:31:13.819 --> 00:31:16.469
People are eating rotten meat, they're eating bugs, they're

616
00:31:16.469 --> 00:31:18.530
eating maggots that are crawling out of the food,

617
00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:21.500
uh, you know, there's no cleanliness about how people

618
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.030
are treating their food in the sense that we

619
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.430
would think. Uh, AND so, that's the Paleo diet.

620
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:30.189
The Paleo diet is whatever you can find. Uh,

621
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.869
IT can be really high in carbs a lot

622
00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:34.709
of the time. And if you're gonna go paleo

623
00:31:34.709 --> 00:31:37.430
meat, then, you know, to be, to be true

624
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.859
to it, you'd have to eat lots of maggots,

625
00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:39.250
I think.

626
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.280
OK, so, I, I mean, and also don't we

627
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.420
have to consider the fact that particularly in human

628
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.560
populations we have gone through, um, agriculture, I mean

629
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.079
we've gone through societies where agriculture was practiced, we

630
00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:03.709
have specific adaptations to be able to digest things

631
00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:11.430
like, uh, cereal, vegetables, milk. Eggs, beer, and so

632
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.750
on.

633
00:32:12.069 --> 00:32:14.349
Yeah, uh, so there are some, there, there are

634
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:17.430
some genetic variants that seem to be, they have

635
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.430
become more common after agriculture, like you say, they

636
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.869
help us digest some of those foods, some of

637
00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:24.869
those agricultural products for sure. So, you know, I

638
00:32:24.869 --> 00:32:27.310
think there's good evidence that we're adapted to those

639
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.869
kinds of foods. Uh, YOU know, I would point

640
00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:32.150
out that, you know, one of the, the, the,

641
00:32:32.229 --> 00:32:36.250
the all meat and no grains school of thought

642
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.510
in paleo world. Uh, THEY often focus on the

643
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.770
Arctic populations, like, you know, the classic Inuit populations

644
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.859
living in the Arctic, above the Arctic Circle, eating

645
00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:46.339
lots of meat. That's true. If you live where

646
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.030
there's no plants, guess what? You don't eat many

647
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:53.150
plants. Uh, AND humans are able to eat a

648
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.609
whole wide variety of things. And so in those

649
00:32:55.949 --> 00:32:58.150
environments, yes, they eat a lot of meat. But

650
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.300
guess what? Those environments are actually not even as

651
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.739
old as farming. Farming is older than living in

652
00:33:06.739 --> 00:33:10.819
the Arctic. Uh, FARMING is older than living with

653
00:33:10.819 --> 00:33:16.140
herds of cattle, actually, the plant agriculture predates animal

654
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.939
agriculture by a couple of 1000 years. Uh, AND

655
00:33:18.939 --> 00:33:21.219
so, you know, people have to pick and choose

656
00:33:21.219 --> 00:33:24.060
the population that they like, uh, to support their

657
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.699
diet. I would say the honest way to do

658
00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:29.010
it is to look at all these groups. And

659
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.359
realize, oh my gosh, you can eat almost anything

660
00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.040
and be a healthy human. It's a matter of,

661
00:33:33.329 --> 00:33:36.569
you know, the proportions you eat. Uh, I think

662
00:33:36.569 --> 00:33:39.849
modern processed foods are a real problem, um, you

663
00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:42.329
know, but the idea that it's, we should only

664
00:33:42.329 --> 00:33:43.689
be eating meat or something like that is, is

665
00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:44.150
silly.

666
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.189
OK, so let's tackle another controversial topic. Of course

667
00:33:50.189 --> 00:33:53.780
nowadays with social media, I guess anything is controversial,

668
00:33:55.449 --> 00:33:58.699
uh, but I mean, let's talk about sexual development.

669
00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:04.459
How, how much variability is there in humans when

670
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:06.469
it comes to sexual development?

671
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.760
Uh, WELL, there's quite a bit. And so, you

672
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.860
know, the, the obvious variation is male versus female

673
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.679
development, right? So if you think about uh embryological

674
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:21.879
development, and the way that you develop in the

675
00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:25.399
womb, In utero, uh, there's sort of two tracks

676
00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:29.820
you can take. And, um, you know, some species

677
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.520
don't have sexes, right? Uh, THERE'S just one monomorphic

678
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.830
thing that just buds and just, you know, that,

679
00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:39.600
that's how they propagate. Um, BUT sexual reproduction, where

680
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.708
you have a male and a female, you call

681
00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:43.520
them whatever you want, but there's sort of two

682
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.830
options, two approaches, two strategies. Uh, THAT has actually

683
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.649
evolved several times, um, in the history of life.

684
00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.830
And so, um, so humans as mammals follow the

685
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.030
same kind of thing. You're either on one trajectory

686
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.030
or another. Uh, IF you have a Y chromosome

687
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.830
that has this SRY gene, then you're gonna develop

688
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.620
in the, in the male way and you, you're

689
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.149
going at it develop as testes, uh, and all

690
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:11.260
the sexual anatomy that you develop is the male

691
00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.929
anatomy. Um, IF you don't have the SRY gene,

692
00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:17.939
um, There's no special gene that kicks off the

693
00:35:17.939 --> 00:35:22.300
female uh anatomy, that will happen in the absence

694
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.100
of the SRY gene. So, sort of, if you

695
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.540
have SRY gene that's functional, There, OK, you, you,

696
00:35:27.629 --> 00:35:31.020
a male. Now, people listening, some are going, oh,

697
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.939
of course, and some are going, no, you're not

698
00:35:32.939 --> 00:35:35.879
getting the variation right because there's so many ways

699
00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:38.300
that that can get varied and, and, and get

700
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.929
tweaked, and that's true too. That's also true, that

701
00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:45.689
if I have an SRY gene. So I would

702
00:35:45.689 --> 00:35:48.179
typically I'd be XY chromosomes. So you probably have

703
00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.929
heard, your listeners have heard of XX chromosomes, XY

704
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:54.020
chromosome. You have a Y chromosome, the SRY gene

705
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.340
is typically on that Y chromosome. If it's active,

706
00:35:57.659 --> 00:36:01.899
you start the male pathway embryologically, but there are

707
00:36:01.899 --> 00:36:03.459
lots of steps along the way. And so one

708
00:36:03.459 --> 00:36:06.219
of the things that happens initially is, um, as

709
00:36:06.219 --> 00:36:09.020
the gonads develop the testes, they start making testosterone.

710
00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:12.850
OK, but what if, what if you can't, the,

711
00:36:12.919 --> 00:36:14.719
the cells that need to, to sort of hear

712
00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:17.699
that testosterone, right? Because hormones are a signal and

713
00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:20.989
a receiver. The, the reception, yeah, the, the, the

714
00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:24.739
receptors might be broken. And so you're producing testosterone

715
00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:29.030
normally, but the receptors don't function. In that case,

716
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.830
what you'll end up with is, essentially, I mean,

717
00:36:31.909 --> 00:36:33.629
there, there's, again, there's variation in all these things,

718
00:36:33.709 --> 00:36:36.750
but, but that, it's can happen that that person

719
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.510
will develop with female anatomy as far as anybody

720
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.379
can tell. Mhm. The gonads will be testes, uh,

721
00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:46.629
they won't develop the full way, but they'll, you

722
00:36:46.629 --> 00:36:51.270
know, from externally, that person will look female. OK.

723
00:36:51.629 --> 00:36:56.100
Um, On the other hand, you could have XX

724
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.659
chromosomes, but you've had a translocated SRY gene. So,

725
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.870
genes, you know, get reshuffled as you make sperm

726
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.830
and egg cells. It's possible that the SRY gene,

727
00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.810
it is very rare, but it could get shuffled

728
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.050
into a different chromosome. And so, you get XX

729
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.489
chromosome, you think, oh well, that's a female. It's

730
00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:15.889
gonna develop into the female anatomy. No, but SRY

731
00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:18.080
genes tag it along with some other chromosome and

732
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.699
kicks off the male development that way. Even if

733
00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:24.169
an XX chromosome becomes a female. So, uh, it

734
00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:26.949
becomes a, a male. All right. There are um

735
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.639
a lot of different variations. They are those kind

736
00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:34.820
of anatomical developmental variations, uh, are, we call them,

737
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.320
they used to be called, you know, disorders, sexual

738
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.739
developments. Now they're called the differences in sexual development.

739
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.399
Um, THOSE sort of, so, you know, consequential variations

740
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:48.520
are pretty rare, right? The, there's been a lot

741
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.709
of selection to get it right because obviously, we're

742
00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:55.040
all descended from sexually reproducing ancestors. And so there's

743
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.719
been a lot of, of, of selection to get

744
00:37:56.719 --> 00:37:58.679
that, to kind of fine tune those things so

745
00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:00.560
that you don't get this variation. But not, no

746
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.459
biological system is perfect, um, and it's perfectly precise

747
00:38:04.459 --> 00:38:07.360
and accurate. And so, you get this variation that

748
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.889
happens. Um, OK. So what's the variation sexually? Well,

749
00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:17.129
the first big thing is male-female. We can talk

750
00:38:17.129 --> 00:38:19.969
about the variations across and the ambiguities there if

751
00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:21.199
you want. Um,

752
00:38:22.409 --> 00:38:27.189
BUT, but male female biologically, is it defined by

753
00:38:27.189 --> 00:38:30.070
the gametes that they produce, or is it any

754
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.189
other criteria?

755
00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:36.830
Uh, THERE'S only It's sort of the anatomical strategy.

756
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.250
OK. And the reason I'm gonna say that is

757
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.550
it's not just the gametes you produce because, I

758
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.810
mean, if that, if that, if we go by

759
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:49.340
the gametes you produce, Hm, and we. Let me

760
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.100
back up one more thing. There's only two pathways

761
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.500
here. Sometimes they get muddled, so I'm not gonna

762
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.770
say that you can't sort of have, you know,

763
00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.659
ambiguous anatomy and physiology. You, you can. But that's

764
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:06.399
ambiguity. Between or among two pathways. There really are

765
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:10.010
are, there's not a third pathway. There are two

766
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.489
pathways OK. We have to think of them as

767
00:39:15.489 --> 00:39:18.810
processes. If you try to hang it on one

768
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.050
trait, gamete production, OK. That seems like a pretty

769
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.989
obvious one. How could you you get that wrong?

770
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.360
There are only eggs and sperm, by the way,

771
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:33.620
so there you go. Fine, but um the typical

772
00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.350
male development. The, you know, uh, uh, when a

773
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.139
boy is born, a male, uh, uh, uh, is

774
00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:43.969
born. They don't produce gametes. You don't produce gametes

775
00:39:43.969 --> 00:39:47.909
until puberty. So is that organism that was born,

776
00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:51.189
that child, is that not a male until puberty?

777
00:39:51.429 --> 00:39:54.679
He's not producing gametes, huh. Uh, ON the other

778
00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:58.290
side, if, uh, you know, a woman grows up,

779
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:02.360
has kids, typical female woman anatomy, whatever the, the,

780
00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:06.389
the classic typical case. And then, for some health

781
00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:09.350
reason or something like that, has her ovaries removed.

782
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.820
Mhm. OK. Does she's not a female anymore. She

783
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.000
doesn't produce. She doesn't have gametes. Or what about

784
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.330
post-menopause when you're, the ovaries shut down? Do you

785
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.320
stop being a female? So, to say like, oh,

786
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.870
it has to be gamy, it's OK, well, actually,

787
00:40:24.919 --> 00:40:26.719
you've just created more problems than you thought you

788
00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:30.050
were solving because there are these weird complications, right?

789
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.320
And so, um, again, this is a little bit

790
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.510
like the IQ story. I, I find both extremes

791
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.189
really frustrating, right? In the IQ story, we said,

792
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.969
well, if you think it's all genetics, you're wrong.

793
00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:43.229
And if you think it's all environment, you're also

794
00:40:43.229 --> 00:40:47.110
wrong. I'm sorry. Uh, WITH sex, and then we'll

795
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.699
talk about gender too, which is sort of a

796
00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:53.959
separate issue. Um, IF you say, Well, there's, you

797
00:40:53.959 --> 00:40:56.379
know, sex could be anything and there's so many

798
00:40:56.379 --> 00:40:58.639
sexes or something like that, or it's not, it's

799
00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:01.479
not kind of a male and female process. Well,

800
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.600
that's not really true. There's a male set of

801
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.510
processes and a female set of processes, and yes,

802
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.479
absolutely, those can get muddled and there can be

803
00:41:10.479 --> 00:41:15.719
differences of sexual development. 100%. I agree. Uh, BUT

804
00:41:15.719 --> 00:41:18.120
they're really, those are, those are variations that happen

805
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.340
on two lines, and there really is just two

806
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.840
lines. There's not a third. OK. Um, ON the

807
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.120
other hand, to say, aha, you agree there's only

808
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.050
2, and that means So there's no, uh, well,

809
00:41:29.129 --> 00:41:30.810
now, OK, no, you've gone too far that way

810
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.250
too. We have to explain and understand it and

811
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.669
also appreciate the variation as well. I don't know.

812
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.590
Sorry, biology didn't develop to be easy.

813
00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:41.729
00, OK, but then let me ask you because

814
00:41:41.729 --> 00:41:45.050
you're talking about two extremes. Yeah. Do you think

815
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:52.820
that there's people who argue on biological grounds? That

816
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.860
sex is not binary. Do you think that they

817
00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.419
have a good enough scientific argument to make there?

818
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.790
I, I understand what they're arguing. What they're focusing

819
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:11.830
on. Is the fact that. Um, YOU can have

820
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.909
this kind of muddled development that ends up with

821
00:42:14.909 --> 00:42:18.429
differences of sexual development. They're focusing on the fact

822
00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:23.620
that, um, That there's really just a couple of

823
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.979
genes on that, that track you on the male

824
00:42:25.979 --> 00:42:30.260
pathway. And that most of the genes that a

825
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.959
female or a male will develop from are shared,

826
00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:35.679
right? So there's a, I mean, that's, that's why,

827
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.080
um, yeah, that's why so much is shared across

828
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.860
male and female reproductive physiology, that a lot of

829
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.770
the hormone pathways are shared, etc. Um, AND they're

830
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.290
focused on the fact that once we finally look

831
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.830
at an adult, And we look at things like

832
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.870
height or like strength, or like, and, you know,

833
00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:59.419
whatever your measure is, um, there's a lot of

834
00:42:59.419 --> 00:43:04.590
overlap. Mhm. And there's, so, from that perspective, it

835
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.270
doesn't look just like, you know, you, you could

836
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.350
make the argument, well, this is not just two

837
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:13.429
things. Um, SO I understand the argument. Um, AND

838
00:43:13.429 --> 00:43:15.030
maybe I'm, I'm being a bit too simplistic with

839
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.629
it, but I think that's the foundation of their

840
00:43:16.629 --> 00:43:20.959
argument. Mhm. Uh, I don't think it's helpful, actually.

841
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.860
I think it's, um, I think it's more. Helpful

842
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.959
and, and more based on the evidence to talk

843
00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:33.520
about. Well, no, that there are 2 sexes, 222

844
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.479
processes of sexual development, a male and a female

845
00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:39.729
process. Um, WE have to be honest about. You

846
00:43:39.729 --> 00:43:42.800
know, differences in sexual development, that there are intersex

847
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.280
individuals that develop, yes, there are. And, and that's

848
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.209
an important piece of the physiology and let's understand

849
00:43:47.209 --> 00:43:51.409
that and not just ignore it. Mhm. Um, THERE

850
00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:53.469
are also, you know, then we'll talk about gender

851
00:43:53.469 --> 00:43:55.129
too, I hope, and that's the way that people

852
00:43:55.129 --> 00:43:59.139
live their lives, you know, isn't neatly defined by

853
00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:04.090
their, their anatomy, like the what your mindset, Ricardo,

854
00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:05.610
you know, if I were, if you were to

855
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.850
give me your genes, I wouldn't know that you

856
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.850
were gonna become a podcast. You know, producer. Uh,

857
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:11.969
HOW would I, how would I know that? And

858
00:44:11.969 --> 00:44:13.580
I don't know how you live your internal life

859
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.929
and if you feel like, you know, you're, you're

860
00:44:14.929 --> 00:44:17.719
very male or whatever. I, I have no idea.

861
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.010
I don't know how you live your life and

862
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.260
I would never know that from your genetics. Um,

863
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.659
AND so, uh, so we have to be honest

864
00:44:24.659 --> 00:44:28.040
about the complications too. But it doesn't help. Uh,

865
00:44:28.139 --> 00:44:32.540
MY, my frustration is With people who often have

866
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.820
this sort of progressive, yeah, often the, the politics

867
00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.780
are very progressive and, and, and what they want,

868
00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:40.260
I think, uh, to hear them make the argument

869
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.020
is they want people to be respected and to

870
00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.100
be able to live their lives how they want.

871
00:44:43.179 --> 00:44:44.939
And I want that too. I think, I hope

872
00:44:44.939 --> 00:44:48.580
we all do. Um, BUT I think to kind

873
00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.179
of muddle the biology to get us there is,

874
00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:53.540
is a little bit of a mistake.

875
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:58.280
Mhm. But, but I mean, even if, uh, saying

876
00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.419
that sex is not a binary, uh, is not

877
00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.919
helpful or perhaps we can or even yeah, but

878
00:45:06.919 --> 00:45:09.320
even if it's not helpful or even if you,

879
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.620
we want to say that it's not true. Uh,

880
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.560
SOME of the arguments, at least used by people

881
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.669
who argue for a non-binary sex, uh, are good

882
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.000
scientific arguments that we have to take

883
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.370
into

884
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:24.379
account,

885
00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:26.270
I mean, you know, I'm sure you could find

886
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.409
lots of examples that wouldn't be good biology, but

887
00:45:29.409 --> 00:45:31.860
yeah, the people I hear arguing it. They're not

888
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.020
wrong about their view of the biology, right? There

889
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.739
is intersection divisions that developed. There is this variation

890
00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:39.219
that happens in the system. There is a lot

891
00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:41.469
of shared anatomy and biology between male and female.

892
00:45:41.659 --> 00:45:44.350
Yeah, that's correct. Yeah,

893
00:45:45.149 --> 00:45:50.810
OK, so that's sex. Uh, GENDER now. So what

894
00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.239
is the difference between sex and gender, and, uh,

895
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.090
I'm very interested in hearing this from you because

896
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:01.550
since you're an evolutionary anthropologist, I mean, people would

897
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.439
tend to think about you as someone who is

898
00:46:04.439 --> 00:46:08.489
more interested in perhaps the more biological aspect of

899
00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:12.330
things and the cultural anthropologists would be more interested

900
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:16.679
in. Uh, SOCIAL constructs like gender and so on,

901
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.000
so, but, but, what is your take on gender?

902
00:46:20.709 --> 00:46:23.270
Yeah, well, it's, I mean, it's a very real

903
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.790
thing. Uh, YOU know, the way that you, we

904
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.270
organize our societies, we write, we, we, we grow

905
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.620
up and the way we see the world, uh,

906
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.070
there's a gender component to it, for sure. And

907
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.510
that's across cultures. Everywhere I've ever lived or worked

908
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.590
or traveled, right? There are masculine things and feminine

909
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.949
things and masculine people and feminine people. Uh, AND,

910
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.959
you know, women and men everywhere, you go to

911
00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:48.379
a Hadza camp, there's men and women, there's nobody,

912
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.959
you know, has, so that's a human universal. Now,

913
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.800
what's interesting is, um, yeah, I, let's start with

914
00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.939
what people usually ignore, which is that this mindset

915
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.969
that we By the way, we don't really completely

916
00:47:03.969 --> 00:47:08.250
understand how the mind develops and, and, and becomes

917
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.409
this mind, uh, from the neurons in your head,

918
00:47:11.629 --> 00:47:14.620
right? That's called the hard problem in psychology, uh,

919
00:47:14.709 --> 00:47:18.479
and consciousness. Sorry, we don't really have a great

920
00:47:18.479 --> 00:47:21.100
explanation for it, but what we, what we observe

921
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.419
when we look around the world is that the

922
00:47:22.419 --> 00:47:24.939
consciousness that you and I and everybody shares, there's

923
00:47:24.939 --> 00:47:28.159
a component to it that's gendered, male and female.

924
00:47:29.209 --> 00:47:36.689
Uh, AND what's remarkable is that 95% of the

925
00:47:36.689 --> 00:47:40.919
time plus, uh, maybe 99% of the time, uh,

926
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:47.149
that mindset. ALIGNS with your biology, with your anatomy

927
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.939
and physiology. Isn't that remarkable? That's crazy, right? That

928
00:47:50.939 --> 00:47:53.449
almost all the time, if I see a child

929
00:47:53.449 --> 00:47:56.090
born and I say, oh, that, that, that child

930
00:47:56.090 --> 00:48:01.409
is male anatomy, male physiology, typical development, I will

931
00:48:01.409 --> 00:48:04.370
be 99% right if I say, I bet that's

932
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.770
gonna, he's gonna grow up and, and live his

933
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.379
life as a man. Mhm. That's remarkable. That's crazy.

934
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.379
Uh, SO, I mean, it's not crazy in the

935
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:16.500
sense that the whole system evolves to support sexual

936
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.370
reproduction. That's why it evolved. Uh, AND you can

937
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.580
only have sexual reproduction if you have males and

938
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.699
females that wanna interact and, and recreate and reproduce.

939
00:48:24.909 --> 00:48:26.620
So in that sense, it's not crazy, but just

940
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.000
as a physiological observation, wow, that system is really

941
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.489
Uh, you know, in tune, well calibrated. Yeah. It

942
00:48:35.489 --> 00:48:39.570
is also true, and this again. I'm sorry, but

943
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.649
this is also true that everywhere we've ever had

944
00:48:42.649 --> 00:48:45.149
big samples and big populations to look at, there

945
00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:49.250
have been people who don't align. Right, who have

946
00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:53.149
male anatomy and physiology, but go through life, uh,

947
00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:56.090
and really, you know, their consciousness, their mindset, they're,

948
00:48:56.479 --> 00:49:00.389
they feel like a woman. Mhm. Uh, AND there's

949
00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:02.959
people, some people who don't feel like either strongly,

950
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.479
right? There's, you get the, the spectrum. Um, AND

951
00:49:06.479 --> 00:49:11.469
it's not. Common. You know, probabilistically, statistically, but it

952
00:49:11.469 --> 00:49:14.229
does happen everywhere we've ever had good data and

953
00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:18.129
big populations to look at. Uh, AND so that

954
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:21.409
seems to be part of, of human, the human

955
00:49:21.409 --> 00:49:25.449
developmental system as well. And that's interesting because humans

956
00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:29.649
are the only species that your mind has such

957
00:49:29.649 --> 00:49:32.649
a huge role in so many aspects of your

958
00:49:32.649 --> 00:49:35.110
life, right? Like your dog and cat and the

959
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.209
birds outside and, you know, they don't have these

960
00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:40.889
rich internal minds as far as we know, that

961
00:49:40.889 --> 00:49:43.010
like dictate everything about what they do, but we

962
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.260
do. And so that becomes your, your gender is

963
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.669
a part of that. Uh, AND, yeah, that's some

964
00:49:50.669 --> 00:49:53.770
funny and interesting things here. There, people would say,

965
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:58.659
oh, it's completely divorced from your physiology. That, you

966
00:49:58.659 --> 00:50:00.969
know, the gender that you decide to, that you,

967
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:04.189
that you feel is you. Has nothing to do

968
00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:08.010
with your biology. I don't, that doesn't actually fit

969
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.590
the data as far as I see it. First

970
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.379
of all, there's this 99% matching issue, or 99%

971
00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:15.850
of the time it actually, it does. That's a

972
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.090
clue that there's some physiology there and how our

973
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.629
minds create our genders. But there are also cases,

974
00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:26.340
uh, where, I mean, some of these are don't,

975
00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:29.760
some of these are, are, uh, you know, they're,

976
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.409
they're sort of sad to consider how this all

977
00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:35.010
happens, but, um, you know, cases where a child,

978
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.250
a male child is born and there's some, either

979
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:41.489
developmental issue or some kind of accident when they're

980
00:50:41.489 --> 00:50:45.949
very little, and, you know, their anatomy gets, gets,

981
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.449
uh, you know, really hurt. So their penis gets

982
00:50:49.449 --> 00:50:51.139
hurt or something like that. And so there have

983
00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:53.139
been in the past, an approach to say, OK,

984
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.959
well, what we're gonna do is remove that anatomy.

985
00:50:57.179 --> 00:51:00.840
Do an operation to make the child externally look

986
00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:04.419
male, sorry, look female, and raise that child as

987
00:51:04.419 --> 00:51:08.270
a girl. Right, it's not common, obviously, thank goodness.

988
00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:13.540
But when it, when that's happened, Um, a really

989
00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:17.560
large percentage of those girls. They're, they're males, they're

990
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.570
raised as girls grow up to have, you know,

991
00:51:20.949 --> 00:51:22.889
gender dysphoria. I, I think that would be the

992
00:51:22.889 --> 00:51:26.169
term where they feel male, they feel like, like

993
00:51:26.169 --> 00:51:28.610
boys and men, and they have this anatomy that

994
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.679
is female externally. Uh, AND so that's a clue,

995
00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:35.570
I think, that actually, you know, the biology does

996
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.090
seem to shape the mind in ways that, you

997
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.169
know, that probably happened even before you're born in

998
00:51:40.169 --> 00:51:43.969
that last, into your adulthood. Um, THERE are cases

999
00:51:43.969 --> 00:51:45.290
that go the other way too. So the point

1000
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.409
being, That this mindset that we have is not

1001
00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:50.969
totally divorced from our biology, it just isn't. Uh,

1002
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.030
BUT we don't really understand. Entirely how it works

1003
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.510
either yet.

1004
00:51:56.219 --> 00:51:59.669
OK, so with all of that in mind, how

1005
00:51:59.669 --> 00:52:03.629
should we think about trans people? How do they

1006
00:52:03.629 --> 00:52:08.110
fit into the picture of variability in terms of

1007
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.770
gender identity?

1008
00:52:10.229 --> 00:52:13.129
Yeah, well, I mean, again, anytime we've ever looked

1009
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.469
historically or today in populations that are, we have

1010
00:52:16.469 --> 00:52:18.860
big populations to see this because it's, it's not

1011
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.169
a huge percent of the population. Mhm. They're a

1012
00:52:22.169 --> 00:52:24.360
part of us. They're a part of, of the

1013
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.510
human experience is some people will have transgender identities.

1014
00:52:28.889 --> 00:52:32.850
Um, AND I think, you know, what I would

1015
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:33.719
like to see, I think what a lot of

1016
00:52:33.719 --> 00:52:35.090
people like to see is that people would be

1017
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.770
allowed to live how they feel and not, you

1018
00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:41.250
know, have to conform to some other person's view

1019
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:43.270
of how they ought to act. And how they

1020
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:46.469
ought to believe they, they, they should live, um.

1021
00:52:47.139 --> 00:52:50.939
And that's a legitimate authentic way to that we

1022
00:52:50.939 --> 00:52:54.290
see humans developing around the world and through time.

1023
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.629
Mhm. OK, so, uh, I mean, I, I have

1024
00:52:59.629 --> 00:53:01.469
two more topics I wanted to ask you about,

1025
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:04.229
but actually I have a third one because this

1026
00:53:04.229 --> 00:53:08.830
is, this is something that has also become relevant

1027
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:16.330
in the, uh, current American context, um. How do

1028
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:19.669
vaccines work and why are they important?

1029
00:53:20.209 --> 00:53:24.409
Yeah, uh, so vaccines are one of them, have

1030
00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:30.820
to be just. Maybe the single greatest scientific breakthrough

1031
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.479
ever. I mean, it's, it's, it's kind of amazing

1032
00:53:33.479 --> 00:53:36.679
what they do. Your immune system is a great

1033
00:53:36.679 --> 00:53:39.719
example of, of an environmentally influenced piece of your

1034
00:53:39.719 --> 00:53:44.139
physiology. It's not just humans, any, any system with

1035
00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:47.469
an immune system. IS trying to battle bacteria and

1036
00:53:47.469 --> 00:53:49.860
viruses that replicate really fast and evolve really fast,

1037
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.030
and so, you have to be born, if you

1038
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.469
have an immune system. You're born with a system

1039
00:53:53.469 --> 00:53:55.830
that can adapt because there's no way that the

1040
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.120
parents, your parents' generation is gonna be ready, you

1041
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.350
know, you're not gonna, they're not gonna give you

1042
00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.949
genes that are gonna be very helpful for the

1043
00:54:01.949 --> 00:54:04.300
next generation of bacteria that are thousands of generations

1044
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.229
evolved from what your parents experienced, right? So, your

1045
00:54:07.229 --> 00:54:11.090
immune system has, you know, it's like an army

1046
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.570
with multiple pieces and components. And they're all ready

1047
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.729
to, to go to battle with whatever they see

1048
00:54:17.729 --> 00:54:22.709
and whatever's new. Um, THERE'S a, a component of

1049
00:54:22.709 --> 00:54:28.270
your immune system that can remember when it gets

1050
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:31.830
hit with a particular bacteria or virus or pathogen.

1051
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:35.570
Uh, AND that's really important because maybe you'll get

1052
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.159
really sick this time and hopefully, you survive it.

1053
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.370
But next time, you won't get sick or as

1054
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.250
sick because your immune system will remember, oh, we

1055
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.489
fought this one before. And, uh, you know, if

1056
00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:50.370
you've heard of antibodies, these are anti, the antibodies

1057
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.159
kind of smother these viruses and flag them. I'm

1058
00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:55.629
ready to make the right antibodies for that particular

1059
00:54:55.919 --> 00:54:58.300
bacteria. It'll fit like a key in a lock.

1060
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.979
To get that particular bacteria and, and take it

1061
00:55:00.979 --> 00:55:02.179
out, so next time I don't get as sick.

1062
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:06.489
Yeah. OK. So there's this memory, there's this learned

1063
00:55:06.489 --> 00:55:09.120
component of your immune system, really remarkable bit of

1064
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.580
evolution, and it, humans have it, lots of uh

1065
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.550
mammals have it generally. Uh, IT'S, it's, anyway. We've

1066
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.790
figured out. Before we even really understood how immune

1067
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:21.479
systems work, this is hundreds of years ago, people

1068
00:55:21.479 --> 00:55:24.659
figured out that if you get sick. Either with

1069
00:55:24.659 --> 00:55:30.199
a weakened version. Of a particular disease. Or with

1070
00:55:30.199 --> 00:55:32.270
a related disease, that's, it's a very similar but

1071
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:35.010
not exactly the same kind of a disease. That

1072
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.360
that will train this learned immune system response in

1073
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.550
a way that when you get sick with the

1074
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.840
real thing, you're ready. Mhm. That's great because now

1075
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.840
I don't have to pass through this illness of

1076
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.199
being super sick and maybe dying or maybe being

1077
00:55:51.199 --> 00:55:55.280
injured for life. Uh, TO get the immune the,

1078
00:55:55.459 --> 00:55:58.639
the immune memory. I can, I can bypass that.

1079
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.659
And this was, you know, the initial smallpox, smallpox

1080
00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:04.300
vaccines that you might have heard of. This is

1081
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:07.739
like, you know, 1,500s, 1600s. People in the Near

1082
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:10.459
East, people in North Africa, people in Asia figured

1083
00:56:10.459 --> 00:56:14.260
this out. They would take the scabs, some people

1084
00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.919
would get sick and they, you know, they develop

1085
00:56:15.919 --> 00:56:18.080
these pustules or whatever, you'd pick a little bit

1086
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.800
of the scab and you'd grind it up and

1087
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.000
you'd blow it up the nose of a, of

1088
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.679
a kid or somebody who, you know, and, and

1089
00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:25.360
that would get them a little bit sick and

1090
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.879
their, their immune system would learn to recognize that

1091
00:56:27.879 --> 00:56:30.760
pathogen and they learned immune system was ready for

1092
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.379
when they really got sick. All these cool ways

1093
00:56:33.379 --> 00:56:36.050
of, of figuring out how to do this. OK,

1094
00:56:36.429 --> 00:56:40.409
uh, George Washington. INSISTED, for example, that his troops

1095
00:56:40.409 --> 00:56:44.090
get the smallpox vaccine because uh it would allow

1096
00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:47.110
them to not get smallpox when it passed through

1097
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.330
and, you know, we keep them healthier as they're

1098
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.530
trying to battle the British. That's an important early

1099
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:58.080
story here in the US. Uh, FOR some that

1100
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:03.100
that has always been contentious. So, because people don't

1101
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.020
really understand how it works, I think, or they

1102
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.699
are misinformed about how it works. Uh, It's always

1103
00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:12.739
been contentious. So back in the 1700s when George

1104
00:57:12.739 --> 00:57:15.209
Washington was making people, making his troops get a

1105
00:57:15.209 --> 00:57:19.500
smallpox vaccine, There were riots in Boston about getting

1106
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.060
the smallpox vaccine. People were trying to, you know,

1107
00:57:22.219 --> 00:57:26.350
push back even then. And, uh, and then, you

1108
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.590
know, smallpox would wipe, would, would pass through Boston

1109
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.189
and kill a lot of people who didn't have

1110
00:57:31.189 --> 00:57:34.270
vaccines and, and people who were vaccinated were protected.

1111
00:57:34.959 --> 00:57:36.800
Uh, SO it's a story again and again and

1112
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.830
again, and we just saw it now with COVID.

1113
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.959
And now we're seeing it with this whole rethink

1114
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:45.540
about how vaccines work here in the US. And

1115
00:57:45.639 --> 00:57:49.820
um, it's an age-old story. I've, I, I don't,

1116
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.300
I know where the fear comes from, people are

1117
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.070
intentionally stoking these fears, uh, that vaccines are bad,

1118
00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.179
and that's been something people have been stoking since,

1119
00:57:58.659 --> 00:58:03.320
again, since at least the 16 1700s. Uh, THERE'S

1120
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.179
a lot of fear about, anyway, you ask how

1121
00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:07.959
vaccines work, that's how vaccines work. They, they, they

1122
00:58:07.959 --> 00:58:11.179
train your learned immune system. Uh, WE can talk

1123
00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:13.520
about mRN mRNA vaccines or something like that if

1124
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.159
you want, but that's, that's the answer.

1125
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.550
Yeah, I mean, one thing that really frustrates me

1126
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.310
is that some of the claims made by, I

1127
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:25.760
think it's fair to call them anti-vaxxers. Some of

1128
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.500
the claims made by them, like, for example, that

1129
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:33.760
vaccines cause autism or that mRNA vaccines are not

1130
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.280
safe. I mean some of these things, even more

1131
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.040
so autism because we have had more time to

1132
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.100
uh study that. I mean they've been thoroughly debunked

1133
00:58:45.239 --> 00:58:48.600
and people keep, keep bringing it, bringing it up

1134
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:53.590
as if it was uh still a valid scientific

1135
00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:53.760
question.

1136
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.169
Right. Yeah, I mean, you know, that you hear

1137
00:58:56.169 --> 00:58:57.489
again and again, well, none of these vaccines have

1138
00:58:57.489 --> 00:59:00.590
been tested. Yeah, that's not, that is simply not

1139
00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:03.110
true. Uh, AND so if you hear that claim,

1140
00:59:03.189 --> 00:59:05.610
it's either by somebody who doesn't know the literature

1141
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:09.139
and, and know the decades of modern, um, excellent

1142
00:59:09.139 --> 00:59:12.750
science that have tested all these vaccines, um, or

1143
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:16.590
they're intentionally, you know, uh, misinforming you. So you

1144
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.729
have to decide if you're being intentionally misinformed or

1145
00:59:18.729 --> 00:59:20.989
the person just doesn't know. Uh, BUT no, all

1146
00:59:20.989 --> 00:59:23.870
these have been my, you know, the, in writing

1147
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:25.949
this book, I, I thought, OK, well, let's be

1148
00:59:25.949 --> 00:59:28.270
an open-minded person here and let's ask the question.

1149
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.080
The COVID vaccines, right? This is the, the COVID

1150
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.719
vaccine is the first time in history that this

1151
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:38.280
Nobel Prize-winning technology was rolled out, this mRNA vaccine.

1152
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.899
Um, MRNA vaccines, they put a little bit of

1153
00:59:41.899 --> 00:59:48.250
mRNA into your body. That makes a protein. So,

1154
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.870
all of your DNA, the, the, the classic way

1155
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.550
DNA works is you have a gene, it makes

1156
00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:57.110
an mRNA molecule, this long mRNA molecule that goes

1157
00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.790
and acts as a template to make a protein.

1158
01:00:00.439 --> 01:00:04.429
Right, that's the classic central dogma of DNA. Um,

1159
01:00:04.989 --> 01:00:08.860
THE mRNA system uses that. That, you know, uses

1160
01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.899
those mechanics and says, well, you don't have a

1161
01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.939
gene that's gonna make the right kind of protein

1162
01:00:12.939 --> 01:00:14.719
that, that the bacteria makes or that virus makes.

1163
01:00:14.729 --> 01:00:17.340
And so we're gonna give you the mRNA molecule.

1164
01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:19.500
It's gonna float in there, act as a template

1165
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.239
to make a protein, and the protein that makes

1166
01:00:21.239 --> 01:00:24.050
is the protein that the virus usually has on

1167
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.860
it. And so, uh, great. So now you've had

1168
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.139
this protein floating around that looks like the virus.

1169
01:00:30.219 --> 01:00:31.620
It's just the protein though. It's not a full

1170
01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.739
virus. It can't actually make you sick like a

1171
01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:38.290
virus would. Yeah. And then your immune system can

1172
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:41.179
learn to recognize that. And now you have learned

1173
01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:45.679
immunity. You have the, the vaccine response. I fairly

1174
01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:49.020
smart. I mean, so smart and so uh clever

1175
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.570
and effective, incredibly effective. Um, BUT, you know, it

1176
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.889
is a new technology. And so I thought, well,

1177
01:00:55.969 --> 01:00:58.239
there's all these concerns and people are saying it

1178
01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:02.889
leads to heart inflammation or, you know, increased all-cause

1179
01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:07.370
mortality. And so, look, I'm a scientist, uh, I,

1180
01:01:07.469 --> 01:01:09.610
I will be led by the evidence. And so,

1181
01:01:09.689 --> 01:01:11.929
great. So I would encourage anybody to go to

1182
01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:14.129
PubMed or wherever you find your science and actually

1183
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.879
look at the, the actual articles. That have tested

1184
01:01:16.879 --> 01:01:19.000
this in 10s of thousands of people, 100s of

1185
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.600
thousands of people in the adult cases, 10s of

1186
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.790
thousands of children. There's no, there's no elevated risk

1187
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.389
from that vaccine. And, uh, you know, they are,

1188
01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:34.129
are incredibly safe and effective. Um, AND in any

1189
01:01:34.129 --> 01:01:36.600
case, you know, they're way safer, more effective, they're

1190
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.770
way safer than getting COVID, for sure. Uh, AND

1191
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.610
so, um, you know, I think we can have

1192
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.520
an argument about, a discussion about, well, was the

1193
01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.370
rollout done right? Was the discussion about what they

1194
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.080
were gonna do? Cause I think You know, maybe

1195
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.020
they were overpromised here in the States. People said,

1196
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.929
well, if you get the COVID vaccine, you'll never

1197
01:01:53.929 --> 01:01:57.250
get COVID. That's not really what vaccines do. They,

1198
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:58.979
they don't stop you from getting the, the illness.

1199
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.770
They stop you from getting really sick from it.

1200
01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:03.530
Like they, they reduce your likelihood of dying or

1201
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:05.689
going to the hospital, in which they absolutely, COVID

1202
01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.360
vaccines absolutely do. Uh, BUT you can still get

1203
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.840
the virus into you, right? The, the vaccine actually

1204
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.080
can't do anything until it, you know, you have

1205
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.520
the virus on board. So, um, you know, maybe

1206
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.389
there was problems with the rollout, maybe there were

1207
01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:20.560
problems with the politics of it, um, but it

1208
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.790
has become this flashpoint that it just didn't never

1209
01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:23.300
have to be.

1210
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.919
Yeah, so let me just ask you about one

1211
01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:29.909
last topic because I'm getting mindful of your time,

1212
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.159
so, um. Now there are a few people out

1213
01:02:35.159 --> 01:02:41.919
there that are really worried about when they're dying

1214
01:02:41.919 --> 01:02:44.520
and they want to try to live forever. I

1215
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.360
mean, do you, do you think that it would

1216
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.399
ever be possible to live forever? I mean, what,

1217
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.139
why do we have biological limits on our life

1218
01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:56.159
expectancy?

1219
01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.139
Yeah, because, so, so that first part is the

1220
01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:02.139
easiest answer, I think, is, uh, the reason that

1221
01:03:02.139 --> 01:03:05.780
all organisms have a lifespan and, and die is

1222
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.340
that energy and time are limited. That's how all

1223
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.850
species have evolved in a time and energy limited

1224
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.939
space. That's the world that we live in And

1225
01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:18.879
so resources are limited. You can spend them on

1226
01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:21.709
reproduction. Or you can spend them on survival. You

1227
01:03:21.709 --> 01:03:24.510
kinda can't spend them on both cause those processes

1228
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.949
physiologically are just different processes. You gotta pick. Yeah.

1229
01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:34.379
Uh, AND so, um, You, every, every organism has

1230
01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:37.370
this balance. I'm gonna spend some on reproduction, some

1231
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:40.889
on survival. A really long-lived species, well, what that

1232
01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:42.389
tells you is they're spending a lot of their

1233
01:03:42.389 --> 01:03:45.290
resources on survival, and there's probably some reduction in

1234
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:48.239
how much they can spend on, on reproduction. So,

1235
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.090
some, yeah, they, they can't spend so much on

1236
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:53.679
reproduction. Mhm. Uh, WHEREAS an animal that, that's sort

1237
01:03:53.679 --> 01:03:55.600
of, you know, a mouse, for example, you can

1238
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.040
do whatever you want with a mouse, treat it

1239
01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.320
as well as you can, give it the best

1240
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.040
veterinary care, it still is gonna die after a

1241
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.469
year. I, I don't know how long they live,

1242
01:04:02.719 --> 01:04:05.959
a few years at most. Um, BUT they reproduce

1243
01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:08.520
a lot, right? Lots of mouse puppy, mouse pups,

1244
01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.870
and, and, and so that's all reproduction, no survival

1245
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.090
versus all survival, no reproduction. You'll never have all

1246
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:19.590
survival, no reproduction. That can't evolve because evolution favors

1247
01:04:19.639 --> 01:04:22.669
reproductive success. Right? So if you never, if you

1248
01:04:22.669 --> 01:04:29.429
never reproduce, you're a dead end, evolutionarily. Um, So

1249
01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:31.649
we're all kind of built with an expiration date.

1250
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:36.489
Right? We all will be done whenever evolution has,

1251
01:04:37.159 --> 01:04:38.469
you know, the, the hand we've been dealt from

1252
01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:41.750
evolution is. To, to be done at some point.

1253
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.290
And that reflects the trade-offs that our bodies make

1254
01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.949
that we can't control, uh, and how much we're

1255
01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:50.719
gonna spend on, on maintenance versus reproduction. So that

1256
01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.949
that's the easy answer there. Are we ever gonna

1257
01:04:52.949 --> 01:04:56.949
live forever? Well, There are animals that live a

1258
01:04:56.949 --> 01:04:59.590
long, long time compared to us, you know, whales

1259
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.689
can live a couple 100 years. It sounds like

1260
01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:03.989
some sharks can live like 600 years at least.

1261
01:05:04.899 --> 01:05:10.080
So we could live a lot longer. Um, But

1262
01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:13.399
that would require like a wholesale change in our

1263
01:05:13.399 --> 01:05:17.189
genetics. Right? So just like, you could, there are

1264
01:05:17.189 --> 01:05:19.669
animals that live twice as long. OK, can we

1265
01:05:19.669 --> 01:05:20.949
do that? Well, I don't know, that's the same

1266
01:05:20.949 --> 01:05:23.860
as asking, could we engineer ourselves to grow twice

1267
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.570
as tall. Right, right. I mean, maybe, I don't

1268
01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.320
know, uh, to say never, it seems, uh, look.

1269
01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:35.889
Science develops at a really breakneck pace. I mean,

1270
01:05:35.969 --> 01:05:39.129
maybe, but it will, it would require an incredible

1271
01:05:39.129 --> 01:05:41.370
rewrite of our genetics, not just, you know, some

1272
01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.879
supplements and get to bed at 8 o'clock and,

1273
01:05:43.969 --> 01:05:45.610
you know, that's, it's, it's gonna be more than

1274
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.449
that. Uh, AND so the folks who wanna live

1275
01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:51.699
forever. Man, I, good luck. I hope so. I

1276
01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:54.070
hope, I, I wish you the best. Um, AND

1277
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.820
I hope that along the way, they discover some

1278
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.550
cool science that we can all share, um, and

1279
01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:03.429
not just the, the billionaires. Um, BUT I'm skeptical.

1280
01:06:03.489 --> 01:06:06.030
I think, yeah, again, it would be the same,

1281
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.300
it's the same as asking, can we grow twice

1282
01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.699
as tall? And the answer is, It's probably not

1283
01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:16.250
gonna happen with supplements. And a, and a, and

1284
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.969
a workout routine and making sure you get to

1285
01:06:17.969 --> 01:06:19.399
bed and don't eat too much. I mean, that's,

1286
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.469
that ain't gonna grow you twice as tall either.

1287
01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:23.010
Um, IT'S probably not gonna get you to live

1288
01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:23.790
twice as long.

1289
01:06:24.399 --> 01:06:26.439
Yeah, and I mean, of course it would be

1290
01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:29.840
great if we could double our lifespan. Let's say,

1291
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:33.159
OK, so now we could live up till 240

1292
01:06:33.159 --> 01:06:37.709
years old, 250, but that's one thing, but to

1293
01:06:37.709 --> 01:06:41.560
live forever, I mean, that's a completely different ball

1294
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.050
game, right?

1295
01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:45.479
Yeah, forever is a long time, and uh, yeah,

1296
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.620
forever sounds pretty impossible. Yeah.

1297
01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:52.439
OK, so let's leave it there, Doctor Bonzer, and

1298
01:06:52.439 --> 01:06:56.159
the book is again adaptable, how your unique body

1299
01:06:56.159 --> 01:06:59.679
really works and why our biology unites us. I'm

1300
01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:02.560
leaving a link with it in the description, and

1301
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.919
uh would you like just to tell people where

1302
01:07:04.919 --> 01:07:07.149
they can find you on the internet?

1303
01:07:07.679 --> 01:07:10.979
Sure, uh, you know, the social media sphere, I'm

1304
01:07:10.979 --> 01:07:12.979
just Herman Poner, you can find me pretty easily.

1305
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.889
Uh, AND, you know, you can check out the

1306
01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:17.209
lab website if you wanna see what we're up

1307
01:07:17.209 --> 01:07:20.129

1308
01:07:20.129 --> 01:07:22.290
