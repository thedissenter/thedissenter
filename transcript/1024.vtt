00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.839
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.380
the Center. I'm your host. As always, Ricardo Lobs

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.270
to the MG by Doctor Matthew mcmanus. He is

4
00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.810
a lecturer in the Department of Political Science at

5
00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.310
the University of Michigan. He is the author of

6
00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.270
several books. And today we're talking about his latest

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.299
one, the political theory of liberal socialism. So, Doctor

8
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.450
mcmanus, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

9
00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:22.909
everyone.

10
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.840
Yeah. Thanks so much for inviting me. Uh I

11
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.530
was happy to hear that uh some people in

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.729
Portugal are interested in what I'm doing.

13
00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:35.110
Yeah. Sure. So let's start perhaps with some definitions

14
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:39.860
here before we get into liberal socialism itself. Of

15
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.080
course, I think this is a combination of liberalism

16
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.935
and socialism. So, first of all, tell us what

17
00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:49.705
is liberalism, what is socialism or perhaps about some

18
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:53.084
of the main tenets that come from each of

19
00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:57.005
them that then come together in liberal socialism. And

20
00:00:57.014 --> 00:00:59.044
then we can talk a little bit more, more

21
00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:01.034
about liberal socialism itself.

22
00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.440
Absolutely. So these are actually quite difficult questions uh

23
00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.319
in no small part because when we're talking about

24
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.480
doctrines like liberalism or socialism, they've been around for

25
00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:13.589
hundreds of years, many different people have espoused them.

26
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.000
Uh MAJOR philosophers um from very different traditions uh

27
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.180
have aligned with them or criticized them. So I

28
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.699
tend to agree with Doctor Alan Ryan that it

29
00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.699
makes more sense to talk about liberalism's plural and

30
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.444
socialism's uh plural uh than a kind of single

31
00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.444
unitary doctrine. Uh That means pretty much the same

32
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:34.544
thing uh everywhere, regardless of circumstance, regardless of ideological

33
00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:38.375
development. So just very briefly, uh I argue that

34
00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.385
at the core of liberalism, its moral core is

35
00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.875
a commitment to two, perhaps three principles. Uh The

36
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.404
first principle is a commitment to the moral quality

37
00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.705
of all human beings. Uh What this just means

38
00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:51.790
is that it's as important that your life goes

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.650
well, is that my life goes well, is that

40
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.599
some other person uh in Uganda's life goes well,

41
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550
et cetera, et cetera. Now, this doesn't mean that

42
00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:01.930
liberals by and large have been committed to social

43
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.300
equality for all individuals or even economic equality for

44
00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.769
all individuals. But it does mean that you're supposed

45
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.869
to be granted things like formal legal equality, equality

46
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.729
of rights for you, utilitarian. Uh YOUR needs are

47
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.714
considered equally in kind of a hedonic or aggregated

48
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:20.455
uh calculus, that kind of thing. Uh The second

49
00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:22.895
principle that I argue liberals are committed to is

50
00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:25.875
this idea of liberty for all. Uh AND that

51
00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:28.235
flows to a certain extent from this commitment to

52
00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:31.125
the moral equality of all individuals because if you

53
00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:34.184
acknowledge that people are moral equals uh entitled to

54
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.115
certain kinds of basic rights or certain um basic

55
00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:41.979
considerations. Uh Then there's something that liberals find worrisome

56
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.809
uh about this idea that I'm in a position

57
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.289
to tell you how to run your life because

58
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.009
I possess superior intellect or superior virtue, or I'm

59
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.029
higher up some kind of social totem pole, you

60
00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.610
know, I'm an aristocrat or a priest or whoever

61
00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.490
it happens to be. Uh And so from this

62
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.770
commitment to moral equality flows this commitment to certain

63
00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:02.029
kinds uh of basic liberties, right? Freedom of expression,

64
00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.110
freedom of speech, toleration for religious views, et cetera,

65
00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.000
et cetera. Uh And then last, but not least

66
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.259
I point out that many liberals uh particularly in

67
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.360
continental European traditions are also committed to the principle

68
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.580
of fraternity uh or solidarity. Uh This, of course,

69
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.470
is the third in the trinity of French revolutionary

70
00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.970
prudential principles, right? Li uh solidarity or fraternity. Uh

71
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.384
Now many anglo liberals would be wary of expressing

72
00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:29.615
a commitment to fraternity or solidarity, precisely because they

73
00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:33.684
are wary of species of French liberalism. Uh But

74
00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:36.535
there's no doubt that in a continental European context,

75
00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:39.714
this idea of showing solidarity with one's fellow citizens

76
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:44.035
and emphasizing Republican forms of participation in community has

77
00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:45.994
been essential to many streams of liberal thought.

78
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.990
Mhm uh And so that's about, yeah, I think

79
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.350
you talked mostly about liberalism. What about socialism? I

80
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.080
mean, what aspects of socialism? Then come together with

81
00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.389
liberalism in liberal socialism.

82
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.979
Absolutely. Well, the classic definition of socialism uh is

83
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.820
social ownership of the means of production, uh or

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.720
even democratic ownership of the means of production. Uh

85
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.210
And again, I'd like to iterate that this has

86
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.178
been understood in vastly different ways uh by different

87
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.488
socialist traditions. Uh Obviously, you have authoritarian forms of

88
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.399
socialism or status forms of socialism. Uh Like what

89
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.549
you saw in the Soviet Union, for example, uh

90
00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.809
where this has been understood as state management uh

91
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.519
of the means of production, really party management of

92
00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.190
the means of production in many circumstances, right? Uh

93
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.329
But it's also been understood and much more um

94
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.059
individualistic ways by liberal socialists like John Stuart Mill.

95
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.940
Uh WHERE Mill understood this as essentially a commitment

96
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.279
to worker owned uh firms. Uh So, rather than

97
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.220
having capitalists run major economic firms, the workers would

98
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.369
run them themselves and then the state would play

99
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.350
uh an ameliorative role by offering redistribution to the

100
00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:57.190
poor. Sorry, my cat is uh very enthusiastically playing

101
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.105
with the ball around here. Um I also out

102
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:02.346
that many social uh almost all socialists are committed

103
00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:05.205
to at least in principle the same kind of

104
00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:07.716
moral ideals. Uh As many liberals, if you were

105
00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.816
to ask socialists, are you committed to this idea

106
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.615
of liberty for all equality, for all, uh certainly

107
00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:15.355
solidarity uh or fraternity for all. Uh THEY would

108
00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.955
of course say yes. Uh BUT all socialists would

109
00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.006
point out that it would be impossible to actually

110
00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:23.761
achieve those ideals uh without actually commit oneself to

111
00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:25.872
social ownership or democratic ownership of the means of

112
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:28.761
production. Precisely because one cannot be truly liberal or

113
00:05:28.772 --> 00:05:31.471
sorry, free. Uh And one certainly cannot be equal

114
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:34.342
in an economic context where various forms of domination

115
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:36.441
are given such wide birth. So,

116
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:40.631
and then liberal socialism, what are the core tenets

117
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:44.891
of liberal socialism? And how do liberalism and socialism

118
00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:46.272
come together here?

119
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.369
Absolutely. So in my book, uh and in other

120
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.329
writings that people can check out if they're interested,

121
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.510
I say that there are three core principles uh

122
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.779
that define liberal socialism. Uh So just to kind

123
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.630
of provide a little bit of um description by

124
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.950
contrast, um I say that liberal socialism is one

125
00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.084
species of liberalism and indeed one species of socialism,

126
00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:08.625
it is committed to these basic principles. But by

127
00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:11.135
no means, would all liberals or socialists also be

128
00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:12.654
committed to these principles? And we can get into

129
00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:14.265
some of these contrasts later on if you wish.

130
00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:17.154
But the first principle, I argue all liberal socialists

131
00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:21.130
are committed to uh is a commitment to normative

132
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.250
individualism and methodological collectivism. Uh Now, those are pretty

133
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.230
technical terms. Uh But by me, methodological collectivism, what

134
00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:31.790
I just mean is that liberal socialists uh view

135
00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:34.369
human beings the same way that Aristotle would understand

136
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.200
human beings or Mill would understand human beings or

137
00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.070
for that matter, Marx would understand human beings that

138
00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:42.429
we're fundamentally social animals and that we can only

139
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.220
realize our full of human potentials uh in a

140
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.730
social setting. Uh Now, this can seem like a

141
00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:50.010
rather abstract point, but I actually think it's extremely

142
00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:52.910
concrete, right? So, uh oftentimes I'll talk to my

143
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.489
students and I'll ask them, uh have you had

144
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.230
a happy moment in your life? Like a genuinely

145
00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:01.059
happy moment? Uh Most of them will say yes,

146
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.309
a few of them say no. And that always

147
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.010
worries me. Uh But then I'll ask them as

148
00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:07.859
a follow up. Uh Were you by yourself when

149
00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:11.250
you enjoy this happy moment? Uh And invariably, they'll

150
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.739
always say no, of course not, right? I was

151
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.540
with my friends, I was with my family, my

152
00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:16.769
boyfriend, my girlfriend, even my husband uh for some

153
00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.600
of the older students. Uh And I point out,

154
00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:21.329
well, this is a nice demonstration uh of what

155
00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:25.799
Aristotle Hagel marks uh Mill we're talking about, right?

156
00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:28.429
That um it's only uh in social conditions with

157
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.109
other people that we can realize our full human

158
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:32.549
potentials. Uh If you are left alone on an

159
00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.126
island like Robinson crusoe with all the resources in

160
00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:37.615
the world, but no one to interact with. Uh

161
00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:40.265
AND no one to realize your capacities with people

162
00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:42.545
would be very, very unhappy, very quickly. Think about

163
00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:44.605
like Will Smith uh in the I Am Legend

164
00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:48.265
movie, right? Uh So that's the methodological collectivism bit.

165
00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:51.776
Uh The normative individualism. Bit as I point out

166
00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:53.786
that all liberal socialists are committed to the idea

167
00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:56.726
that it is the development of the individuals uh

168
00:07:56.735 --> 00:08:00.115
human capacities uh that is of moral importance uh

169
00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:02.291
for people, people who are committed to this doctrine.

170
00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:04.981
Uh Not for instance, the flourishing of some rafi

171
00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:09.381
abstraction like the nation or civilization uh or people

172
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:12.201
or the VK, for example. Uh Now, this might

173
00:08:12.212 --> 00:08:15.122
seem self evident uh to some people uh who

174
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.302
are committed to certain forms of normative individualism. Uh

175
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.052
But it's, of course, by no means, self evident

176
00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:22.381
to those who take a more vish uh approach

177
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:25.131
to morality. Uh I think it's appropriate for the

178
00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:28.890
individual to occasionally be um sacrificed uh for the

179
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:30.730
good of the greater community. Liberal socialists would have

180
00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:33.700
no truck with that. Uh And contemporaneously, some liberal

181
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.369
socialists uh or people who are aligned with left

182
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.719
egalitarianism at the least uh would say that we

183
00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:41.080
also have to take into account future generations. Um

184
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.380
So that's an interesting philosophical question. We don't need

185
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.010
to get into it right now. Uh But the

186
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.950
argument would be that future individuals that are almost

187
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.059
certainly going to come to be, uh they are

188
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.979
entitled to certain kinds of uh weightings uh and

189
00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:55.859
felicitas that we might make. So that's the first

190
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.219
principle of liberal socialism that I say everyone is

191
00:08:58.229 --> 00:09:01.380
committed to. Uh AND probably the most important one,

192
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.960
the second principle uh of liberal socialism that I

193
00:09:03.969 --> 00:09:05.919
think everyone is committed to is to what I

194
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:08.955
call a developmental rather than an inquisitive ethic. Uh

195
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.474
Now again, these are technical terms, but I'll start

196
00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.395
off by talking about the inquisitive ethic because I

197
00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:15.534
think that um the contrast of the developmental ethic

198
00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:18.414
becomes more clear that way. So, an inquisitive ethic

199
00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.965
um is a term that is um drawn from

200
00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:23.965
CB mcpherson, the great Canadian political theorist in his

201
00:09:23.974 --> 00:09:27.159
book, The uh Political Theory of possessive individualism. And

202
00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:29.250
in this book, Mill or Sorry mcpherson is very

203
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.520
critical uh of proto liberal thinkers like Locke or

204
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.809
Hobbs uh arguing that they had this very atomic

205
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.440
understanding of human beings uh as more or less

206
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.880
purely self interested, uh highly competitive. Uh AND they

207
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.919
defined life more or less uh in terms of

208
00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:48.239
the pursuit of desire after desire, right? The acquisition

209
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.132
of goods to gratify our hedonic urges. Um And

210
00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:54.002
you know, the understanding of human beings that emerges

211
00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:56.143
from this is uh the richer I am and

212
00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:57.543
the more stuff that I have and the more

213
00:09:57.552 --> 00:09:59.382
I'm able to outcompete other people to get all

214
00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:01.362
those riches and all that stuff. Uh The better

215
00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:04.862
off I'm doing. Uh And mcpherson was very critical

216
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:07.182
of this uh for the same reason, say Aristotle

217
00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:09.112
would be very critical of it. Uh And this

218
00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:11.742
is what leads me to the developmental ethic uh

219
00:10:11.752 --> 00:10:14.663
where I say we should commit ourselves, not to

220
00:10:14.672 --> 00:10:17.515
this idea that human beings are made happy by

221
00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:20.306
acquiring a lot of stuff. Uh Instead, we should

222
00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:23.236
realize that most human beings are much happier when

223
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:26.656
their fundamental human faculties or their fundamental human capacities

224
00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.786
are developed uh in certain kinds of refined ways.

225
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.156
And this is a point that Mill uh especially

226
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:36.106
made very emphatically uh inspired by the German philosopher

227
00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:39.085
uh Humboldt, right? Uh WHERE Mill said most people

228
00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:42.280
get a lot more satisfaction out of starting off

229
00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:44.299
uh as a father and becoming a good father

230
00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:46.530
and a better father over time, right? Developing those

231
00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:50.619
capacities uh or wanting to write a book, maybe

232
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.940
failing a couple of times. Uh ANYBODY who's a

233
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.530
writer will know, you know, that's kind of part

234
00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:56.539
of the process uh and then getting better and

235
00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:58.700
better over time uh as they start to develop

236
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.080
those faculties, uh or, you know, think about a

237
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.010
musician, right? Uh Nobody is especially good at the

238
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.549
violin uh when they first pick it up. Uh

239
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.219
I know my sister plays the violin and she

240
00:11:08.229 --> 00:11:09.929
really struggled with it at the beginning. But, you

241
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.679
know, you take lessons, you practice, you put in

242
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.900
the time and eventually you get better at doing

243
00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:16.789
that. Uh So liberal socialists are committed to the

244
00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:20.099
idea that it's this developmental ethic uh that we

245
00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:22.450
should be fostering instead of the acquisitive ethic. Uh

246
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.760
BECAUSE it's the development of human capacities in harmonious

247
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.789
social settings uh that make people happy rather than

248
00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.369
again, uh just acquiring a lot of stuff to

249
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.489
gratify our human urges. It's not that, that is

250
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.039
completely unimportant. Obviously, we need food, shelter, uh you

251
00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:38.867
know, cars uh now, especially uh in order to

252
00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:40.767
fulfill our basic functions. Uh BUT it's not the

253
00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:42.807
be all and end all in life and then

254
00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:45.187
the very last principle uh of liberal socialism and

255
00:11:45.197 --> 00:11:48.096
then I promise I'll stop. Um Is this commitment

256
00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:52.026
to the realization of economic democracy uh in a

257
00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:56.736
liberal democratic political context uh that includes respect for

258
00:11:56.747 --> 00:11:58.786
the basic liberal rights. Uh YOU know, of course,

259
00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:01.744
freedom of expression, freedom of religion, uh freedom of

260
00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:05.023
assembly, but does not put the same kind of

261
00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:08.924
maximal weight on the importance of private property that

262
00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:12.393
classical liberals for instance would think is absolutely sacrosanct.

263
00:12:12.494 --> 00:12:14.713
So for instance, all liberal socialists would say uh

264
00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:17.843
one is not entitled to private ownership of the

265
00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:20.664
means of production, particularly where private ownership of the

266
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.283
means of production. On the hand in the hands

267
00:12:22.294 --> 00:12:24.560
of capital will lead to the emergence of new

268
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.870
forms of domination. In fact, liberal socialists insist that

269
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.281
we need to extend liberal principles um of democracy,

270
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:35.301
non domination and um basic rights into the economy

271
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.491
precisely protect workers against the potential forms of domination

272
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.580
that can emerge in private government as Elizabeth Anderson

273
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.231
would put it. So those are the three core

274
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:46.491
principles of liberal socialism as I understand them. Uh

275
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.870
ALL liberal socialist thinkers that I talk about in

276
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.679
my book, understand these in slightly various ways. And

277
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.260
some of them put more emphasis on the one

278
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.039
rather than the other and we can get into

279
00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.359
that a little bit if you'd like. But I

280
00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:59.369
think that that's the normative core, uh, of the

281
00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.859
doctrine.

282
00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:03.359
Mhm. And how do people tend to react to

283
00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:07.409
a term such as liberal socialism, particularly the liberals

284
00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.289
and the socialists when they're, when they see this

285
00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.960
term and they feel like they are lumped together

286
00:13:12.969 --> 00:13:17.669
into one single uh theory, one single ideology, let's

287
00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.539
say, um I mean, are there aspects that particularly

288
00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:26.719
that people think that from liberalism, socialist would contradict

289
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:29.789
each other and they see perhaps problems with it?

290
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.099
Yeah, absolutely. So, um for a certain generation uh

291
00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:37.030
of figures that are weaned on what Samuel Moyne

292
00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:40.210
calls Cold War liberalism, uh They see liberal socialism

293
00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:42.729
as just an oxymoronic idea, right? Because they usually

294
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.340
will make claims like uh while liberalism is committed

295
00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:49.659
to individualism, where socialism is committed to collectivism, uh

296
00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:52.979
or liberalism is committed to individual rights and democracy

297
00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:56.849
where socialism is inherently status uh and authoritarian, right?

298
00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:59.330
Uh Now I want to be clear there without

299
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.460
a doubt, authoritarian forms of socialism uh that have

300
00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:04.460
no respect that have had no respect for rights.

301
00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:07.989
Uh And anyone with even an inkling of sympathy

302
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.119
for the liberal tradition, uh would want to be

303
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.359
very, very critical of that and reject it emphatically.

304
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.849
Uh But I point out that this understanding uh

305
00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:19.770
is very historically inaccurate, right? Uh And it's frankly

306
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.820
quite contemporary, right? It's just a product uh of

307
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.880
the kind of Cold War environment uh where the

308
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.619
simplistic bifurcations were ideologically uh important for a lot

309
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.359
of people to try to make sense of why

310
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.559
it is uh that many liberal states were rival

311
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.460
risk uh with communist states. Uh But more sophisticated

312
00:14:35.469 --> 00:14:38.830
understandings of the liberal tradition in particular. Uh Certainly

313
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.539
those that are coming out recently have pointed out

314
00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:43.049
that through the 19th century, up until the early

315
00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:46.476
20th century, uh liberals like John Stuart Mill um

316
00:14:46.606 --> 00:14:49.676
or for that matter, John Maynard Keynes, John Dewey.

317
00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:53.056
Uh WE'RE very happy uh to learn from socialists

318
00:14:53.096 --> 00:14:55.875
to even identify a socialist in many circumstances. Uh

319
00:14:55.885 --> 00:14:58.906
And to draw an elective affinity or symmetry uh

320
00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:03.755
between the egalitarian Liberator and humanist goals of liberalism

321
00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:06.685
and the egalitarian humanist and Liberator goals uh of

322
00:15:06.695 --> 00:15:09.935
liberalism. Uh SINCE both our enlightenment doctrines, arguably even

323
00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:13.632
mature enlightenment doctrines. Uh So part parcel of my

324
00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:17.312
project uh is one of historical clarification uh where

325
00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:20.901
I tried to indicate that this bifurcation uh between

326
00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:24.392
liberalism and socialism uh that became quite common uh

327
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:27.111
in the mid to late 20th century. Uh IS

328
00:15:27.122 --> 00:15:31.812
a historical abnormality uh that underplays the long dialogue

329
00:15:31.822 --> 00:15:34.392
that has existed between the two traditions. And part

330
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:35.591
of what I'm hoping to do is, of course,

331
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.572
we start that dialogue since I think it was

332
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:39.851
fruitful and productive. Even. Of course, it could be

333
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.291
acrimonious at different points.

334
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.409
So let's talk a little bit about the historical

335
00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:49.390
background of his o of uh liberal socialism here.

336
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.059
So how far back do you think we would

337
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.070
need to go to understand the origins of liberal

338
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.840
socialism?

339
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.239
Yeah, it's a good question. So I, I want

340
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.539
to make clear my own limitations, right? So uh

341
00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:02.349
my work is as the title would suggest a

342
00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:05.500
work of political theory. So I merely mainly trace

343
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.780
the origins of liberal socialism and thought uh by

344
00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:12.239
looking at uh important political theorists and political thinkers

345
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.099
who systematize uh insights about the relationship between liberalism

346
00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:19.359
and socialism uh or offer schemas of liberal socialism

347
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.320
uh in a fairly refined way, right? Uh Someone

348
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.130
who approaches um the liberal or socialist traditions from

349
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.140
a different standpoint, uh like, say Edmund Fas uh

350
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.140
like Edmund Fawcett uh might take a ton of

351
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.270
different tech. Uh But in my case, I start

352
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.130
the story that I'm telling uh with Thomas Payne

353
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.030
and Mary Wolston craft, uh two liberal thinkers uh

354
00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:38.979
or proto liberal thinkers depending on who you talk

355
00:16:38.989 --> 00:16:42.719
to uh that have been wildly uh influential. So

356
00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:44.619
for those who don't know, uh I'll start by

357
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.309
talking about Thomas Payne and then I'll move on

358
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.719
to Wilson craft. Uh Thomas Payne uh was an

359
00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:52.869
enormously important revolutionary thinker uh in the late 18th

360
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.650
century. Uh Many people see him as the chief

361
00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:58.020
ideologue actually of not one but two revolutions, the

362
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.969
American revolution and the French revolution. Uh So, in

363
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.059
the case of the American revolution, his most famous

364
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.489
contribution is a pamphlet called Common Sense. Uh Common

365
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.479
Sense in the American tradition is one of the

366
00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:11.560
great works uh of political literature uh is widely

367
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.608
read uh to the troops uh fighting in the

368
00:17:13.618 --> 00:17:17.229
revolutionary armies. Um Because um it just offered a

369
00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:20.770
scathing indictment uh of the British aristocracy uh pointing

370
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.060
out that it was a ridiculous idea. Uh And

371
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.270
making a case for a Republican system of government

372
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.089
that's respectful uh of the rights of man. Um

373
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.750
So see from this standpoint, uh if you just

374
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.640
look at common sense, Payne looks an awful lot

375
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.859
like a kind of an American liberal, right, very

376
00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:38.760
committed to individual rights, limited government, uh Republican forms

377
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.619
of participation, that kind of thing. Uh But as

378
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.400
I point out in the book, his opinion starts

379
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.930
to shift in a more egalitarian direction by the

380
00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.520
time of the second half of an important book

381
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.239
he writes called The Rights of Man and in

382
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.790
pamphlets like uh a gray injustice. And a lot

383
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.880
of this was inspired by the second revolution. Payne

384
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.839
was part of uh the French revolution. So in

385
00:17:56.849 --> 00:17:58.219
the first parts of the Rights of Man, uh

386
00:17:58.229 --> 00:18:01.819
Payne offers just a scathing indictment of the conservative

387
00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:05.589
Edmund Burke uh who wrote an important uh pamphlet

388
00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:08.060
um or sorry book criticizing the French revolution called

389
00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:10.189
Reflections On the Revolution in France, which people should

390
00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:11.829
also read if they get a chance. Uh But

391
00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:13.239
in the second half of the rights of man,

392
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.800
uh Payne makes some very interesting arguments about private

393
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.770
property uh where he starts to suggest uh that

394
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.020
private property is not a natural institution, the way

395
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.510
that say lock and sub limbers thought it was.

396
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.130
Uh IT'S very much a social institution. Uh It

397
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.010
came about uh as a kind of artificial uh

398
00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:35.930
social project uh where people who have a lot

399
00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:38.810
of property in effect, dispossessed, uh those who do

400
00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:41.310
not have a lot of property. Uh Now Payne

401
00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:43.949
argues, it's not necessarily the worst thing in the

402
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.500
world for people to have private property because he

403
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.400
thinks that that is vital uh to incentivize things

404
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.520
like cultivation. Uh But he says, look, if you

405
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.540
possess an enormous amount of private property, uh and

406
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.189
you have dispossessed people de facto uh by owning

407
00:18:59.199 --> 00:19:01.630
it, uh then you owe society and especially the

408
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.719
poor, a debt for the possession of that private

409
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:07.949
property. Uh And this becomes even more vehement uh

410
00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:11.359
in agrarian justice uh where he says there's this

411
00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:13.839
enormous amount of reverence that is paid to private

412
00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:16.869
property uh that borders on a fetish uh or

413
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.020
even a kind of mystical ideology. Uh And he

414
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.400
says that as the world becomes more mature, we're

415
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.880
gonna start to see uh this fetish become considerably

416
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.079
depleted uh in terms of its ideological power. So,

417
00:19:30.089 --> 00:19:32.670
from these kinds of extrapolations, uh Payne goes on

418
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.989
to argue for essentially a welfare state. Uh One

419
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.449
of the first people to kind of offer systematic

420
00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:39.479
arguments to that effect. So just kind of very

421
00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:43.400
briefly, um summarize uh what Payne argues. Uh He

422
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.939
claims that people should get um a universal pension

423
00:19:46.949 --> 00:19:49.290
uh after the age of 50 that should become

424
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.439
more generous when they hit the age of 65.

425
00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:54.180
Uh He thinks that all education should be free

426
00:19:54.189 --> 00:19:57.160
uh for anybody who is capable. Uh He argues

427
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.689
for guaranteed employment and not just guaranteed employment, but

428
00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.479
quality employment. Uh FOR anybody who wants it, particularly

429
00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:05.060
in major urban cities. Uh He also argues that

430
00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:08.380
women should receive a stipend uh after giving birth

431
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.862
uh for their troubles. Uh AND also to kind

432
00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:12.552
of help give themselves and their Children a head

433
00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:14.452
start in life. Uh And then he also argues

434
00:20:14.462 --> 00:20:16.741
that at the um upon reaching the age of

435
00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:19.381
maturity, uh all people should receive what amounts to

436
00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:22.541
a universal inheritance, right? Uh QUITE generous for the

437
00:20:22.552 --> 00:20:24.322
time uh again, to kind of get them started

438
00:20:24.332 --> 00:20:25.991
off in life uh in the era of their

439
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:27.991
maturity. Uh So there are other kind of things

440
00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:30.121
that he proposes also about meals and so on,

441
00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:31.342
but we don't need to get into that. Uh

442
00:20:31.352 --> 00:20:34.024
But all flows from this commitment pain has that

443
00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:38.293
property is an artificial social institution, nonna institution, it

444
00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:42.313
might have certain uses. Uh But clearly, he thinks

445
00:20:42.323 --> 00:20:44.913
uh an excess amount of reverence to private property

446
00:20:44.923 --> 00:20:47.774
ceases to be useful when allows mass concentrations of

447
00:20:47.784 --> 00:20:49.923
wealth. Uh When that wealth could be better used

448
00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:52.394
to ameliorate the condition of the poor and indeed

449
00:20:52.404 --> 00:20:55.066
even ameliorate the condition of the working classes. Uh

450
00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:57.416
So let's move on to Mary Woolston Craft. Uh

451
00:20:57.426 --> 00:21:00.526
So in Woolston Kraft's case, uh she's probably best

452
00:21:00.536 --> 00:21:02.536
known for her classic book, a vindication of the

453
00:21:02.546 --> 00:21:05.026
Rights of women, uh which is an early feminist

454
00:21:05.036 --> 00:21:07.536
classic arguing as the title suggests, uh that the

455
00:21:07.546 --> 00:21:09.975
rights of women uh should be taken very seriously.

456
00:21:10.056 --> 00:21:11.826
Uh But less well known is the fact that

457
00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:15.345
she was just a scathing critic uh of inequalities

458
00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:20.939
uh of property. Uh So, for instance, and a

459
00:21:20.949 --> 00:21:23.310
vindication of the rights of women, uh she takes

460
00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.939
aim in this case at the aristocracy. Uh And

461
00:21:25.949 --> 00:21:28.829
she says that from this reverence, people pay to

462
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:31.569
private property uh flows like a poison as though

463
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:34.750
from a poison chalice. Uh ALMOST all the ills

464
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.920
uh that appear in our society today, uh particularly

465
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.500
the corrosion uh of our moral virtues. Uh And

466
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.550
she points out this is because the rich almost

467
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.709
invariably tend to assume uh that they are somehow

468
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:49.000
responsible for their own riches. Uh Even if they

469
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.045
just have to inherit them as if by magic.

470
00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:53.165
Uh AND align with this is this tendency to

471
00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:55.994
either ignore the poor uh or just to instinctively

472
00:21:56.005 --> 00:21:57.925
assume that the poor are somehow to blame. Uh

473
00:21:57.935 --> 00:22:01.204
FOR their circumstances, even though a moment's reflection would

474
00:22:01.214 --> 00:22:03.484
suggest that it's not. Uh NOW I would submit

475
00:22:03.494 --> 00:22:05.535
that this is a point that um Wolson Kraft

476
00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:09.364
took from Adam Smith, uh who also uh made

477
00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:11.545
this exact same argument in his uh theory of

478
00:22:11.555 --> 00:22:14.265
moral sentiments, uh where he pointed out how, um

479
00:22:14.324 --> 00:22:16.594
it's the reverence of the rich uh in our

480
00:22:16.604 --> 00:22:20.130
society that is by far uh the greatest corruptor

481
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.550
uh of our moral sentiments. Uh I can't necessarily

482
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.380
uh establish that because she doesn't directly cite Smith

483
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.050
in this passage, but she's well known to have

484
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.750
been an avid reader of Smith and had quite

485
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.930
a lot of admiration for her some. And so

486
00:22:30.939 --> 00:22:33.359
I'm thinking that's where it comes from. Uh And

487
00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:36.489
then later on in her um letters uh where

488
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.959
she's talking about her journey through uh Sweden Norway

489
00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:41.229
and Denmark, uh which were not the Nordic States

490
00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:42.689
uh that they eventually were to become, they were

491
00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:47.319
highly anti uh highly um aristocratic estates uh in

492
00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:49.369
the 19th century. Uh She starts to direct more

493
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.930
of her ire towards the emerging capitalist class. Uh

494
00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:54.469
So she didn't just have nasty things to say.

495
00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:56.300
Let's put it about this uh that way about

496
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.449
the aristocracy. Uh So she actually compares early capitalists

497
00:22:59.459 --> 00:23:02.030
in northern Germany. Uh And I quote to a

498
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.390
fungus uh that spreads every uh everywhere always. Uh

499
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.560
And she points out that the kind of novo

500
00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:12.000
rich that are emerging um in big industry, uh,

501
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.849
very rarely do anything that's particularly valuable. Uh, BUT

502
00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:17.689
they very much like to applaud themselves for the

503
00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:19.270
very little that they do end up doing. Uh,

504
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.640
AND much worse, she points out, uh, they have

505
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.880
displayed very, very few virtues of character or intellect.

506
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.290
Uh They almost always assume to paraphrase, uh, that

507
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.640
the main point in life is to make as

508
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.589
much money as possible. Uh, THAT one owes no

509
00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:36.619
duties of care to one's fellow human beings. Uh

510
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.459
Because in the pursuit of profit, uh and they

511
00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:42.579
adopt almost a suspicious attitude to anyone uh that

512
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.790
suggests that they should do anything uh for another

513
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.000
person. Uh And she points out that this kind

514
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.510
of nullity, uh this empty void uh of avarice

515
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.859
and greed is what is taken to be an

516
00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:55.479
ideal in many of these societies right now. Uh

517
00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:58.500
And again, Good Smith in that she is, uh

518
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.699
she just thinks that this is beyond contempt uh

519
00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:03.579
and potentially very dangerous uh in terms of the

520
00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:06.000
effect it might have on the broader moral culture

521
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.400
of the era. Uh Now, Wilson Kraft was not

522
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.579
a uh socialist. Uh THAT term wasn't even in

523
00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:12.979
the lexicon at that point. Uh But she does

524
00:24:12.989 --> 00:24:17.469
argue persuasively uh that a more moral society will

525
00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:21.050
emerge in the event that we ameliorate uh inequalities

526
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.439
of property quite substantially. Uh And she even gives

527
00:24:23.449 --> 00:24:26.150
a kind of um the only way to describe

528
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.709
it is like macho uh argument for this. Uh

529
00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:30.930
Wilson Kraft was quite prone to leaning very heavily

530
00:24:30.939 --> 00:24:33.530
on like male forms of argumentation. Uh As some

531
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.310
commentators have pointed out, uh and partly to offset

532
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.900
the accusation that uh she was too effeminate, maybe

533
00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:40.640
we could be critical of that. Uh But she

534
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.670
said things like, look, uh you know, I tough

535
00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:45.000
minded virtuous person doesn't want to live in a

536
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.150
highly unequal society. Uh BECAUSE a tough minded virtuous

537
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.310
person wants to live in a society uh where

538
00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:51.770
he is treated as an equal and where he

539
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.979
treats other people as an equal. Uh Because that's

540
00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:56.880
the only kind of society where people are going

541
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.170
to display the requisite virtues that morality requires to

542
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.689
one another. Uh So, unfortunately, Wilson Kraft died um

543
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:08.459
and th age 38 of childbirth uh before any

544
00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:10.819
of these thoughts were systematized. Uh And another great

545
00:25:10.829 --> 00:25:12.750
work uh who knows where she might have gone.

546
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.819
Uh Had she continued to write. Uh But I

547
00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:17.560
point out that in Bane and Wolson Kraft case,

548
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.160
uh you start to see uh the emergence of

549
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.319
a kind of liberal socialist outlook uh where in

550
00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:25.719
both of the authors, uh they're drawing a tight

551
00:25:25.729 --> 00:25:30.790
connection between this need uh to ameliorate the extraordinarily

552
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.739
corrosive effects of inequalities of property in order to

553
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.000
more securely put um liberal and Republican principles uh

554
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.199
on a firm foundation,

555
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.410
but they weren't liberal socialists yet or were they?

556
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.329
No, I, I say that they aren't. Right. I

557
00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:47.849
mean, let's be clear. Right? Socialism as a distinct

558
00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:52.089
political and economic ideology, uh only really emerged in

559
00:25:52.099 --> 00:25:55.680
the early 19th century uh with the Santas, the

560
00:25:55.729 --> 00:25:58.939
Owen nights, uh and others. Uh So they, of

561
00:25:58.949 --> 00:26:01.280
course, would not call themselves a liberal socialist because

562
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.209
uh even the term liberal uh wasn't particularly popular

563
00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:06.500
at that point. Right. The term liberal really enters

564
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.670
the political exon uh around, you know, 1812, 1815,

565
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.680
1818 in Spain, uh when Los liberal um argued

566
00:26:14.689 --> 00:26:16.880
for a new constitution uh because they don't want

567
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.560
a restoration uh of the cult out of all

568
00:26:18.569 --> 00:26:22.479
kind of uh aristocratic monarchy. Uh So they're not

569
00:26:22.489 --> 00:26:24.939
liberal socialists yet. I argue that you can only

570
00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:28.010
really call uh a major intellectual liberal socialist when

571
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.189
we get to John Stewart Mill.

572
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.829
OK. So tell us then about Jon Stewart Mill,

573
00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:36.630
what makes him or made in your understanding the

574
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.489
first liberal socialist?

575
00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:41.880
Yeah, absolutely. So, um this isn't just a claim

576
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.949
that I've made, by the way, I want to

577
00:26:43.959 --> 00:26:45.869
uh pay due diligence and point out that um

578
00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:49.630
there's been a recent suite of scholarship on Mill,

579
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.790
all very good uh which has foregrounded the egalitarian

580
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.560
dimensions uh of his economic thought. Uh Probably the

581
00:26:55.569 --> 00:26:57.709
best book in this respect uh is a magnificent

582
00:26:57.719 --> 00:26:59.900
tome by uh my good friend Helen mccabe uh

583
00:26:59.969 --> 00:27:02.599
for Queen's mcgill University Press. Uh She wrote a

584
00:27:02.609 --> 00:27:05.270
book called John Stuart Mill Socialist. Uh VERY readable

585
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.880
very short, uh strongly recommend people kick it up.

586
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.290
But you can also look at the recent books

587
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.849
by uh Elizabeth Anderson, for example, um excuse me,

588
00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:16.020
um or Edmund Fawcett, anyone like that is good.

589
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.560
Uh So Jos Street Mill is probably best known

590
00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:22.109
for his fierce defense uh of individualism and personal

591
00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:25.069
liberty, right? Uh If you're an undergraduate student, certainly

592
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:27.199
in a country like I'm from uh Canada and

593
00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:29.449
you're doing an undergraduate degree in any social science,

594
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.729
uh inevitably at some point or another, somebody's gonna

595
00:27:31.739 --> 00:27:33.619
sign you at least a couple chapters of uh

596
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.050
Mill's classic book on liberty, uh which includes a

597
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.910
strident defense of individualism, free speech. Um YOU know,

598
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.709
particularly free political speech, very, very stirring stuff, right?

599
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.790
Uh Less appreciated is the fact that Mill overtly

600
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.469
identified as a socialist in his autobiography, uh where

601
00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:53.119
he points out how he is deeply wary uh

602
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.359
of certain kinds of authoritarian forms of socialism. Uh

603
00:27:56.369 --> 00:28:00.099
But nonetheless, he proudly identifies under the general designation

604
00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:02.135
of socialists as he puts it. Uh And he

605
00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:04.734
looks forward to a day uh where um the

606
00:28:04.744 --> 00:28:06.834
kind of goods uh that are produced in a

607
00:28:06.844 --> 00:28:10.145
society uh will be distributed more equally. Uh AND

608
00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:13.464
particularly uh where the goods of society uh will

609
00:28:13.474 --> 00:28:15.244
be more likely to fall into the hands of

610
00:28:15.255 --> 00:28:16.854
those who actually produce most of the goods of

611
00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:20.885
society. Uh NAMELY the workers. Uh So following mccabe,

612
00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:25.599
um Mills, socialism is pretty idiosyncratic to him. Uh

613
00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:27.560
Like any other great thinker, he's not a follower,

614
00:28:27.569 --> 00:28:29.869
he's very much an intellectual leader. Uh So he

615
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.719
develops his own unique understanding of what this will

616
00:28:31.729 --> 00:28:34.140
entail. Uh And I argue in the book that

617
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.880
Mills and liberal socialism uh has two major features.

618
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.400
Uh The first again, is this commitment to the

619
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.479
idea that capitalists really don't do all that much.

620
00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:46.520
Uh If in the economy, uh yes, they provide

621
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.640
the initial capital often because they've inherited it. Uh

622
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.569
But in terms of work skill contribution, uh mel

623
00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:56.969
points out it's extremely minor when you compare it

624
00:28:56.979 --> 00:28:59.969
to the people who, you know, actually build cars,

625
00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.949
make, you know, build uh you know, uh computers,

626
00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:05.439
build microchips, whatever it happens to be. Uh So

627
00:29:05.449 --> 00:29:08.300
he says for the most part, a mature economy

628
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.239
uh would do away with capitalists as kind of

629
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.833
a frivolous uh even indulged uh kind of decadence.

630
00:29:14.922 --> 00:29:17.213
Uh And we would just allow the workers to

631
00:29:17.223 --> 00:29:19.152
run the firms where they work at. Uh He

632
00:29:19.162 --> 00:29:21.932
says that they're more likely to be uh efficient

633
00:29:21.942 --> 00:29:23.873
in doing this because they're the ones who actually

634
00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:27.343
build the cars and market the cars uh and

635
00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:29.572
understand how the cars work than the capitalist. Uh

636
00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:32.662
And he says, even if uh we lose something

637
00:29:32.672 --> 00:29:35.556
in efficiency because of the, it'll still be beneficial

638
00:29:35.566 --> 00:29:38.465
uh to move towards a co-operative kind of economy

639
00:29:38.475 --> 00:29:40.635
because he thinks that workers who are producing for

640
00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:43.576
themselves uh are more likely to distribute uh the

641
00:29:43.586 --> 00:29:45.836
profits from the firm amongst themselves in a relatively

642
00:29:45.845 --> 00:29:47.735
even way. And he also thinks it will morally

643
00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:50.196
uplift them uh because he feels that there's something

644
00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:52.586
servile. Uh AND this is where the liberalism comes

645
00:29:52.595 --> 00:29:57.839
up, right? Uh And uh basically undignified uh about

646
00:29:57.849 --> 00:30:01.150
being someone in a subordinate position uh in an

647
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.739
economic firm. Uh MILL doesn't care for that because

648
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.239
he thinks that people should be, you know, individuals

649
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.410
uh and look after themselves and he just doesn't

650
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.239
think that's possible in a firm uh where your

651
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.089
boss basically gets to tell you when to arrive,

652
00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:14.729
when you can eat, what you can wear all

653
00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:16.239
those kinds of things. Uh And Mill doesn't have

654
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.969
a lot of truck with that. Uh The second

655
00:30:17.979 --> 00:30:20.209
component of a mills and socialist society is, of

656
00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:22.719
course, Mill starts to argue for various forms of

657
00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:26.369
state redistribution, right? Uh So mccay points out that

658
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.449
this includes things like provisions for public education, public

659
00:30:29.459 --> 00:30:32.650
health, uh certain kinds of protections for the poor.

660
00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:36.810
Um Nothing that is especially uh generous by say

661
00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:39.689
20th century standards. Uh But certainly by 19th century

662
00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:42.130
standards, uh the kind of welfare state or proto

663
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.859
welfare state uh that Mill argues for uh was

664
00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:47.380
quite expansive. Uh And I agree with Elizabeth Anderson

665
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.489
that had he lived uh into the 20th century

666
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.579
and seen the advent of things like Nordic social

667
00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:55.530
democracy, for example. Uh AND um the kinds of

668
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.020
social security that provided there, there's very little evidence

669
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.609
to suggest that he would not sign off on

670
00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:02.829
it uh very quickly given that he was already

671
00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:04.949
very much on the bleeding edge uh of arguing

672
00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:08.229
for redistributive policies by the uh 19th century. Uh

673
00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:12.449
So I wanna acknowledge mills socialism or liberal socialism

674
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.839
uh also has serious limitations. Uh So my book

675
00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:17.780
is not a, a hagiography of these figures. Uh

676
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.969
I point out that uh liberal socialist theory and

677
00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:21.939
liberal socialist practice failed uh for a lot of

678
00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:24.859
different reasons. Uh And there's also pretty substantial moral

679
00:31:24.869 --> 00:31:27.219
deficiencies uh in to my mind, at least in

680
00:31:27.229 --> 00:31:28.890
a lot of the figures. Uh So, uh Mills,

681
00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:31.560
uh I'm very critical for example of his endorsement

682
00:31:31.569 --> 00:31:34.420
of imperialism. Uh And frankly, the racist attitudes he

683
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.939
took towards people in India and many parts of

684
00:31:36.949 --> 00:31:39.140
the globe uh where he would insist that one

685
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.219
day uh they might be ready for things like

686
00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:45.000
self governance governance. Uh But despotism is appropriate uh

687
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.369
for people who are in a kind of childlike

688
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.239
situation. Uh We need to kind of uh assume

689
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.930
control over their business until they're mature enough uh

690
00:31:52.939 --> 00:31:54.930
to assume control of it for themselves. Uh I

691
00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:58.369
think that that's a pretty um awful view to

692
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.260
take. Uh And I'm quite critical of Mill for

693
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.099
that. Uh I also follow Marx in being critical

694
00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:08.640
of Mill's uh view that um see it, we

695
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.199
could kind of um just engage in reformist enterprises.

696
00:32:12.209 --> 00:32:14.729
Uh TO move towards uh a cooper economy. Uh

697
00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:17.119
I agree with marks that this is probably almost

698
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.670
invariably going to entail more pushback from capital. Uh

699
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.479
And so certain forms of struggle are gonna be

700
00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:24.300
necessary if we're going to change relations of production

701
00:32:24.385 --> 00:32:26.964
in such a foundational way. Uh Nonetheless, I think

702
00:32:26.974 --> 00:32:31.064
that mills liberal socialism is a noble but flawed

703
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:32.604
beginning. Uh I think is the way that I

704
00:32:32.614 --> 00:32:34.734
put it in the book. Uh Kind of echoing

705
00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:38.025
Martha Nos Baum's famous title. Uh Not Perfect but

706
00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:40.324
definitely a pretty good and pretty auspicious start.

707
00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.790
So you mentioned Karl Marx there, tell us a

708
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.560
little bit more about him. I mean, what would

709
00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:49.579
he have to say about liberal socialism? And what

710
00:32:49.589 --> 00:32:53.000
do you think from his work would contribute to

711
00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.349
liberal socialism?

712
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.930
Well, I think that Marx would be very critical

713
00:32:56.939 --> 00:32:59.020
uh of elements of liberal socialism, but in a

714
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.719
sophisticated way, right? So um I'm drawing very heavily

715
00:33:02.729 --> 00:33:05.819
here uh on works like uh Igor Shuka Broad's

716
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.349
revisiting uh Karl Marx's Critique of Liberalism. Uh AND

717
00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:11.329
also the work of people like say uh J

718
00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:14.050
A Cohen, for example. Uh So what Shuga Broad

719
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.810
points out is that uh it is very easy

720
00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:21.030
to overstate uh and even treat unal electrically. Uh

721
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.199
Marx's critique of liberalism, you see this online, right?

722
00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:26.359
All the time, right? Where people say uh Karl

723
00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:29.569
Marx hated liberalism, wanted to destroy liberalism, uh was

724
00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:31.800
anti liberal, you know, his very bones uh And

725
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.829
what shaker broad reminds us is that that is

726
00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.699
very much an anti Marxist kind of position to

727
00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:38.380
take uh almost moralistic in a certain way. Uh

728
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.489
So Shaker Broad points out that in his early

729
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.670
years and Rodney Peer points out the same thing

730
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.910
in his book, um Marxism, uh and Morality and

731
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.819
Social Justice. Uh So Marx in his early years

732
00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:51.819
was a liberal, a radical liberal. Uh HE argued

733
00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:54.260
for things like freedom of expression and particularly freedom

734
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.599
of the press. Uh It's very understandable when you

735
00:33:56.609 --> 00:33:59.400
think that he was running various newspapers agitating for

736
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.599
political form in autocratic Germany and they kept shutting

737
00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:05.339
down his newspapers and destroying his livelihood, right? Would

738
00:34:05.349 --> 00:34:07.689
he not be uh committed to those things? Uh

739
00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:12.199
And Marx was extremely critical uh of certain forms

740
00:34:12.208 --> 00:34:15.695
of bourgeois reformism. Obviously, he had nothing but contempt

741
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:17.804
for John Strip Mills most of the time, right?

742
00:34:17.813 --> 00:34:19.304
Uh Even though he did think that he was

743
00:34:19.313 --> 00:34:22.103
a more impressive figure than the mere vulgar economist.

744
00:34:22.313 --> 00:34:24.185
Uh But it's important to note that Mill also

745
00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.284
argued that the bourgeois was, of course the most

746
00:34:26.293 --> 00:34:28.824
revolutionary class that had ever existed. Uh And had

747
00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:32.425
undoubtedly brought about the freest most equal, most productive

748
00:34:32.435 --> 00:34:35.054
society that had ever existed. Uh And I think

749
00:34:35.063 --> 00:34:37.135
that this is something that is sometimes missed uh

750
00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:39.844
in vulgar Marxist uh kind of critiques uh of

751
00:34:39.853 --> 00:34:43.060
liberalism and even capitalism, right? Uh If you look

752
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.040
at the Communist Manifesto, right, it's very clear that

753
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.929
Marx and Engels both say that bourgeois has brought

754
00:34:46.938 --> 00:34:48.949
about wonders that the world has never seen. Uh

755
00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:51.228
And they mean that as a positive thing, right?

756
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:54.350
It has swept away all the old venerable prejudices,

757
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.850
uh and forced man to confront his real conditions

758
00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.939
uh for the first time. Uh So in terms

759
00:34:59.949 --> 00:35:03.669
of Marx's mature approach to socialism, uh I agree

760
00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:07.790
with Chuck abroad and others that he's very insistent

761
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.860
uh that any kind of view uh of socialism

762
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.139
that entails it being a millenarian break uh from

763
00:35:14.149 --> 00:35:17.350
bourgeois society uh is invariably utopian in the bad

764
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.810
sense and doomed to failure. Uh This comes through

765
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.510
most clearly in his classic piece, uh a critique

766
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.510
of the Gotha program, right, where he points out

767
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.345
that there's this kind of socialist idea that holds

768
00:35:27.355 --> 00:35:29.746
uh we can just break from the old society

769
00:35:29.756 --> 00:35:32.206
and build an entirely new one as if from

770
00:35:32.216 --> 00:35:35.535
some magical blueprint. Uh And Mark says no, right?

771
00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:37.645
Uh The reality is that if we are good

772
00:35:37.656 --> 00:35:40.645
historical materialists, we need to recognize that any socialist

773
00:35:40.656 --> 00:35:43.635
society to emerge even after a big revolution is

774
00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:45.305
going to be to use his term stamped uh

775
00:35:45.315 --> 00:35:48.135
by many features of the old society. Uh We're

776
00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.525
not going to transcend what he calls bourgeois, right?

777
00:35:50.535 --> 00:35:53.031
Or bourgeois ri uh in a day or a

778
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:55.021
month or even a couple of years. Uh And

779
00:35:55.031 --> 00:35:56.681
we're gonna need to maintain a lot of those

780
00:35:56.691 --> 00:35:59.872
institutions and those practices uh in a transitional phase

781
00:35:59.882 --> 00:36:01.951
that could last men very, very long time uh

782
00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:04.412
on the road to whatever you wanna call it,

783
00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:06.882
full communism, right? Uh WHERE we could finally uh

784
00:36:06.892 --> 00:36:09.211
indulge in the moral principle of uh from each

785
00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:11.132
according to his ability to each according to his

786
00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:14.352
means uh to his needs. Excuse me. Uh So

787
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:16.822
what I point out drawing upon this is, it's

788
00:36:16.832 --> 00:36:19.397
very clear that Marx would be critical of bourgeois

789
00:36:19.417 --> 00:36:23.218
reformism uh of the sort that Mill endorsed, arguing

790
00:36:23.228 --> 00:36:26.427
that it does not take into sufficient account, the

791
00:36:26.647 --> 00:36:29.518
forms of power uh that are present in the

792
00:36:29.528 --> 00:36:33.558
relations of production. Uh And it's naivete on these

793
00:36:33.568 --> 00:36:36.308
limits. Uh It's been aspiratory capacity. Uh And I

794
00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:37.437
want to point out as somebody who is an

795
00:36:37.447 --> 00:36:39.998
enormously who is enormously influenced and enormously fond of

796
00:36:40.008 --> 00:36:42.288
Marx. I think that that's a legitimate criticism of

797
00:36:42.298 --> 00:36:44.404
the liberal socialist tradition that we can get into

798
00:36:44.414 --> 00:36:46.313
that later on. Uh But I also think it's

799
00:36:46.323 --> 00:36:48.894
important to note that Marx would be, was more

800
00:36:48.904 --> 00:36:52.493
sympathetic to many elements of liberalism uh than some

801
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:55.854
of his most uh vulgar appropriators appreciate. Uh And

802
00:36:55.864 --> 00:36:58.333
again, following shook abroad and uh my reading of

803
00:36:58.343 --> 00:37:00.023
the Critique of the Gotha program, he was also

804
00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:02.204
pretty insistent that liberalism is not just going to

805
00:37:02.214 --> 00:37:04.993
go away in a socialist society. Uh EVEN if

806
00:37:05.003 --> 00:37:07.253
people wanted to uh and the expectation that it

807
00:37:07.263 --> 00:37:10.134
would go away is Ahist and anti materialist.

808
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.570
Mhm So before we move on to other topics,

809
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.620
there's one last major figure that I would like

810
00:37:16.629 --> 00:37:19.270
to ask you about it is John Rawls. So

811
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:23.060
what, which of his ideas can be associated with

812
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.280
liberal socialism?

813
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.620
Sure. Well, for those of your listeners who don't

814
00:37:26.629 --> 00:37:29.000
know. Um SO John Rawls is probably the most

815
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.110
famous American political philosopher, not probably just is most

816
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.939
famous American political philosopher of the 20th century uh

817
00:37:34.949 --> 00:37:38.979
author uh of a really long and tedious but

818
00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:41.899
very interesting book called The Theory of Justice. Uh

819
00:37:41.949 --> 00:37:44.020
I say it's long and tedious because, you know,

820
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.320
it's very, very technical, very academic, you know, walls

821
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.620
was a professor at Harvard University and he writes

822
00:37:49.629 --> 00:37:52.120
like it. Uh So at the core of his

823
00:37:52.129 --> 00:37:55.540
argument uh is a thought experiment uh uh that

824
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.360
leads to two principles of justice. Uh So Mill

825
00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.620
says, oh sorry. Uh Ra says, I want us

826
00:38:00.629 --> 00:38:04.239
to imagine um a group of people who are

827
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.429
choosing principles to govern what he calls the basic

828
00:38:06.439 --> 00:38:09.590
structure of society. Uh And it's important to note

829
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.689
that Rawles is saying these principles are going to

830
00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:15.179
apply to the basic structure of society. Uh Because

831
00:38:15.189 --> 00:38:17.540
that is a subtle but very important shift in

832
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:21.000
liberal thinking that Raws enacts uh earlier liberals would

833
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.010
insist that actually the first subject of justice as

834
00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.149
Rawles would put it uh is the individual and

835
00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:28.570
their rights. Uh Raw says, no, no, it's actually

836
00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.530
the basic structure that is the first subject of

837
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.899
justice. Uh And then his lectures of Political Philosophy,

838
00:38:32.909 --> 00:38:35.139
he points out that this is something that he

839
00:38:35.149 --> 00:38:38.570
picked up directly from Hegel. Um And by extension,

840
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.459
certain kinds of Marxism, right? Because uh he recognized

841
00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:44.550
upon reading Hegel uh that again, uh human beings

842
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.419
are social animals. There's the methodological collectivism for you.

843
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.709
Uh And it's only within a just basic structure

844
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.260
uh that individual rights and individual flourishing can be

845
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.090
guaranteed. So just wanted to pause right there. So

846
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.229
his reasoners uh have special restrictions uh imposed upon

847
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:04.050
their political epistemology uh where he says, uh look,

848
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.969
uh these are individuals who are self interested, they're

849
00:39:05.979 --> 00:39:08.830
neither angels or devils. Uh They more or less

850
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.050
want to be uh well taken care of in

851
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.679
whatever society they uh wind up creating. Uh And

852
00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:17.179
they have knowledge of basic facts by human psychology,

853
00:39:17.189 --> 00:39:20.250
human economics, uh human history, that kind of thing.

854
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.169
Uh But they don't know uh many of the

855
00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:24.530
particulars about who they are going to be as

856
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.270
individuals, they don't know uh their sex, they don't

857
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.500
know their class position. Uh They don't know their

858
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.110
religious orientation. Uh Many contemporary rigs have also pointed

859
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.709
out sexual orientation would probably fall behind uh what

860
00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:37.399
he calls the veil of ignorance, et cetera. Uh

861
00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:39.620
So they exist behind a veil of ignorance uh

862
00:39:39.629 --> 00:39:42.514
As you it in an original position. Uh And

863
00:39:42.524 --> 00:39:46.004
Rawles wanted this idea to capture uh certain kinds

864
00:39:46.014 --> 00:39:49.814
of canon uh ideas about the importance of reasoning

865
00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:53.834
about morality and politics from a position of rationality

866
00:39:53.844 --> 00:39:56.504
and impartiality. Right. Uh, BECAUSE he thought, argued, I

867
00:39:56.514 --> 00:39:59.524
think quite persuasively that very often when, uh, we

868
00:39:59.534 --> 00:40:02.185
reason morally about issues, uh, we would do so

869
00:40:02.195 --> 00:40:04.564
in a very slanted way. Uh, THAT'S intended to

870
00:40:04.574 --> 00:40:08.179
favor our own interests and our own dispositions. Right.

871
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.659
Uh, YOU know, Catholics, uh, will almost invariably sit

872
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:12.239
there and think, uh, we'd all be better off

873
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.949
if we live in a Catholic society, which people

874
00:40:13.959 --> 00:40:15.290
always think we'd be better off living in a

875
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.959
society where income taxes were lower, you get the

876
00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:20.340
idea. So this way, you know, uh, this kind

877
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.229
of information is removed from people's reasoning. So they

878
00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:24.080
can't reason in that way. Uh, THEY have to

879
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.280
think more about what it would be like to

880
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.550
enter into society. Uh, IF there was someone who

881
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.745
adopted, uh, different kinds of viewpoints or was in

882
00:40:30.754 --> 00:40:32.975
a different situation than themselves. So to make a

883
00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:35.754
very long and very technical story, a little shorter.

884
00:40:35.764 --> 00:40:38.074
Uh, Rawles argues that there are two really three

885
00:40:38.084 --> 00:40:40.354
principles of justice that people would adopt behind this

886
00:40:40.364 --> 00:40:42.435
veil of ignorance in what it calls the original

887
00:40:42.445 --> 00:40:44.875
position. Uh, THE first is a principle of justice

888
00:40:44.885 --> 00:40:47.745
that is committed to, uh, equal liberties for all,

889
00:40:47.754 --> 00:40:49.875
uh, at least equal liberties, compatible, uh, with the

890
00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:52.989
same equal liberties for everyone else. Um There's some

891
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.520
complicated questions we can ask about that but we'll

892
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.320
put that aside, right now, the more important one

893
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.709
is uh the second principle of justice, really, the

894
00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.530
two other principles of justice. Uh FIRST off that

895
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.149
people need to have fair quality of opportunity uh

896
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:07.500
to access things like uh jobs and opportunities uh

897
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.610
and um social positions in their society. Uh And

898
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.310
secondly, he argues for um what's called the difference

899
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.239
principle, this idea that social and economic inequalities in

900
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.830
a society are, are justifiable. Uh But only if

901
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.350
you can demonstrate that those social and economic inequalities

902
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.459
work to the benefit of the least well off.

903
00:41:25.469 --> 00:41:26.739
Uh And I want to point out only the

904
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.110
least well off, right. Uh So it's from the

905
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.669
standpoint of the least well off that you adjudicate

906
00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:35.500
how just your society is. So for a long

907
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.860
time, uh raws theory of justice uh was interpreted

908
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.219
to be kind of a left liberal protos social

909
00:41:43.229 --> 00:41:46.320
democratic uh defense of the mid century welfare state

910
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.389
uh of the sort that you see emerging uh

911
00:41:48.399 --> 00:41:51.280
in many European countries uh or for that matter,

912
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.080
to a lesser extent. Um And for instance, um

913
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.949
FDR Lyndon Johnson's United States, you know, think about

914
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:59.100
the uh New Deal or the Great Society programs.

915
00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:03.610
But interestingly enough, Rawles actually explicitly rejected that interpretation

916
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.949
of his work by the time of uh justice's

917
00:42:05.959 --> 00:42:08.010
fairness, a restatement uh which is the last book

918
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.570
that he wrote kind of a Swan song um

919
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.350
summarizing uh some responses to criticisms and kind of

920
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.739
re articulating uh the whole theory. So in this

921
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.360
book, uh raw says, look, the problem with welfare

922
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.889
states uh is even though they're clearly superior and

923
00:42:21.899 --> 00:42:23.620
he wants to be very obvious about that uh

924
00:42:23.649 --> 00:42:26.659
to unbridled capitalism just better in every way. Uh

925
00:42:26.689 --> 00:42:29.219
They still permit too many inequalities that are clearly

926
00:42:29.229 --> 00:42:31.239
not to the benefit of the least well off.

927
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.409
Uh And just as importantly, uh the kind of

928
00:42:33.419 --> 00:42:37.560
inequalities that they allow in economic terms, align with

929
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.879
uh or generate probably a baby term uh political

930
00:42:40.889 --> 00:42:44.090
inequality because people who are really, really rich uh

931
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.739
for pretty obvious reasons tend to like to use

932
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.399
that money uh in order to obtain political power.

933
00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:52.560
Uh And this means that the fair quality uh

934
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.689
of basic liberties or fair value of basic liberties

935
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.179
uh particularly political liberties. So central uh to many

936
00:42:58.189 --> 00:43:02.050
facets of liberalism are undermined uh by uh economic

937
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.750
inequality. Uh So he says really the only kind

938
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.699
of society that could properly instantiate our society that

939
00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:12.600
could potentially instantiate uh liberal justice as Rawles understands

940
00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.169
it uh would either be what he calls a

941
00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:18.120
property owning democracy uh or a liberal socialist society.

942
00:43:18.209 --> 00:43:20.510
Uh And in other works, like his lectures again

943
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.229
on political philosophy, uh He lays out certain kinds

944
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:25.469
of uh co tenants uh that he would associate

945
00:43:25.479 --> 00:43:27.620
with liberal socialism. You can talk about them if

946
00:43:27.629 --> 00:43:29.229
you want. I've already talked for a very long

947
00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:31.350
time. Uh But I think that there's a lot

948
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.379
going, uh, to this role as you envision. Uh,

949
00:43:33.389 --> 00:43:35.540
AND, um, I'm very sympathetic to it in many

950
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.389
respects as I'm sure, uh, came through in the

951
00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:37.830
book.

952
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:40.899
Mhm. Right. So, uh, let me ask you now,

953
00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:45.219
how does liberal socialism relate to something like social

954
00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:46.060
democracy?

955
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.250
Yeah, it's a good question. So, uh, I agree

956
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.270
with Scott Sahan. Uh, Scott Sahan is a logician,

957
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.449
uh, who wrote a great recent book called Socialism.

958
00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:56.760
Uh A Logical Defense. People should read it if

959
00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.399
they get a chance. Uh But he points out

960
00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:01.159
correctly, I think uh that it's very easy again

961
00:44:01.169 --> 00:44:05.600
to uh think about political and economic systems uh

962
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.570
in these kind of bifurcated terms, right? You're either

963
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.709
a socialist society or a capitalist society, you're a

964
00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:12.459
liberal society or an authoritarian society. And he points

965
00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:15.040
out that in the real world, uh oftentimes what

966
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.169
we see instead is a continuum uh of different

967
00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:21.560
practices or a blend of different practices, right? Uh

968
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.176
And country in the world really has a mixed

969
00:44:24.186 --> 00:44:26.706
economy, right? Where the state does some things, private

970
00:44:26.716 --> 00:44:29.756
actors, do some things. Uh AND sometimes uh even

971
00:44:29.766 --> 00:44:32.176
international actors will do certain kinds of things. Uh

972
00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:34.976
And the argument that Scott Sahan points out is

973
00:44:34.986 --> 00:44:39.516
that uh the line between social democracy and socialism

974
00:44:39.555 --> 00:44:43.625
uh is somewhat blurry, right? Um There's a continuum

975
00:44:43.635 --> 00:44:46.395
uh uh sorry, the difference operates on a continuum

976
00:44:46.406 --> 00:44:48.716
rather than a strict either or. Uh SO the,

977
00:44:48.872 --> 00:44:52.941
that I interpret this difference is that social democracy,

978
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:57.471
generally speaking, uh has been much more oriented around

979
00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:01.191
redistributive policies uh that are intended to ameliorate inequality

980
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:04.751
and particularly to ameliorate the worst consequences of poverty

981
00:45:04.761 --> 00:45:07.862
rather than changing uh relations to production, to use

982
00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:11.531
the Marxist term. Uh BY, for instance, uh fundamentally

983
00:45:11.541 --> 00:45:15.632
challenging the power of capital or fundamentally challenging um

984
00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:18.949
the wage labor uh relationship. Uh And I argue

985
00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:21.719
that in a liberal socialist society, uh we would

986
00:45:21.729 --> 00:45:25.179
definitely want to engage in uh intensive redistributive schemess.

987
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.959
Uh I agree with Mill and Rawles about that.

988
00:45:27.129 --> 00:45:29.639
Uh But a good liberal social society would want

989
00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:32.159
to be much more militant uh in trying to

990
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.780
challenge the forms of domination that exist at the

991
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.709
level of the relations of production by moving towards

992
00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:40.739
something like uh workplace democracy. Uh WHICH again is

993
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.919
very much an idea that I draw from John

994
00:45:42.929 --> 00:45:45.334
Stuart Mill. Uh Now how this could be done

995
00:45:45.344 --> 00:45:47.754
practically. Uh I actually don't really have very much

996
00:45:47.764 --> 00:45:50.465
to say about that, unfortunately. Uh BECAUSE uh as

997
00:45:50.475 --> 00:45:52.354
somebody who operates in kind of a theoretical vein,

998
00:45:52.445 --> 00:45:55.034
uh practice isn't always uh my strong point. So

999
00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:56.895
I leave it to uh others who are far

1000
00:45:56.905 --> 00:45:58.925
smarter on this point than I am. Uh If

1001
00:45:58.935 --> 00:46:00.215
they like the idea to kind of take it

1002
00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.675
forward and roll with it. But I think that

1003
00:46:01.685 --> 00:46:03.594
would be the kind of core difference between a

1004
00:46:03.665 --> 00:46:06.395
social democrat uh and a liberal socialist. Although I

1005
00:46:06.405 --> 00:46:08.114
want to point out again, uh, this is a

1006
00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:11.485
difference of degree in many cases, uh, rather than

1007
00:46:11.495 --> 00:46:12.574
a kind of strict either or

1008
00:46:13.379 --> 00:46:15.939
so earlier, we've talked a little bit about Karl

1009
00:46:15.949 --> 00:46:20.729
Marx. What about communism specifically? I mean, how, how

1010
00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:25.120
would social or liberal socialism relate to communism?

1011
00:46:26.209 --> 00:46:28.439
So, it's a really good question, especially with relation

1012
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.679
to, uh, Marxist understanding communism. So, as everybody knows,

1013
00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:35.139
um, at least anybody who spent any time in

1014
00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:38.149
left circles anywhere. Uh The unfortunate reality is Marx

1015
00:46:38.159 --> 00:46:41.229
and Engels wrote very, very, very little about communism,

1016
00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:43.560
right? Um If you were to add up everything

1017
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.679
that they had to say about it uh Over

1018
00:46:45.689 --> 00:46:48.860
decades, uh it probably wouldn't amount to much more

1019
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.500
than 100 pages, right? Uh Which if you compare

1020
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.899
it to the thousands of pages uh that they

1021
00:46:54.909 --> 00:46:57.580
wrote about capital uh or even the hundreds of

1022
00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:02.199
pages that they would write about idiosyncratic uh idealist

1023
00:47:02.209 --> 00:47:05.070
philosophers like Mike Steiner. It's not very much, right.

1024
00:47:05.209 --> 00:47:08.070
Uh So it's hard to actually say what the

1025
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.760
Marxist vision of communism looks like. Uh JUST because

1026
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.750
they didn't really have very much to say about

1027
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.010
it, right? Uh In terms of what we can

1028
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.290
extrapolate, uh I would say that liberal socialists share

1029
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.360
with Marx the vision that he laid out quite

1030
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.679
beautifully actually. Uh IN capital volume three. So I

1031
00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:28.850
talked earlier about the developmental ethic, right? This idea

1032
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.350
that it's the development of human capacities or human

1033
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.500
powers uh that should be the end of a

1034
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.090
good society. Uh And in capital volume three, Marx

1035
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.270
expressly aligns himself uh with this ethic if you

1036
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.040
want to call it that uh although he probably

1037
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.770
wouldn't want to call it an ethic. Uh So

1038
00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.909
Mark says, look uh in capitalist society, it is

1039
00:47:47.919 --> 00:47:50.000
definitely the case uh that certain kinds of human

1040
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.260
powers are developed by capital. Um YOU know, to

1041
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.000
go back to the Adam Smith example, if I

1042
00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.419
am the owner of a pin factory and you

1043
00:47:58.429 --> 00:48:01.600
work in my pin factory, then needless to say,

1044
00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.020
I want to help you develop your power to

1045
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.939
make pins more effectively because that'll be beneficial to

1046
00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:09.330
me for pretty obvious reasons. Uh The problem is

1047
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.679
that I'm only gonna want to develop your powers

1048
00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:13.830
to make pins uh because that's the only thing

1049
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.520
that is profitable for my firm. Uh And this

1050
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.340
is one of the problems that Marx stresses again

1051
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.840
and again and again. Uh HOW under capitalism, the

1052
00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.649
only kinds of human powers that are developed for

1053
00:48:22.659 --> 00:48:26.149
many people uh are those that are necessary for

1054
00:48:26.159 --> 00:48:29.719
the pursuit of profit? Uh AND um efficiency within

1055
00:48:29.729 --> 00:48:31.919
firms, which means that the full range of human

1056
00:48:31.929 --> 00:48:34.629
powers that an individual might possess and might want

1057
00:48:34.639 --> 00:48:37.179
to develop uh never are, right? Uh And he

1058
00:48:37.189 --> 00:48:40.625
says that under communist society, uh the development of

1059
00:48:40.635 --> 00:48:42.955
human powers will no longer be a means the

1060
00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:44.915
way that it is under capitalism, right? A means

1061
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:47.685
uh to economic efficiency and profit seeking. Uh BUT

1062
00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:49.314
it'll be an end in itself for the first

1063
00:48:49.324 --> 00:48:52.014
time. Uh And I think that all liberal socialists

1064
00:48:52.024 --> 00:48:54.205
are committed to very much the same vision. Uh

1065
00:48:54.235 --> 00:48:56.344
Just to give two examples. Again, we talked about

1066
00:48:56.354 --> 00:48:59.955
uh John Stuart Mill, right, continuously emphasized uh the

1067
00:48:59.965 --> 00:49:03.274
importance of individuals becoming full sighted uh and developing

1068
00:49:03.284 --> 00:49:06.554
themselves like living trees uh that kind of extend

1069
00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:10.729
uh to their natural parameters. Uh And arguing that

1070
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:13.280
socialism was necessary to achieve that. Uh OR John

1071
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.629
Raws, right? Talked about him a few seconds ago.

1072
00:49:15.649 --> 00:49:17.889
Uh John Rawls very much emphasizes what he calls

1073
00:49:17.899 --> 00:49:21.199
the Aristotelian principle in theory of justice. Uh WHERE

1074
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:23.830
he says human beings very much like to exercise

1075
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.889
their fundamental capacities. Uh AND they enjoy developing those

1076
00:49:27.899 --> 00:49:31.439
capacities and becoming better at higher order activities. Uh

1077
00:49:31.449 --> 00:49:33.260
Whether again, it's playing the violin or writing a

1078
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.060
book or being a good father or a good

1079
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.409
football player, whatever it happens to be. Uh And

1080
00:49:37.419 --> 00:49:39.110
he points out how a good society uh will

1081
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.360
be committed to this Aristotelian principle in a very

1082
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.330
robust way. So that's where I think you can

1083
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.830
see a strong ethical symmetry uh between what's sometimes

1084
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.479
called Marx's Aristotelian or Hegelian vision uh of human

1085
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:55.110
development and liberal socialism's view of human development. Now,

1086
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.389
in terms of where there can be some contrast

1087
00:49:57.399 --> 00:49:59.760
in the book, I point out how uh in

1088
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:05.449
um the Communist Manifesto uh Marx and Engels argue

1089
00:50:05.459 --> 00:50:07.540
for uh what's sometimes called the form of democratic

1090
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.719
centralism that was profoundly influential on people like Lennon,

1091
00:50:10.729 --> 00:50:13.199
right? This idea that you'd have uh a vanguard

1092
00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:17.229
party uh or a uh proletarian party that would

1093
00:50:17.239 --> 00:50:20.919
seize power and substantiate a dictatorship of the proletariat

1094
00:50:20.929 --> 00:50:24.679
for a brief period of time, uh erode uh

1095
00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:27.439
private ownership of the means of production and eventually

1096
00:50:27.449 --> 00:50:30.000
uh work one's way uh to communism. And I

1097
00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.260
point out that any liberal socialist would be very

1098
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.209
critical of this idea of democratic centralism uh because

1099
00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:38.399
they'd be extremely anxious uh about allowing uh these

1100
00:50:38.409 --> 00:50:41.290
enormous powers to concentrate in the hands of a

1101
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.219
single party, even a proletarian party. Uh And I

1102
00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:47.239
think that the 20th century uh has borne out

1103
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.405
those anxieties very, very, very well, right? Uh WHATEVER

1104
00:50:50.415 --> 00:50:53.985
you think about Marxism, Leninism, uh or Maoism, very

1105
00:50:53.995 --> 00:50:56.685
few people would characterize the societies that they built

1106
00:50:56.794 --> 00:50:59.975
uh as democratic even if they were highly centralized

1107
00:51:00.074 --> 00:51:01.885
uh in certain kinds of ways. Uh Now I

1108
00:51:01.895 --> 00:51:03.864
point out in the book that Marx himself seems

1109
00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:07.625
to have drifted away uh from this political vision

1110
00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:09.564
uh of what communism would look like by the

1111
00:51:09.574 --> 00:51:11.264
time of pamphlets like uh the Civil War in

1112
00:51:11.274 --> 00:51:14.199
France. Um WHERE he points out instead actually, uh

1113
00:51:14.419 --> 00:51:18.090
what we have is a highly democratic, even hyper

1114
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.080
democratic uh national Assembly uh where people could elect

1115
00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:25.050
representatives uh to operate on their half, but then

1116
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.530
recall them uh at almost at any given moment.

1117
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.389
Uh And this National Assembly would have certain kinds

1118
00:51:30.399 --> 00:51:32.649
of powers uh to govern for the nation. Uh

1119
00:51:32.659 --> 00:51:36.129
But a lot of powers would be devolved to

1120
00:51:36.139 --> 00:51:39.149
regional councils and regional assemblies. Uh That would be

1121
00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:42.564
for organizing production and organizing social life uh in

1122
00:51:42.574 --> 00:51:44.564
different towns and cities. Uh And if you think

1123
00:51:44.574 --> 00:51:46.354
about it, that makes an awful lot of sense,

1124
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:49.465
right? Uh Marx wanted people to be involved in

1125
00:51:49.475 --> 00:51:52.544
their own self governance and be highly involved in

1126
00:51:52.554 --> 00:51:54.774
the production process. Uh The idea that this would

1127
00:51:54.784 --> 00:51:58.014
all be oriented by Paris or Berlin or wherever

1128
00:51:58.024 --> 00:51:59.594
it happens to be, uh would be an anemia

1129
00:51:59.745 --> 00:52:03.254
uh to this aspiration. Uh But again, he doesn't

1130
00:52:03.264 --> 00:52:06.979
really um defend this idea at any great length.

1131
00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:09.449
That's just kind of sketched out uh admiringly drawing

1132
00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.270
from the experience of the Congress Commune. Uh I

1133
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.449
think it could certainly an improvement uh on uh

1134
00:52:13.459 --> 00:52:16.750
democratic centralism circa the Communist Manifesto. Uh But it

1135
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.050
still has certain kind of foundational problems. Uh IN

1136
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.820
particular, the liberal in me is wary of this

1137
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.610
idea of giving uh the legislative branch of government

1138
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.080
uh just sweeping powers to make changes without any

1139
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:29.780
substantial checks imposed upon it uh by something like

1140
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.270
say, a bill of Rights, for example. Uh So

1141
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.719
again, I know I want to be too hard

1142
00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:39.090
on Marx um because many uh vulgarizes uh and

1143
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.590
reactionaries uh have wildly distorted his work in ways

1144
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.669
that are just unrecognizable and frankly, I think almost

1145
00:52:44.679 --> 00:52:47.330
illiterate. Uh, AND I'm a huge admirer of Marx.

1146
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.219
I do think that there are problems, uh, with

1147
00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:52.489
this, uh, and it, if you're going to try

1148
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.169
to make an argument for communism in the 21st

1149
00:52:55.179 --> 00:52:57.800
century it is incumbent upon you, uh, to, I

1150
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:02.120
think, answer, uh, many people's anxieties, uh, about why

1151
00:53:02.129 --> 00:53:05.040
many people who marched under, um, that banner in

1152
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.310
the past ended up marching people to some very

1153
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.000
dark places.

1154
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.060
Mhm uh So generally speaking, what would you say

1155
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.729
are perhaps some of the main shortcomings of liberal

1156
00:53:15.739 --> 00:53:16.500
socialism?

1157
00:53:17.159 --> 00:53:19.659
Yeah, I'm very grateful that you asked that question

1158
00:53:19.669 --> 00:53:21.739
actually because um as I point out in the

1159
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:23.439
book, uh and a few people have missed this

1160
00:53:23.449 --> 00:53:25.870
already. Uh That's just me being cranky. So I

1161
00:53:25.879 --> 00:53:28.469
apologize. Uh The book is not a defense of

1162
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:32.040
liberal socialism uh but a retrieval of rebel socialism.

1163
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.219
Uh So a retrieval is a term again uh

1164
00:53:34.229 --> 00:53:38.135
coined by cb mcpherson and refers to this historical

1165
00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:40.804
tendency to go back and to try to retrieve

1166
00:53:40.814 --> 00:53:45.195
um in a political tradition, egalitarian and Liberator impulses

1167
00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:48.675
and ideas that have maybe been forgotten um or

1168
00:53:48.685 --> 00:53:51.165
even actively sidelined. Uh And of course, I think

1169
00:53:51.175 --> 00:53:55.195
that liberal socialism is a Liberator and egalitarian doctrine

1170
00:53:55.205 --> 00:53:59.389
that is worth retrieving um well, for um intellectual

1171
00:53:59.399 --> 00:54:02.270
sake uh for intellectual reasons and also for political

1172
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.189
reasons. Uh But I point out in the book

1173
00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:06.270
that it's not a defense of liberal socialism because

1174
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.459
the reality is that liberal socialism in practice uh

1175
00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:12.780
was never really implemented in a particularly robust way.

1176
00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.850
Uh And where people tried to do so, uh

1177
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.520
it largely failed. Uh And so if anyone wants

1178
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:20.459
to identify with liberals socialism in the 21st century,

1179
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:23.030
uh then starting at a theoretical level, we need

1180
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.399
to ask ourselves, well, what are the fundamental problems

1181
00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:27.419
with this doctrine and how can we fix them?

1182
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.870
Uh So, in the book, I highlight a few

1183
00:54:29.879 --> 00:54:33.649
problems uh with historical liberal socialist political theory. Uh

1184
00:54:33.659 --> 00:54:36.729
I'll just gesture towards two, right? Uh Right now,

1185
00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:39.889
uh First off, I agree with uh Sheldon Wolin

1186
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.590
uh that thinkers like raws and thinkers like um

1187
00:54:43.139 --> 00:54:46.439
Mill have a very deficient understanding of the nature

1188
00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:50.300
of power, right? Uh They, if you compare their

1189
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.760
understanding of power to the theorization of somebody like

1190
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.090
um Karl Marx or Michelle Foucault or Wendy Brown

1191
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.040
for that matter. Uh One of Roland's uh favorite

1192
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.600
students. Uh It's just very clear that there's a

1193
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.550
fundamental lack of sophistication uh and liberal socialist political

1194
00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.750
theory. Uh There's no really uh refined understanding of

1195
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.090
ideology or discourse. Uh There's a very limited understanding

1196
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.169
of subjectivism, how different kinds of subjectivities are created.

1197
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.090
Uh YOU know, the different ways uh that media

1198
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.074
can operate to disseminate ideological views of the way

1199
00:55:23.084 --> 00:55:24.665
that, you know, say adorno would speak, we would

1200
00:55:24.675 --> 00:55:26.544
talk about that very robustly. None of that really

1201
00:55:26.554 --> 00:55:29.294
comes into play. And I think that a liberal

1202
00:55:29.304 --> 00:55:31.735
socialism in the 20th century has to be way,

1203
00:55:31.745 --> 00:55:34.524
way, way more sophisticated on questions of power uh

1204
00:55:34.534 --> 00:55:36.754
than it was in the past. Um And I

1205
00:55:36.764 --> 00:55:39.294
think that we see some progress towards that now.

1206
00:55:39.304 --> 00:55:43.280
Uh PEOPLE like um Tommy Shelby or Charles Mills,

1207
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.939
for example, uh who are two people I talk

1208
00:55:44.949 --> 00:55:46.669
about the end of the book are took pretty

1209
00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:48.679
foundational steps in that direction, but there's still a

1210
00:55:48.689 --> 00:55:50.669
long way to go. Uh The second thing that

1211
00:55:50.679 --> 00:55:54.070
I point out is that uh liberal socialists historically

1212
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:57.360
have had a very deficient understanding of capital as

1213
00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.419
a kind of global system uh of governance and

1214
00:56:00.429 --> 00:56:03.739
a political economy. Uh VERY often liberal socialists will

1215
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:07.936
focus almost uh manically uh on the state uh

1216
00:56:07.946 --> 00:56:10.585
as the kind of primary subject of justice. Uh

1217
00:56:10.595 --> 00:56:11.996
And you see that very clearly, for instance, if

1218
00:56:12.006 --> 00:56:14.785
somebody like John Rawls, right, John Rawls argues that

1219
00:56:14.855 --> 00:56:17.436
when we ruminate about justice is the basic structure,

1220
00:56:17.446 --> 00:56:19.696
basically the state uh that is the first subject

1221
00:56:19.706 --> 00:56:21.726
of justice. And in his work on things like

1222
00:56:21.736 --> 00:56:25.016
international relations or international justice, he just really does

1223
00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:26.916
not have very much of great interest to say.

1224
00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:28.795
Uh YOU can read the Laws of peoples and

1225
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:30.481
it's not a particularly good book and it's definitely

1226
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:32.731
not a very uh rich book compared to his

1227
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:36.102
other works. Uh And this is not tolerable uh

1228
00:56:36.112 --> 00:56:39.691
when we recognize that capitalism, which any liberal socialist

1229
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:41.582
has to be very critical of, is very much

1230
00:56:41.592 --> 00:56:44.882
a global system uh of political economy. Uh And

1231
00:56:44.892 --> 00:56:47.451
here again, I think is where liberal socialists have

1232
00:56:47.461 --> 00:56:50.691
a great deal to learn uh from Marxist theorists

1233
00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:54.082
uh like Nancy Frasier uh or Leo panic. Uh

1234
00:56:54.479 --> 00:56:56.540
It was at my alma mater passed away recently

1235
00:56:56.629 --> 00:56:58.770
uh to try to understand, you know, the way

1236
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:02.790
that uh global finance interacts with American imperialism, interacts

1237
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.129
with things like uh Western geopolitics, you name it

1238
00:57:06.139 --> 00:57:07.820
all that other stuff. Uh And then I guess

1239
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.260
I'll cheat and actually add a third point, which

1240
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:13.169
is that many liberal socialists uh historically have had

1241
00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:15.780
not had as much to say as they should

1242
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:19.850
about issues of racial uh inequality in particular. Uh

1243
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.719
A lot of liberal socialists are actually very good

1244
00:57:21.729 --> 00:57:24.320
on issues of gender inequality. Certainly for the time.

1245
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.389
Uh AGAIN, think about somebody like Mary Wilson craft,

1246
00:57:26.399 --> 00:57:28.669
right? Uh As proto liberal socialist or John ST

1247
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.750
Mill, right, who wrote a classic book, the subjection

1248
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.449
of women, uh probably the only feminist classic I

1249
00:57:33.459 --> 00:57:34.830
could think of. Uh THAT was written by a

1250
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.939
man. Uh But on issues of racial inequality, uh

1251
00:57:37.949 --> 00:57:41.409
many liberal socialists either had nothing of note to

1252
00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:44.530
say. Uh Sometimes they had peripherally good comments uh

1253
00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.199
like hoop houses, criticisms of imperialism, but nothing really

1254
00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:50.760
all that deep. Uh Or they even uh offered

1255
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.090
racist apologetics uh for imperialism. Uh And for this

1256
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.669
kind of chauvinistic western uh or white supremacist attitude

1257
00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.590
in the case of people like Mill. So we

1258
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.489
need to be very, very critical of that in

1259
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.409
the tradition of liberal socialism. Uh AND much more

1260
00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:07.590
aware of the different ways that racism precludes the

1261
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.679
pursuit of uh economic equality and society is oriented

1262
00:58:10.689 --> 00:58:11.669
around non domination.

1263
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.169
Yeah. So I need to ask you now, since

1264
00:58:15.179 --> 00:58:19.250
we now currently live under um under neo liberal

1265
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.989
capitalism since the 19 eighties and with its rise

1266
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.510
and its association with things like neoconservative foreign policy

1267
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.510
and social conservative moralism. Um How does liberal socialism

1268
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.810
relate to it?

1269
00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:39.360
Well, liberal socialism is extremely critical uh of neoliberalism,

1270
00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.629
right? Uh I don't know if I would go

1271
00:58:41.639 --> 00:58:44.919
as far as people like Michael Frieden uh in

1272
00:58:44.929 --> 00:58:50.280
arguing that neoliberalism uh self description, notwithstanding uh doesn't

1273
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.979
even count as a species of liberalism. Uh Although

1274
00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:54.739
there are good arguments you can make to that

1275
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:59.060
effect, right? Uh But I think that neoliberalism belongs

1276
00:58:59.649 --> 00:59:02.600
in the liberal family uh with the major caveat

1277
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:05.330
being that uh even if neoliberalism belongs in the

1278
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.979
same liberal family as liberal socialism, uh Anybody who

1279
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:10.629
has been in a family will know that there

1280
00:59:10.639 --> 00:59:12.439
are many family members that you don't like. Uh

1281
00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:14.590
And very often times you'll have family members like

1282
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.280
your uncle or your aunt, where you'll think God,

1283
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:19.060
how are we even related, right? Uh So I

1284
00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:23.290
argue that neoliberalism uh its ideological roots can be

1285
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.474
traced back to again what mcpherson called possessive individualism,

1286
00:59:26.483 --> 00:59:29.164
right? This idea that uh the proper way to

1287
00:59:29.174 --> 00:59:33.273
anthropologically understand individuals is this kind of in uh

1288
00:59:33.283 --> 00:59:37.884
atomic units, all competitive, all pursuing their self interest

1289
00:59:37.894 --> 00:59:40.414
without regard to one another. Uh AND ultimately uh

1290
00:59:40.424 --> 00:59:43.374
oriented by this acquisitive ethic. Uh THE idea that

1291
00:59:43.444 --> 00:59:46.513
acquiring more and gratifying more of one's desires uh

1292
00:59:46.523 --> 00:59:49.788
is the ultimate and in life. Uh What neoliberalism

1293
00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:53.738
adds to this interestingly enough, uh Wa Hayek especially

1294
00:59:53.748 --> 00:59:55.798
uh is that if you are actually go, if

1295
00:59:55.808 --> 00:59:57.617
you're going to create a society of people that

1296
00:59:57.627 --> 01:00:00.907
are committed uh to this Anthropic vision, uh We're

1297
01:00:00.917 --> 01:00:02.498
actually gonna need the states to play a much

1298
01:00:02.508 --> 01:00:05.627
more active role uh in producing the conditions uh

1299
01:00:05.637 --> 01:00:08.258
where people will act this way uh Than earlier

1300
01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:10.627
proponents of Laissez Faire uh would have thought was

1301
01:00:10.637 --> 01:00:14.271
appropriate. Uh So Hayek, for instance, and numerous works

1302
01:00:14.281 --> 01:00:16.721
uh used to say uh this idea of Laissez

1303
01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:21.521
Faire uh is a complete nonstarter. Uh NO liberal

1304
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:23.122
as he understood them has ever been committed to

1305
01:00:23.132 --> 01:00:25.802
Laissez Faire, that is an anarchist position. Uh Every

1306
01:00:25.812 --> 01:00:27.802
liberal understands that the state needs to play a

1307
01:00:27.812 --> 01:00:31.201
very active role in creating the conditions uh for

1308
01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.362
what he thought an appropriate market society should look

1309
01:00:33.372 --> 01:00:35.582
like. And of course, this could take some pretty

1310
01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:38.025
dark turns. Uh If you think about, for instance,

1311
01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.825
uh Hayek support of things uh like uh Pinochet's

1312
01:00:41.025 --> 01:00:43.186
Chile uh where, you know, he famously would say

1313
01:00:43.196 --> 01:00:45.206
things like uh if the choice is between a

1314
01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:49.785
democratic socialism. Uh Ala Allende uh or an authoritarian

1315
01:00:49.795 --> 01:00:54.615
liberalism so-called really neoliberalism. Uh Ala Pinochet. Uh Then,

1316
01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:58.635
absolutely. Uh I'm in favor of an authoritarian neoliberalism.

1317
01:00:58.746 --> 01:01:02.045
Uh AND liberal socialist uh would be very critical

1318
01:01:02.055 --> 01:01:05.409
of that from a theoretical down to a political

1319
01:01:05.419 --> 01:01:08.739
level. Right? Uh Obviously, we have very different understandings

1320
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.800
of how individuals flourish uh via this commitment to

1321
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:16.149
methodological collectivism and normative individualism. Uh We have very

1322
01:01:16.159 --> 01:01:19.300
different understandings of the kind of political institutions that

1323
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:21.909
would be required uh to secure people's liberty. Uh

1324
01:01:21.919 --> 01:01:24.780
And liberal socialists, I would argue are far more

1325
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.600
sensitive uh to how economic forms of domination and

1326
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:32.610
subordination uh are in many ways the most impactful

1327
01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:36.350
forms uh of domination that people experience. Uh And

1328
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.560
that a good liberal society needs to not just

1329
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.560
protect them against that. Uh But actually needs to

1330
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.469
empower them uh to seize control of their economic

1331
01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:47.379
destiny for themselves rather than having their economic destiny

1332
01:01:47.389 --> 01:01:50.120
be basically held by capitalists.

1333
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.449
Yeah. So, uh when I asked you about the

1334
01:01:54.459 --> 01:01:57.709
shortcomings of liberal socialism, one of the topics you

1335
01:01:57.719 --> 01:02:03.560
mentioned was racism. What is black, liberal socialism? And

1336
01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.310
what would you say it adds to the overall

1337
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.330
picture of liberal socialism?

1338
01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:11.560
Yeah, absolutely. So, uh one of the chapters in

1339
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.479
the book that I'm most fond of uh is

1340
01:02:13.489 --> 01:02:15.179
a chapter on a man called Charles Mills uh

1341
01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:18.159
who probably is less well known to many people

1342
01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:20.909
uh certainly than uh Karl Marx and John Rawls,

1343
01:02:20.919 --> 01:02:23.719
uh which uh is a real shame. Uh So

1344
01:02:23.729 --> 01:02:26.139
Charles Mill uh Mills uh started off as a

1345
01:02:26.149 --> 01:02:29.270
Marxist uh later drifted towards becoming what he called

1346
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.780
a black radical liberal uh for a variety of

1347
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.219
different reasons. Uh But probably his most famous book

1348
01:02:34.229 --> 01:02:36.320
is a book called The Racial Contract uh where

1349
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:41.149
he pointed out that there's long been these apologies

1350
01:02:41.159 --> 01:02:44.290
uh for liberalism that have been put forward, uh

1351
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.080
Certainly from the 19 sixties onward, that suggests, uh,

1352
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:50.629
look liberal is liberals here and there, uh might

1353
01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:52.780
have endorsed the odd racist view, might have endorsed

1354
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.199
the odd uh bit of imperialism here or there.

1355
01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:56.610
Uh But for the most part, they were pretty

1356
01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.830
good on issues of race. Uh And even where

1357
01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.560
they weren't, uh, racism is in no way a

1358
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:07.020
um predominant feature uh of the liberal tradition and

1359
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.260
certainly not a predominant feature uh of any major

1360
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:12.209
liberals thought. Uh AND mills really challenged this view

1361
01:03:12.219 --> 01:03:14.760
quite foundation, uh where he pointed out that if

1362
01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.560
you read the works of someone like Emmanuel can't,

1363
01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.239
for example, uh they are saturated uh with certain

1364
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:23.199
kinds of racial supers, presuppositions, uh can't even developed

1365
01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:25.540
an elaborate, I don't say that as a positive

1366
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.699
uh racial typology, uh ranking different races. Uh AND

1367
01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:31.016
again, implying very heavily, uh that some of them

1368
01:03:31.025 --> 01:03:33.736
uh were just in a immature state, uh and

1369
01:03:33.746 --> 01:03:36.635
almost incapable of self governance. Uh And he points

1370
01:03:36.645 --> 01:03:38.456
out that, you know, John Stuart Mill, who again,

1371
01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:41.706
I write admiringly about uh was a fierce proponent

1372
01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:45.375
of euro imperialism. Uh ARGUING that this would be

1373
01:03:45.385 --> 01:03:47.775
to the benefit uh of many peoples in the

1374
01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:49.895
world because they were also were not capable of

1375
01:03:49.906 --> 01:03:52.075
self governance. Uh And so having the British uh

1376
01:03:52.085 --> 01:03:54.635
run their societies for them uh would help them

1377
01:03:54.645 --> 01:03:57.251
mature uh or for a sufficiently long period of

1378
01:03:57.261 --> 01:04:00.791
time. And I think that Charles Mills uh analysis

1379
01:04:00.802 --> 01:04:03.251
of the subject matters is eye opening, right? Uh

1380
01:04:03.261 --> 01:04:06.931
And revealing just how much the liberal tradition has

1381
01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:10.271
to answer for on the front of racial inequality.

1382
01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:14.251
Uh Now, mill identifying as a black radical liberal

1383
01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:16.632
uh is not rejecting the liberal tradition, right? He

1384
01:04:16.642 --> 01:04:19.912
says, look, uh the principles that people like John

1385
01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:23.417
Rawls espoused can't espouse are all sound. Uh But

1386
01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:26.458
we need to recognize that they never extended them

1387
01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:29.177
in any meaningful way uh to racialized groups that

1388
01:04:29.187 --> 01:04:32.488
they regarded as their inferiors. And very obviously, contemporary

1389
01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:35.558
liberals need to do that. Uh And if we're

1390
01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:37.278
going to do that seriously, it's gonna entail two

1391
01:04:37.288 --> 01:04:39.187
different things. Uh First off, it's going to mean

1392
01:04:39.218 --> 01:04:42.298
acknowledging that many liberals were racist uh and endorse

1393
01:04:42.308 --> 01:04:45.708
racist policies. Uh And we need to be attentive

1394
01:04:45.818 --> 01:04:48.194
and mindful of that history. Uh And second, we

1395
01:04:48.204 --> 01:04:50.593
need to recognize that liberal societies might need to

1396
01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:54.043
engage in reparative activities uh to try to offset

1397
01:04:54.053 --> 01:04:56.964
uh the consequences of long histories of racism. Whether

1398
01:04:56.974 --> 01:04:58.974
in the United States or the Caribbean Islands. Uh

1399
01:04:59.174 --> 01:05:01.464
Right. You know, um Charles Mills was Caribbean uh

1400
01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:03.894
or elsewhere. Right. Uh And I think that there's

1401
01:05:03.904 --> 01:05:07.253
a lot to this. Uh UNFORTUNATELY, Charles Mills passed

1402
01:05:07.263 --> 01:05:09.843
away quite recently actually. Uh WHEN he was just

1403
01:05:09.854 --> 01:05:12.674
really um starting to develop the program of black

1404
01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:16.090
radical liberalism uh in books like uh Black rights

1405
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.370
white wrongs. Uh AND his essay on We Du

1406
01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:21.040
Bois. Uh But in terms of the socialist dimension

1407
01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.250
of this, uh in his essay on We Du

1408
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.969
Bois. Uh AND in some of the writings in

1409
01:05:24.979 --> 01:05:27.639
the aforementioned book, uh he says, look, Black radical

1410
01:05:27.649 --> 01:05:30.090
liberalism will obviously be a species of left liberalism

1411
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.850
economically. Uh It's incompatible with command economic socialism. Uh

1412
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.820
But probably not economic uh sorry, incompatible with market

1413
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.760
socialism. Uh And he starts to say that's probably

1414
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.239
what we should do economically uh again, sadly, passed

1415
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.810
away before we started to see more of this.

1416
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.500
Uh WHICH I'm personally quite sad about because I

1417
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.629
would have been very interested in it. Uh But

1418
01:05:49.639 --> 01:05:53.100
uh he lays out a preliminary schema uh that

1419
01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.020
I'm hoping that future scholars might pick up if

1420
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.790
they're interested uh in developing black radicalism more for.

1421
01:05:59.139 --> 01:06:02.000
So I have one last question then, uh how

1422
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:05.020
do you look at the future of liberal socialism?

1423
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.419
Do you have any specific traditions about how it

1424
01:06:08.429 --> 01:06:09.879
would evolve in the future?

1425
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:16.379
Well, I am optimistic, intellectually and pessimistic politically uh

1426
01:06:16.469 --> 01:06:18.520
which truthfully is not a great position to be

1427
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:22.429
in. So I'd much rather be optimistic politically and

1428
01:06:22.439 --> 01:06:26.370
pessimistic intellectually. I'm optimistic intellectually because I think that

1429
01:06:26.379 --> 01:06:29.800
there's been a real surge of interest in if

1430
01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:31.570
not liberal socialism, at least something that looks a

1431
01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.270
lot like it. Uh Just to list off a

1432
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.370
couple of uh examples. Uh PEOPLE like Samuel Moyne

1433
01:06:36.379 --> 01:06:39.830
and Elizabeth Anderson and Daniel Chandler and Helen mccabe

1434
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.699
and Eagle Shirt Broad. Uh Helena Rosenblatt have all

1435
01:06:42.709 --> 01:06:47.179
produced very interesting books recently. Uh ARGUING for revisiting

1436
01:06:47.189 --> 01:06:49.600
the liberal tradition, recognizing how much of a debt

1437
01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:52.550
it many liberal figures owe socialism. Uh OR even

1438
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.310
arguing overtly for various forms uh of liberal socialism.

1439
01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320
If we think about people like uh Will Edmondson

1440
01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:59.449
with his recent book, um John Stri Mill Redis

1441
01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:02.100
Socialist for Cambridge University Press. So I think that

1442
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.729
intellectually we're in really great shape, right? Uh There's

1443
01:07:04.739 --> 01:07:07.810
some very exciting work that's being done in economics,

1444
01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.139
political theory, um Cultural theory, you name it. Uh

1445
01:07:11.149 --> 01:07:14.610
And I think that if allowed to continue, uh

1446
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.669
the future will be bright from an academic, scholarly

1447
01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:20.870
and uh intellectual standpoint politically though the reality is

1448
01:07:20.879 --> 01:07:23.010
that it's the far right. Uh THAT is ascendant

1449
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.889
all around the globe right now. Uh By the

1450
01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:27.770
time, you know, this airs the US election will

1451
01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.889
be done, uh It's possible that Donald Trump will

1452
01:07:29.899 --> 01:07:31.629
be defeated. It's also very possible he might have

1453
01:07:31.639 --> 01:07:34.590
won. Uh But whatever the case is, uh the

1454
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.709
fact that this is such a close election, uh

1455
01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.320
really demonstrates that there's a mass appeal uh to

1456
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:43.090
a lot of far, right, illiberal ideas. Uh And

1457
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.489
I guess it's a good place to close because

1458
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.879
the reality is, I think that if the far

1459
01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:50.330
right is ascended everywhere, uh, liberals have only themselves

1460
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.969
to blame for that and I include myself in

1461
01:07:51.979 --> 01:07:54.850
this. Uh And that is because for decades now,

1462
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.340
uh liberals have been committed to neo liberal policies

1463
01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:01.770
that were uninspired in theory and proved enormously uninspiring

1464
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.810
in practice. Uh And if people are rejecting liberalism

1465
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.739
for being coextensive with neoliberalism, uh you can't really

1466
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.070
blame them because liberals did not offer a sense

1467
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.399
that hope for a better society was genuinely possible.

1468
01:08:14.449 --> 01:08:16.160
Uh This is a point that Sam Moyne makes

1469
01:08:16.169 --> 01:08:18.359
beautifully in his book, Liberalism Against Its Health, the

1470
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:20.520
way he points out if liberals are not able

1471
01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.509
to offer people en masse a sense of hope

1472
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.750
for the future, uh Then we are unlikely to

1473
01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:28.270
see our creed survive into the 21st century. Uh

1474
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.459
And the sad reality is that survival is not

1475
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:33.180
good enough. Uh We need to not just inspire

1476
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:36.689
uh this feeling that liberalism is the best of

1477
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.990
very bad alternatives. Uh But something that actually should

1478
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.180
inspire love uh and inspire passion. Uh And I

1479
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:45.399
think that liberal socialism is a liberalism of hope.

1480
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:47.549
It does offer a vision for a better future.

1481
01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.259
All the problems that I pointed out in the

1482
01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.774
tradition. Notwithstanding, I think it is worth worth giving

1483
01:08:51.785 --> 01:08:53.924
a chance to. Uh AND I would hope that

1484
01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:56.995
people would take it seriously as a political doctrine

1485
01:08:57.075 --> 01:09:00.035
uh and try to find ways to instantiate it

1486
01:09:00.044 --> 01:09:02.194
in practice because I think that something very much

1487
01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:03.924
like it is needed if we're going to prevent

1488
01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:05.604
the far right from gaining power everywhere in the

1489
01:09:05.615 --> 01:09:06.415
21st century.

1490
01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.200
Great. So the book is again, the Political Theory

1491
01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:12.790
of liberal socialism. I'm leaving a link to it

1492
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:15.580
in the description of the interview and Doctor mcmanus

1493
01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:18.549
just before we go apart from the book, where

1494
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.990
can people find you on the internet?

1495
01:09:21.298 --> 01:09:23.528
Sure. If people want, they can email me uh

1496
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:27.099
Matt mcmanus 300 at gmail.com. Uh I do my

1497
01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:29.988
best to answer emails. Uh So if I don't

1498
01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.488
respond to you, it might just be that you

1499
01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:33.438
wound up in spam. So send it again. I'll

1500
01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:35.148
do my best uh or they can add me

1501
01:09:35.158 --> 01:09:38.219
on uh Twitter uh at Matt Pulp Prof. Um

1502
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:39.719
And again, I try to be pretty responsive to

1503
01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.269
those things. So get in touch with me. Happy

1504
01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.707
to chat if uh you're interested.

1505
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.729
