00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode. And today

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.869
I have here is a very special guest, Doctor

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:08.829
Richard Wolf. He's professor of Economics Emeritus at the

4
00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:13.619
University of Massachusetts Amherst. And today, we're talking about

5
00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.540
socialism and Marxism, perhaps trying to tackle some common

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.260
misconceptions about them. So, Doctor Wolf, welcome to the

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.620
show. It's an honor to everyone.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.840
Thank you very much, Ricardo. I'm very glad to

9
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.370
be here. So,

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.229
as I said at the beginning, uh, um, we're

11
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.500
going to talk about socialism and Marxism. I would

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.580
like to start with socialism and as we do

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.939
so, I would like to also perhaps try to

14
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.720
tackle some common misconceptions about it and Marxism later

15
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.619
on. So, how would you characterize socialism? What are

16
00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.340
its main tenants?

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.700
Socialism has meant different things to different people at

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.340
different moments in now a history that is 2

19
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.930
centuries old. Uh, THE reality is it begins to

20
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.459
be a common idea, a common name, early in

21
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.769
the 19th century, becoming more and more important across

22
00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:19.139
the 19th, then across the 20th century. It spread

23
00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:24.580
from Europe, where it began to now being uh

24
00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.220
a movement of sorts that is global. So, as

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.580
movements of human beings go, it is one of

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.129
the more successful. It has grown to a global

27
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:44.139
institution in a very short historical time. And of

28
00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:50.239
course, any idea, any tradition that grows so quickly

29
00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:56.660
across so many different societies will show differences in

30
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.720
one place from another, in one century from another.

31
00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:05.260
To expect socialism to have one definition all the

32
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.660
time is silly. It means you don't understand how

33
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.770
human thinking evolves. Having said that, let's go through

34
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.440
briefly what is common to the different approaches and

35
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.419
how they differ. The most common basic impulse behind

36
00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.899
socialism is really very simple to express. It's the

37
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:36.729
idea that we as human beings can do better

38
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.179
than capitalism. Capitalism is what we have. Capitalism is

39
00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:47.330
what we know. Capitalism also grew. Over the last

40
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.600
4 or 5 centuries. It's older than socialism. Why?

41
00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:58.809
Because socialism is a reaction against capitalism. It is

42
00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:06.729
capitalism's self-criticism. And so it has evolved with capitalism.

43
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.820
I make a joke for people to understand this

44
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.500
idea by saying nothing better guarantees the future of

45
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.610
socialism than capitalism. As long as we have capitalism,

46
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.220
it will continue to provoke and to create and

47
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.119
to recreate socialism. Even if you look at the

48
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:38.660
20th century's efforts to destroy, literally, to kill and

49
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.229
imprison and persecute socialists and communists of all kinds,

50
00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.440
whether Hitler in Germany or Mussolini or Salazar, or

51
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.550
Franco, any of them. They went to enormous lengths

52
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.529
in Spain, they had a civil war, etc. It

53
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.009
didn't work. Socialism came right back as we knew

54
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:07.660
it would because they instituted capitalism, and that always

55
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.649
provokes in people. It's a little bit this way.

56
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.029
In slavery, eventually the slaves said we can't stand

57
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.108
this anymore. We can do better as a society

58
00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:25.190
than slavery, and they did. And in feudalism, the

59
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.260
serfs did better than feudalism, and eventually they did.

60
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.720
In capitalism, it's the employee class, the working class,

61
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.269
which has the idea we can do better, and

62
00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:45.170
I am personally quite convinced that they will. So

63
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.010
that's what all socialists more or less can agree

64
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.829
to, that we can do better than Capitalism. After

65
00:04:55.829 --> 00:05:01.029
that, what they mean by better varies, and I,

66
00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.200
I don't have time to give you the many

67
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.200
different forms it takes, but I'm gonna give you

68
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.000
two or three of the major ones. So, one

69
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.559
idea of socialism, the one you will find in

70
00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.519
much of Western Europe and beyond, is the idea

71
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:23.510
that socialism is when the working class takes power.

72
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.890
Usually through a parliamentary voting, but sometimes by revolution,

73
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.739
the government takes power and regulates and controls private

74
00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:40.239
capitalists. So they must pay a certain level of

75
00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.609
wages. They cannot do what they want with workers.

76
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.880
They have to make employment secure. They have to

77
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.670
provide a national health for everybody, a health insurance.

78
00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:57.380
They um must give workers so many weeks of

79
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.450
paid vacation every year. In other words, it is

80
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.140
what we sometimes call capitalism with a human face.

81
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:11.410
And that's the position of most socialist parties in

82
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.480
Western Europe. That's what the German Socialist Party does,

83
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.519
that's what the Italians did, that's what the French

84
00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:22.760
do, etc. ETC. ETC. Labour Party, uh, in England.

85
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.440
That's one kind of socialism. There is nobody who

86
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.279
issues a permission to use the name socialism. Anybody

87
00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:36.000
watching this program one day can wake up and

88
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.209
say, I'm a socialist, and that's perfectly all right.

89
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.040
There is no, you don't have to have a

90
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.000
license, no permit, no nothing, OK. Here's a second

91
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.200
kind of socialism. In the second kind of socialism,

92
00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:56.359
associated mostly with the Soviet Union in the 20th

93
00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:01.660
century, The government not only regulates and controls, but

94
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.299
it takes a further step. It owns and operates

95
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:15.190
enterprises, industrial enterprises, agricultural enterprises. The government, instead of

96
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.260
regulating, takes ownership. It allows the government, of course,

97
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.709
to control much more than it would if it

98
00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:27.059
were in the Western European model of a government

99
00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.829
that merely regulates, but leaves the enterprise in the

100
00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:36.200
hands of the private capitalists. So the Soviet Union

101
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.850
had another kind of socialism. By the way, here

102
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:48.570
in America, Americans whose um political literacy is, I'll

103
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.070
try to be polite now, quite limited. Uh, THEY,

104
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.190
they look upon the Soviet Union as a communist

105
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.470
country, and, and, and people in, in Europe do

106
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.929
that too. That's of course a mistake. The Soviet

107
00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:09.220
Union never claimed that it was a communist country.

108
00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:12.670
It had a communist party, but lots of countries

109
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.839
have that. What the Communist Party had done was

110
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:24.079
to establish Soviet socialism and communism maybe they could

111
00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:27.149
get to in the future. To call that society

112
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:32.400
communist means either you're ignorant or you have some

113
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.440
political motivation in making this confusion, but we don't

114
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.039
have to be confused here. That's another kind of

115
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:45.059
socialism. Alright, here's now a 3rd kind, that's very

116
00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:49.619
important in the world today. The example here is

117
00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:54.789
the People's Republic of China. That is a hybrid

118
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.020
of the first two. It's a country that is

119
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:05.869
roughly half government regulated private capitalist enterprises. And the

120
00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:11.630
other half, Soviet style government ownership and operation of

121
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.909
enterprises. So it's half the one kind of socialism,

122
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.919
half the other, and that makes it a yet

123
00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:24.219
another variety of what socialism can mean. And the

124
00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:31.469
Chinese call what they have socialism with Chinese characteristics.

125
00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:35.960
Well, the big characteristic is this hybrid, this 50/50

126
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.429
split between the two others. Finally, there is a

127
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:47.950
whole another tradition within socialism. That is critical of

128
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.789
the 1st 3, the Western European, the Soviet, and

129
00:09:51.789 --> 00:09:57.400
the Chinese. The criticism here goes like this. You

130
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.099
have made many changes that are improvements on capitalism,

131
00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:07.020
but You have not, or at least not yet,

132
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:14.830
transformed the workplace, the actual factory or office or

133
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:20.070
store where people come together to do work of

134
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.650
one kind or another. And we socialists, these folks

135
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.530
say, for us, socialism beyond whatever you do in

136
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.489
terms of government and private, has to include the

137
00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:39.450
transformation of the workplace. And what do they mean?

138
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.130
They mean the democratization of the workplace. So that

139
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.650
no longer do a small group of people, the

140
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.890
owner of the enterprise, the board of directors in

141
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.760
the corporation, a tiny group of people no longer

142
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.979
have the power to decide. What gets produced, what

143
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:05.010
technology is used, where the production happens, and what

144
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.409
is done with the product. That now has to

145
00:11:08.409 --> 00:11:15.809
become democratized and we socialists, this fourth kind, that's

146
00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:20.864
our primary focus now. We want to transform. From

147
00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:27.575
the hierarchical capitalist organization of production to a democratic

148
00:11:27.924 --> 00:11:32.784
socialist form. Those are the four major, and each

149
00:11:32.784 --> 00:11:37.664
of them has variations, but that's what socialism in

150
00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:41.784
today's world is all about, and it means that

151
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:47.700
socialists are busy fighting for one or the other

152
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.679
or combinations of these four basic varieties.

153
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.929
So let me ask you, since at a certain

154
00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:57.690
point you mentioned Soviet Russia and I also would

155
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.099
like to have Mao's China to the picture here.

156
00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:04.929
So what impact do you think that Soviet Russia

157
00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:08.580
and Mao's China have on how people look at

158
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.919
socialism and communism, even people on the left?

159
00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:16.770
Well, it, it, the first answer to your question

160
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.260
is it depends on what information about the Soviet

161
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.099
Union and Mao they got, who provided the information,

162
00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:31.429
because we've been in a Cold War, let's call

163
00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:35.570
it, uh, for the entire history of modern socialism,

164
00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:44.500
uh. Let's remember, inside capitalism, socialism has been persecuted,

165
00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:48.739
hounded, killed, imprisoned, and it's not as though we've

166
00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:54.549
had a conversation that's polite and OK. Occasionally there

167
00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:58.150
have been small periods of time in one country

168
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.900
or another where you could actually have an honest

169
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.140
conversation between pro and anti-socialists, and they could argue

170
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.599
and make their argument, that does happen. But most

171
00:13:11.599 --> 00:13:16.510
of the time, there's an enormous overlay of propaganda.

172
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.919
It's mostly anti-socialist propaganda, but at least in the

173
00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:23.440
Soviet Union and China, you have a little bit

174
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.119
the other way, propaganda going in the opposite direction.

175
00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:30.250
Anyway, to answer your question as best I can,

176
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:36.099
the Soviet Union was the first major country. To

177
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:42.619
be captured politically by a socialist political movement. That

178
00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:46.780
had not happened before. The closest thing was a

179
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.929
few weeks in 1871 when you had something called

180
00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:57.130
the Paris Commune, in Paris, France. And that was

181
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.099
the model, if you know the history, that was

182
00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:04.130
the model that Lenin and others in the leadership

183
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.340
of the Bolshevik Party in Russia, they used the

184
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.380
essays Marx had written because Marx was alive at

185
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.299
the time of the Paris commune, and his people

186
00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:19.929
participated in that commune, so he knew very well

187
00:14:20.099 --> 00:14:23.780
what happened there. Lenin studied all of that writing.

188
00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:29.049
So the Russians were the first nation to try

189
00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:34.880
to build a socialist economy. Now what that means

190
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.599
is they didn't have any model other than the

191
00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:42.280
few weeks of the Paris commune, and that wasn't

192
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.960
that much of a model because they didn't have

193
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.080
a chance to do very much before the French

194
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.320
army came in and by the way, killed large

195
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.270
numbers of the people who led the Paris commune.

196
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.409
You can see their monuments in the Pere Lachaise

197
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:04.400
uh cemetery in Paris to this day. So, What

198
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.840
I would say to people is, the first thing

199
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.809
you should understand is that the Russians were an

200
00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:15.559
experiment. They had no blueprints. They didn't have any

201
00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:19.080
clear idea of what they should do. After the

202
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:25.760
revolution succeeds in 1917, they immediately plunge into a

203
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.650
civil war. Into a war against foreign armies coming

204
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:38.390
in to undo the revolution. France, Britain, Japan, and

205
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:43.520
the United States landed troops in Russia to defeat

206
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.320
the new socialist government. And there was still the

207
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.150
leftover of World War One, because that had been,

208
00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:54.549
uh, Russia had been involved and had suffered enormous

209
00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:58.869
damage in the war. So here is an experiment

210
00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:03.080
that has to cope with a World War, with

211
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.559
a revolution, with a civil war, and a foreign

212
00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:11.679
invasion. They did the best they could. The major

213
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:17.309
achievement was to survive. They were able to survive.

214
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.840
They won the Civil War, they pushed out the

215
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.840
foreign invaders. They signed a treaty to leave World

216
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.520
War One. It's amazing what they accomplished. But they

217
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.849
were just the first experiment. So they made lots

218
00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:41.739
of mistakes. That's what the first experiment in everything

219
00:16:42.049 --> 00:16:44.849
does, whether it's in a laboratory or from a

220
00:16:44.849 --> 00:16:48.690
scientist, or it's a social experiment, or it's a

221
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.239
personal experiment, you are learning as you are going.

222
00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:58.210
So, the history of the Soviet Union teaches the

223
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:04.430
broader socialist movement. Things to do that work, and

224
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.390
things not to do because they fail. And you

225
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.709
need, if you're honest, to draw the lesson from

226
00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:15.949
the Soviet Union, what to build on and what

227
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:20.048
to avoid. And that's what socialists have done. They've

228
00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:24.358
tried to build on, but also to avoid. And

229
00:17:24.358 --> 00:17:30.010
they've done a perfectly reasonable job. Eastern Europe, that's

230
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.849
a product of World War II, because the Germans

231
00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:38.000
and the Russians fought that war, the Russians wanted

232
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.569
a uh a stripe of countries from the Baltic

233
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.920
states in the north to Bulgaria in the south,

234
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.040
to be a kind of a buffer between Russia

235
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.000
and Western Europe. The same issue that now produces

236
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.479
the Ukraine war, same issue of the security of

237
00:17:58.479 --> 00:18:03.959
Russia relative to the danger they feel from Western

238
00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:09.040
Europe, which they should. Let me remind everyone, after

239
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.760
the Russian Revolution, the French, the British, the Japanese,

240
00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:20.750
and the Americans landed troops in those countries. To

241
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.949
overthrow the government. Russia never sent any troops to

242
00:18:25.949 --> 00:18:30.189
any of those countries to overthrow their governments. There's

243
00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:34.670
no comparison here. And if you didn't know that,

244
00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:38.739
shame on you. That you should know, that's a

245
00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:42.500
fact you can verify in any history book you

246
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.869
want. OK. Capitalism, while all this is going on,

247
00:18:49.239 --> 00:18:56.510
provoked socialists in other countries, in Cuba, in Korea,

248
00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.469
in China, in Vietnam, and I could go on.

249
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.520
But in those that I listed, they too then

250
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.780
made efforts to go beyond the capitalism. And what

251
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.500
did they do? They learned from the experience of

252
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.680
the Soviet Union. Up until 1989, they got help

253
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.829
from the Soviet Union, as well as advice and

254
00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:29.790
as well as lessons. After the collapse of the

255
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:36.630
Soviet Union, around 1989, 1990, these societies had to

256
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.000
develop on their own, and they have now made

257
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:47.520
further developments and experiments. In the early years of

258
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.329
the Chinese revolution, The big uniqueness of China. WAS

259
00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:58.030
gathered around the figure of Mao Zedong, their most

260
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:04.270
important leader. He had had his own idea of

261
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:10.079
how to make a Soviet style revolution in China.

262
00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:14.660
And one of the big differences was in Russia,

263
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:19.329
in the Soviet Union, the revolution was concentrated in

264
00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:27.140
the small urban industrial center of Russia. For Mao,

265
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.689
China didn't have that. So he built his revolution

266
00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:38.609
in the rural agricultural portions, interior portions of China.

267
00:20:39.349 --> 00:20:43.849
He was driven out. Of Shanghai and those other

268
00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:49.630
cities by the right wing pro-capitalist Chiang Kai-shek government

269
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.949
of China. Hounded by them, arrested by them, many

270
00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:58.069
people killed by them. So he went into the

271
00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:05.209
interior and developed a communistic organization of the peasantry

272
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.189
and built an army out of that. And then

273
00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:15.030
he fought a civil war. With the pro-capitalists between

274
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.709
1945, the end of World War II, and 1949,

275
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.260
4 years of a brutal civil war which Mao

276
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.180
Tse-tung and the Communist Party of China won. And

277
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.810
Chiang Kai-shek, the defeated, retreated to the island of

278
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:39.310
Taiwan where they still are. What did Mao do?

279
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.579
He wanted to build on his notion of communes.

280
00:21:45.189 --> 00:21:50.469
So, already in the 1950s, the first decade after

281
00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:56.439
the Civil War, he tried to organize communes, and

282
00:21:56.439 --> 00:22:03.060
in the 1950s and 1960s, China was transformed around

283
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:09.869
this experiment. Of communes, and the decision was made

284
00:22:10.479 --> 00:22:15.030
that they weren't ready. That the experience of the

285
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.079
communes was such that they had to first develop

286
00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:28.770
China's Economy, have an industrial base, have modern technology,

287
00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:32.020
and then they could go back and try to

288
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:39.420
create a modern industrial commune organization, but they had

289
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.099
to give it up. That that's the biggest lesson.

290
00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:47.890
That Mao left. After he died, and so the

291
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.930
the the leaders of China. In fact, quite Maoist.

292
00:22:54.089 --> 00:23:00.790
In their ideas, went to work to build China's

293
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:07.589
modern industry, starting in the 1970s. And now here's

294
00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:13.550
a fact. A fact. Starting to count looking say

295
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:22.939
since 1975. China has developed a modern economy. Further

296
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:31.390
and faster than any country on this planet. Nobody

297
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:37.500
has achieved in these few years, 40 years, more

298
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.969
or less. No one has achieved what they have

299
00:23:41.969 --> 00:23:46.130
achieved. They are now the great competitor and the

300
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.239
great challenger of the United States, which has been

301
00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:55.339
operating a global empire for the last century. And

302
00:23:55.339 --> 00:24:01.489
they are now the new face. Of socialism. They're

303
00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:05.829
not the only socialism. I've been through that with

304
00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:11.319
you, but they are proof that they have learned

305
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.599
that if you, if your goal in life is

306
00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:19.959
to develop a modern economy, to escape poverty, to

307
00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:24.300
become a powerful nation state. Then China is the

308
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.900
way to do that, because nobody has come close

309
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.790
to achieving that amount of growth in so short

310
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:38.760
a historical period. And I'm sure that future. Efforts

311
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:44.969
of socialism now have The strengths and weaknesses, the

312
00:24:44.969 --> 00:24:49.010
achievements and mistakes of the Soviet Union to build

313
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.920
on, but likewise, the mistakes and achievements of China,

314
00:24:54.329 --> 00:24:57.410
and you can see it in, for example, the

315
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:03.150
remarkable economic success of Vietnam. Which is the one

316
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.750
who has in the most creative way, tried to

317
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.780
use those lessons. You see it also elsewhere, but

318
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:18.040
Vietnam has not suffered. The blockades, the sanctions, and

319
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.640
the overt hostility of the United States. The United

320
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.239
States still wants to somehow Take advantage of Vietnam.

321
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.160
It doesn't care about North Korea and Cuba and

322
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.790
so subjects them to every kind of negative pressure,

323
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.239
which has its impact.

324
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.140
So with all of that in mind, let me

325
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.020
ask you then, how do you react to claims

326
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.339
still made by many, many people when they say

327
00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:53.650
that wherever socialism has been tried, it always failed.

328
00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:58.250
Yeah, this is an this is ignorance, and it's

329
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.810
an ignorance that keeps being repeated, so that people

330
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.369
who don't take it 10 minutes, that's all it

331
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:07.939
takes, 10 minutes to find out the facts. They

332
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:11.380
avoid spending that 10 minutes and instead tell each

333
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.140
other these sorts of things. I am in, I

334
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.300
am in debates here in the, I'm, I've been

335
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.900
talking to you from New York City, so I'm

336
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.900
in the middle of the financial core of this

337
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.219
country, the government of this country is much more

338
00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:27.959
here than in Washington, right so it's here is

339
00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:30.060
where it is, and I live here and I

340
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.229
work here. And I therefore engage in debates, the

341
00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:38.030
public, at the university and trade unions in which

342
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.069
people say what you just said. So I know

343
00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:44.910
you are correct, lots of people say things like

344
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.790
that, uh, but that's ignorance. You know what they

345
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.589
have they have in their mind after I, I

346
00:26:50.589 --> 00:26:53.709
give them my answer, they will start talking to

347
00:26:53.709 --> 00:27:00.079
me about Venezuela. Yes. Oh, they get very excited

348
00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:04.319
about Venezuela, and then some of them, uh, mentioned

349
00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:09.949
Cuba. I, I assume that's because those two economies

350
00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:15.280
have enormous difficulties. But that has very little to

351
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.829
do with socialism. That has to do with a,

352
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:24.760
that they were either actual or they were in

353
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.760
fact colonies of the United States, and then they

354
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.920
were enemies of the United States, very little between.

355
00:27:33.689 --> 00:27:37.609
During their colonial period, they became very poor, as

356
00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:42.650
most colonies do, because they were exploited by the

357
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.810
United States. After they broke away Cuba in the

358
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.949
revolution with Fidel Castro uh in 1950. Venezuela much

359
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:55.709
later with Hugo Chavez and so on, then they

360
00:27:55.709 --> 00:28:01.069
were subject to total blockades in which they couldn't

361
00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:04.869
sell their product, they couldn't buy anything, they, I

362
00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:10.300
mean. Here's the joke. If you wanted to come

363
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.260
up with a balance sheet for socialism, I'm willing

364
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.619
to think about that, then we would have to

365
00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:23.430
look at Cuba and Venezuela, fine, but we'd also

366
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.959
have to look at Vietnam and China also. And

367
00:28:27.959 --> 00:28:31.770
then you would see that clearly socialism isn't the

368
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.839
problem, because socialism is what they have in Vietnam

369
00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:41.319
and China, and those are two models of successful

370
00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:45.589
industrialization. I mean, let, let me be really clear

371
00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:50.030
with you. In the 100 years that the United

372
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.430
States has been the dominant economic power in the

373
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.959
world. Roughly from the 1920s, 1930s to now, a

374
00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:03.739
century. The United States Empire was dominant. The United

375
00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:11.199
States Empire had no competitor. Now, the United States

376
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:14.839
for the first time in a century, has a

377
00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:20.160
serious competitor. And that competitor is the People's Republic

378
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.949
of China, which calls itself socialism with Chinese characteristics.

379
00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:33.420
OK. No one expected this, no one foresaw this.

380
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.869
China was not very many decades ago, the poorest

381
00:29:37.869 --> 00:29:43.270
country on earth. And it is now the technological

382
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.050
equivalent of the United States. That this is unbelievable.

383
00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:51.420
If your goal in life is to become less

384
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.770
poor, to become a modern society, which is the

385
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.099
goal of the vast majority of the nations of

386
00:29:59.099 --> 00:30:02.689
the world right now, in Asia, Africa, Latin America,

387
00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:07.819
and beyond. If that's your goal, then China is

388
00:30:07.819 --> 00:30:11.959
the number one success story in the world. So

389
00:30:11.959 --> 00:30:17.130
to repeat, oh socialism never works. You know, if

390
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.089
a student does that in a class, you call

391
00:30:20.089 --> 00:30:23.630
the student up and say, either you're not reading

392
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.219
the material that we give you to study. Or

393
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:30.140
there's something wrong with you, but you gotta get

394
00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.699
some help, because you keep repeating what is know

395
00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:37.160
that and you have no evidence. Give me evidence.

396
00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:41.180
Evidence is not Cuba and Venezuela. Whatever you think

397
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.300
about those societies, that's not enough evidence. You have

398
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.689
to talk about China and Vietnam, which you never

399
00:30:49.689 --> 00:30:55.189
do. Those folks who say that do not, or

400
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.969
here's another one you may encounter. They will say

401
00:30:58.969 --> 00:31:03.290
grudgingly when I point out China. Yeah, that's because

402
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:08.380
China has adopted capitalism. And then then I go,

403
00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:10.579
then I, you know, then I say, OK, well.

404
00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:15.920
Who who authorizes the use of this term? You

405
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.989
just decided that since China is a great success,

406
00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:23.719
you're gonna call it capitalist, but that that that's

407
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:26.439
a legalism, that's the kind of thing a lawyer

408
00:31:26.439 --> 00:31:28.680
does in a in a in a jury, hoping

409
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.979
the jury doesn't notice. You can call it whatever

410
00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:36.180
you want. They call it socialism, I call it

411
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.900
socialism. The whole world calls it socialism. You want

412
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.500
to call it something else because you've been embarrassed.

413
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.400
That the statement you make, socialism never works, turns

414
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.839
out it works real well, and now you don't

415
00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:54.239
know what to say, so you'll say, oh, it

416
00:31:54.239 --> 00:31:57.810
isn't socialism. It's a little bit like um Mr.

417
00:31:57.839 --> 00:32:02.119
Trump reacting to Kamala Harris as his opponent by

418
00:32:02.119 --> 00:32:06.469
saying, oh, she's not really black. Oh what? Where'd

419
00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:09.160
you get this? He made that up. He makes

420
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.199
most things up. He, he, he's not bound by

421
00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:15.270
any rules of, of factuality.

422
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.920
Well, maybe I will ask you a little bit

423
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.989
about Trump since we, the results of the elections

424
00:32:20.989 --> 00:32:23.160
are already out toward the end of our conversation.

425
00:32:23.199 --> 00:32:25.359
But let me just ask you now, since we've

426
00:32:25.359 --> 00:32:29.199
been talking a lot about socialism, what is Marxism

427
00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:32.400
then? And does it relate to socialism and if

428
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.359
so in what way?

429
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:41.959
Yes, good. Socialism is older than Marx. When Marx

430
00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:44.800
was a young man, there already was in the

431
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:51.699
world, socialism. And given Marx's own position as a

432
00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:56.140
critic of capitalism, he found his way to the

433
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.890
literature about socialism. He found it in the library,

434
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.300
he found the people that he bumped into, you

435
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300
know, he was an academic, he went to the

436
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.699
university, he got a degree in philosophy, and he

437
00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:11.660
began his working life as a teacher. So he

438
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.349
encountered other teachers and students, and they Made him

439
00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:24.569
familiar with the literature of socialism. Uh, SO he,

440
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.349
he read that literature and he found it. On

441
00:33:28.349 --> 00:33:33.810
the one hand, very persuasive. So he began referring

442
00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:38.859
to himself as a socialist. But he also found

443
00:33:40.589 --> 00:33:45.290
Himself disagreeing with a whole bunch of things in

444
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.599
the socialist tradition that he encountered. So he began

445
00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:58.640
to develop his own way of understanding socialism. He

446
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.359
did, like I said before, he took what he

447
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:06.150
felt were a valid, powerful insights from that tradition,

448
00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:09.708
and he was grateful for them. But he also

449
00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:12.717
took it in his own direction. He developed it

450
00:34:12.908 --> 00:34:19.120
in a particular way. And that's what Marxism is.

451
00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:25.520
It's one strain of thinking within the broader socialism.

452
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.050
There have always been socialists who are not Marxists.

453
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.860
There are different kinds of socialists. Some of them

454
00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.458
take a lot from Marx. And mix it with

455
00:34:39.458 --> 00:34:42.820
other things. Some take only a little from Marx,

456
00:34:42.978 --> 00:34:45.540
some take nothing at all. So you have the

457
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.780
whole range of of attitude, but Marxism is a

458
00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:59.389
particular Analytic, an idea. Marx's goal was to explain.

459
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:07.219
Why capitalism worked the way it did. And why

460
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:13.649
the workings of capitalism. Explain what for Marx was

461
00:35:13.649 --> 00:35:18.270
the great question of his lifetime. And let me

462
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.530
tell you what that question was. OK. Marx was

463
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:28.469
born in 1818. Which means he was born into

464
00:35:28.469 --> 00:35:34.310
the Europe whose transformation was underway, and for whom

465
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.429
the great event that provoked their transformation was the

466
00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:45.280
French Revolution. The overthrow of the feudal monarchy of

467
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.949
Louis Catos and all the others. And the establishment

468
00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:56.270
instead of capitalism. In place of feudalism. And the

469
00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:03.510
great slogans of the French Revolution, liberte, egalite, fraternite,

470
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.919
that these were for Marx, his own beliefs. This

471
00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:12.959
was what he was a a a child of

472
00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:17.020
the French Revolution. He wanted there to be liberty,

473
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.580
equality, fraternity, and he added from the American Revolution

474
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.610
at about the same time, democracy, that these were

475
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.100
his values. So the great question at his time.

476
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.379
When he becomes an adult, it's now 1850, more

477
00:36:36.379 --> 00:36:39.939
or less, middle of the 19th century, he becomes

478
00:36:39.939 --> 00:36:44.600
an adult, goes to the university. He looks around.

479
00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:49.770
Germany and France at that time, I mean he

480
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.199
comes from the border uh between France and Germany.

481
00:36:53.729 --> 00:36:57.489
Uh, HE looks at that and he says, we

482
00:36:57.489 --> 00:37:03.030
have capitalism, feudalism is gone. But do we have

483
00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:10.469
liberty, equality, fraternity, and democracy? Not at all. So

484
00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:14.330
here's the question. The people who made the French

485
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:19.669
Revolution, Bob Spierre, Danton, all of the great leaders

486
00:37:19.669 --> 00:37:25.219
of the French Revolution, they promised liberty, equality, fraternity,

487
00:37:25.229 --> 00:37:29.909
and democracy. Those were the, the banners in the

488
00:37:29.909 --> 00:37:34.649
in the streets of Paris. What happened, Marx said,

489
00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:38.250
We got the capitalism, but we didn't get the

490
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:44.320
liberty equality fraternity. Capitalists are rich, proletarians are poor.

491
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.600
Capitalists have freedom, the working class has none. Democracy,

492
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.770
the workers do not elect in any way or

493
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.919
participate in any way in deciding who their exploiter

494
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:04.969
is. OK, so what, what happened? And the results

495
00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:09.610
of Marx's work were to demonstrate. It took him

496
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:13.850
years, but to demonstrate to all of us that

497
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:20.949
the reason capitalism failed to bring anywhere ever liberty,

498
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:27.060
equality, fraternity, and democracy. It is because capitalism itself

499
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.770
is the obstacle to doing that, that the way

500
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:36.780
capitalism is organized prevents liberty, equality, and fraternity. You

501
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.090
don't have to look outside, you don't have to

502
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:43.010
look for a special reason. It's right here, inside

503
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.360
the guts of capitalism that you have the obstacle

504
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.770
to liberty, equality. And the way to put that

505
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.659
in, in simple English. Slavery is the dichotomy of

506
00:38:55.659 --> 00:39:00.810
master and slave. Feudalism is the dichotomy of lord

507
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:06.330
and serf, and capitalism is the dichotomy of employer

508
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.580
and employee. That's the problem. You have to overcome

509
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.729
that, or else you're not gonna get liberty, equality,

510
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:21.409
fraternity, and democracy. Mary's project is to show that.

511
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.949
And Marx's goal is to inform the working class

512
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.959
that wants and needs liberty, equality, fraternity, and democracy,

513
00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:37.199
that the way to get it is to go

514
00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:39.489
beyond capitalism. Mhm.

515
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.040
So, what would you say are the most recurring

516
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.439
problems of capitalism, the ones that seem to keep

517
00:39:47.439 --> 00:39:50.310
coming back over and over again?

518
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.149
Yes, and those are the ones that keep provoking

519
00:39:53.149 --> 00:39:58.899
socialism. I would argue that there are 3. I

520
00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:00.820
mean, there are many, but I'm gonna give you

521
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.679
the 3 main ones. OK. The the first is

522
00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:11.270
the tendency of capitalism, wherever it comes to exist.

523
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:18.449
To worsen the inequality of wealth and income. Among

524
00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:22.090
people. If you take a look, uh, I'm not,

525
00:40:22.209 --> 00:40:24.169
I don't know if you're familiar. There's a French

526
00:40:24.169 --> 00:40:28.429
economist named, uh, Thomas Piketty who works in I'm

527
00:40:28.429 --> 00:40:32.370
aware of him. Yes, OK. Well, his is only

528
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:37.159
the latest. In a long series of works that

529
00:40:37.159 --> 00:40:39.639
show this. If you look at his book called

530
00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:43.419
Capital Capital in the 21st Century, it is, you

531
00:40:43.419 --> 00:40:50.000
know, 600 pages demonstrating that wherever capitalism goes, the

532
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.199
the the the gap between rich and poor gets

533
00:40:54.199 --> 00:41:00.389
worse. So, that's a terrible quality of capitalism. It

534
00:41:00.389 --> 00:41:04.270
is not only not bringing us equality, it is

535
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:09.020
bringing us the opposite. And what periodically happens is

536
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.570
it goes so far that it provokes a revolution

537
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.770
which temporarily narrows the gap between rich and poor,

538
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.820
and then when the revolution is over, if it

539
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:27.580
lets capitalism survive, the capitalism will once again produce

540
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.489
the we are that now. 40 years ago, the

541
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.409
United States was less unequal than most of the

542
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:40.300
countries in Europe. Today, the United States is more

543
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.770
unequal than most of the countries in Europe. What's

544
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.500
that about? Capital has been more dynamic in the

545
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.459
United States than in Europe, and so it got

546
00:41:51.459 --> 00:41:56.040
worse, and we are now very extreme. We are

547
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.790
so extreme now that I would not be surprised,

548
00:42:00.399 --> 00:42:03.479
especially now with Mr. Trump, that we begin to

549
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:09.479
have very serious social explosions because of the gap

550
00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:13.479
between rich and poor inside the United States. So

551
00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:18.469
that's the first one. The second problem of capitalism

552
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:25.330
is a profound Instability. This is a system that

553
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:30.090
goes from recession to inflation back to recession, more

554
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:36.800
unemployment, less unemployment. No one escapes, no one. The

555
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.760
business cycle, the crisis, the recession, the depression, the

556
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.280
boom, the bust, the crash. I mean, we have

557
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.479
endless words because this is always with us. Wherever

558
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:57.070
capitalism goes, it produces this business cycle. In which

559
00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:01.199
workers now have to struggle not just with low

560
00:43:01.199 --> 00:43:05.350
wages, but with the risk that 2 years from

561
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.110
now or 4 years from now, I won't have

562
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:13.120
a job. How do I buy a house paying

563
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.040
every month for my mortgage? If I, if I'm

564
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.479
gonna lose my job, I won't be able to

565
00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:21.669
pay the mortgage. I'll lose my house. I'll lose

566
00:43:21.669 --> 00:43:26.219
my apartment. You know, students drop out of university

567
00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:29.540
because suddenly their family doesn't have the money cause

568
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:34.139
father or mother lost the job, etc. THE, the

569
00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:41.340
instability is terrible. Capitalism has tried for centuries to

570
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.830
stop the instability. We even have a Branch of

571
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:50.110
modern economics called Keynesian economics after the British economist

572
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:54.750
who devoted himself to understanding why is this happening

573
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.030
and what can we do about it. And now

574
00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.399
we have monetary policy and fiscal policy. We have

575
00:44:00.399 --> 00:44:04.429
wonderful policies. Do they prevent the instability? Not at

576
00:44:04.429 --> 00:44:09.179
all. Not at all. The, the two worst collapses,

577
00:44:09.379 --> 00:44:15.340
the three worst, 1929, the Great Depression. 2008, we

578
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.159
call that in this country the Great Recession, and

579
00:44:18.159 --> 00:44:22.659
then 2020, which we call the pandemic recession, but

580
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:26.679
I mean, it, it doesn't matter. We have collapses,

581
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.550
and then we have inflations, and then we have

582
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:35.669
collapse it's that instability is a terrible problem for

583
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:41.620
capitalism, which, like inequality, it has never been able

584
00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:45.830
to stop or to solve. And the 3rd 1.

585
00:44:47.209 --> 00:44:54.419
IS the built-in expansion of capitalism. Capitalists have to

586
00:44:54.419 --> 00:44:59.760
take their profits. Either entirely or in the major

587
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.879
parts of it, and plow them back into production,

588
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.790
because otherwise they risk being competed out of existence.

589
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.560
They have to get the new machine. They have

590
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.189
to produce the next successful commodity. They're always expanding,

591
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.250
which means they have to go around the world

592
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.229
to get inputs. For their expansion, and they have

593
00:45:25.229 --> 00:45:28.629
to go around the world to find markets for

594
00:45:28.629 --> 00:45:33.780
their expansion. They are forever bumping into each other

595
00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:38.750
or bumping into local societies who they want to

596
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:43.530
serve them. That's why we have colonialism, and now

597
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.370
that the mass of people won't allow colonialism, are

598
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:52.000
fighting back, that's why we don't have Britain in

599
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.600
India. That's why we do have Israel in Gaza,

600
00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:02.020
they're still trying to do it. OK, that produces

601
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:07.580
war, endless war, large war, little war. The worst

602
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.620
wars in human history, World War 1 and 2

603
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:17.929
were fought among expanding capitalist economies, Germany, Britain, United

604
00:46:17.929 --> 00:46:21.689
States, Japan. And at the beginning of World War

605
00:46:21.689 --> 00:46:25.929
One, Russia, which had its capitalist too. So it

606
00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:29.239
seems to me that the great, the three great

607
00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:35.409
flaws of capitalism are inequality, instability, and a tendency

608
00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:41.969
to global warfare that constantly destabilizes everybody.

609
00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:45.209
And so, how do you look at the current

610
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:50.600
state of support for socialism, particularly in the West

611
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.649
and in capitalist societies? Because it seems to me

612
00:46:53.649 --> 00:46:57.969
that since the 2008 economic crisis and now also

613
00:46:57.969 --> 00:47:02.889
more recently, as you mentioned, the pandemic crisis, people

614
00:47:02.889 --> 00:47:07.209
have been looking, uh, have been moving to. Uh,

615
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:14.310
MORE fascist, more right-wing populist narratives instead of alternatives

616
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:18.830
based of, of more leftist alternatives based on socialism

617
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.350
or some other related uh positions in, in the

618
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:26.860
left wing uh aspect of the political divide. So

619
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.139
how do you look at it?

620
00:47:29.489 --> 00:47:34.129
Here's the way I look at it. Capitalism, because

621
00:47:34.129 --> 00:47:42.870
of its flaws. Provokes Opposition, it always has. And

622
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.590
it knows that the people who run capitalist societies,

623
00:47:46.959 --> 00:47:50.080
they're not stupid. They, they learned from their parents

624
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:56.399
and their grandparents that They have different explanations than

625
00:47:56.399 --> 00:47:58.790
I do, but they know that there's a risk.

626
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.790
When the forces on the right are very strong,

627
00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:09.219
They make alliances with the left. When the forces

628
00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:13.600
on the left seem strong, they make alliances on

629
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.060
the right. They don't care. For them, the issue

630
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.939
is not left and right, which they disagree with

631
00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:24.540
all of that. They are there to keep the

632
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:33.030
capitalist system going. So, for example, When fascism grew

633
00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:37.719
in the 1930s, I didn't find it. I mean,

634
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.379
I wasn't alive then, but as I look back,

635
00:48:40.959 --> 00:48:46.340
I don't find this surprising because In 1917, the

636
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:50.810
Russian revolution gave to the capitalists of the world

637
00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.649
a fantastic shock. Up until then, no socialists had

638
00:48:56.649 --> 00:49:01.659
been more than an annoying politician who was critical.

639
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:07.879
But now they captured a government. Now they had

640
00:49:07.879 --> 00:49:11.239
a big country, Russia, that they were in charge

641
00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:16.909
of, so they felt terribly threatened. That's why they

642
00:49:16.909 --> 00:49:19.629
sent those troops that I talked about before. That's

643
00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:22.030
why they aided the white army to try to

644
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:27.550
overthrow uh Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and the others. Mhm.

645
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.050
So they convinced their people very quickly, starting in

646
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:42.050
1917, and without interruption. Through the 1920s, in every

647
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:48.570
Western country, there was anti-leftist propaganda from the top

648
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.290
to the bottom. Bolsheviks, that was the bad word

649
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:56.290
then. The Bolsheviks are coming. The Bolsheviks threaten you.

650
00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:01.439
In Portugal and Spain, everywhere you had it. So

651
00:50:01.439 --> 00:50:05.870
when capitalism then collapsed in the Great Depression, starting

652
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:12.659
in October of 1929. The mass of people realized

653
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:16.969
that the capitalist system that was running their societies

654
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.820
had broken down. It was obvious, millions were out

655
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.350
of work, the government didn't function, so they went

656
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:27.260
to the right because they had been taught for

657
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.459
15 years or more that the left is evil,

658
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.219
terrible, don't go there. So they went to the

659
00:50:33.219 --> 00:50:38.979
right. The capitalists, in some cases, went with them.

660
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:46.350
Italy, Germany. Spain, Portugal, them. But most capitalists said,

661
00:50:46.429 --> 00:50:49.870
oh no, oh no, we have to go to

662
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:54.139
the left, make an alliance with the working class

663
00:50:54.419 --> 00:50:58.590
against the fascists. So that's what you got. That's

664
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:03.429
why the government in Spain invites the international brigades

665
00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:06.840
to help them fight against Franco. That's why the

666
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.360
French vote into office Leon Bloom in the middle

667
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.459
of the 1930s, a socialist for the first time,

668
00:51:13.879 --> 00:51:17.879
a socialist prime minister in France. That's why in

669
00:51:17.879 --> 00:51:21.949
World War II, Britain, France, and most of Europe

670
00:51:21.949 --> 00:51:26.840
allies with the Soviet Union, the arch enemy, they

671
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.889
went and allied. Here in the United States, people

672
00:51:30.889 --> 00:51:35.270
who were known socialists and communists were given high

673
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:40.000
government positions. In World War II, so alliance with

674
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.879
the right to uh to the left to destroy

675
00:51:42.879 --> 00:51:46.399
the right. The minute the right is destroyed, end

676
00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:51.739
of World War 2, 1945, the minute. The complete

677
00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:54.889
switch around and the Soviet Union, which was your

678
00:51:54.889 --> 00:51:59.860
ally, becomes the evil enemy, and we have the

679
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.010
Cold War ever since, so that answers your question.

680
00:52:04.229 --> 00:52:09.469
Now that capitalism is falling apart again. The people

681
00:52:09.469 --> 00:52:12.179
at first go to the, go to the right,

682
00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:16.949
because that's the allowable place. An American worker will

683
00:52:16.949 --> 00:52:19.590
go to the right because he's afraid the left

684
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:24.489
is somehow evil and terrible and dangerous. But here's

685
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:27.439
why I'm confident. Here's why I don't have a

686
00:52:27.439 --> 00:52:32.159
long face. The right wing, for example, Mr. Trump,

687
00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:36.300
in his 1st 4 years, he solved exactly no

688
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.250
problem of the United States. Our sit, we are

689
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:42.639
more unequal now than we were before. We are

690
00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:46.560
more unstable than we were before, and our empire

691
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.959
is disintegrating. There's nothing he can do about that.

692
00:52:50.159 --> 00:52:52.290
He is going to be the president of a

693
00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:56.320
further decline. And I predict to you, you and

694
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.560
I should talk, 4 years from now, they will

695
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.040
blow him out of the water the way they

696
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.600
just blew Biden and Harris out of the water.

697
00:53:06.399 --> 00:53:09.179
And why? Because the mass of the working class

698
00:53:09.179 --> 00:53:15.399
will go, gee, this guy hasn't done anything. That's

699
00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:17.590
why they didn't vote for him 4 years ago.

700
00:53:17.719 --> 00:53:20.560
That's why Biden got elected. It wasn't that Biden

701
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.399
was no great leader. Mr. Biden has been a

702
00:53:23.399 --> 00:53:27.000
politician here for 50 years, and nobody paid him

703
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.040
any attention. He comes from a small state, he's

704
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.669
irrelevant, but he was able to beat Mr. Trump

705
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.360
because even then, large numbers of people said nothing.

706
00:53:39.209 --> 00:53:43.770
Now Mr. Trump cleverly, to his credit, turned himself

707
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:47.709
into a folk hero. And that way he begins

708
00:53:47.709 --> 00:53:52.229
to express. The anger that the mass of the

709
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:57.260
working class feels towards this whole capitalist system. He

710
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:02.979
looks like an acceptable outside critic. You know, he,

711
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:08.899
the problem is immigrants, immigrants. Immigrants make no difference

712
00:54:08.899 --> 00:54:12.260
at all. That is it. We are a country

713
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:16.620
of 330 million people, and we have between 10

714
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:22.179
and 11 million undocumented immigrants. There is no way

715
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:26.270
that 10 to 11 million people, among the poorest

716
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:28.929
in the world coming to a rich country like

717
00:54:28.929 --> 00:54:32.459
this could be the cause of the economic problems

718
00:54:32.459 --> 00:54:37.169
of American capitalism. That is ridiculous. There's no way

719
00:54:37.169 --> 00:54:39.919
to do, no way to show that, nobody has,

720
00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:45.100
but by making a wall, it's very dramatic. It's

721
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:50.560
all a big wall, people, 00, he's doing something.

722
00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:53.840
And he's gonna put a tariff on everything. He's

723
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:58.360
doing something. Compared to that, the the Democrats look

724
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.639
like same old, same old, everything is, uh, and

725
00:55:02.639 --> 00:55:06.120
that's no longer acceptable because the system is falling

726
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.919
down. The United States lost the war in Vietnam.

727
00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:13.280
The United States lost the war in Afghanistan. The

728
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.800
United States lost the war in Iraq, and it

729
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.030
is now losing the war in Ukraine. Everybody knows,

730
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:24.120
everybody knows, they dare not speak it, but they

731
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.760
all know.

732
00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:27.770
OK, so as a last question, let me ask

733
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:31.290
you then more directly about Donald Trump because as

734
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.449
you were already alluding to, we already know the

735
00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:37.250
results of the presidential elections in the US and

736
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.929
Donald Trump won the second term. So what do

737
00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:43.250
you think that 4 more years of Donald Trump

738
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:47.770
represents for the average American and perhaps for the

739
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:48.800
rest of the world?

740
00:55:50.199 --> 00:55:53.929
Um, NOTHING going on in the rest of the

741
00:55:53.929 --> 00:56:04.189
world. Matters here. That is The American people Having

742
00:56:04.189 --> 00:56:10.189
been the dominant empire in the world. For a

743
00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:17.060
century See the rest of the world. As somewhere

744
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:25.689
between irrelevant. And easily manageable. And they don't care.

745
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:30.429
Uh THEY'RE split between the Democrats who are convinced

746
00:56:30.429 --> 00:56:34.350
they can manage everything and the Republicans who say

747
00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.870
we're not gonna worry about managing it because we

748
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:40.629
don't care what happens. We are sober for one

749
00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:43.370
group. We are so big, we don't have to

750
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.489
worry. For the other group, we are so big,

751
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:49.870
we can take care of everything. So, you will

752
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:55.159
get a mixture of those two perspectives. A little

753
00:56:55.159 --> 00:57:00.060
less management and a little bit more disengagement. If

754
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:03.159
I, if, if I was. If you were to

755
00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:06.800
ask me this question, What does it mean for

756
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:11.500
Western Europe? I mean, that's where the impact will

757
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.760
be the greatest. Because you have a series of

758
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.659
governments. In most of the car, not all, but

759
00:57:19.659 --> 00:57:24.370
in most. That have allied themselves with the United

760
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:28.889
States. And they are now going to be allied

761
00:57:28.889 --> 00:57:33.209
to someone who will be perfectly happy to throw

762
00:57:33.209 --> 00:57:38.770
them into the ocean. Doesn't care. Doesn't care what

763
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:44.080
happens to Mr. Starmer. Or to Macron, or to

764
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:49.080
you doesn't, doesn't care, don't you. The issue is

765
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:55.310
China and Russia and BRICS, and we don't. If

766
00:57:55.310 --> 00:58:03.330
the Chinese offer Interesting deals. To the United States.

767
00:58:04.979 --> 00:58:10.840
By dividing between them, Europe. They'll do it. And

768
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.439
the Europeans will have absolutely nothing to say about

769
00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:18.209
it. So if I were a leader who had

770
00:58:18.209 --> 00:58:22.739
identified myself. With the United States, say around the

771
00:58:22.739 --> 00:58:28.320
war in Ukraine. I would worry. You're done. You

772
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.489
just lost You you hooked yourself to a ship

773
00:58:33.489 --> 00:58:38.159
that is now sinking as we speak. They ought

774
00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:40.520
to worry, they ought to be looking for another

775
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:46.280
job. They ought to move maybe to China. So

776
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.669
I think what he'll do is a variety of

777
00:58:50.669 --> 00:58:55.860
economic acts that will backfire on him. And that

778
00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.020
the business community will come down on him. And

779
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:05.149
he will, he will then be defeated. One way

780
00:59:05.149 --> 00:59:08.280
or another. Either the business class will get rid

781
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.300
of him. Or the military will get rid of

782
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.409
him. Because they're working with the business class, and

783
00:59:15.409 --> 00:59:19.310
he's just too strange. And the irony is the

784
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:23.229
Europeans are going to try to find Americans to

785
00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:27.540
work with and for for Trump and his people,

786
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.750
that will be dangerous, and they will destroy those

787
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:34.389
people at home, and those people in Europe for

788
00:59:34.389 --> 00:59:37.550
making even the effort to do this. You're not

789
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:40.570
dealing with any, he can't run again. He's already

790
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:44.070
he is already a lame duck, we call that,

791
00:59:44.669 --> 00:59:46.949
because he's had one, you only can have 2.

792
00:59:47.649 --> 00:59:50.489
Unless he changes the law, which it would be

793
00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:52.409
difficult for him, you know, you may do that.

794
00:59:54.639 --> 00:59:59.300
But you're also going to see now major upsets

795
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:05.070
in the United States. If he, for example, Blocks

796
01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:08.909
access to abortion, you're going to have a revolution

797
01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:12.840
here of the women. They didn't vote for him

798
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.679
anyway, but they are now, you know, you, you

799
01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:19.770
cannot do what he wants to do. Or I

800
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:22.810
could be wrong. I could be wrong, and maybe

801
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:26.810
he can mobilize well enough. And then there will

802
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:33.080
be an exodus from here. An exodus of Left-wing

803
01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:42.149
people, intellectuals, feminists, anti-racists, by the millions. And you

804
01:00:42.149 --> 01:00:47.239
will have a wave of immigration. To Europe as

805
01:00:47.239 --> 01:00:51.030
big or bigger than the one that left Europe

806
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.080
because of the Nazis and Mussolini and all of

807
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:54.489
that.

808
01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:58.679
But we were talking just about this off record

809
01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:02.389
and just quickly, when it comes to the potential

810
01:01:02.389 --> 01:01:05.919
resurgence of fascism, of course, as you know, I

811
01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:09.840
come from Portugal and My grandparents and even my

812
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.399
parents a little bit went through the later stages

813
01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:16.919
at least of the almost 50 years of Salazar's

814
01:01:16.919 --> 01:01:19.729
regime here in Portugal. So do you think that

815
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.379
Trump, or, or the, the second election of Trump

816
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.399
also has something to tell us about that or

817
01:01:28.399 --> 01:01:28.679
not?

818
01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:32.060
Not so much about that because we don't have

819
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.780
that experience, you know, in the 1930s when when

820
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.219
you had the Salazar and Franco and all the

821
01:01:38.219 --> 01:01:41.179
rest of it, the American working class went to

822
01:01:41.179 --> 01:01:47.489
the left. Roosevelt here introduced, you know, very high

823
01:01:47.489 --> 01:01:50.649
in Roosevelt's government were socialists and communists and all

824
01:01:50.649 --> 01:01:55.350
of that. They were considered more reliable as opponents

825
01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.179
of fascism. So you had the movement to the

826
01:01:58.179 --> 01:02:03.530
right. We have no comparable. Movement to the to

827
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.409
the right that succeeded. We've had many movements to

828
01:02:06.409 --> 01:02:09.489
the right, and we came close after World War

829
01:02:09.489 --> 01:02:14.729
One, but We haven't had that experience yet, so

830
01:02:14.729 --> 01:02:18.750
people don't know. You know, here, if you want

831
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.459
people to know that, you tell them the story

832
01:02:21.709 --> 01:02:25.189
of Portugal or Spain or Germany or Italy, and

833
01:02:25.189 --> 01:02:28.899
that's being done. I, I have a dozen uh

834
01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:32.370
emails today about You know, Hitler and how he

835
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.489
came to power, and is it similar, how similar

836
01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:38.370
is it and all that. So, there are people

837
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.290
who know that that's a danger, but you also

838
01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:45.530
have to remember certain particular things. The ruling class

839
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:51.439
here was not unified in favor of Trump. If

840
01:02:51.439 --> 01:02:56.399
anything, they tilted towards Harris. Because he's a loose

841
01:02:56.399 --> 01:03:03.360
cannon, he's he's uncertain, he introduces odd ideas that

842
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.719
they know are no good for us, so they

843
01:03:05.719 --> 01:03:09.129
don't like him very much. That's one issue. So

844
01:03:09.129 --> 01:03:12.489
he's got that as a serious problem. The military

845
01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.929
has basically told him that you can't do what

846
01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.929
you wanna do. They told that to Biden too.

847
01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.689
Biden has wanted to do things in Ukraine and

848
01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:26.129
in Israel that the American military said we can't

849
01:03:26.129 --> 01:03:30.399
do that. We won't do that. OK, he's st,

850
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.879
he can't do it, um. Then also, Mr. Mr.

851
01:03:35.889 --> 01:03:39.449
Trump is very old and not very well, so

852
01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:43.800
you don't, you know, these others were relatively younger.

853
01:03:44.649 --> 01:03:47.199
He is going to die, probably in the next

854
01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:50.290
4 years, so we will actually be looking at

855
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:54.250
President Vance. And no one knows what that is

856
01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:57.449
because he was a left of center, then he

857
01:03:57.449 --> 01:04:00.850
became a right of center. He seems to be

858
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:04.370
somebody who goes wherever the money supports him for

859
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.489
his political career. And so he's unknown. No one

860
01:04:08.489 --> 01:04:10.969
knows what it is, but that's the expectation. So

861
01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:14.919
those are serious problems if you want to establish

862
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:20.370
a fascism. And finally, Mr. Trump is, he really

863
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:24.600
is interested in Mr. Trump. He isn't a fascist

864
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.639
uh in the old way. He hasn't always been.

865
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.810
He, he was in favor of abortion a few

866
01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:35.479
years ago. He only changed his opinion to get

867
01:04:35.479 --> 01:04:41.510
the vote of the evangelical Christian, uh, anti-abortion, you

868
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:46.010
know, the fundamentalist Protestants and the religious Catholics. They,

869
01:04:46.169 --> 01:04:48.969
he wanted that vote, so he said that. He

870
01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:51.570
doesn't care about guns, he doesn't care about any

871
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:54.399
of this, none of it. It's never been his

872
01:04:54.399 --> 01:04:57.840
whole life, he has no interest in these issues,

873
01:04:57.959 --> 01:05:02.080
none. He wants to make money. His whole life

874
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.639
is getting the money from his father, who had

875
01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:08.050
a real estate business, left him some buildings here

876
01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:10.989
in New York City. And that made him a

877
01:05:10.989 --> 01:05:14.459
millionaire, and that's only, he's never worked, he's never

878
01:05:14.629 --> 01:05:18.260
had to struggle about anything. He makes hotels, he,

879
01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:21.550
he builds hotels, and when they work, he makes

880
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.590
money, and when they don't, he sells them, and

881
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.469
then he builds another, it's just that he has

882
01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:32.860
no, that's why, for example, he attacked Kamala Harris.

883
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:38.290
As a, I quote now, a socialist Marxist fascist,

884
01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:41.580
he put all the three words together because he

885
01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.260
has no idea what they mean, none. He, he

886
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.570
knew that those are bad words in American politics,

887
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:56.139
so he called his opponent, he couldn't think of

888
01:05:56.139 --> 01:06:00.280
anything else, you know, it's, it's. Europeans have a

889
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.199
much more developed understanding. You really, if you're trying

890
01:06:05.199 --> 01:06:12.360
to understand America, you have to really understand. The

891
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:17.979
political ignorance that has been cultivated in this culture

892
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.070
throughout the Cold War. The whole world is a

893
01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:27.709
world of good, that's us, and bad, that's everybody

894
01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:34.399
else, everybody. And the worst, Mr. Putin or Xi

895
01:06:34.399 --> 01:06:40.169
Jinping, you know what? Our president, Mr. Biden. Refers

896
01:06:40.169 --> 01:06:46.189
to these people in words like crook, thug. Evil

897
01:06:46.189 --> 01:06:50.620
empire, the language. Listen to the it's a language

898
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:55.209
of children. It's, it's like a a 4 year

899
01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:57.729
old looking at another 4 year old thing, you

900
01:06:57.729 --> 01:07:01.659
are poo poo. What? That's it? You can't do

901
01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:05.139
better than that. You're an adult. What's the problem?

902
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:09.459
There's a hug. One leader calls another leader these

903
01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:15.770
names. It's childish. Mhm. You have to understand, and

904
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:19.449
that's just not, not just our leaders. Our people

905
01:07:19.449 --> 01:07:23.790
have the political understanding that you would shake your

906
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.239
head. Now, I, I'm not a European, I'm an

907
01:07:26.239 --> 01:07:29.510
American, I was born here. On the other hand,

908
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.800
my parents experienced fascism like yours did. So did

909
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.639
my grandparents. Most of my family is dead. They

910
01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:40.840
were killed in either gas chambers or in the

911
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.159
war. So, I know, I grew up in the

912
01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:47.560
same room with my grandmother, who told me the

913
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.239
stories of the bombing. I know the way a

914
01:07:51.239 --> 01:07:53.800
child learns. I have that in my head, I

915
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.340
know. My mother was German, my father was French.

916
01:07:57.429 --> 01:08:01.070
I speak those languages. I spoke those languages before

917
01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:05.459
I learned English. So I really do understand and

918
01:08:05.459 --> 01:08:08.250
have a sense of the European tradition. I'm part

919
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:11.739
of it. I read French and German newspapers all

920
01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:15.100
the time in order to keep up, but I'm

921
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.179
telling you, this country, is in a very, very,

922
01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:26.729
very dangerous place. Its empire is falling apart. The

923
01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:31.627
bricks is the new. Power in the global economy.

924
01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:35.790
And that power is an enemy of the United

925
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:40.259
States, and it is outperforming at every turn, and,

926
01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:43.790
and the Americans know it. That's why half of

927
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:49.589
our ruling class has invested in China. They, it's

928
01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:53.419
very complicated, but the position of the United States,

929
01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:58.939
that's obvious, down. And the people in Europe, the

930
01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:02.330
political leaders, they think the United States is still

931
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.580
on the rise of its empire. No. The rise

932
01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:12.417
was in the 20th century. Up until 2010, 2015.

933
01:09:12.809 --> 01:09:16.769
Now we are going down, and as with every

934
01:09:16.769 --> 01:09:21.279
other empire in the world, Going up is much

935
01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:25.589
more pleasurable than going down. And, and the rest

936
01:09:25.589 --> 01:09:30.310
of the world needs to understand, you're watching the

937
01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:36.000
convulsions inside the United States as it goes down.

938
01:09:36.509 --> 01:09:39.669
So, Doctor Wolf, let's send on that note, we've

939
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:42.509
reached our time limit. So thank you so much

940
01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:44.589

941
01:09:44.589 --> 01:09:46.310

944

Thank you, Ricardo, and thank you for having these

945
01:09:53.929 --> 01:09:56.738
conversations, cause one of the best ways we can

946
01:09:56.738 --> 01:10:01.019
make some progress is if we all understand what

947
01:10:01.019 --> 01:10:03.898
is going on. So, my thanks to you as

948
01:10:03.898 --> 01:10:04.219
