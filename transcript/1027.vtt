00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.299
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.079
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.140
today I'm joined by Doctor Juan Tech. He is

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.840
Australian Research Council de Raffaello at the Evolution of

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.579
Cultural Cultural Diversity Initiative School of Culture, History and

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.500
Language at, at the Australian National University and also

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.030
scientific vice coordinator at the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.250
at the University of Coimbra. He is a population

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.779
geneticist focusing on the evolution of humans and closely

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.080
related species. His main research focus revolves around human

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.250
evolution during the Pleistocene, in particular, the egg mixture

12
00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:45.590
events between so-called modern and archaic humans after the

13
00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:50.240
out of Africa and before human colonization of Saul.

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.060
So, and today we're talking about modern humans, human

15
00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.459
dispersal, the the nizo ones and the neanderthals balancing

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.279
selection and some other related topics. So, Doctor Teixeira,

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.540
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

18
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.639
Uh Thank you so much, Ricardo. It's a pleasure

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.139
to be here.

20
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.610
OK. So let's start here perhaps with a question

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.870
that I've already asked several times on the show

22
00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:22.139
to paleoanthropologists specifically. But what are modern humans and

23
00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.669
archaic humans? What does that mean

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.480
exactly? Well, that's a, that's a good question. I

25
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:35.720
don't know. Um No, seriously, I think uh the

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.650
terms come uh from, of course, they have an

27
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.839
historical um background to them. Uh AND they result

28
00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.650
from uh typology classification of fossil groups. So people

29
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.150
looking at fossil bones and saying, which are more

30
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.360
closely related to humans based on their appearance, based

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.599
on their morphological traits, those that similarly uh that

32
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.220
are, you know, old fossils like from the Pleistocene,

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.400
for example, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands

34
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.769
of years old, those that look slightly more different

35
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.990
to whatever the distribution of those traits are in

36
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.020
people today. They are called archaic. And that term

37
00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.190
is itself archaic because it sort of takes us

38
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.380
to, um, an idea of uh potentially these groups

39
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.080
being, um, you know, the, I think, I think

40
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:27.520
it's a loaded word where I'm going to use.

41
00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.520
It's not my word, but it's, it's not what

42
00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.070
I think. Um, BUT this is what might take

43
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.990
people to, is to think of these groups as

44
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.369
inferior in some ways. Um And I think that's,

45
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.619
there's no, um, sort of, uh good, good evidence

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.850
for that to stand on. Um But, and then

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.479
the ones that look more like people today that,

48
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.720
you know, are first seen in Africa, they are

49
00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.690
called modern humans. So basically what happens is that

50
00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.809
paleoanthropologists looking at the bones in, in, in the

51
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.529
field, uh they can sort of start and start

52
00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:07.039
classifying different traits, morphologically. And then they start grouping,

53
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.029
they are useful classifications in the sense that they

54
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.570
allow us to have intelligible conversations. But um you

55
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.179
know, moderns would be everything that looks like people

56
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.929
today, archaic, everything that looks slightly different.

57
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:27.380
But just to be sure these terms apply exclusively

58
00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.380
to Homo sapiens. Correct. I mean, I'm asking you

59
00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.979
that because sometimes when we talk about human evolution,

60
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.960
we refer not only to our species, Homo sapiens,

61
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.779
but also other closely related species. Sometimes we are

62
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.830
referring to the entire homogenous.

63
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.179
Yes. And the archaic refer to all the groups.

64
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.619
Actually, the ar cakes are like neanderthals would be

65
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.410
considered archaic homo would be considered archaic Homo ailes.

66
00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.119
And then the moderns are the Homo sapiens, right?

67
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.419
So, but you already get an idea of what

68
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.399
I, where I stand on this um, classifications.

69
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.320
Uh Yes, because we're going to get uh uh

70
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.619
a little bit later into our interbreeding with other

71
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.548
species like the neanderthals and the, the miso ones.

72
00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.510
Uh We're going to talk about that. Uh But,

73
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:28.239
uh I also asked you that question to clarify

74
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.010
where actually the term modern human applies because, uh

75
00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:38.630
I mean, since we interbred with neanderthals at least,

76
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.339
uh and, uh and we are so so closely

77
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.790
related, not just historically in terms of our genetics,

78
00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:51.880
uh and our morphology as well, I guess. So,

79
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.660
I was just wondering if by any chance uh

80
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.640
modern humans could also apply to neanderthals or, or

81
00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:03.510
other closely related species. No,

82
00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:06.940
not canonically not, not. So when we're, when we're

83
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.640
having these discussions, when we say archaic, archaic does

84
00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:12.839
not include the neanderthals or uh sorry, archaic, includes

85
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.279
the neanderthals and does not include the modern humans.

86
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.279
The modern humans are the Homo sapiens. Maybe that's

87
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.049
what I should have started my answer. But essentially,

88
00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:25.589
um those are, you know, social classifications.

89
00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:30.459
OK. So I, I want to talk now about

90
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.970
uh out of Africa migration migrations by, we're going

91
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.010
to start with Homo Sapiens, but then we'll probably

92
00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.470
take a few steps back because it's also very

93
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.579
interesting to understand uh what species exactly first migrated

94
00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:52.690
out of Africa where they went to. Exactly. But

95
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.209
uh le let's go first with Homo sapiens. So

96
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.619
what do we know exactly about out of Africa

97
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.450
migrations by Homo Sapiens uh up till uh around

98
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.559
the, the period where we basically colonized Saul.

99
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.649
Well, um so what we know is that these

100
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.320
forms of uh so called modern or anatomically modern

101
00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:23.149
humans. So Homo sapiens first emerged in Africa around,

102
00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.399
uh it's pushing back now, I think 300,000 is

103
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.470
the earlier proposal in North Africa and Morocco, there's

104
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.079
uh some fossil evidence of uh modern human presence

105
00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.589
uh up to that point or starting at that

106
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.730
point. And then we know that uh th these

107
00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:43.579
fossil forms start sort of appearing in the fossil

108
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:46.390
records of the Middle East and then, uh across

109
00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:51.649
the rest of the world around uh 60,000, 60

110
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.220
between 70 50,000 years ago. Um And then of

111
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.519
course, these, these states keep changing, right? Because we

112
00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:04.309
keep calibrating uh and getting a better understanding on

113
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.250
of, you know, when, when the first migrations happened.

114
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.119
Uh But there's stone tool evidence, for example, in,

115
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.570
in, in Indonesia uh associated with lithic artifacts associated

116
00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:18.779
with more humans, with anatomically modern humans. Um The

117
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.299
cave called Lida A which is uh I think

118
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:25.279
around 70,000 years ago. So what we know is

119
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.429
that once that spread took over, it was fast.

120
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.959
So people went from Africa across the rest of

121
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.140
the world in a relatively short period of time.

122
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.980
So that occurred quite swiftly. Uh Of course, that

123
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:45.899
does not negate the possibility that other migrations occurred

124
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.410
uh before, right. So it's not to say that

125
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.250
people were always stuck in Africa and then they

126
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.570
only moved together as a pilgrimage in a certain

127
00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:59.179
specified time period. This was much more likely a

128
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.100
highly dynamic process that took thousands of years. Um

129
00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:07.529
And we know, for example, that modern humans contributed

130
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.190
genetically to neanderthals uh around 100,000 years ago. So

131
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.359
there was a modern human migration from Africa to

132
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:22.220
Europe that resulted in detectable genetic admixture with neanderthals

133
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.700
around 100,000 years ago, right? That should already tell

134
00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:28.089
you that those movements uh out of Africa were

135
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.700
not necessarily like a one migration event but they

136
00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:35.460
were probably much, much more nuanced events um that

137
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:38.058
occur, occurred across a wide range of time.

138
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:44.679
So when we talk about almost Sapiens migrations out

139
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.090
of uh migration out of Africa, it was not

140
00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:53.169
one single migration event right out of Africa.

141
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.409
Yeah. So that's how it's modeled because it's useful,

142
00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:01.830
it's simplistic. Uh BUT in reality, um this was

143
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.960
much more likely, uh you know, uh a complex

144
00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:07.840
process, right? It's not like somebody just, you know,

145
00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:10.340
suddenly remembered and say, yeah, OK, I'm going out

146
00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:13.679
of Africa, please follow me and then everybody just

147
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.340
felt like just follow as a pilgrimage. Um So,

148
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.000
so, but of course, it's a use, you can

149
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.650
model it use in a useful way as a

150
00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.849
single wave, right? So, and what do we mean

151
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:31.140
by single wave? We mean that the descendants of

152
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:36.820
those migrations out of Africa uh around 70,000, 60,000

153
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.450
years ago because the descendants of that big big

154
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.690
one wave migration as we are modeling it are

155
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.000
people living outside of Africa today, right? So all

156
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.729
of us, you know, descend to a great extent,

157
00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.789
not all, not entirely but to a great extent

158
00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.130
to that one wave migration. And because we can

159
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.890
model it as a one wave um that also

160
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.830
allows us to then interrogate what was happening in

161
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.979
other parts of the world as these people en

162
00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:12.010
encountered other groups of people that we've archaically classified

163
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.219
as archaic. Um But if we model this in

164
00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.940
a single wave model, then we can start asking

165
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.659
what's happening in other parts of the world.

166
00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:26.469
But so we got out of Africa and went

167
00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:31.440
through, uh went across Asia and then it was

168
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:38.380
into Australia and Oceania right before we crossed, I

169
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.799
guess the Bering Strait into the Americas.

170
00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:46.460
Yes, that's uh yes. So the earlier evidence for

171
00:10:46.609 --> 00:10:49.400
the colonization of Saul, which was the supercontinent that

172
00:10:49.409 --> 00:10:52.820
included both Australia and New Guinea due to lowered

173
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.609
sea levels. Uh The earlier estimate is 65,000 years

174
00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:03.229
ago in a uh a site called Maja Bibi.

175
00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:07.500
Um There's evidence uh for human presence there, although

176
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.760
it's been disputed. Um But I guess, you know,

177
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.419
for our conversation here of like the dispersal of

178
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:16.609
modern humans that nuance is like less important. Um

179
00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:19.559
But then there's, there's a, there's a many sites

180
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.369
around 50,000. Uh THE Bering Strait crossing, it was

181
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.750
estimated at around 15,000 until recently, 15,000 years ago.

182
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.340
It's been pushed slightly back. And there's also an

183
00:11:31.349 --> 00:11:35.169
hypothesis called the uh the Beringia standstill where people

184
00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:38.440
might have actually inhabited Barring because it was like,

185
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.369
uh you know, it was a habitable land area

186
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.830
where people could stay, but then they could migrate

187
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.080
south. Uh And so they were sort of stuck

188
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.679
in Beringia for a while. Uh But that's again,

189
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.099
this is something that's emerging. Uh The picture is

190
00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:55.770
emerging. But yes, so people left Africa, let's say

191
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.250
around 60,000 years ago, they moved into Eurasia, both

192
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.580
Europe and Asia. Southeast Asia arrived in Australia at

193
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.039
least at 50,000 years ago. And the crossing through

194
00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:13.159
the Bering is Bering. Beringia might have occurred around

195
00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:13.989
20,000.

196
00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:19.590
Mhm. So, ok. So o off the record before

197
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:24.030
we started our conversation, uh, I, I wasn't expecting

198
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:27.169
to ask you about this beforehand, but, uh, I

199
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:30.099
guess that we also have to include this topic

200
00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:33.450
here. It's very interesting. I was saying of record

201
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.940
that, uh, even though I've already interviewed many paleoanthropologists

202
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.619
on the show, I've never talked with anyone before

203
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.690
about, uh, like ominous or ominate evolution in Portugal,

204
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.150
for example. And from that, we went into, OK,

205
00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:56.340
so what ominous species were really present in Europe.

206
00:12:56.349 --> 00:12:59.109
And we were saying that we know that Homo

207
00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:03.924
sapiens was here, of course, neanderthals. But apart from

208
00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:07.705
that, I mean, the rest, we are not really

209
00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:10.275
sure of, I mean, as far as we know

210
00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:13.684
they weren't here, but, uh, let's perhaps take a

211
00:13:13.695 --> 00:13:16.625
few steps back and talk about also the other

212
00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:20.174
hominid species, particularly the species that are part of

213
00:13:20.184 --> 00:13:24.965
the homogenous, starting with homo erectus. So, because that

214
00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:27.744
was the first species that actually as far as

215
00:13:27.755 --> 00:13:31.390
we know, uh migrated out of Africa,

216
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.590
correct, uh, we will get back to that because

217
00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:39.080
there's another hypothesis when we talk, I guess if

218
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.469
we're talking about Island Southeast Asia, I think we'll,

219
00:13:41.479 --> 00:13:43.130
we'll go back to that to this point of

220
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.229
who, who migrated out of Africa and when and

221
00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:48.770
like events. But yes, as far as we can

222
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.219
tell Homo actus was uh the first migrant, uh

223
00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:55.789
let's call it the first migrant out of Africa.

224
00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:59.260
Uh And that, that migration occurred at around 2

225
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.900
million years ago. And we have solid evidence of

226
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.150
uh Homo presence in Asia. There's fossils in Georgia,

227
00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:13.869
there's also fossils in China at around 1.8 million

228
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.260
years ago, if I'm not mistaken, and then down

229
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.260
to Island, Southeast Asia in Java for at least

230
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.619
1.5 million, right? And so, uh that was the,

231
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.059
so there's no, there's no one out of Africa,

232
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.690
there are multiple out of Africa's, right? And then

233
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.820
the question is, and then I think paleoanthropology uh

234
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.559
in the late 20th century, early, you know, 21st

235
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:43.239
century, the discussion was about how much the these

236
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.929
groups, these fossil groups contribute to the modern uh

237
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.750
to the present day people, right? So whether they

238
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.809
are related to us or not, but in Europe,

239
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.719
we have no evidence beyond the neanderthals in Asia,

240
00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:59.179
we have Hoor actus much earlier than the neanderthals.

241
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.650
The neanderthals appeared around half a million years ago.

242
00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:05.739
And then there are, you know, there's fossil evidence

243
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.270
for Homo erectus at 1.5 as I said in

244
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.099
Java and interestingly east of Java. Uh SO already

245
00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:16.150
in the Eastern Indonesia, Indonesian Islands, you have other

246
00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:20.340
fossil groups, uh homo fluorescence and Hoin Sis and

247
00:15:20.349 --> 00:15:23.400
you have stone tool records for at least 700,000

248
00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:26.950
years on those islands, which is quite remarkable.

249
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.030
And what about Homo He Heidelberg? I mean, it

250
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.679
is, it, is, is that species associated with any

251
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.859
out of Africa migrations or

252
00:15:39.869 --> 00:15:43.059
not? Yeah, I guess the Heidelberg is, I mean,

253
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.549
it depends who you ask could be thought of

254
00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:48.650
as a place like a placeholder, but these are

255
00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:51.739
like this transition fossils, right, that people always debate.

256
00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:57.250
Um AGAIN, it's showing the high Albert against, this

257
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.869
is showing you that uh the classification of these

258
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.549
groups into archaic moderns, neanderthals, erectus, whatever that morphological

259
00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:11.390
classification, it's very, very useful, it, it is very

260
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.000
accurate in some cases, but it can be problematic

261
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.440
in others, right? Because what do you do with

262
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.900
fossil forms that have sort of mixed traits or

263
00:16:20.909 --> 00:16:23.020
that you can't really classify? And so aid Albert

264
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.390
against is the transition between neanderthals and humans. And,

265
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.169
you know, Adalbert against is sort of sitting in

266
00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:34.770
between. Um YOU know, that's, that's um you can

267
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.559
some people classified as a different species, right? You

268
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.530
know, that that's a different thing, you know. Um

269
00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:43.849
And this goes back to, you know, the tradition

270
00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:46.960
of uh taxonomy, right, where some people are more

271
00:16:46.969 --> 00:16:50.489
prone to split and some people are more prone

272
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.049
to lump. And uh and that's so that's another

273
00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:57.200
example of what do you do? Uh I always

274
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.530
like to think about uh these problems of taxonomical

275
00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:03.719
classification of human groups. And I like to call

276
00:17:03.729 --> 00:17:06.530
them groups and not species, which already also, I

277
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.060
think shows what, where I stand on the debate.

278
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.819
Um But I, I always like to think about

279
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.618
other species, right? What would we do if we

280
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.750
were talking about different species that is not humans?

281
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.858
Would we be so prone to divide and classify

282
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.030
uh these groups as like different species? Um And

283
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.589
it's also like a, a bit daunting to think

284
00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:34.989
about, you know, that what we're doing when we're

285
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.310
classifying is really um in many ways, um racially

286
00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:45.800
profiling uh groups, right? Even if they are extinct

287
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.979
groups, right? What you're asking is, is this group

288
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:53.750
based on these characteristics fundamentally different from this other

289
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.270
group, right? This is what um it's the same

290
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.619
for genetics, right? If you're comparing two different genetic

291
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.010
sequences and you're asking, is this genetic sequence different

292
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.010
from this genetic sequence? What you're asking really is,

293
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.359
is, can I split these two groups into two

294
00:18:10.369 --> 00:18:12.910
different species or two different groups? And how do

295
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.770
you decide this? Is this an arbitrary reason? Is

296
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.739
this because, you know, when, when do you go

297
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.040
from, oh, we could group them to, you know,

298
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.719
they shouldn't belong together and that we should be

299
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.880
aware of that, right? Uh That, that's what we

300
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.729
are doing uh in human evolution. So when you're

301
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.819
thinking about all of these groups and all of

302
00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:36.469
these species, and of course, what we're all we're

303
00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:39.290
trying is to, to, to tell our story, right?

304
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.180
We're interested in our story. I wanna tell our

305
00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:43.859
story. I think it's great. Um But we need

306
00:18:43.869 --> 00:18:46.459
to be very careful in how we're thinking about

307
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:50.910
these problems. Uh And um yeah, anyway, we can,

308
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.510
we can keep going and we can back, can

309
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.939
come back to this point if you want.

310
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.689
Yeah. So I, I wasn't expecting to go there,

311
00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:00.449
but actually, let's dig a little bit deeper into

312
00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:03.140
that. I mean, I I've already asked also on

313
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.390
the show several times the question about uh species

314
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.420
classification in and of evolution. And I know that

315
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.810
there's tons of discussions surrounding that, but actually, you

316
00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:20.449
mentioned something there that I don't quite remember anyone

317
00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:25.660
at least directly mentioning in, in my previous conversations

318
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.729
on the show. I mean, where you basically, you

319
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.609
said that at least to a certain extent there

320
00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:37.410
might be an element of racialization when we're thinking

321
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.930
about species classification, particularly in this case, since we

322
00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:47.319
are uh comparing homo sapiens to other very, very

323
00:19:47.329 --> 00:19:53.910
closely related species, phylogenetic phylogenetic speaking. Uh So that,

324
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.880
that's interesting. So do you think that perhaps to

325
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.050
a certain extent there might be an element of

326
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.489
uh uh I mean, I will say politicization here

327
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.589
when it comes to uh perhaps as wanting or

328
00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:21.170
allowing for certain um uh hominins to be classified

329
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.520
as human or not? Let's say le le le

330
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.930
let's perhaps put it that we start with that

331
00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:30.250
and then we can go on from there.

332
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:38.729
Yeah, I think, I think that um pe people

333
00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:43.479
are always more drawn in the to look for

334
00:20:43.489 --> 00:20:46.369
differences, right? I mean, we're trying to explain processes

335
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.160
of differentiation, right? Evolution is a process that through

336
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.760
each um things that are the same become different.

337
00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.030
Um And so, and that that is sort of

338
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.650
unstoppable, right? Evolution keeps generating diversity, it keeps differentiating

339
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:11.010
things that were once the same. So we're obviously

340
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.890
drawn to look for differences. Now, we, we know

341
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.150
since the, you know, uh at, at least I'm

342
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.250
gonna be gentle, at least since the second half

343
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.569
of the 20th century that there's no scientific basis

344
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:37.819
to talk about groups of people today is like

345
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.229
anything different in a meaningful way. Mhm So we

346
00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:46.260
can talk about, there are no, there are differences

347
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.260
between people, right? You and I are different, right.

348
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.209
Right. You know, I'm different from my parents. The

349
00:21:54.219 --> 00:21:58.680
questions, right? The question is, is that meaningful? Right?

350
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.540
And there's no evidence that there's any meaningful differences,

351
00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:03.819
right.

352
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:09.520
00, ok. But then with this meaningful mean

353
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.949
here. So let's go back, let's go to, that's,

354
00:22:11.959 --> 00:22:16.599
that's good. Let's go to that racial classification of

355
00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:22.140
people, right? People of present day people. Mhm The

356
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:28.930
basis for those classifications are meaningless. Right. Right. For

357
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.439
what, what people proposed in the beginning, for example,

358
00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:34.959
the fact that some, you know, geographical groups were

359
00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:38.670
inferior to others, right, Europeans, right. Europeans went and

360
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.150
colonized every uh uh all parts of the world.

361
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.890
And this idea that the European some somehow were

362
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.489
more, uh, were brighter or more developed or whatever,

363
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.599
right? That is completely shattered. There's no basis for

364
00:22:54.609 --> 00:22:58.920
that meaning that's meaningless. But you can still say

365
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.479
that Europeans are, you know, uh they have lighter

366
00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:07.939
skin than say Africans. So that's an obvious statement.

367
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.750
Now, is it meaningful? That's what I'm asking. And

368
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.530
you could say, well, it depends, right? You know,

369
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.359
darker skin might help uh prevent, you know, skin

370
00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:21.489
damage caused by UV. So it could be meaningful

371
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.839
that way, right? But you need to be, I

372
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.819
mean, I guess if you wanna bring meaning to

373
00:23:26.829 --> 00:23:30.020
this or you're gonna say it's meaningful, then the

374
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.180
burden of proof is on whoever is saying that

375
00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:34.829
there's meaningful differences and there, what I'm saying is

376
00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:38.540
there's no evidence for that, right? So to say

377
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.099
that there are no differences, of course, there are

378
00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:43.250
differences and we know very well how those differences

379
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.930
emerge. The question is, are those differences warranting racial

380
00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:55.859
classifications? No. Are those differences warranting any sort of

381
00:23:56.089 --> 00:24:02.170
hierarchical grouping of people? No. Right. I think that's

382
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.170
scientifically pretty well established. Now, you go back to

383
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.319
the archaic. Now we're looking at other groups that

384
00:24:12.329 --> 00:24:14.520
we are not associating or we have not been

385
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:22.160
associating with the modern humans right now that, you

386
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.060
know, we're looking at the fossils and we're saying

387
00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:29.380
Oh, look, this brow ridge is different. This, you

388
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:36.680
know, the uh rib cage is different. Um The

389
00:24:36.689 --> 00:24:39.010
bones are thicker or less or more dense or

390
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.540
less dense or whatever. And we're saying therefore, this

391
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.859
is different and therefore this is a different species.

392
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.910
And what I'm asking or what I was trying

393
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.550
to allude to is that reflects I'm not saying

394
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.219
that people that are doing this are, that's not

395
00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:57.969
what I'm saying. Right. I'm not, I'm not passing

396
00:24:57.979 --> 00:24:59.810
any judgment on the people that are doing this.

397
00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:02.640
I'm just saying that the reasoning behind those types

398
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:11.050
of approaches are inherently racial classifications. Mhm. Right. They

399
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.770
are looking for differences. They're not saying that they

400
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.739
are meaningful. They're not saying that the neanderthals were

401
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.430
this or that or whatever, but what they are

402
00:25:19.439 --> 00:25:21.660
is they are profiling and we need to, I

403
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.150
mean, we just need to understand that that's what,

404
00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:28.829
that's what the field is doing. And I guess

405
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:32.390
this is important because how we then construct or

406
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.359
reconstruct the history of our being on the planet

407
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.420
and how we relate or do not relate to

408
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:46.920
these groups is informed by these perceptions. Does that

409
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.910
make sense? I hope that.

410
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. It, it makes lots

411
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.439
of sense. And by the way, let me just

412
00:25:52.449 --> 00:25:55.670
also add to that, that if people are interested,

413
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.199
I've already have on the show several conversations with

414
00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:06.680
geneticists, evolutionary biologists and anthropologists, both paleoanthropologists and biological

415
00:26:06.689 --> 00:26:11.030
anthropologists and I mean, I don't think that there's

416
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.430
any basis for racial classification and, uh, uh, I

417
00:26:16.439 --> 00:26:20.349
don't think that anyone can make a strong argument,

418
00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:23.300
at least nowadays with the information we have that

419
00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:28.400
race is scientifically meaningful in any way. I mean,

420
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.989
it's basically a social and political uh, construct, basically.

421
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.640
And, but, but on the other hand, uh, I

422
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.790
mean, on what you were saying just a few

423
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.589
seconds ago, uh, in terms of how that translates

424
00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:45.750
into perhaps to a certain extent, how we think

425
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.099
about other ominous species and how we classify those

426
00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:54.310
different species and how we think they relate to

427
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.709
us. Uh I was going to say actually that

428
00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:03.680
uh perhaps uh uh not so much today, I

429
00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:06.969
guess, I mean, if we talk to anthropologists and

430
00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:10.290
other scientists, I don't think that people would talk

431
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.890
in that way, but there's perhaps a legacy from

432
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.810
an earlier history in anthropology, not only with actually

433
00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:22.579
the use of racial classification, but also the way

434
00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:27.390
we, it uh thought about our relationship to other

435
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.040
ominous species where for example, it's very common to

436
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.930
hear people using, oh, you're a Neanderthal as an

437
00:27:34.939 --> 00:27:39.219
insult, for example, right. So there, there, there, there's

438
00:27:39.229 --> 00:27:42.489
perhaps I I'm not, I wouldn't say perhaps in

439
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.819
terms of the among the pe people who are

440
00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:50.589
part of the scientific community, but the broader public,

441
00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:53.829
let's say still has to deal to deal with

442
00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:59.550
some of these uh earlier scientific legacy of how

443
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.020
we fought about how we relate, not only to

444
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.449
other ominous species, but also to other human populations

445
00:28:07.459 --> 00:28:08.979
across the globe.

446
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.109
Right. And, and that for sure. And the, the,

447
00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:14.300
the problem with that is, uh, you know, again,

448
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.510
we going back to the same, right. There's no

449
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.260
scientific basis for any type of, you know, uh

450
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:27.900
racism. Somebody was telling me, uh the problem is

451
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.319
not the racist, the problem is racism. Right. Right.

452
00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:35.469
Um And that, that was alluding to the fact

453
00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:38.420
that there are, there aren't measurable differences. And so

454
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.859
what we know exactly what the process is, the

455
00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:45.780
demographic processes that are causing these differences are, but

456
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.520
I'll let me maybe go into a slightly um

457
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.209
not a tangent but something maybe that will help

458
00:28:53.219 --> 00:28:57.160
frame why. OK. Um Why we tend to think

459
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.599
about uh this hierarchical clustering of groups, right? Because

460
00:29:01.609 --> 00:29:05.079
oh, they are different. Therefore, one must be better

461
00:29:05.089 --> 00:29:07.979
and that, that in evolution is rooted through the

462
00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:13.319
to the start of the discipline, right? And evolution

463
00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:20.119
by natural selection implies or seemingly implies that, you

464
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.640
know, these things like the survival of the fittest,

465
00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:25.719
right? If the two things are different and one

466
00:29:25.729 --> 00:29:30.810
takes over, then one must be better. And because

467
00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:33.369
I'm a population geneticist, right, that is interested in

468
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.420
human evolution. But my background is population genetics, we're

469
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.099
forced to really think about the processes through which

470
00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:45.500
diversity emerges through which certain variants take over, right?

471
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:48.760
And what we, what I can tell you is

472
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.800
that most of the diversity existing today, right, in

473
00:29:52.810 --> 00:30:00.750
present day people is um functionally neutral, right? Doesn't

474
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.949
do anything and it's fluctuating. So some variants are

475
00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:07.660
at the higher frequency in Asia than they are

476
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.650
in the Americas or vice versa. It's not because

477
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.359
it's better or it's worse. It's because the processes,

478
00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:21.150
the demographic processes chance created those differences. But evolution

479
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.020
by random chance is a much less appealing title

480
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.239
than the survival of the fittest or evolution by

481
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.910
natural selection. And of course, you know, and so

482
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.839
those there are also, there are also sort of

483
00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:38.030
um historical contexts for how we are thinking about

484
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.939
these problems, how we're thinking about differences coming from

485
00:30:40.949 --> 00:30:44.260
how we understand evolution and what, what it is,

486
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.229
right? Uh EVEN the word evolution, right? As if,

487
00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:50.339
as if like that, this process of change is

488
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:53.280
creating always something that is better and that, that

489
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.219
is not only by the way, it's not only

490
00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:58.900
on among the general public, a lot of scientists

491
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.170
believe that, you know, the process of change of

492
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.739
the, of the, the DNA sequencing is improving something,

493
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.750
right? The chances that it's improving or it's actually

494
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.150
making it worse. You know, I'm not sure what's

495
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.109
what's more likely actually, I think, I think it's

496
00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:17.239
much more likely to create damage by using, by

497
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:22.790
having a mutation. But, you know, so what I'm

498
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.449
trying to say is that you cannot disconnect all

499
00:31:24.459 --> 00:31:28.180
of these things, these are people's imagination. And when

500
00:31:28.189 --> 00:31:30.540
we are looking at the data, there are objective

501
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.270
things we can measure and there are a lot

502
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.089
of reconstructions that are, as you said, political, uh

503
00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:41.689
they are historical, they are, you know, and we

504
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.910
need to, we need to understand that we need

505
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.670
to understand that and try, you know, the issue

506
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.489
is when we take something that is reconstructed and

507
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.829
we take it as dog mine, we take it

508
00:31:50.839 --> 00:31:54.410
as fact and it's politically informed rather than anything

509
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.079
else. So we need to be very careful both

510
00:31:56.089 --> 00:31:58.449
ways in whatever way. I'm not trying to say

511
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.439
um uh to say anything about specific politics. I'm

512
00:32:02.449 --> 00:32:06.369
just, you know, trying to bring to, to, to

513
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.969
the attention, you know, to our viewers that, you

514
00:32:08.979 --> 00:32:14.040
know, uh science is not immune to that, you

515
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.400
know, it has never been.

516
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.349
Uh No, I, I think this is actually great

517
00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:22.550
because I think it perhaps makes for a good

518
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.949
segue into the next topic because I was actually

519
00:32:25.959 --> 00:32:30.489
going to ask you about uh interbreeding between Homo

520
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.140
sapiens, neanderthals and possibly also the, the Nivens. But

521
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.449
ju just before we get into the interbreeding itself,

522
00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:43.000
uh tell us a little bit more about the

523
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:48.540
Denisovans. So where exactly do they come from? And

524
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.439
how do they phylogenetic relate to other hominids?

525
00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:57.439
The vans are the greatest mystery I would say

526
00:32:57.449 --> 00:33:01.209
in human evolution at the moment. Uh THE knees

527
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.589
ones are classified or identified based on the DNA

528
00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:07.640
on DNA evidence from a pinky finger from a

529
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.660
fragment of a pinky finger found in uh a

530
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:16.949
Siberia cave uh called the Nizo a cave. Um

531
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.060
And when geneticists, uh the group of Shante Pao

532
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:23.650
and, and Leipzig and, and colleagues, when they sequence

533
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.589
that uh fragment of bone, um they realized that

534
00:33:29.849 --> 00:33:34.589
the DNA sequence was remarkably different from that of

535
00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:39.489
present day people on average. Yeah. And that it

536
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.650
was similar to the neanderthals but also quite distinct.

537
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.160
And then they estimated the split times between these

538
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:51.199
different groups based on the variants that were different

539
00:33:51.209 --> 00:33:54.520
between these sequences. And what they saw is that

540
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.619
or they estimated is that Dennis have split from

541
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:04.459
the modern human lineage perhaps 700,000 years ago and

542
00:34:04.469 --> 00:34:06.770
their separation from the neanderthals might have occurred around

543
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.050
500,000. Of course, don't take this as like literal

544
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.250
dates, right? Of course. And the margin for us

545
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.899
could be 200,000 years either way, right? Because there

546
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.699
are all sorts of assumptions that we have in

547
00:34:20.708 --> 00:34:23.120
terms of generation, time, musician rates and so on

548
00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:28.310
right now, what is very interesting is that when

549
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.179
they looked at the distribution of, you know, first

550
00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:34.780
they asked, did this group which we didn't know

551
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.649
it's, we can say it again, we can look

552
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.938
at things and say this is different from that.

553
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:46.967
Can we call it a different species? Yeah, I

554
00:34:46.978 --> 00:34:48.599
don't know. You tell Mexican, we can we call

555
00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:52.928
it a different species? We, we, what we, what

556
00:34:52.938 --> 00:34:57.540
we found, what, what they found is that this

557
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.260
group had contributed to the pre to present day

558
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:05.300
genetic diversity um of humans. So, in particular, in

559
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.149
Asia, people carried the needs of an ancestry. They

560
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:11.580
carried this to this day. It's very, very small

561
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:15.540
fragment. Uh It's about a small proportion, about uh

562
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.790
1% or less. But then if you go to

563
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.419
Island, Southeast Asia to go to the eastern Islands

564
00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:23.189
of Indonesia, and if you go to Australia to

565
00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:25.510
New Guinea, this proportion can go up to like

566
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.790
four or 5%. Now is Southeast Asia and Australia

567
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.560
are very, very far away from Siberia. There are

568
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:38.010
thousands of kilometers away from Siberia and I'll, I'll

569
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.030
stop here for now. So these are the needs

570
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.010
of them. This is what we know.

571
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.159
Oh, ok. These are the Denisovans. We've also already

572
00:35:46.169 --> 00:35:49.729
touched a little bit on the Neanderthals. So, are

573
00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.489
these at least as far as we know the

574
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:58.060
two, the only two ominous species we homo sapiens

575
00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.070
interbred with?

576
00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:05.030
Well, yes. And to the extent these are the

577
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.350
two groups, you know, that are considered extinct. Uh

578
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.750
You know, there are two fossils from which we

579
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.239
were able to retrieve DNA. And the two out

580
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.449
of two, we get into breeding, right? So you

581
00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:20.979
get DNA from Neanderthals, you, oh, is that, is

582
00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:23.860
that, was that interbreeding between Neanderthals and the ancestors

583
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.760
of present day people. Yes, you get DNA from

584
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:30.139
the pinky finger. The Denise events was that interbreeding

585
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:33.350
between uh this group and the ancestors of present

586
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.679
day people? Yes. So, yeah, they are the only

587
00:36:35.689 --> 00:36:37.879
two, but they are the only two we could

588
00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:43.770
test directly. And then when you look around and

589
00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.709
you can ask, you know, uh do, does the

590
00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:50.399
genome, does the human genome around the world? Do,

591
00:36:50.409 --> 00:36:54.290
does the human genome carry any evidence for, you

592
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.310
know, mixing with other groups? Uh And so far

593
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:04.689
the answer is like, not really, but

594
00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:08.810
so uh th this is very interesting the basically

595
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.810
the history of our interbreeding with these other uh

596
00:37:13.919 --> 00:37:17.860
groups, species wherever you want to call them. Uh

597
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:22.229
So, uh because uh this is actually, and that's

598
00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:25.010
one of the reasons why I said earlier that

599
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.750
the previous conversation we have would make for a

600
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.709
good segue into this part of our talk today

601
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.219
because uh didn't the uh doesn't this also put

602
00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:40.659
into perspective the way we think about uh hominid

603
00:37:40.669 --> 00:37:45.840
species and how ho we homo sapiens relate to

604
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.260
some other uh hominids that we classify as a

605
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.780
different species because we were able to interbreed with

606
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.199
them. Of course, this perhaps points to a sort

607
00:37:59.209 --> 00:38:04.909
of definition of species that is probably out of

608
00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:08.159
date by now where it would be something along

609
00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:13.209
the lines of, of all the two individuals are

610
00:38:13.219 --> 00:38:16.010
part of the same species if they are able

611
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:22.620
to reproduce between themselves and generate basically fertile, fertile

612
00:38:22.629 --> 00:38:26.570
offspring or something like that. So that, that's perhaps

613
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.340
pointing more to that. But a anyway, do, do

614
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.260
you think that these would have, uh, our interbreeding

615
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:38.810
with other hominins would have any implications as to

616
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.179
how we think about the way we classify species

617
00:38:43.189 --> 00:38:46.250
and how we relate to other hominids?

618
00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:49.229
Yes, I think that's, yeah. So I'm biased. Right.

619
00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:51.159
I'm a biologist. So I will take the bio

620
00:38:51.439 --> 00:38:54.629
biological concept of species, right? Uh WHICH is an

621
00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:56.969
arbitrary way as well. Like you can think of

622
00:38:56.979 --> 00:38:58.610
it as an arbitrary way to define a species.

623
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.090
So if they can interbreed, then they are, they

624
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.729
belong to the same species and we know that,

625
00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:06.189
you know, in real life examples and other species

626
00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:08.879
like birds, for example, there are contact zones or

627
00:39:08.889 --> 00:39:11.489
certain groups can interbreed. But then if you go,

628
00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:14.030
you know, they can, they can. So for example,

629
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.270
in latitude, right, they can interbreed with adjacent latitudes.

630
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.830
But then if you take the populations from the

631
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.909
extremes of the distribution, they can't interbreed anymore, but

632
00:39:21.919 --> 00:39:24.530
the genes are traveling all the way across. So,

633
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.350
are these the same species or not? So, anyway,

634
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.310
so there are limits to that concept as well.

635
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.040
But I'll, I'll take another, I'll, I'll take it

636
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.770
through another lens. It's not only that they've interbred,

637
00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.780
it's let's think about what 2% mean, what does

638
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.479
it mean to have? 2% Neanderthal and what it

639
00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:53.679
means is that this significant proportion of Neanderthal variants

640
00:39:53.689 --> 00:39:59.320
in present day Europeans implies that the ancestors of

641
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.800
well Europeans and, and, and people around the world,

642
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:09.270
it implies that that proportion resulted from interbreeding events,

643
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.199
not sporadic but family units, right? That, that takes

644
00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:17.199
you to the to the point where you have

645
00:40:17.209 --> 00:40:20.820
to, you know, assume that the most likely scenario

646
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.540
is that these were family units, people were not

647
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.830
just like randomly, you know, encountering each other on

648
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.659
the landscape and say, oh, there's another, there's a,

649
00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:35.070
someone from another group, from another species and, you

650
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.280
know, let's sporadically, uh you know, interbreed with them.

651
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.959
These, these contacts occur through hundreds thousands of years.

652
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.300
They resulted in family units, they likely had shared

653
00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:51.209
culture. You know, there's the question about Neanderthal language

654
00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:54.110
all the time. I would, I would say, I

655
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.469
mean, I'm, I'm no expert on this, but I

656
00:40:56.479 --> 00:40:59.169
would say definitely they were speaking the same languages

657
00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:03.649
so that they have language.

658
00:41:04.459 --> 00:41:06.669
I would say that's the most likely scenario. Some

659
00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:08.239
people would disagree there studies.

660
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.520
No, I, I mean, actually that is very interesting

661
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.699
because uh as you said, some people disagree, but

662
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:17.729
there's also on the other hand, and of course,

663
00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:20.899
I'm not sure to what extent he is right

664
00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:24.530
on that or not. But there's uh a linguist

665
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:28.959
Daniel Everett, that makes a very, at least interesting

666
00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:33.840
argument, I would say as to uh how uh

667
00:41:34.129 --> 00:41:39.919
homo reactors are already at language. So,

668
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.979
yeah, like I, I would, I would have no

669
00:41:41.989 --> 00:41:44.070
issue with that at all. Like as a, you

670
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.030
know, as a theoretical concept, I have no issue

671
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.260
with that. I mean, and then again, you know,

672
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.989
if, if what we are observing is that this?

673
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.459
So OK, so let's get back to the interbreeding

674
00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:55.260
before we go to the language or the culture.

675
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.830
Sure. Sure. So if, what we are seeing is

676
00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.699
that neanderthals integrated the ancestors of modern humans we've

677
00:42:01.709 --> 00:42:03.610
also seen and we've talked about this, that modern

678
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.199
humans, there was sort of radiations out of out

679
00:42:06.209 --> 00:42:08.090
of Africa before the main, the main out of

680
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.810
Africa, like by modern humans that resulted in identifiable

681
00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:17.850
genetic footprints of modern human DNA into the Neanderthal

682
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.709
gene pool. We know that neanderthals in the knees

683
00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:23.100
of evens interbred and coexisted in the knees of

684
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.590
a cave, we know the knees of events interbred

685
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.989
in modern humans. So every combination that is possible

686
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.919
that we can test meaningfully like meaningfully in the

687
00:42:32.929 --> 00:42:35.489
sense that like that we can statistically get really

688
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.949
good signal from the data for which we have

689
00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:41.909
data. All the possibilities so far have come out

690
00:42:41.919 --> 00:42:46.620
to positive people have mixed people have interpreted with

691
00:42:46.629 --> 00:42:49.459
each other. Now, what does that, what that starts

692
00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:54.340
to me painting a picture of? Sure human groups

693
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.699
were relatively isolated. Sure, they could start developing some

694
00:42:57.709 --> 00:43:00.750
sort of feature because you know, physical feature, physical

695
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.820
trait because of either just random chance as we've

696
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.290
discussed or some adaptation, it could be some adaptation

697
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.350
to local environments. But to think of this as

698
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.780
isolated units that were not interbreeding with anyone that,

699
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.070
you know, there were different species. I think it

700
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.229
has no bearing anymore. To be honest, I think

701
00:43:20.239 --> 00:43:23.709
IIII I like to think of humans as uh

702
00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:25.639
you know, all the, all the, all these groups,

703
00:43:25.649 --> 00:43:33.770
Homo aus, the NAOS neanderthals, the moderns. Sure it's

704
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.110
useful, you can talk about them as separate entities

705
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:41.600
and have conversations, right? But to, to, to have

706
00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:45.409
to think that that would translate again meaningfully into

707
00:43:45.419 --> 00:43:49.639
separate species or, you know, iii I just don't,

708
00:43:49.649 --> 00:43:51.590
I just don't see, see how that's possible in

709
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.330
light of the current genetic evidence of widespread admixture

710
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.260
or widespread uh you know, interbreeding between these groups.

711
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.590
I just can't see it because to me, you

712
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.719
know, they're starting to emerge a picture as well

713
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:10.379
as like lithic transfer between groups, right? I mean,

714
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.520
I don't think this is going to last much

715
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.620
longer, but, you know, as a robust scientific theory

716
00:44:17.629 --> 00:44:19.800
that these are separate species or whatever, like I

717
00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.199
think, I think they're just one, like we are

718
00:44:22.209 --> 00:44:24.360
one species, call it homo, put it all in

719
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.870
the homogenous and say homo is a species and

720
00:44:27.879 --> 00:44:31.810
then within homo, there's different groups that you can

721
00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:37.219
intelligibly discuss, but biologically they're not necessarily meaningful. Now,

722
00:44:37.229 --> 00:44:39.750
you could say, but I think a really good

723
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.790
way to classify a species is to, you know,

724
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.389
look at the rate at which a particular stone

725
00:44:46.399 --> 00:44:51.570
ax is made by a particular group. And therefore,

726
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.989
because it's a different culture that the stone axes

727
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.120
in a particular way, this is a different species.

728
00:44:57.129 --> 00:44:59.889
OK? If that's, if that's how you want to

729
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:03.459
classify them and that's the drawers, you wanna sort

730
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:06.540
of construct, then that's fine. But you need, you

731
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.340
need to specify what you, what you mean by

732
00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.840
species. And I guess this is another issue, right?

733
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.379
Is that the concept of species is really artificial,

734
00:45:14.389 --> 00:45:18.219
right? It's, it's useful, it's very, very useful, but

735
00:45:18.229 --> 00:45:21.139
it doesn't always work. Uh You can always find

736
00:45:21.149 --> 00:45:23.909
exceptions to the rules and then unless you define

737
00:45:23.919 --> 00:45:26.689
exactly what you mean, like we can't really have

738
00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:29.320
a conversation, you know, in the sense that maybe

739
00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:31.719
you'll interview someone next and say no, no, clearly,

740
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.379
these are different species and it's not that we

741
00:45:33.389 --> 00:45:35.530
are disagreeing with one another is that the definitions

742
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.600
that we have are different,

743
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.000
but particularly when it comes to how we relate

744
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:45.429
to neanderthals, I guess it's very interesting because there's

745
00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:49.820
all of these, an entire set of questions, let's

746
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:56.780
say about how neanderthals went extinct, I guess. Uh

747
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:01.669
AND perhaps we can also discuss that but, and

748
00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:06.050
I guess that uh it's very common for people

749
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.580
to try to bring to the table suggestions or

750
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:15.629
hypothesis about how neanderthals went extinct because they were

751
00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:22.030
not as biologically or evolutionarily fit as Homo sapiens

752
00:46:22.189 --> 00:46:28.889
or perhaps they were inferior to us again, going

753
00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:31.399
back to that discussion surrounding race and all of

754
00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:34.139
that inferior to us in certain aspects. Like for

755
00:46:34.149 --> 00:46:39.199
example, they were less intelligent, they, the their sociality

756
00:46:39.209 --> 00:46:43.570
was less complex, their culture was less complex stuff

757
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:49.350
like that. So, is there any evidence of uh

758
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:58.010
meaningful differences be uh biologically speaking, uh cognitively speaking

759
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:03.399
between neanderthals and Homo sapiens? And, and by by

760
00:47:03.409 --> 00:47:05.790
the way, if you want to comment on the

761
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:11.260
bit about them going extinct, uh go ahead.

762
00:47:13.149 --> 00:47:16.899
Well, I think so you can take people across

763
00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:24.989
the world. Yeah, uh today and identify the Neanderthal

764
00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:33.379
segments in their genome and reconstruct entire Neanderthal genomes

765
00:47:33.689 --> 00:47:38.199
from that, right? So we can, we can basically

766
00:47:38.209 --> 00:47:40.649
recreate a Neanderthal without even taking the DNA from

767
00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:43.449
the fossil anymore just because we can identify those

768
00:47:43.459 --> 00:47:45.610
bits as Neanderthal because we had a fossil, right?

769
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.830
For which we would measure. What does that tell

770
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.830
you about them being extinct? So what, so if

771
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.419
you take a modern and we've done this like

772
00:47:58.429 --> 00:48:00.409
people, I I not our group but other groups

773
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:03.729
have done this. If you look at the contribution

774
00:48:03.939 --> 00:48:07.300
of modern, of what we are calling ancient modern

775
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:11.129
humans, these are the modern humans that left Africa

776
00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:15.300
their first, they are paleolithic under gatherers in Europe.

777
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:18.290
And you know, it's mostly in Europe and some

778
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:22.139
of them have not contributed to people today, but

779
00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:25.750
they are more than human are they extinct? So

780
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.280
that's my. So there are neanderthals who contributed to

781
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.389
the genetic diversity of present day people. We're saying

782
00:48:32.399 --> 00:48:36.800
the neanderthals are extinct. There are modern humans, ancient

783
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:40.409
modern humans that have not yet, no one's saying

784
00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:43.949
that they are extinct, right? So, but extinction, uh

785
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.620
you know, when we're, when we're talking about genetic

786
00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:50.000
differences of invariants, like, you know, you and I,

787
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.610
as we say it, right? We, you and I

788
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.520
are different because biologically different because we have variants

789
00:48:56.879 --> 00:49:00.419
in our genome that differ from one another. What

790
00:49:00.429 --> 00:49:02.679
I can promise you is that the differences that

791
00:49:02.689 --> 00:49:06.679
separate you and I will also eventually vanish. You

792
00:49:06.689 --> 00:49:09.729
just need time. Everything gets extinct in time. So,

793
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:15.929
so, but to say that a group that contributed

794
00:49:15.939 --> 00:49:20.110
2% of ancestry of present day people is extinct.

795
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.590
To me again, if you want to say that

796
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.449
there's no one around with specific physical traits that

797
00:49:29.459 --> 00:49:34.449
that group had. Sure, sure that and that those

798
00:49:34.459 --> 00:49:38.030
traits no longer exist. Yeah, like I can't argue

799
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.149
with that, but we have observed those traits around,

800
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.300
right? Until we do, we can consider them extinct.

801
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.500
And we've looked, I guess quite enough, there's 7

802
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.620
billion people or, or 8 billion people on the

803
00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:51.570
planet at the moment. It's not like we've looked

804
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.209
at everyone, but we've looked at enough people. You

805
00:49:55.219 --> 00:49:57.300
could say that those traits are extinct, that's different

806
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.689
to say that the group is extinct. You know

807
00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:01.169
what I mean, so that's my take on the

808
00:50:01.179 --> 00:50:03.189
extinction bit. And the other is like when you're

809
00:50:03.199 --> 00:50:05.870
talking about, yeah. And the reasons for that. Right.

810
00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.360
So I don't even go to the reasons because

811
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:09.330
I don't think they are extinct in that way.

812
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.409
Uh, AND so there is, first of all, I

813
00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:15.649
don't think there's any robust evidence, culturally from artifacts

814
00:50:15.659 --> 00:50:19.149
from, you know, uh, from the fossil record that

815
00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:23.250
suggests that the tools were less sophisticated. That was

816
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.870
true in the beginning. But I think that's that

817
00:50:24.879 --> 00:50:28.770
picture again, when you're looking at borrowings between ethics

818
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.600
across these groups, uh The picture starts to be

819
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:34.199
uh way more complex. And so it's always an

820
00:50:34.209 --> 00:50:38.129
attack on the hubris of the, of the moderns

821
00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:41.360
uh that, you know, somehow these archaic, they, you

822
00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:44.469
know, they kept on, on existing, they kept on

823
00:50:44.479 --> 00:50:46.610
like passing their ethics, they kept on passing their

824
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:52.770
genes. Um So those, those, those constructions are uh

825
00:50:52.909 --> 00:50:57.090
are to me, uh very fragile in terms of

826
00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.790
the scientific evidence. Again, you wanna say a specific

827
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.330
trait is gone, share, you wanna say specific stone

828
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.270
ax disappeared or whatever lithic what? Yeah, sure. Uh

829
00:51:09.229 --> 00:51:12.760
But we, I mean, think about this, if I

830
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.459
tell you that 2% of your family, it's like

831
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:20.600
it's not your family or it is only 98%

832
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.610
of your family is really your family. You belong

833
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.669
to this 98% the 2% with, without whom you

834
00:51:25.679 --> 00:51:28.129
would be here. They're not part of your tree,

835
00:51:28.139 --> 00:51:30.189
they're not part of your family. That's weird. I

836
00:51:30.199 --> 00:51:35.060
would say, uh, also there's, uh, another thing, um,

837
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.979
if you think about how genetic information is passed

838
00:51:39.989 --> 00:51:46.260
on from generation to generation, right? You're only 25%

839
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.709
your grandparents, right? So you have four grandparents. So

840
00:51:49.719 --> 00:51:54.830
you get 25% of them each, on average. If

841
00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:01.239
you go back one generation, it's halved 12.5% and

842
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:04.729
they keep, you keep halving that right. That means

843
00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:07.159
that for you to inherit 2% of the neanderthals,

844
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:11.350
that 2% had to be everywhere, everyone had to

845
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.280
have it. So you now have the 2%. Otherwise,

846
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.729
if no, if if people, some people didn't have

847
00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:20.340
the, the 2% would not necessarily survive, right? The

848
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:23.040
chances of that passing on would not be high.

849
00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:28.959
So everyone having 2% from a specific group that

850
00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:31.929
is identified based on a specific fossil that is

851
00:52:31.939 --> 00:52:34.979
identified then based on specific DNA taken from those

852
00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:39.500
fossils is quite limiting, right? So if you, if

853
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.189
you take the same, that's why I brought the

854
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:43.600
ancient modern humans. If you, if you have the

855
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:50.139
same type of rigorous uh constraint on who are

856
00:52:50.149 --> 00:52:53.979
the ancestors who, who went extinct, then there are

857
00:52:53.989 --> 00:52:57.669
no, basically uh there would be no groups alive

858
00:52:57.679 --> 00:53:01.100
yet there are 8 billion people. That's what I

859
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:01.889
mean. So,

860
00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.959
yeah, but, but that's why I asked you also

861
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:11.659
uh to comment on neanderthals going extinct because, I

862
00:53:11.669 --> 00:53:14.459
mean, o of course, I, I never want to

863
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.560
be arrogant or anything like that. I mean, I

864
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:20.860
don't have an anthropology degree. I've just talked with

865
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:23.800
lots of people on the show about those way.

866
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.939
But, but, but again, I mean, it, it always

867
00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:32.169
sounded, I mean, not always but, uh, for a

868
00:53:32.179 --> 00:53:36.820
long while now it, it sounded a bit weird

869
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:42.479
to me why we would say that neanderthals, we

870
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:46.639
really went extinct if we have that high of

871
00:53:46.649 --> 00:53:51.739
a percentage of their DNA in Homo sapiens. I

872
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.830
mean, I, I always found that a little bit

873
00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.030
weird. O of course, uh again, I could have

874
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.479
been missing some aspects. I, I mean, I, I

875
00:54:04.489 --> 00:54:07.199
don't know, someone could come and say, oh if

876
00:54:07.209 --> 00:54:12.070
you also share 99% of your DNA with chimpanzees.

877
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.979
So if tomorrow chimpanzees go extinct, I mean, tomorrow

878
00:54:16.989 --> 00:54:20.800
there's no, there's not one single chimpanzee on earth

879
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:25.620
just because you have 1% or 0.1% of their

880
00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:30.510
DNA. Does that mean that chimpanzees never went extinct?

881
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.639
I mean, oo, of course, there's those kinds of

882
00:54:33.649 --> 00:54:37.129
questions that we could ask but, but, but still,

883
00:54:37.139 --> 00:54:40.090
it always sounded a bit weird to me and

884
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:44.399
even particularly because, uh, it never seemed to me

885
00:54:44.409 --> 00:54:48.800
that there was much evidence to really make a

886
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:54.850
strong case for Homo sapiens having out competed Homo

887
00:54:55.169 --> 00:55:00.040
Neanderthal lenses on the basis of being cognitively or

888
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:04.639
culturally superior in any meaningful way. So

889
00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:08.469
regard, let me just clarify something with chimps with

890
00:55:08.479 --> 00:55:11.219
the chimps. When you say we're 98% chimps or

891
00:55:11.229 --> 00:55:14.699
99% like the chimps. What you're saying is that

892
00:55:15.689 --> 00:55:19.090
across the genome, right? The entire code, if you

893
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.889
look at the entire code, 98% or 99% 98%

894
00:55:22.899 --> 00:55:25.429
I think is, is the same. That's what you're

895
00:55:25.439 --> 00:55:29.270
saying. When you're saying you're 2% Neanderthal. That's not

896
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.250
what you're saying. That that's not what we are

897
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.729
saying. What we are saying is that around the

898
00:55:35.739 --> 00:55:40.050
world because that, and that's why I was saying,

899
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.520
you know, if you take people across the world,

900
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:46.969
you could reconstruct Neanderthal genomes because you and I

901
00:55:47.729 --> 00:55:55.479
do not have necessarily the same 2%. Mhm. There

902
00:55:55.489 --> 00:55:58.709
are 2% in the gene pool but it's not

903
00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:01.689
shared, right? You might have some who, who, you

904
00:56:01.699 --> 00:56:04.459
know, your 2% and my 2% might add up

905
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.399
to 4% or to 3%. You know what I

906
00:56:08.409 --> 00:56:11.000
mean? When is, when is when you're talking about

907
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:19.040
the 98% chimp, it's shared, it's fixed. Does that,

908
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.889
does that make sense? It might be a bit

909
00:56:21.899 --> 00:56:24.889
confusing to wrap your head around this. But one

910
00:56:24.899 --> 00:56:27.110
thing is the variation that is segregating in the

911
00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.439
populations and it's when I say it's 2% and

912
00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:33.379
that everybody has it, it's not that everybody has

913
00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:36.669
the same 2%. But because I have 2% let's

914
00:56:36.679 --> 00:56:39.010
say my I have 2%. My wife has 2%.

915
00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:43.149
Our kid will have 1% from me. 1% from

916
00:56:43.159 --> 00:56:47.199
her. Our kid keeps the 2%. Right. But now

917
00:56:47.209 --> 00:56:50.199
my kid is gonna have 2% Neanderthal DNA that

918
00:56:50.209 --> 00:56:52.120
I don't have like, at least 1% I don't

919
00:56:52.129 --> 00:56:56.139
have that. Does that make sense? So, some, because

920
00:56:56.149 --> 00:56:57.649
we get this question a bit, you know, like

921
00:56:57.659 --> 00:56:59.919
even, you know, in family discussions or whatever. So

922
00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:02.159
what, what does that mean? Like 2% Neanderthal but

923
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:05.659
we are 98% chimp, right? It's different that way,

924
00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:08.149
right? It's, it's, it's different in that way. One

925
00:57:08.159 --> 00:57:11.889
is the architecture of the genome, the the we're

926
00:57:11.899 --> 00:57:16.580
not talking about diversity, everybody is the same on

927
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:22.629
those 98% everybody. It's exactly the same, the 2%

928
00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:27.540
Neanderthal or, you know, uh not exactly but virtually

929
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.040
the same, the 2% is slightly different, right? The

930
00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:33.929
2% is uh the, the Neanderthal 2% is not

931
00:57:33.939 --> 00:57:36.159
the same. It's not comparable to the 98% shape.

932
00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:37.860
We're talking about two different things. I hope that

933
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:38.340
was clear.

934
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.110
Mhm No, no, no, no. Oo of course, of

935
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.090
course. And, and thank you for that clarification. Uh

936
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.949
uh Also because uh I, I mean, I will

937
00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:50.030
in my head uh I was thinking one thing

938
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.419
but then I said that we have just 1%

939
00:57:54.429 --> 00:57:57.840
of chimp DNA that, that uh so, so I

940
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:01.320
got it reversed a anyway. So uh but, but

941
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:04.709
that's very interesting because also another question that I

942
00:58:04.719 --> 00:58:09.429
wanted to ask you today is so what questions

943
00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:14.500
about our origins and evolution? And by our, I

944
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.620
mean, I'm not just referring to Homo sapiens but

945
00:58:17.739 --> 00:58:24.239
to AINS more generally, can genetics help answer? I

946
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.840
mean, in this case, genetics alone, how much information

947
00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.979
can we get from genetics alone?

948
00:58:32.149 --> 00:58:35.080
Well, from genetics alone, you can only get uh

949
00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:40.370
to understand whether particular groups, you know, mixed or

950
00:58:40.379 --> 00:58:42.610
did not mix or, you know, you can also

951
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.770
ask, and we have, we have worked on this,

952
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:50.090
you can ask, um you know, what's the likelihood

953
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.649
that even groups that are not sampled? You know,

954
00:58:53.909 --> 00:58:56.209
you can theory, you can abstract on it and

955
00:58:56.219 --> 00:58:58.439
by looking at present day people, you can abstract

956
00:58:58.449 --> 00:58:59.669
and say if there is a group that I

957
00:58:59.679 --> 00:59:02.780
haven't sampled, you know, but that would have split

958
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:06.179
around this time would have these characteristics, genetic characteristics.

959
00:59:06.189 --> 00:59:07.590
Would, you know, do I have, do we have

960
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:12.560
any evidence of mixing? Uh GENETICS itself alone can

961
00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:16.550
only answer that genetics always needs to reconstruct human

962
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.699
history. Genetics always needs to bring together the archaeological

963
00:59:20.709 --> 00:59:24.340
record always. And then if you want to ask

964
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:28.020
questions about language or about culture or I mean,

965
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:32.540
I can speculate, but we need to bring on

966
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:35.209
experts from those disciplines, right? And uh what I

967
00:59:35.219 --> 00:59:39.280
think the what I'm really interested is how genetics

968
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:46.459
can be used in ways that are nontraditional for

969
00:59:46.469 --> 00:59:53.550
genetics, right? For example, uh can we use um

970
00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:59.659
the 2% DNA from, you know, neanderthals, for example,

971
00:59:59.669 --> 01:00:03.370
can we like, how much does that information help

972
01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:06.399
us rethink? This is the discussion we were having,

973
01:00:06.409 --> 01:00:09.360
right? How much does that help us rethink culture?

974
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:12.340
How much does that help us rethink like? So

975
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:16.040
I think the implications of genetics are way beyond

976
01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:21.689
uh the exact, you know, inference um of ancestries

977
01:00:21.699 --> 01:00:28.459
or whatever. But they need to be, you know,

978
01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.719
they need to be integrated that you can't just

979
01:00:30.729 --> 01:00:32.840
say, all right. So I need, I need an

980
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.459
archaeologist now because I need to, you know, know

981
01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:39.590
the date of this, this, that's, you know, if,

982
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.239
if you sit down and talk to people, I

983
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:44.389
think uh what genetics can bring or, and, and

984
01:00:44.399 --> 01:00:45.830
by the way, it's not just genetics, it's any

985
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.610
discipline they can bring is way more than just

986
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.590
a disciplinary contribution to the problem. I think they

987
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.610
can help you rethink the problem. Uh They can

988
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:01.300
help reframe the question uh those discussions. And so

989
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.520
that's what I'm interested in. And by the way,

990
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.679
there's uh in interdisciplinary, there's uh an author, an

991
01:01:07.689 --> 01:01:11.209
anthropologist Georgina born. She, she refers to this as

992
01:01:11.219 --> 01:01:14.060
the reconfiguration of disciplines. This is how, how you

993
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.209
bring perspectives from different disciplines can actually not just

994
01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:19.370
add, it's not the, it's not the whole is

995
01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:21.169
more than the sum of the parts, right? So

996
01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:23.959
it's not just adding information, it's actually helping us

997
01:01:23.969 --> 01:01:27.110
rethink a lot of, of, uh, of what we

998
01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.989
are doing and, and you've seen, right? I mean,

999
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.419
the Denise, for example, is a really good example

1000
01:01:31.429 --> 01:01:33.860
as well if you know how genetics just described

1001
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:36.129
a particular group. And now this is opening all

1002
01:01:36.139 --> 01:01:37.770
sorts of questions, right? We're having to look at

1003
01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.699
the fossil record again and it's, you know, uh,

1004
01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:44.459
so what can genetics answer? I mean, who knows?

1005
01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:47.209
I mean, I think movements, of course, the, the

1006
01:01:47.219 --> 01:01:49.530
things that people have been using genetics for, you

1007
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.479
know, what is the ancestry of present day people?

1008
01:01:52.489 --> 01:01:54.060
Can we trace the movements of people in the

1009
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.939
landscape? Can we identify variants that help people adapt

1010
01:01:56.949 --> 01:02:00.820
to different environments, all of that? But much more,

1011
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:03.260
I think that is dry, that's still dry. And

1012
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.570
I'm a geneticist, right? But I think I'm interested

1013
01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.020
in opening sort of this too, more, more relatable

1014
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:12.510
questions about, you know, the, the processes, the, you

1015
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.219
know, because we're really interested in, in, in or

1016
01:02:16.229 --> 01:02:19.340
I am really interested, I'm curious about what, you

1017
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.459
know, how did things come to be? And that's

1018
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.729
you, you can't just use genetics for that. That

1019
01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:24.669
would be too limiting.

1020
01:02:25.929 --> 01:02:30.189
So we talked a lot about human disposals. Uh

1021
01:02:30.199 --> 01:02:33.870
And we haven't yet uh talked about this concept

1022
01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:38.750
of hoin intros. So, uh could you tell us

1023
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.310
about that and how we can study more or

1024
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.100
learn more about modern human dispersal through it.

1025
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.949
Yeah. So ho and integration is simply the app

1026
01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:54.750
mixture, right? Like it's basically the way that we

1027
01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.169
are, we were talking about mixing between populations, right?

1028
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.919
And the term sort of the jargon for that

1029
01:02:59.929 --> 01:03:04.129
is um hominid in progress. Uh But it's essentially

1030
01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:06.000
like you're looking at present day people across the

1031
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:11.030
world and you're trying to identify pieces of their

1032
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.949
DNA that, you know, were inherited from these different

1033
01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:16.330
groups, say the neanderthals and Denisovans and that's known

1034
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:23.330
as hominid in aggression, right? By comparing those different

1035
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.949
proportions, not just the proportion of say Neanderthal or

1036
01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:31.429
Denise and DNA, but also, you know, the frequencies

1037
01:03:31.439 --> 01:03:34.439
of the variants, right? We can, that's sort of,

1038
01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:40.459
that gives us another signal of demographic processes that

1039
01:03:40.469 --> 01:03:43.780
led, you know, to the peopling of certain places

1040
01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.270
that led to the geographical spread of people across

1041
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.270
the continent. And so, and when we look at

1042
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.260
this, so you could, you could actually, for example,

1043
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:54.570
because everybody carries 2% Neanderthal that is living outside

1044
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.419
of Africa carries 2% Neanderthal DNA. You know, you

1045
01:03:57.429 --> 01:03:59.090
can start saying, OK, so if that is the

1046
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.040
case where, where is it likely to have occurred?

1047
01:04:03.429 --> 01:04:07.169
Right? Um And you know, you have Neanderthal fossils,

1048
01:04:07.179 --> 01:04:10.090
um you know, in Europe and the Middle East,

1049
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.770
right? So if people are leaving Africa through, you

1050
01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.129
know, that parts or through, through the Middle East

1051
01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:19.879
and then colonizing Eurasia, then maybe that's a good,

1052
01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:23.800
you know, proxy for where maybe this Neanderthal admixture

1053
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.879
has occurred. Of course, it doesn't, people do not

1054
01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:29.679
just, you know, a mix and then become static.

1055
01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.219
So there's all these processes people keep, you know,

1056
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.669
traveling around and mixing and so on. But because

1057
01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:38.679
um the Neanderthal or the Denise of an a

1058
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.110
mixture uh or intros hominid Intres those signals are

1059
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.449
very clear because these populations were, you know, relatively

1060
01:04:47.459 --> 01:04:53.159
diverged, they create sort of these pulses, right? Um

1061
01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:57.229
It's, they are very easy to identify. And then

1062
01:04:57.239 --> 01:05:00.149
you can start comparing this, you know, proportions and

1063
01:05:00.159 --> 01:05:04.750
qualitatively the sequences uh the DNA sequences and start,

1064
01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.149
you know, reconstructing the puzzle of, oh if you

1065
01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:10.270
know this group has the same proportion as this

1066
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.889
group, oh, but they're qualitatively different. So that other

1067
01:05:13.899 --> 01:05:16.149
event must have occurred after they split. And so

1068
01:05:16.159 --> 01:05:18.350
you can start building the puzzle and having a

1069
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.340
reconstruction of hominid disperse. Oh sorry human dispersal through

1070
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:26.530
looking or by looking at uh the signals from

1071
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.620
the need of an and Neanderthal ancestry.

1072
01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:32.979
And since we're talking about admixture here, uh I

1073
01:05:32.989 --> 01:05:36.479
would like to ask you about a particular article

1074
01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:41.959
of yours uh where you argue or present evidence

1075
01:05:41.969 --> 01:05:47.679
that admixture has obscured signals of historical hard sweeps

1076
01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:49.590
in humans. So, could you could you tell us

1077
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:55.560
about that article and perhaps specifically explain what hard

1078
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.159
sweeps are?

1079
01:05:57.739 --> 01:06:01.429
Yes. OK. Uh So, first of all, I, you

1080
01:06:01.439 --> 01:06:03.300
know that that is by a colleague of mine

1081
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:05.439
that led that Yasim Soil Me at the University

1082
01:06:05.449 --> 01:06:08.580
of Adelaide. He's the first author uh and uh

1083
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:13.370
um Christian Huber who was also at Adelaide uh

1084
01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:16.330
and now at the University of Pennsylvania. So they

1085
01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.870
were the really, really the people leading this. So

1086
01:06:18.879 --> 01:06:21.159
in that, in that article, uh what we've done

1087
01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:25.409
is that we've uh so hard sweeps are uh

1088
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.949
instances, examples of uh positive selection. OK. So if

1089
01:06:31.959 --> 01:06:36.719
a mutation emerges in a population and has a

1090
01:06:36.729 --> 01:06:42.850
competitive advantage, right to the pre existing variant, uh

1091
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:48.649
the the carriers of that mutation will have a

1092
01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:52.949
higher reproductive uh rate. So they, this is called

1093
01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:57.500
differential reproduction, Darwinian selection. And that variant is gonna

1094
01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:03.209
increase in frequency quite fast depending on how, what,

1095
01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:06.219
what's what, what's the relative advantage, right? So the

1096
01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:10.449
higher the advantage, the more rapid it can increase

1097
01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:14.219
in frequency that increase in frequency because it's very

1098
01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:17.370
fast, we call it a sweep. So it sweeps

1099
01:07:17.379 --> 01:07:23.399
through the population right now when that occurs, just

1100
01:07:23.409 --> 01:07:27.629
imagine, right? This is a new variant occurring on

1101
01:07:27.639 --> 01:07:31.229
a particular background. But because it's a new variant,

1102
01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:36.550
it will sit on one genetic background, which is

1103
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.219
11 chromosome of the entire population, right? If that

1104
01:07:41.229 --> 01:07:43.520
sweeps in frequency, we can look at the, we

1105
01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.570
can look at it computationally. And what we observe

1106
01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.899
is a decrease in genetic diversity, local genetic diversity

1107
01:07:49.909 --> 01:07:54.449
around that variant. So we can identify this right

1108
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:59.969
now. There's been back and forth discussions about how

1109
01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:04.760
common was this during human evolution? And what we

1110
01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:06.870
have now is that we, we can, we can

1111
01:08:06.879 --> 01:08:09.870
access ancient DNA. So we can, you know, we

1112
01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:13.919
can look at not only present day genetic diversity,

1113
01:08:13.929 --> 01:08:16.040
but you can look at all genetic diversity on

1114
01:08:16.049 --> 01:08:18.859
people that are, that have uh diseases long ago.

1115
01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.279
And so we can start and ask, were these

1116
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:29.549
common, you know, uh in older times, right? In,

1117
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.930
in ancient times. And what we have found is

1118
01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:37.578
that since humans left Africa, uh in Eurasia, there

1119
01:08:37.587 --> 01:08:41.749
were, you know, several of these episodes of selection,

1120
01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:46.438
taking alleles to fixation. So sweeping through taking variant

1121
01:08:46.448 --> 01:08:51.578
genetic variants through fixation, but those signals have since

1122
01:08:51.587 --> 01:08:55.569
been obscured in president. So you can't detect that

1123
01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.600
signature anymore because the backgrounds that swept and fixed

1124
01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:06.000
in the population have since been admixed with non

1125
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:08.870
carriers, right? It's not like the non carriers went

1126
01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:12.020
extinct is that this happened in a local specified

1127
01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:15.740
time period. But then when, you know, people kept

1128
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:23.029
on, you know, gen genetically or mixing, reproducing those

1129
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.200
signatures disappeared. And that's why you can't find them

1130
01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:28.080
today. And so that's what that article is about,

1131
01:09:28.089 --> 01:09:30.339
right? Is that you could use ancient DNA to

1132
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:34.120
detect signatures of selection that have since been obscured

1133
01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:35.759
in present day people. So if you just have

1134
01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.930
present day genomes, you couldn't observe this. But because

1135
01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:40.990
we have ancient, we can look at ancient genomes

1136
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and identify those signatures, right? And and then ask,

1137
01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:47.520
but why aren't they present anymore? And the explanation

1138
01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:50.140
is because there were other people who didn't have

1139
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:53.419
that selection didn't, you know, occur on other, on

1140
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:56.450
all groups, right? And then when they mixed back

1141
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.899
then you did, the signal disappears.

1142
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.259
OK. So I have two more questions then that

1143
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:07.859
I think from a genetics perspective are also very

1144
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:12.379
interesting for the audience to learn more about also

1145
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:17.009
because they al they are also i informing when

1146
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.290
it comes to our own evolution. So what is

1147
01:10:21.299 --> 01:10:23.620
balancing selection?

1148
01:10:25.109 --> 01:10:27.689
I'm so glad someone asked. Um

1149
01:10:29.569 --> 01:10:31.629
I, I have to be the one. So,

1150
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.689
no, it's great. No, that's a great question. Um

1151
01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:40.080
So people think about, you know, selection, Darwinian selection

1152
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:44.290
as the again one variant being better than another

1153
01:10:44.299 --> 01:10:46.779
variant, right? And then of course, this is a

1154
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.000
struggle and then one takes over and that's the

1155
01:10:50.009 --> 01:10:53.859
survival of the fittest that's known in population genetics

1156
01:10:53.870 --> 01:11:00.080
that's called positive selection, right? Um But you could

1157
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:07.310
have instances where, for example, in humans, right? We

1158
01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:11.439
are a diploid species that means we carry DNA

1159
01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:15.620
from mom and from dad, we have two copies

1160
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.049
now. So if we have, if we have one

1161
01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:23.839
variant that had advantage towards the other, right? Of

1162
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.640
course, we pass each with 50% to our kids.

1163
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.049
But in the population, what would happen is that

1164
01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.490
one would take over, right? But it can be

1165
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.879
the case that you have two variants that are

1166
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.770
different in a particular gene. And therefore you're a

1167
01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:43.379
ne zygote. So you have two co two different

1168
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:48.560
copies. And because you have these two different copies,

1169
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:54.040
you have a selective advantage compared to carriers of

1170
01:11:54.049 --> 01:11:57.890
only a single copy. So compared to people that

1171
01:11:57.899 --> 01:12:01.609
carry one of the variants in double copy or

1172
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.419
the other variant in double copy, right? So you

1173
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:08.810
could think about let's color code this, you can

1174
01:12:08.819 --> 01:12:12.890
think about blue, blue, red, red and then someone

1175
01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:16.899
would have blue and red. If the people that

1176
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:20.759
have the blue and red have a selective advantage

1177
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.919
towards the the the carriers of either the red

1178
01:12:24.129 --> 01:12:27.700
or the blue genetic variant, they are more likely

1179
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:34.060
to reproduce, right? Because they transmit this either red

1180
01:12:34.069 --> 01:12:37.879
or blue with 50% the red, both the red

1181
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:40.990
and the blue will be maintained in the population

1182
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.129
for a longer period. So instead of the blue

1183
01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.899
or the red taking over both variants, both genetic

1184
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:52.089
variants will carry on. So selection is not favoring

1185
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.799
one or the other. It's favoring the diversity. It's

1186
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:59.359
favoring the maintenance of both because the zygotes for

1187
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:02.629
it's one example, the zygotes have a selective advantage.

1188
01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:06.279
And we know this, for example, in Africa, um

1189
01:13:06.399 --> 01:13:11.089
in regions where malaria is endemic, there is a

1190
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.370
variant is the sickle cell anemia variant. So if

1191
01:13:14.379 --> 01:13:17.009
you carry that variant in homozygos, so if you

1192
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.990
have two copies of that variant, you have sickle

1193
01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:24.580
cell anemia and you're very likely, you know, to

1194
01:13:24.589 --> 01:13:29.419
die at a very young age if you and

1195
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:33.029
then you have the so called wild type variant,

1196
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:39.240
um which makes you highly susceptible to malaria. So

1197
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:45.089
you're likely to eventually get malaria and potentially die

1198
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:49.439
from malaria. But if you have the sick cell

1199
01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:52.950
copy and the wild type copy, you do not

1200
01:13:52.959 --> 01:13:55.450
have sickle cell anemia because one copy of the

1201
01:13:55.459 --> 01:13:57.870
wild type is enough to have your red blood

1202
01:13:57.879 --> 01:14:03.160
cells trans efficiently transporting oxygen in your bloodstream. So

1203
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:06.990
you're not developing sickle cell anemia and you're more

1204
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.810
resistant to malaria infection. So the carriers of the

1205
01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:15.790
two copies are more likely to survive to an

1206
01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:20.759
older age and pass on their genes because because

1207
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:25.279
they pass each with 50% that variant is maintained

1208
01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.979
at a relatively higher frequency. Now it's not 5050

1209
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:29.700
because of course, if you carry the single cell

1210
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.660
anemia variant is more deleterious than the wild type

1211
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:37.830
sort of um uh the the wild that variant.

1212
01:14:37.839 --> 01:14:41.200
So the frequency is about 10 to 90%. So

1213
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:45.129
balancing selection is just the way through which selection

1214
01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:49.770
maintains diversity in populations, right? That's, that's what balancing

1215
01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:51.790
selection is. So it's not like positive selection where

1216
01:14:51.799 --> 01:14:54.410
you have one variant taking over. It's a process

1217
01:14:54.419 --> 01:14:57.939
through which through time variants are maintained in populations

1218
01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:01.310
for longer than expected, right? Because they are selected.

1219
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:09.259
So would that have specific implications as to how

1220
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:14.810
we think about how natural selection works, particularly when

1221
01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:19.689
we are talking about um adaptive traits because I

1222
01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:23.339
was just thinking that, ok, so if we compare

1223
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.490
uh balancing selection to a more, let's say, let's

1224
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:32.319
call it traditional view in genetics, that then translates

1225
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:36.899
of course into how we think about uh traits

1226
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:40.819
that are under selection and how they are over

1227
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:45.680
the over time, spread across particular populations and become

1228
01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:51.100
adaptations. Uh I mean, would there be implications there?

1229
01:15:52.399 --> 01:15:55.290
Yeah, I mean, so gene in population genetics, balancing

1230
01:15:55.299 --> 01:15:57.750
selection is taken into account. So it's, it's considered

1231
01:15:57.759 --> 01:15:59.899
a type of natural selection and that right there,

1232
01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:04.620
uh, in people's imagination, instead of the general public's

1233
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:09.290
imagination, selection means directional selection or positive selection, as

1234
01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:11.419
I said, like the more sort of traditional view.

1235
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:16.319
Um, SO I think in terms of implications for

1236
01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:18.250
genetics, they are taken into account in the sense

1237
01:16:18.259 --> 01:16:21.399
that we are pretty much aware of the existence

1238
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.410
of, of that type. I mean, it's not given

1239
01:16:23.419 --> 01:16:28.330
as much attention, uh, even in the field. Um,

1240
01:16:28.339 --> 01:16:30.379
THERE'S not a, there's not a lot of people

1241
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:33.299
who I was lucky enough to study it. There's

1242
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:35.439
not a lot of people who, who did to

1243
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:39.640
devote their time to this. Um, BUT yes, uh,

1244
01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.950
it's taken, it's taken into consideration and you can

1245
01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:44.419
really, you can do really interesting things, right, because

1246
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:47.520
you can have variants that segregate so that, you

1247
01:16:47.529 --> 01:16:51.350
know, survive in a population for hundreds of thousands

1248
01:16:51.359 --> 01:16:56.109
of years. Right. And if they think about this,

1249
01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.720
if, if, and it also has implications for how

1250
01:17:00.729 --> 01:17:02.430
we think about the neanderthals and the knees of

1251
01:17:02.439 --> 01:17:07.189
events and so on. Right? Because if now, let's

1252
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.330
say you have a meta population and you have

1253
01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:14.049
different variants in that population, right? And now one

1254
01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.990
group goes one way and another group goes another

1255
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.720
way and they've never meet and those variants that

1256
01:17:20.729 --> 01:17:22.549
were, you know, some people have one, some people

1257
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.830
have another variant, they both migrated with people, right?

1258
01:17:26.839 --> 01:17:30.529
Let's say that those variants are now under balancing

1259
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:36.089
selection. So they will be maintained in both groups

1260
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:38.870
for a long period of time. And when you're

1261
01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:42.009
looking at those two groups, they might now be

1262
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.640
even two different species, right? There might be two

1263
01:17:46.649 --> 01:17:50.229
different species that cannot reproduce, but they will still

1264
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.169
carry the two original variants that were present in

1265
01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.330
the ancestral population. So there will be parts of

1266
01:18:00.339 --> 01:18:06.069
the genome where species A or individuals in species

1267
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.450
A let's say will be more similar to individuals

1268
01:18:10.459 --> 01:18:14.509
in species B, then they will be to individuals

1269
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.950
in their own species on that particular part of

1270
01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:21.729
the genome. Does that make sense? Yes. Um And

1271
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.970
so these are called trans species uh uh polymorphism.

1272
01:18:25.979 --> 01:18:29.359
So these are variants that because they were maintained

1273
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:32.419
by balancing selection, they were able to survive the

1274
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:35.700
speciation event and still segregate to today. And we

1275
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:38.379
have this in humans and chimps, for example. So

1276
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:41.180
humans have some variant, I have some V in

1277
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:46.000
my own DNA that you don't, that you don't,

1278
01:18:46.549 --> 01:18:52.250
that I share with a chimpanzee and you have

1279
01:18:52.259 --> 01:18:55.500
variant that you share with another chimpanzee and it,

1280
01:18:55.509 --> 01:18:57.779
at that part of the genome, you are more

1281
01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:00.299
like that chimpanzee than you are like to me

1282
01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:03.759
and vice versa, right? The, the, we, you and

1283
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:05.310
I are still part of one species and the

1284
01:19:05.319 --> 01:19:08.299
chimpanzees are another species. But the process that led

1285
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:11.109
to that, you know, that, that DNA sequence, that

1286
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.100
DN the small bit of DNA, that where you

1287
01:19:14.109 --> 01:19:16.040
are more like the other chimp is still there

1288
01:19:16.069 --> 01:19:20.629
because it's an ancestral process, right? That, that occurred

1289
01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.080
really long ago in the ancestors of humans and

1290
01:19:23.089 --> 01:19:26.270
chimps. And that has survived the speciation event. I

1291
01:19:26.279 --> 01:19:28.270
mean, I guess this is a bit more complicated

1292
01:19:28.589 --> 01:19:32.910
to visualize um we can't draw here. But uh

1293
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:35.290
it's fascinating how, what selection can do,

1294
01:19:35.299 --> 01:19:41.149
right? Uh And so actually, trans species polymorphisms are

1295
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.580
my last question. So you've already explained there what

1296
01:19:45.589 --> 01:19:49.770
they are, but how do they evolve and what

1297
01:19:49.779 --> 01:19:52.220
can we learn by studying them?

1298
01:19:53.609 --> 01:19:57.939
So they emerge. So a trans species polymorphism first

1299
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:00.189
starts as a new variant, right? So there's a

1300
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.950
population and that some, someone, you know, a baby

1301
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.919
uh carries one variant, a mutation. And we call

1302
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:13.049
this a polymorphism right now that polymorphism, let's say

1303
01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.310
it's maintained by balancing selection so that baby is

1304
01:20:15.319 --> 01:20:17.939
able to have babies and those babies. Well, those

1305
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:19.890
people will then have other babies and so on.

1306
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:24.459
That variant then becomes, let's say a 50% frequency

1307
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:27.089
in the population. So 50% of the people carry

1308
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:30.680
one variant, 50% carry the other or you know,

1309
01:20:30.689 --> 01:20:33.129
they carry both as we've discussed, right? So it's

1310
01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.490
usually it's like 25% carry two copies of 1

1311
01:20:36.529 --> 01:20:39.899
25%. They carry two copies of another 50% carry

1312
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:44.370
both copies, right? We're still in one population. 11

1313
01:20:44.379 --> 01:20:48.779
variant, one genetic polymorphism that just emerged and became

1314
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:53.330
a 50% variant again. Now you take that example

1315
01:20:53.339 --> 01:20:55.229
that I was telling you about that population splits

1316
01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.350
into two, once those two populations no longer are

1317
01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:03.240
the same species. If that genetic variant, if selection

1318
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:07.549
is able to maintain that variant for hundreds of

1319
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:12.709
thousands or even millions of years, right? That results

1320
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.100
in, that's what we call a trans species because

1321
01:21:15.109 --> 01:21:17.470
there are, these populations are now two species. This

1322
01:21:17.479 --> 01:21:20.870
is a trans species polymorphism. It's just a genetic

1323
01:21:20.879 --> 01:21:27.950
mutation that is shared between species. Mhm OK. Right.

1324
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:31.160
And it's polymorphic, right? It's not that everybody carries

1325
01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:35.220
one, right? It's, they are both present in both

1326
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:39.859
species. What can that tell us about evolution? That

1327
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:43.310
can tell us that? Imagine a pro I mean,

1328
01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:48.250
you pass on your alleles or your genetic variants

1329
01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:53.209
with 50% probability in one generation. If you take

1330
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:58.649
millions of years, the probability that randomly a variant

1331
01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.729
passes on and survives for millions of years is

1332
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:09.189
virtually zero. Right. Mhm. So they all go extinct

1333
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:15.299
like the neanderthals. Um I was joking but so

1334
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:20.069
if you take that, you know that process for

1335
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.609
millions of years, it's not, it, it's just not

1336
01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.669
likely at all that, that variant would survive by

1337
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.240
chance. So you need to invoke selection, you need

1338
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:34.350
to say this variant, this polymorphism is doing something

1339
01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.569
right? That this diversity to be maintained, it has

1340
01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.490
to do something and then it becomes interesting. And

1341
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.100
when we look at what are the genes that

1342
01:22:42.109 --> 01:22:46.149
are carrying these variants, we're seeing, for example, genes

1343
01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:51.450
related to immun immunity. So apparently how you recognize

1344
01:22:51.459 --> 01:22:55.649
viruses and how you recognize, you know, uh micro

1345
01:22:55.669 --> 01:23:01.009
organisms that could infect uh your body, how, how

1346
01:23:01.169 --> 01:23:04.379
our genetic apparatus like how the proteins that are,

1347
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:07.169
you know, doing that recognition, how they are encoded.

1348
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:09.649
Apparently it pays off to have a lot of

1349
01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:14.049
diversity within them because the theory goes, you're more

1350
01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.919
likely to recognize a wider array of micro organisms

1351
01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:21.049
and therefore your body has the ability to sort

1352
01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.750
of fight uh different infections and be much more

1353
01:23:24.759 --> 01:23:26.790
efficient in recognizing that. So when we look at

1354
01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:28.729
balancing selection and look at these trans species bo

1355
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
morphisms, what we see is that they are located

1356
01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:35.020
in regions of the genome that are mostly responsible

1357
01:23:35.029 --> 01:23:36.500
for immune responses.

1358
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:41.669
Mhm No. Th this is very interesting. But uh

1359
01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.240
so my last question will be then by taking

1360
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:51.089
into account things like balancing selection and trans species

1361
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:56.839
polymorphisms. What implications does that uh does that have

1362
01:23:56.850 --> 01:24:02.640
specifically for how we understand human evolution and how

1363
01:24:02.649 --> 01:24:05.720
we relate to other hominids?

1364
01:24:07.799 --> 01:24:11.600
Well, not, not directly necessarily, right? But for example,

1365
01:24:11.609 --> 01:24:15.939
um you could ask whether the similarities between, you

1366
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:18.080
know, humans and Neander, there was a question that

1367
01:24:18.089 --> 01:24:20.700
in the beginning, uh people asked was, you know,

1368
01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:24.609
are the similarities between humans and neanderthals just resulting

1369
01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:29.729
from mixing or are they simply, you know, maintenance

1370
01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.950
of genetic diversity, either through selection or through chance

1371
01:24:33.049 --> 01:24:35.069
that is surviving in certain groups but not in

1372
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.700
others, but does not result from mixing uh but

1373
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:40.870
rather result from these processes. So, uh and I

1374
01:24:40.879 --> 01:24:44.029
think the evidence really suggests that there's no uh

1375
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.810
that interbreeding was really the cause for those similarities.

1376
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:51.149
Um But again, you can also ask for selection,

1377
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.910
not just trans species, but the polymorphisms, but selection

1378
01:24:53.919 --> 01:24:55.970
in general, you can ask, you know, whether the

1379
01:24:55.979 --> 01:25:01.290
Neanderthals, for example, experience the similar similar uh selective

1380
01:25:01.299 --> 01:25:05.850
pressures as say to modern humans. Um And yeah,

1381
01:25:05.859 --> 01:25:07.859
I think, I think selection is always an interesting

1382
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.979
way to study human evolution in the sense that

1383
01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:12.509
it tells you about the processes that you know,

1384
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.569
were beyond just the random chance of passing on

1385
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:20.180
variants. But it tells you something about the interactions

1386
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:23.399
with the environment even if those are rare. Um

1387
01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:26.879
It will tell you something about that. Um Yeah,

1388
01:25:28.339 --> 01:25:32.040
OK. Great. So, uh, just before we go, would

1389
01:25:32.049 --> 01:25:34.220
you like to tell people where they can find

1390
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.359
you and your work on the internet?

1391
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.140
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess I'm on Twitter

1392
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:43.540
on, uh, I guess it's a Dr, uh, Siete

1393
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:47.790
Sheer. Um, AND I, yeah, I'm on Twitter. You

1394
01:25:47.799 --> 01:25:48.859
can find me on Twitter. I'm not sure if

1395
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:50.470
that's my handle but you can, you know, you

1396
01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:52.799
can Google or you can search on Twitter uh

1397
01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:58.319
for me. Uh And yeah, um get in touch,

1398
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:00.359
I guess. And uh yeah, I, I post all

1399
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:03.109
of my work there. Uh And I do have

1400
01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.870
comments on other people's work sometimes nice, sometimes not

1401
01:26:05.879 --> 01:26:08.189
that nice. Uh And what they also, they also

1402
01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.660
comment sometimes nicely, sometimes not that nicely, but it's

1403
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:14.189
always a place to discuss science in, in a

1404
01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.209
very interesting way. So that's where you can find

1405
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:16.379
me.

1406
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:20.040
