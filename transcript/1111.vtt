00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.230
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.110
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.750
today I'm joined by Doctor Charlotte Bliss. She's an

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.350
interdisciplinary health researcher at the Department of Women's and

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.879
Children's Health at Uppsala University in Sweden. And also

6
00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.879
the digital psychiatry division at the Beth Israel Deaconess

7
00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.959
Medical Center at Harvard Medical School. And today we're

8
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.840
going to talk about her book, The Nocebo Effect,

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.600
When Words Make You Sick. So, Charlotte, welcome to

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.830
the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.930
Ricardo, it's, it's fantastic to be here at last.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.040
Thanks for having me.

13
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720
Great. So, OK, so we're going to talk about

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.000
the nocebo effect, but just before that, I would

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
like to ask you a little bit about the

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.159
placebo effect. So what is it?

17
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.430
The placebo effect is the better known of these

18
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.389
two effects, and it is the response that happens

19
00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:03.299
as a result of patients expecting to feel better.

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.379
So as a result of expecting to feel better,

21
00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:11.290
they actually do. Uh EXPERIENCE positive health benefits, and

22
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.449
it's particularly, it's considered to be particularly relevant to

23
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:22.290
experiences of pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and so on.

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.360
And there's actually quite a body of research now.

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.730
There's quite a mature body of research investigating the

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.290
placebo effect, um, but it's still quite a young

27
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.120
science, I will say. So, as an organized field

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.760
of research, while the so-called placebo effect has been

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.010
known for quite a while as an organized scientific

30
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.319
field, we're talking about 20 to 30 years old.

31
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.069
And what is the medical relevance of placebos? I

32
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.050
mean, why should we care about them from a

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.800
medical standpoint?

34
00:01:57.309 --> 00:02:02.389
That's a great question. Um, THERE'S actually, um, two

35
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.099
ways to answer this question. So the first is,

36
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.740
um, The first is that placebos are used as

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.699
tools, methodological tools in the clinical trials, and to

38
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.500
that extent they're really a measuring instrument. So that's

39
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.740
the first particular usage um because there's lots of

40
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.139
noise in clinical trials, patients, you've got to screen

41
00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.580
out for that noise. So if you want to

42
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.630
evaluate a particular treatment. And to see whether it's

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.830
effective for a condition, you need a placebo, which

44
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.149
is essentially should mimic everything about the treatment under

45
00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:43.110
scrutiny, except for the particular ingredients, if you will,

46
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.179
that you think are going to make the difference.

47
00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.589
You don't need to have a mechanistic story about

48
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.509
why they make a difference. You just have to

49
00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:54.039
isolate them as best as you can. Um, THROUGH

50
00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.610
the design of the placebo. So in that, so

51
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.679
placebos are relevant in that sense, and it's quite

52
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.330
seductive in a clinical trial scenario and a lot

53
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.160
of people um Think of placebos this way, including

54
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
researchers, but they tend to say placebos are sugar

55
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
pills, they're saline solutions. That's really not quite accurate

56
00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.289
because the placebos, they say, should be a sort

57
00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.240
of a measuring tool, so it should copy in

58
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.710
a sense what it is you're trying to measure

59
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.440
as far as possible. Um, SO it's like a

60
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.326
moving category of things. It's a control. One sense

61
00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.335
in which we can think of the relevance of

62
00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:35.776
placebos. The second sense is in a more clinical

63
00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:39.606
setting. And here we're thinking more about the vernacular

64
00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:42.955
in which people use the term placebo, and there's

65
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:47.195
almost a kind of family resemblance situation going on

66
00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:54.712
descriptively about how physicians or think about placebos. But

67
00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:58.231
in that scenario, we're thinking about a treatment that

68
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:01.511
might be offered to a patient, perhaps at a

69
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:05.841
primary care visit where the doctor doesn't think it's

70
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:08.632
going to be effective, um, but they think they're

71
00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:11.111
offering him a placebo, but they just want to

72
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.300
see a face, offer a demanding patient something. Um,

73
00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:18.720
THEY'RE not sure if it'll work. So if there

74
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.200
can be many reasons, it might actually work, or

75
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.160
they might actually want the illicit placebo effects, so

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.119
they give them something that they think the patient

77
00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:30.079
will think will work, um, and. So there's that

78
00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:33.839
separate area of of placebos in clinical practice, which

79
00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.660
is, which means something slightly different. I think in

80
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.959
the field there's a tendency to talk across purposes

81
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.920
a little bit, so I, I welcome that question.

82
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.040
There's definitely a need for differentiation here.

83
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.679
And what is then the nocebo effect?

84
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.250
The nocebo effect, um. So the lesser known to

85
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.489
say of these these effects is sort of characterized

86
00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:02.429
as the evil twin of the placebo effect. Um,

87
00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:07.250
AND it is what happens when you have negative

88
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.369
expectations about a treatment or or intervention as a

89
00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:17.329
result of which, you start to experience genuine negative

90
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:22.089
effects. Um, MUCH less research in in this, into

91
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.649
this phenomenon, but quite interesting studies, we'll get into

92
00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.600
them a little later, but um, yeah, fascinating effect.

93
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.609
So, and this is also interesting because you come

94
00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:40.670
at things from two different standpoints, both, both from

95
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.869
a philosophy standpoint and also from a medical standpoint.

96
00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:47.989
So, as a philosopher, particularly, how do you approach

97
00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:49.820
the nocebo effect?

98
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.609
Good question. So basically, I mean, when I think

99
00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:58.200
about philosophy, my my PhD was in philosophy, um,

100
00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.850
and this increasingly veered into quite an interdisciplinary health

101
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.709
research. But um I kind of go back to

102
00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.970
Wilfred Sellers's description of philosophy, which is seeing how

103
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.450
things in the broadest sense of the term hang

104
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.239
together in the broadest possible sense of the term.

105
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.440
Philosophers in general can approach things like the nocebo

106
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.850
effects with the ultimate mind body effect in a

107
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.489
few different ways. Um, MY particular approach to these

108
00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:33.769
issues has been epistemological in the sense, in almost

109
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:37.010
the most rudimentary sense of doing philosophy, which is

110
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.529
to say, what is you can't measure what you

111
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.510
first. DEFINED. So how do we define these these

112
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.910
terms and that sort of become the low lowest

113
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.190
hanging fruit in placebo studies, if you will, which

114
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.470
includes the nocebo effect. How are we defining these

115
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.790
terms? Are we talking across purposes sometimes? Um, SO

116
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.390
let's get clear about what those terms are and

117
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.350
then how we could possibly investigate them. Um, SO

118
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.500
related to that, I've also been interested in um

119
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.570
The replication crisis. So is it philosophical, it's evidence

120
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.690
based practice in a sense, but turning the question

121
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.809
in on the field, are we being robust enough

122
00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:26.579
in our methodologies? Are we canonizing findings a little

123
00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.089
bit too early? We need to show due diligence.

124
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.910
So again, it's the philosopher taking a step back

125
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.769
and somewhat finger wagging. It's not always appreciated, but

126
00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:39.429
um. So that's, that's one perspective and another area

127
00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:42.799
of philosophy is, is of course ethics, clinical ethics

128
00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:45.589
and thinking what are the implications of these effects.

129
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.600
So the nocebo effect um is a fascinating almost

130
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.920
a disruptive force in healthcare because you want to

131
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.010
uh. Ultimately, you want to tell patients about the

132
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.529
potential risks of treatments, possible side effects. How do

133
00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:04.809
you do that in a way that is honest

134
00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:10.809
and open without causing side effects and and causing

135
00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:15.970
potential harm or secondary harms to patients. Um, SO

136
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.859
that's another that's another area that I've I've been

137
00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:20.640
interested in. Mhm.

138
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.000
So, later in our conversation, we're going to talk

139
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.239
about the importance of distinguishing between real side effects

140
00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:33.558
of treatments, medication, and so on, and nocebo effects

141
00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:35.989
and how we can do it. But at this

142
00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:38.679
point, let me ask you, is there a risk

143
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:43.239
of over identifying the nocebo effect as the cause

144
00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.479
behind very diverse phenomenon?

145
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:50.479
Yeah, absolutely. Um, AND we tend to see this

146
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.119
particularly as you say, Thomas talked about, you know,

147
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.039
the emergence of paradigms and research and it's hard

148
00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:59.880
not to go back to that kind of appreciate

149
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.559
that kind of thinking when you look at the

150
00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.799
emergence of research into the nocebo effect. So there

151
00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:12.150
is a tendency, I think, to um over ascribe

152
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:18.609
certain phenomenon to nocebo effects. Um WE'RE not talking

153
00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:23.710
about overtreatment. We're not and some people have suggested

154
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.849
that that might be the case and the nasty

155
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.429
side effects of over treating patients. It's not any

156
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:33.739
kind of side effect. We're talking about a very

157
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:39.409
specific. Kind of effect, negative effect that results from

158
00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.809
expectations. Um, SO yeah, absolutely we've got to be

159
00:09:42.809 --> 00:09:47.770
vigilant, I think about that. Um, AND I think

160
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.609
when there is a tendency, particularly when we're thinking

161
00:09:51.609 --> 00:09:55.840
about something as negative as this as well, um,

162
00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:59.289
maybe to, to get even more freaked out and

163
00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:03.809
to start over ascribing or or. Uh, BUT, but

164
00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:05.780
we, we really have to be careful in this,

165
00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:08.429
this case, for sure. You know, if everything's a

166
00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:10.900
nocebo effect, nothing's a nocebo effect.

167
00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:14.710
Yeah. And when it comes to the harms that

168
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:20.349
come from overdiagnosis and overtreatment, should we treat them

169
00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:24.859
as nocebo effects or are they more the result

170
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:29.669
of side effects of drugs and unnecessary treatment?

171
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:33.679
I think it it can be a whole amalgam

172
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:38.640
of different things. Um, SO it could be the

173
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.719
overtreatment, over medicalization, lower thresholds for diagnostic categories, for

174
00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:51.039
example, in mental health conditions. These things could prompt

175
00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:54.950
nocebo effects. Um, BUT again, we got to be

176
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.390
very careful about saying what it is we think

177
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.510
might do the the might elicit those kinds of

178
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.469
effects, and then, you know, result does that try

179
00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:06.909
to find some ingenious way of of experimentally getting

180
00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:13.109
at that or empirically getting at that. So Yeah,

181
00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:20.380
That's uh Tricky question, but yeah. Mhm.

182
00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.229
So, uh, and do we have a good understanding

183
00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:28.450
of how nocebo effects are produced psychologically? I mean,

184
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.559
what are the psychological mechanisms that play a role

185
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.030
in them?

186
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.590
Another great question. Um, I think I guess I

187
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.109
would go back to we don't really have a

188
00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:42.469
good um put my head above the part, but

189
00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:47.429
we don't really have a good descriptive psychological depiction

190
00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:49.270
of these effects. And I think the same is

191
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.429
actually fair to say in placebo, the placebo effect

192
00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:55.390
as well. If you go back to David Marr,

193
00:11:55.469 --> 00:12:01.830
the cognitive scientist who thought about different levels of

194
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.710
analysis, different questions you can ask in a particular

195
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:09.789
field. You can ask the question of of what

196
00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:12.599
it is. What is the phenomenon that needs to

197
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.799
be described. I think what we have a tendency

198
00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:17.359
to do when it comes to the psychology of

199
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:21.320
nocebo effects and placebo effects, is we have isolated

200
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.320
what it is. It's an expectancy response and some

201
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.840
say, in some sense. But when we drop the

202
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.239
second question is that Maridentified was, you know, not

203
00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.909
just the what but how. Does this work? What's

204
00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:41.419
the what's the mechanistic level to explain this phenomenon?

205
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.729
And I think we have a tendency in general

206
00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:47.150
in psychology to to embark on a kind of

207
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.750
circular reasoning and just to say for the mechanistic

208
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.750
reason we're going to redescribe the thing that needs

209
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.580
to be better understood, and that is to say

210
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.469
it's expectancies that are, you know, but that doesn't

211
00:12:58.469 --> 00:13:02.609
really offer us an edifying explanation. So there seems

212
00:13:02.609 --> 00:13:04.489
to be this gap and what is, what are

213
00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:06.969
the mechanisms, what's sort of the algorithmic level of

214
00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:11.210
what's doing the work, the processing underneath, and then

215
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.489
of course there's the issue of the where this

216
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:19.090
instantiation and there we do have some interesting studies

217
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.419
in the nocebo effect on engaging um cortisol or

218
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.770
CCK is another hormone involved in anxiety responses. Um,

219
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.150
SO in general, we don't have a, we don't

220
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.400
have a fantastic story yet to tell about uh

221
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.510
the mechanisms, um, and then at the other side

222
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.349
of it, you know, can add the 4th, that

223
00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:47.640
4th question of why does the nocebo effect exist?

224
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.619
So the ultimate explanations, um. And there we need

225
00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:56.169
to, we could ask questions about is it a

226
00:13:56.169 --> 00:14:03.390
evolutionary adaptation, a byproduct of an adaptation. Probably there's

227
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.419
something very interesting to say there too. In general,

228
00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:12.900
it's probably a readiness, an anticipatory response, better to

229
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.239
over. Better to anticipate negative events in your environment

230
00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:23.409
and be ready with a physiological response to them

231
00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:25.969
and to err on the side of false positives

232
00:14:25.969 --> 00:14:30.210
and false negatives. So I think it's not too

233
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.409
much of a stretch to tell a story there

234
00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:37.950
about why those Now why effects arise and then

235
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.099
the issue is, are we eliciting them in modern

236
00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:43.390
environments in ways that are not appropriate that are

237
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.309
mismatched in the very places that people want to

238
00:14:46.309 --> 00:14:49.750
get help, hospitals, connects, and we're making people feel

239
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.229
more anxious. So yeah.

240
00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:56.510
So, uh there is this common idea that if

241
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:02.190
nocebo effects are caused by negative expectations, then they

242
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.510
are merely all in the head. Uh, DOES it

243
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.630
make sense to think about them this way?

244
00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:14.440
Uh, SO, good question. Um, AND we see pushback

245
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.159
particularly from patients when when we talk about these

246
00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:20.700
kinds of phenomena that it's a sort of degradation

247
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.869
or discrediting, um. I think two ways to think

248
00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:26.780
about that question, is it all in the head.

249
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.989
First is quite literally, um, and we can say

250
00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:32.869
scientifically, is it all in the head? Well, it's

251
00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:37.109
a nervous system response. Um, SO the nervous system

252
00:15:37.109 --> 00:15:38.900
extends throughout the whole body, so it's not quite

253
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.669
all in the head. Um, BUT, and related to

254
00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:45.190
that, we could say, look, if this is a

255
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.843
response, um, some capacity. CAPACITY that behavioral responses suite

256
00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:54.033
of of behaviors and cognitions that as a result

257
00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:57.872
of of observing something in the environment, you have

258
00:15:57.872 --> 00:15:59.992
to have the cues in the environment to elicit

259
00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:02.083
it. So it's not quite all again all in

260
00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:05.752
the head, either from that respect. But the more

261
00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:12.036
figurative, I suppose, um, common common. PARLANCE thinking about

262
00:16:12.036 --> 00:16:13.995
is it all in the head. I would be

263
00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:20.195
really wary about, again, saying that um that we

264
00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:25.085
are diminishing certain responses in that way. And we've

265
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.995
got to be careful too, because medicine has a

266
00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:32.596
history of gaslighting patients when it comes to conditions

267
00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:38.929
that are medically unexplained. CONDITIONS like stroke, so called

268
00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:42.030
chronic fatigues and more patients were in fact told

269
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.559
we can't find the reasons for this. We can't

270
00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:50.919
see any causes for this condition. We can't understand

271
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.280
that to some extent it wasn't in the doctor's

272
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.390
head of the medical community's head, what was wrong.

273
00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:58.840
So there go the explanations well it must all

274
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.679
be in the patient's head that they're making this

275
00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:05.079
up or um this isn't a real condition. So,

276
00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.479
um, I try to stay away from this all

277
00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:12.489
in the heads. It's understandable to an extent, but

278
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:16.810
it's a very loaded description, um, and we would

279
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.969
not want to be saying many medical conditions are

280
00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:23.560
the result of no effects. These are short-lived effects.

281
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.040
Um, THEY'RE probably not that severe, um, but they,

282
00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:31.209
but they can, they can have repercussions for healthcare,

283
00:17:31.329 --> 00:17:34.250
but I wouldn't want to be ascribing. Lots of

284
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.280
unknown medical conditions to this.

285
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.650
Right. So this is something that I think is

286
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.709
very important for us to try to understand. Uh,

287
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.770
HOW, how is the nocebo effect produced in the

288
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.969
clinical context? I mean, how is it that doctors

289
00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:57.359
and other clinicians and intentionally harm patients through it?

290
00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:02.520
Yeah, again, good question. So probably the best way

291
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.920
to answer this is by example. So it could

292
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.680
be through the power of suggestion, through what's communicated

293
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.099
to the patient, um. Including about side effects, um,

294
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.910
the manner in which it is communicated, um. Uh,

295
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.810
BUT also to some extent we might say that

296
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.640
the performance of medicine. So, uh, a couple of

297
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.530
interesting illustrative cases, um, Fabrizio Benedetti, who's a researcher

298
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:37.770
in placebo studies from Turin. DID a very interesting

299
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:43.010
what was called an open hidden style study. This

300
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.449
was published by 2003. Um, BUT basically in this

301
00:18:47.449 --> 00:18:52.000
study, he had a postoperative pain patients and he

302
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.170
hasten to add this study probably wouldn't get ethical

303
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.599
approval today. But he randomly allocated them to um

304
00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:03.704
Two conditions. One was that the truthful, the open

305
00:19:03.704 --> 00:19:09.354
condition where the patients were told that their intravenous

306
00:19:09.354 --> 00:19:12.234
pain medication had been disrupted and it had been

307
00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:15.755
disrupted. And then the other condition, um they were

308
00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:19.635
not informed that the morphine, the intravenous morphine had

309
00:19:19.635 --> 00:19:23.319
been disrupted, even though it had been. And what

310
00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:27.959
he found was those who were informed, uh, honestly

311
00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:31.880
informed about what had happened, were much more likely

312
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.560
to request pain medication, uh needed higher dosages of

313
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.594
it, um, small, small trials. Um, BUT that sort

314
00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:44.435
of offers a window to the potential, you know,

315
00:19:44.714 --> 00:19:47.354
knowing that something has happened, you have a negative

316
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:50.275
expectation and you start to feel much worse as

317
00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:54.064
a result. There's been other studies which are more

318
00:19:54.064 --> 00:19:59.390
suggestive, um. For example, one with which is another

319
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.459
sort of almost canonized study in the field, but

320
00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:08.030
done by an anesthetist Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center

321
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.390
where he allocated patients be allocated patients to, he

322
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.780
was giving them a local anesthetic, and he said,

323
00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:17.150
you know, I'm going to give you the anesthetic,

324
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.829
it's going to feel like a bee sting. Uh,

325
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.000
AND you know, patients actually felt reported much higher

326
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.660
levels of pain when they were told, I'm going

327
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.060
to give you an anesthetic and it's it's going

328
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.380
to make you feel better. So it's going to

329
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.969
reduce the pain or help you manage the situation.

330
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.260
So there have been studies like that which are

331
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.900
more suggestive and what you do find is patients

332
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.500
do report higher levels of pain and so on

333
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.959
when they're in the nocebo effect condition, um. I

334
00:20:47.959 --> 00:20:50.920
don't want to prolong it, but another interesting study

335
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.520
think worse, uh listeners might be interested in it

336
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.400
was carried out by Lauren High, who is at

337
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.520
a crumbs or who was at a crumbs lab

338
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.680
and Stanford, which is a lab is conducted quite

339
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:10.119
a lot of interesting placebo research. Um, AND what

340
00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:13.660
they did in this study was they induced, um,

341
00:21:15.469 --> 00:21:19.790
an allergic response through a histamine healthy normal people

342
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.530
and they they induce this this this uh allergic

343
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.530
response, um, which created a wheel, which is another

344
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.199
name for the sort of itchy rash, red rash

345
00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:35.510
that you get in your skin, uh, when you

346
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.670
have an allergy or it's irritated. And what they

347
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.729
did was they, they offered people basically a placebo

348
00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:45.040
cream. Um, SO there was, there was no active

349
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.160
ingredient in this cream there I'm I'm veering into

350
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.719
some of the language that I say you shouldn't

351
00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:52.160
use, but anyway, it was a cream that doesn't

352
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.089
really work. But they The manner in which people

353
00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:02.520
were offered the creams the providers delivery was what

354
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.989
was what was experimentally under investigation in this. Um,

355
00:22:08.089 --> 00:22:11.520
AND they basically, to cut a long story short,

356
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.819
find that the practitioners who delivered the treatment with

357
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.969
what looked like cus of high high level of

358
00:22:19.969 --> 00:22:23.589
competence. So they were very confident, knowledgeable, and so

359
00:22:23.589 --> 00:22:29.640
on. And high levels of empathy. Those patients experienced

360
00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:33.430
placebo effects, a reduction in the size, measurable reduction

361
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.650
in the size of the response, the allergy response,

362
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:42.589
and those who were in the low competence, low

363
00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:52.150
empathy delivery. ALLOCATION actually didn't didn't experience any diminishment

364
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.640
in the size of the wheel, the rash. So

365
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.640
how do we interpret that? And I say this

366
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.930
is a short study, needed replication, but Um, could

367
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.650
that have been that there was this sort of

368
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.689
um nocebo effect response going on that was mediated

369
00:23:11.689 --> 00:23:14.930
by a perception. This person is incompetent. They're not

370
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.689
going to help me. They're not empathetic. You don't

371
00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:20.010
look like they're trying to help me. And that's

372
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.489
what might have influenced um this kind of of

373
00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:29.599
anticipatory response. So fascinating kinds of studies that that

374
00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:32.040
begin to inch closer to what might be going

375
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.959
on here and how to elicit these responses or

376
00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:36.050
not elicit them.

377
00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:41.290
So can the nocebo effect be produced in different

378
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.479
ways in a clinical context?

379
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.380
Uh, IT could be. So again, through, it could

380
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.410
be through the behavior of the providers who say

381
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.949
it might even be, uh, you know, I'm not

382
00:23:53.949 --> 00:23:57.020
advocating so feng shui in the clinic, but it

383
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.060
could be if you if you're in a clinic

384
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.550
that looks disorderly. That that might signal some sort

385
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.869
of level of incompetence, or it doesn't look as

386
00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:08.150
clean as it could be, for example, there could

387
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.989
be certain cues in in the environment beyond the

388
00:24:10.989 --> 00:24:15.660
practitioner that leads the the the patient to have

389
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.189
um. A negative anticipatory response, but it could also

390
00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:24.079
be things that the provider is doing too. Do

391
00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:29.069
they instill confidence or not? Um, DO they look

392
00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:31.599
empathetic towards you or not, or are they are

393
00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:35.119
they, are they being cold and disinterested and too

394
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:39.089
busy, so. And aside from all of that, what

395
00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:41.209
is it they're telling you? What's the part of

396
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:44.150
suggestion here in terms of the information that they're

397
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.010
they're giving you, um, and if they're if if

398
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.829
it's negative information as well, that may, may lead

399
00:24:52.829 --> 00:24:54.849
to these sort of negative expectancies.

400
00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.099
And how can we distinguish real side effects of

401
00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:05.189
treatments from nocebo effects, and is it important to

402
00:25:05.189 --> 00:25:06.979
establish this distinction?

403
00:25:08.849 --> 00:25:11.599
I think it's important to establish the distinction. I

404
00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:14.989
think it's quite difficult to do, but it's certainly

405
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.920
possible to do. Um I think when we again

406
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.680
go back to with nocebo effects, these are likely

407
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.040
to be short-lived effects. They're not going to be

408
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.844
as severe effects. Some treatment side effects are going

409
00:25:29.844 --> 00:25:34.055
to be, um, they're not unlikely to be dose

410
00:25:34.055 --> 00:25:38.415
responsive. So a real treatment may, um, you know,

411
00:25:38.494 --> 00:25:41.535
the higher the dosage, maybe the higher the level

412
00:25:41.535 --> 00:25:45.055
of the toxicity, the negative, the side effects are

413
00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:48.500
going to be. So, um, but again, you know,

414
00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:52.020
we need more studies to to investigate whether that's

415
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.930
in fact the case for the nocebo effect. Um,

416
00:25:56.209 --> 00:26:00.219
IT'S certainly possible to do, it's, it's challenging, um.

417
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.319
If we go back to the clinical trials where

418
00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:11.170
um, Which are a great venue for um beginning

419
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.329
to identify some of these interesting effects, but they're

420
00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:18.969
not a great way to isolate the nocebo effect,

421
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.609
for example, because as I said, there's a lot

422
00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:24.770
of noise in a clinical trial. If you give

423
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.969
people if they're allocated to the placebo arm in

424
00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:33.449
a clinical trial, um. And then they experience negative

425
00:26:33.449 --> 00:26:37.689
effects as a result, that could be owed to

426
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:40.119
natural history. Some people are going to feel worse

427
00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:43.729
anyway. It could be responder biases you're told that

428
00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:45.949
there's a potential for side effects and you actually

429
00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:48.729
just report them, but you don't experience them. It

430
00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:52.959
could be attribution of of symptoms you already feel

431
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:54.449
you had one too many glasses of wine the

432
00:26:54.449 --> 00:26:57.660
night before you didn't sleep well, whatever, and you

433
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.050
you you're misattributing. Some of those low grade symptoms

434
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.849
that any of us may feel at any time

435
00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:06.170
to the side effects or whatever, and then as

436
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.810
a result, it would be a confusion, a conflation

437
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:13.729
to say those are nocebo effects. So um again

438
00:27:13.729 --> 00:27:15.930
it requires a lot of ingenuity to try to

439
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.890
isolate exactly these specific effects, but the kinds of

440
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.810
experiments I mentioned are a good starting point for

441
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.810
thinking about how we do that.

442
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.619
So, I probably should have asked you this question

443
00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:34.150
earlier, but why should we care about nocebo effects?

444
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.130
What kinds of consequences can they have?

445
00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:43.160
Well, the first issue is that they can make

446
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.469
they can make people feel worse, and we don't

447
00:27:46.469 --> 00:27:48.989
want to, particularly in the medical setting, we don't

448
00:27:48.989 --> 00:27:53.219
want people to feel worse. Um, AND if people

449
00:27:53.219 --> 00:27:56.560
are already experiencing, say they've got a chronic illness,

450
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.819
um, you're offering them medications, um, it could be

451
00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:04.150
a tipping point scenario where, you know, even if

452
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.630
some of these these um The nocebo effect is

453
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.550
time limited. It's it's not as aggravating as some

454
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.229
other side effects may be. We don't want to

455
00:28:15.229 --> 00:28:18.140
compound that, and we don't want people to really

456
00:28:19.589 --> 00:28:23.114
to experience, to feel worse as a result. So

457
00:28:23.114 --> 00:28:26.915
there's that issue of just um the negative effects

458
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:31.594
in themselves. Um, BUT there's also the issue of

459
00:28:31.594 --> 00:28:36.275
people dropping out of care or becoming anxious about

460
00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:40.444
taking medications. And so, uh, either through word of

461
00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:45.515
mouth experiencing or experiencing these kinds of side effects,

462
00:28:45.714 --> 00:28:49.064
um, there are health repercussions. I'll give an example,

463
00:28:49.155 --> 00:28:53.160
um. 70% of the world's population had a COVID

464
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.329
vaccine. But many people, we don't actually have the

465
00:28:56.329 --> 00:28:59.479
exact figures, many people didn't get a second vaccine.

466
00:29:00.089 --> 00:29:02.459
Why is that one of the leading reasons was

467
00:29:02.459 --> 00:29:06.369
side effects. Um, AND perhaps get into the literature

468
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:12.380
and nocebo effects, nocebo responses to the COVID vaccine,

469
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:20.869
but that in itself. THE public health consequences in

470
00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:25.790
a sense of potential here for nocebo effects as

471
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.430
the cause of of health behaviors can be quite

472
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.910
serious. So from a small thing, big things can

473
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.750
emerge. Um LOOK at if you consider lack of

474
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.270
very paternalistic term, but lack of adherence to medications,

475
00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:43.390
bad patients not taking their medications. But a lot

476
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.660
of the reasons. And that is side effects. So

477
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.930
in the US alone, it's about 100,000 deaths every

478
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.650
year because people don't take their medications as they've

479
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.530
been prescribed. So it's a serious issue. It's a

480
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:03.449
costly issue as well. I think it's figures of

481
00:30:03.449 --> 00:30:08.430
$100 billion in the US every year because of

482
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.239
failures, the consequences of failures to take medication. So,

483
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.640
um, It can be a costly issue, um, both

484
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.880
literally and figuratively, the patient's health. So it's it's

485
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.040
the it's it's the downstream consequences, I think that

486
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.469
might be some of the most severe issues here.

487
00:30:29.939 --> 00:30:34.640
Uh, BUT can nocebo effects do actual clinical harm

488
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.280
to people more than just producing more side effects

489
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.560
and leading people to quit their treatments?

490
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.000
Um, I think it's a very, very good question.

491
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.349
Uh WHAT are the extent because we don't want

492
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:54.969
to exaggerate the the the effect size here. I

493
00:30:54.969 --> 00:30:58.410
think that would be a big mistake. Um, I

494
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.329
think it's an I don't really want to answer

495
00:31:00.329 --> 00:31:03.050
the question because I don't know. Um, BUT I

496
00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:08.250
would suspect that as I've said, these are limited

497
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:13.150
effects in many ways. Um. It depends how one

498
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.540
wants to interpret harm, I suppose, to the extent

499
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.030
of the harm, but I think it's open to

500
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.949
empirical questioning. So for example, if the study that

501
00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:26.099
Fabrizio Benedetti carried out, you know, if patients really

502
00:31:26.829 --> 00:31:30.180
need higher levels of pain medications as a result

503
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:36.829
of behaviors within the clinic, um. You know, if

504
00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:39.479
you, if you're experiencing a much higher threshold of

505
00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:42.359
pain, that's not a good thing. Now, the extent

506
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:46.630
to which the pain can be dialed back through

507
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.079
behaviors that could reduce those sort of nocebo effects

508
00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:53.099
is an open question. We might even say like,

509
00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:55.560
what is the actual dosage of morphine that you

510
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.160
over and above you've got to get what is

511
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.270
the equivalency? Um, BUT Uh, you know, there is,

512
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.119
I, I, I would be cautious here too. It's

513
00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:07.640
it's a good question because in general as I

514
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.560
said before, we've got, we've got to pay attention

515
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.939
to, especially when the field is hot when you've

516
00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:15.079
got this idea of the mind body problem, the

517
00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:17.739
placebo effect and nocebo effect, you know, we're doing

518
00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:20.160
an interview on it. I've done different kinds of

519
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.400
media things on the placebo effect. Um, IT'S a

520
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.270
hot field and there's always a tendency to exaggerate

521
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.650
effect size unwittingly sometimes, but scientists do it too,

522
00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:36.760
because you know you can court a bit of

523
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.030
media attention, and there is this publication bias too,

524
00:32:40.239 --> 00:32:43.564
of course you find. FINDINGS, they're more likely to

525
00:32:43.564 --> 00:32:49.155
be published, canonized, cited widely, fewer replication. So that

526
00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:52.594
we should be, uh, as I do due diligence

527
00:32:52.594 --> 00:32:55.594
and not exaggerate what possibly is going on here.

528
00:32:55.645 --> 00:32:59.765
So are they harmful? They're not pleasant. How do

529
00:32:59.765 --> 00:33:03.170
we want to decide what's harmful. It's an open

530
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:03.760
question.

531
00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:09.290
Mhm. And can words themselves produce harm? I mean,

532
00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:13.489
if, for example, a procedure is expected to produce

533
00:33:13.489 --> 00:33:18.089
some pain and doctors mention it beforehand, can it

534
00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:21.520
cause even more pain than it was supposed to?

535
00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:26.510
It could do. Um, SO again, we could take

536
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.550
a look at that open open hidden paradigm, the

537
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.819
study by Fabrizio Benedetti, where what was simply disclosed

538
00:33:33.349 --> 00:33:36.910
or not communicated did make a difference to reported

539
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.829
harm and for the need for medication. Um, AND

540
00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:45.729
we've got other studies that suggest similar things that

541
00:33:45.729 --> 00:33:49.270
you know, what is communicated is what makes the

542
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:56.160
difference to patients, um. I give another example um

543
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.920
of, again, this was from Eli Crum's lab where

544
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.290
they did um a fascinating study on and this

545
00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:08.120
this study actually lasted for around 6 months. So

546
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.949
patients with peanut allergies, um, And the treatment for

547
00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.918
that is just to sort of give a dose

548
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:17.228
dosage of the peanut in order to get the

549
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:21.510
antibodies levels up. And in both groups, they actually

550
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:26.899
communicated that you will feel side effects of this

551
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:33.909
treatment intervention. There's going to be some discomfort scratchiness

552
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.310
in your throat, and they advised them both in

553
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.830
the randomized control both groups were told the same

554
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.550
information, but in one group, they were told that's

555
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.870
the signal the treatment's working, you know, stick with

556
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.739
it. So it was positively framed. And in fact,

557
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.550
that made a difference to sticking with the treatment

558
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.199
regime, to the extent I think it was only

559
00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:01.070
4% of people dropped out whenever they were given

560
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:05.040
the positive framing versus the 20% who weren't told

561
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.350
you this is a positive signal, reframe reframing, reinterpreting

562
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:15.129
the negative side effects. And in fact at the

563
00:35:15.129 --> 00:35:18.770
end of the 6 months, patients and the positive

564
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:24.010
mindset, the positive uh framed information had higher levels

565
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.639
of antibodies, so the treatment actually did work. Um,

566
00:35:27.649 --> 00:35:32.250
SO there we're getting at. How you can manage

567
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.899
expectations in a way that's positive for patients that

568
00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:40.820
actually can mean that they, they adhere to treatments,

569
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.979
they stick with it, uh, they're less anxious and

570
00:35:43.979 --> 00:35:49.370
fearful and um. You can help overcome what potentially

571
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:54.729
the side effects, possibly be via dialing back the

572
00:35:54.729 --> 00:35:58.250
nocebo effects or negative expectancies about what how to

573
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:03.290
think about these negative effects. So there there are

574
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.360
going to be many ways, I think, in which

575
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.530
providers, especially if they had the time to do

576
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:13.800
it, but um. Could be better managing patients' expectations

577
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.449
leading to more desirable health outcomes. Mhm.

578
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:24.300
Um, ARE healthcare professionals aware of the nocebo effect?

579
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.899
Uh, DO they underestimate it? Um, I mean, what

580
00:36:27.899 --> 00:36:29.209
do we know about that?

581
00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:32.179
I, we don't know a great deal about it,

582
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.620
but when we wrote the book, we suspect that

583
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:39.449
that uh just through almost a data as well,

584
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:43.179
healthcare professionals don't know as much about the nocebo

585
00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:49.919
effect. It's been this overshadowed phenomenon, which is interesting

586
00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:52.919
in itself, but we suspected that there's just not

587
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:57.959
that much awareness about it. Interesting, so when I

588
00:36:57.959 --> 00:36:59.520
speak to people about it, they'll say I've never

589
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.639
heard of that, but they've heard of the placebo

590
00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:07.409
effect. So I think more, more education, more literacy

591
00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:10.399
around that could only be a good thing and

592
00:37:10.399 --> 00:37:13.370
it be beneficial for patients to know as well

593
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.209
because they can begin to find ways to manage

594
00:37:16.209 --> 00:37:19.290
their own expectations or my own case, I don't

595
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.610
like to read the side effects of medications I

596
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:26.030
think knowledge isn't always power, you know, so in

597
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.790
that scenario, I don't really want to know. Yeah.

598
00:37:30.209 --> 00:37:33.850
So, uh, let me ask you two questions 2

599
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:39.050
or 3 questions about psychotherapy specifically. So, uh, and

600
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.050
please correct me if I say something wrong here,

601
00:37:42.169 --> 00:37:45.330
but it seems that it doesn't matter much what

602
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.689
type of psychotherapy is used. They all tend to

603
00:37:48.689 --> 00:37:51.850
work more or less equally well. If this is

604
00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.090
the case and the different uh kinds of psychotherapy

605
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:59.354
are Based on different theoretical approaches to human psychology

606
00:37:59.614 --> 00:38:04.364
and apply sort of different methodologies. Does it mean

607
00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:08.215
that we might be dealing with placebo effects here?

608
00:38:08.334 --> 00:38:12.294
I mean, could it be that psychotherapy is mostly

609
00:38:12.294 --> 00:38:12.985
placebo?

610
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.340
It's a really big question. Um, YEAH, so there

611
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:25.489
is this debate in the evidence base in psychotherapy,

612
00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:29.580
how to interpret the findings, there's some controversy over

613
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.250
it too, I will say, but so, for example,

614
00:38:32.379 --> 00:38:36.139
Bruce Wamold is a researcher in this field who

615
00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:39.760
advocates the perspective, he says. It doesn't really matter

616
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.570
what treatment you give. It could be a sort

617
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.010
of cognitive behavioral therapy. It could be more of

618
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:51.129
a rosarian humanistic therapy. It could be a psychodynamic

619
00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:55.689
the embarking these archival digs into your personal history

620
00:38:55.689 --> 00:38:57.770
your childhood and all the rest. It doesn't really

621
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.919
matter what you do that um they all tend

622
00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:04.500
to have. They're much of a muchness and sometimes

623
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:10.100
this is called the dodo bird hypothesis from Lewis

624
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.020
Carroll's book where the dodo bird had said, you

625
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.870
know, there's a race and all everyone has one

626
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.899
all must have prizes. So how do we explain

627
00:39:21.899 --> 00:39:26.260
then the effectiveness because psychotherapy is quite effective, it's

628
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.530
very effective for many patients, so not all. Um,

629
00:39:30.899 --> 00:39:33.070
BUT, uh, what is going on and then sort

630
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.659
of as a result of that, uh, is this

631
00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:40.820
idea of the common factors hypothesis. So there must

632
00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.659
be factors that are common across all versions of

633
00:39:43.659 --> 00:39:47.100
therapy that are what make the difference here. And

634
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.939
so it's getting into what could those core. Uh,

635
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.729
FACTORS B and they're thought to be things like

636
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.800
the therapists effect, so it could be high levels

637
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.239
of empathy, could be, you know, signals of competence

638
00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:03.379
and so on to. It could be that the

639
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:07.629
patient has higher expectations. They find a theory behind

640
00:40:07.629 --> 00:40:11.760
it plausible, um, something that they can get on

641
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.919
board with. So is there sort of a core

642
00:40:14.919 --> 00:40:19.669
set of um Uh, factors there that may be

643
00:40:19.669 --> 00:40:22.120
making a difference and then some people say, look,

644
00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:25.949
all of those factors are really related to inducing

645
00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:29.989
placebo effects and that therefore, it maybe is just

646
00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:32.590
a placebo. I think it gets murky here because

647
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.989
I don't really want to say that it would

648
00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:36.360
be a placebo, but I don't also think so

649
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.790
the idea is it all just a placebo placebo

650
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.149
effect. Um, AND, and researchers like Jensa is a

651
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:48.389
researcher at the University of Basel has. Notably, um,

652
00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:52.100
advocated that that might be be what all the

653
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.439
place that psychotherapy is, and therefore, we should be

654
00:40:55.439 --> 00:41:00.120
communicating to patients, uh, what actually is going on

655
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.020
here, um. So I would say that uh I,

656
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.310
I, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't, I don't believe

657
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:10.360
that that's necessarily. I don't think that that psychotherapy

658
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.280
is just a placebo effect. I think there's possibly

659
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.520
other things that are going on in a psychotherapy

660
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.449
encounter. That could be beneficial to patients. I don't

661
00:41:21.449 --> 00:41:23.370
want to digress too much, but it's a couple

662
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.169
of thoughts on this. I say depression is an

663
00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:31.080
adaptive response, for example, but you know, in some

664
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.469
scenarios in modern environments, you know, we're getting more

665
00:41:34.469 --> 00:41:37.159
and more depressed. What might be a way to,

666
00:41:37.169 --> 00:41:39.610
if you think about theories as to why people

667
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:44.919
get depressed. Couple of theories one is it's an

668
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:49.659
analytical rumination hypothesis, when you're depressed, you're more likely

669
00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:54.179
to think deeply about difficult social problems, and so

670
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.300
it's a way of socially withdrawing, thinking more about

671
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.889
them. Is it possible that in some psychotherapy contexts

672
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.659
that the therapist actually facilitating you working through those

673
00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:08.949
problems, and that's what's. ON the top of the

674
00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:11.510
fact that you're getting this boost of possibly placebo

675
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.310
effects. Possibly that's what's going on. It could be

676
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.149
that additionally that you're, you're the therapist is a

677
00:42:18.149 --> 00:42:20.669
role model, for example, of how to, how to

678
00:42:20.669 --> 00:42:24.310
behave differently. Of course, the therapists say that's exactly

679
00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.590
not what they're doing. They would never tell their

680
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.949
client how to improve their behavior, possibly that there

681
00:42:29.949 --> 00:42:33.560
is some kind of role modeling happening. So I

682
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.919
think there are many, many, uh, it's under determined

683
00:42:36.919 --> 00:42:41.810
what exactly is going on in psychotherapy, um. But

684
00:42:42.209 --> 00:42:46.330
certainly we could say it's a forum whereby people

685
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.750
could be induced to to have a more positive

686
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.129
expectancy about am I going to feel better as

687
00:42:52.129 --> 00:42:55.090
a result of this process or not? And there's

688
00:42:55.090 --> 00:43:00.610
also it's also an arena where suggestability people particularly

689
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:05.810
in a vulnerable state may be induced if they're

690
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:10.732
already feeling skeptical, depressed. ANXIOUS, could be made to

691
00:43:10.732 --> 00:43:13.683
feel worse. It might not always be beneficial to

692
00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:16.343
ruminate over problems, particularly if there's not much of

693
00:43:16.343 --> 00:43:20.883
a solution where the therapist isn't offering suggestions of

694
00:43:20.883 --> 00:43:24.353
what look like plausible solutions. You could feel worse.

695
00:43:24.762 --> 00:43:28.433
Um, AND I sort of go back to Scott

696
00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:33.522
Lillian, the late Scott Lillian, um, who very iconoclastic

697
00:43:33.522 --> 00:43:39.795
figure and very necessary figure in. AND psychology, who

698
00:43:39.795 --> 00:43:41.676
was one of the first really to to say

699
00:43:41.676 --> 00:43:47.395
that um around he has around 10% of patients

700
00:43:47.395 --> 00:43:50.115
felt worse as a result of psychotherapy. We don't

701
00:43:50.115 --> 00:43:54.125
talk about that enough, I think because we possibly

702
00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:56.466
tend to think when people are undergoing a treatment,

703
00:43:56.676 --> 00:43:59.835
a talking cure, so to speak, that there's not

704
00:43:59.835 --> 00:44:02.875
really any potential for harm, but in fact that

705
00:44:02.875 --> 00:44:05.909
there could be. Uh, THROUGH a variety of means,

706
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.419
one of which might be nocebo effects. You just,

707
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:10.379
you just don't you feel worse.

708
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:17.090
So psychotherapy can harm, it can produce nocebo effects

709
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:17.639
as well.

710
00:44:18.459 --> 00:44:23.010
I think it's certainly think that that that's a

711
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.290
very real possibility. So if we go back to

712
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:31.560
the study on um the the Lauren House study,

713
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.689
for example, which looked at perceptions of competence and

714
00:44:35.689 --> 00:44:39.560
empathy. Now if those influence the size of placebo

715
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.655
effects and potentially we don't. Again, we don't have

716
00:44:41.655 --> 00:44:44.245
enough research on this, but say they also influence

717
00:44:44.245 --> 00:44:47.925
nocebo effects. If you're sitting with a psychotherapist, and

718
00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:49.645
you don't have a grid, you don't think that

719
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:53.725
they're they're particularly competent, or that they're they're not

720
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:56.485
being as empathetic to your needs as they could

721
00:44:56.485 --> 00:45:01.445
be, that might influence you to feel have negative

722
00:45:01.445 --> 00:45:06.850
expectations about. Not only your current health, but about

723
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.540
this provider is not going to be able to

724
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.860
help me. So you drop out of care, you

725
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.780
think, and everything feels worse and you think well

726
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.580
nobody can help me now, or you know, you

727
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.139
start to feel considerably worse about your situation. So

728
00:45:21.379 --> 00:45:26.250
I would suggest that certainly it's plausible that psychotherapy

729
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:33.300
um could lead to negative effects for patients.

730
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:38.830
What about the use of labels and diagnosis in

731
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:43.350
psychotherapy and even the medical system more generally? Can

732
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.870
those produce uh nocebo effects as well?

733
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.550
Yeah, it's an interest again, really interesting question. Um,

734
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:56.510
AND I think we sort of secular trend of

735
00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:01.300
lower thresholds for mental health conditions and diagnostic classifications.

736
00:46:01.429 --> 00:46:04.510
Um WITHOUT again we don't want to get into

737
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.139
the sphere of saying, you know, but I think

738
00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:07.739
that there's can be a good case to be

739
00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:09.669
made in the modern world, more and more people

740
00:46:09.669 --> 00:46:12.149
actually are more depressed, they're more anxious and so

741
00:46:12.149 --> 00:46:19.080
on too. But certainly, um, Uh, the, the over

742
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.520
medicalization of, of, of many everyday experiences, some of

743
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.270
which may not be in the realm of of

744
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.679
of of medically significant, but are just, you know,

745
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.320
problems with living, um. If there's a tendency to

746
00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.360
over medicalize those, you get to tell people there's

747
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.919
something wrong with you as opposed to I see

748
00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:43.199
most people feel lousy sometimes or or whatever. This

749
00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:47.439
is part of life. Um, THERE could be a

750
00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:50.959
risk that you're inducing people to to have a

751
00:46:50.959 --> 00:46:55.719
perfectionistic idealistic perspective. OF theirs of what life life

752
00:46:55.719 --> 00:46:58.340
ought to be like, and that as a result,

753
00:46:58.379 --> 00:47:02.139
they have a really negative set of expectancies that

754
00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:07.139
in fact induit nocebo effects that could lead people

755
00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:11.419
to feeling just generally anxious and more depressed, um,

756
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.060
more worried about their life. So, um, I think,

757
00:47:16.129 --> 00:47:17.770
I think that there is a real risk of

758
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.169
that certainly do, yeah.

759
00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:24.780
So going back to the COVID vaccine for a

760
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.739
minute because you've already mentioned it briefly earlier in

761
00:47:28.739 --> 00:47:32.979
our conversation. Um, SO, now and then we hear

762
00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:38.699
claims from people about supposed COVID vaccine side effects.

763
00:47:39.139 --> 00:47:43.030
How do we go about distinguishing real side effects

764
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.580
of the vaccines from nocebo effects?

765
00:47:48.209 --> 00:47:54.129
Yeah, so the really interesting literature came out of

766
00:47:54.129 --> 00:48:00.090
the clinical trial data for the COVID-19, the COVID

767
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.969
vaccine. So when you, various researchers looked at the

768
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:08.250
data and they found that people who were allocated

769
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:15.822
to The saline vaccine, the fake vaccine, also reported

770
00:48:15.822 --> 00:48:21.222
side effects. Um, AND depending on the the meta-analysis

771
00:48:21.222 --> 00:48:23.343
that you looked at, a couple of them were

772
00:48:23.343 --> 00:48:27.583
published. One attributed as much as 2/3 of the

773
00:48:27.583 --> 00:48:33.996
vaccine side effects. To uh to nocebo and the

774
00:48:33.996 --> 00:48:38.476
use of nocebo phenomenon. Another one said 3 quarters

775
00:48:38.476 --> 00:48:40.795
of the side effects were. Why did they say

776
00:48:40.795 --> 00:48:43.756
that? Because again, the people who are in the

777
00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:48.585
control who got the placebo vaccine um reported side

778
00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:52.139
effects to. So it seemed like that which is

779
00:48:52.139 --> 00:48:56.239
really interesting because it's possible that as a result

780
00:48:56.239 --> 00:48:59.489
of uh a few things going on here, and

781
00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:04.100
this is where it's almost the, the um Clinical

782
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.409
trials are not an amazingly good place to isolate

783
00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:13.739
nocebo effects nor placebo effects, because there's so much

784
00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:17.209
noise in them, but it could have been that

785
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.419
because an amalgam of things, it could have been

786
00:49:20.419 --> 00:49:23.580
responder biases, that is, you know, you're told that

787
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.780
there's certain side effects and then you just you

788
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.090
mimic them, you know, unintentionally sort of people pleasing

789
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:33.760
response to researchers. It could have been um. Again,

790
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.760
misattribution of certain low level low grade symptoms that

791
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.000
one already faces could be natural history, but it

792
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.879
also could have been genuinely in that case, people

793
00:49:45.879 --> 00:49:47.959
were told about the side effects and as a

794
00:49:47.959 --> 00:49:50.320
result they did start to feel worse or it

795
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.479
could have been, well, that's that's that's that's possibly

796
00:49:53.479 --> 00:49:56.639
what was going on in which case. SAY whatever

797
00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:59.000
was happening in the in the group who received

798
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.239
the actual vaccine over and above, that might have

799
00:50:02.239 --> 00:50:05.989
been the the the genuine side effects associated with

800
00:50:06.239 --> 00:50:10.540
the vaccine, which were not that many proportionately compared

801
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:15.879
to to when you received a placebo. So, um,

802
00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:20.239
Yeah, so isolating those effects and this is uh

803
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:25.489
uh differentiating them from genuine and nocebo effects is

804
00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:27.449
really, really tricky from the noise of if you

805
00:50:27.449 --> 00:50:30.679
like, more broadly, you could talk about the nocebo

806
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:37.540
response, uh. TRICKY situation to to isolate those. I'm

807
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.350
not sure if that quite answers the question, but

808
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:47.199
uh yeah so.

809
00:50:48.209 --> 00:50:50.129
So let me ask you a different kind of

810
00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:53.570
question now. When it comes to media reports, because

811
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:58.520
sometimes we get negative media reports of certain medicines,

812
00:50:58.969 --> 00:51:02.290
can they produce nocebo effects as well? And I

813
00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:05.050
mean, in this particular case, since we're focusing a

814
00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.409
little bit here on the COVID vaccine. Is it

815
00:51:08.409 --> 00:51:12.929
that, for example, the media communicating about potential side

816
00:51:12.929 --> 00:51:17.889
effects of the vaccine might have contributed to producing

817
00:51:17.889 --> 00:51:21.010
nocebo effects in people. And I mean, I would

818
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.689
imagine that this is a sort of delicate question

819
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:29.010
or delicate thing to explore because Of course, from

820
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:36.469
the perspective of uh medical, the ontology, the ontology

821
00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:39.600
potential side effects have to be communicated to patients,

822
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.560
but it can be done by doctors, not necessarily

823
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.800
by the media. So, I mean, what do you

824
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.479
think about this?

825
00:51:49.129 --> 00:51:53.739
So, yes, it, it's, again, I mean, the media

826
00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:57.750
could play a role here, um. And I think

827
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:02.260
it's, it's, it's really challenging to answer this question

828
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.040
because it it does, I mean, so the media

829
00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.209
we know that people are more attentive to negative

830
00:52:08.209 --> 00:52:12.689
information, um. Uh, YOU know, and again, there's sort

831
00:52:12.689 --> 00:52:17.139
of an evolutionary, uh, evolution has sort of bequeathed

832
00:52:17.139 --> 00:52:18.909
a kind of an heirloom and that respect and

833
00:52:18.909 --> 00:52:21.909
that we tend to pay attention it's more adaptive

834
00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:24.719
in our history to have paid attention to negative

835
00:52:24.719 --> 00:52:27.540
information to be to be more ready to respond,

836
00:52:27.649 --> 00:52:33.469
um, um. Uh, BUT, and that's, we know the

837
00:52:33.469 --> 00:52:35.790
media, you know, if it bleeds it leads, you

838
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:41.419
know, so, so there's overreporting of negative information. Now,

839
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.110
does that potentially induce nocebo effects? I don't think

840
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:50.314
we know. But um it could certainly be part

841
00:52:50.314 --> 00:52:53.794
of it. There could be a contributory factor there

842
00:52:53.794 --> 00:53:00.034
for uh communicating in a in a scale what

843
00:53:00.034 --> 00:53:03.479
a doctor might be communicating about a vaccine. Um,

844
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:05.770
SO I see no reason to think that it

845
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.760
it couldn't possibly be contributing to nocebo effects if

846
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.060
you have what you think is medical information and

847
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.820
that influences in the moment when you're receiving the

848
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.860
medication, you're, you're, you're aware you what you think

849
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.010
might be the case. I think it's, it's certainly

850
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.419
a possibility, how you measure these things sort of

851
00:53:27.419 --> 00:53:31.090
as a Cognitive anthropologist and you work out what

852
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:34.090
is making the difference, what kind of exposure people,

853
00:53:34.219 --> 00:53:39.199
gets really, really tricky to do that. Um, BUT

854
00:53:39.989 --> 00:53:41.979
I think that sort of on the face of

855
00:53:41.979 --> 00:53:44.060
it, there's no reason to think that there couldn't

856
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.580
be a contributory force if you will, in terms

857
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:55.689
of media communicating information at scale, as I said

858
00:53:55.689 --> 00:53:57.550
to the public. Mhm.

859
00:53:58.689 --> 00:54:04.449
And how can COVID-19 vaccines, uh, nocebo effects be

860
00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:05.000
reduced?

861
00:54:06.889 --> 00:54:10.389
Um, SO it could be they could be reduced.

862
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.679
Well, I'll give you an example actually of my

863
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.330
my own case. When I went to get the

864
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:18.489
COVID vaccine, the first vaccine, the nurse said to

865
00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:22.080
me, um, You're going to feel a bit of

866
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.520
a, you know, it's going to feel a bit

867
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.639
of a pinch here in your skin, but 12

868
00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:30.219
hours from now, she was highly specific about it,

869
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.080
and I wish she hadn't been. She said 12

870
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.709
hours from now you might start to feel pains,

871
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.919
shivers, um. Headaches, just take a couple of Tylenol,

872
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.639
which was in the States, in other words, take

873
00:54:41.639 --> 00:54:45.159
paracetamol, and sure enough, like 12 hours later, I

874
00:54:45.159 --> 00:54:48.879
looked at my watch, I really did and did

875
00:54:48.879 --> 00:54:51.649
start to feel terrible. And part of me wondered,

876
00:54:51.719 --> 00:54:55.205
you know, Being familiar with nocebo effects, I thought,

877
00:54:55.455 --> 00:54:58.175
shit, is this just a nocebo effect, or in

878
00:54:58.175 --> 00:55:02.175
fact, am I having a really negative reaction? Are

879
00:55:02.175 --> 00:55:04.614
these genuine side effects. I was just second guessing

880
00:55:04.614 --> 00:55:06.635
myself what's really going on, and I really didn't

881
00:55:06.635 --> 00:55:10.260
feel at all well. So, was there a kind

882
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:15.889
of amplification through my negative expectancies as a result

883
00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:19.459
of the information she gave me, possibly. So I

884
00:55:19.459 --> 00:55:22.060
think what I would say in that case is

885
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.139
how could that nurse have handled it a little

886
00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:27.389
bit better. Well, she could, she could have framed

887
00:55:27.389 --> 00:55:29.949
the information a bit more positively instead of being

888
00:55:29.949 --> 00:55:33.860
so definitive 12 hours from now, which, which made

889
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.979
her look highly competent and made me, you know,

890
00:55:36.389 --> 00:55:38.389
it was just so specific. She could have said

891
00:55:38.389 --> 00:55:41.110
something like most people don't experience side effects. If

892
00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:45.260
you do, you can manage it with with Tylenol

893
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:50.189
or so positively framing the information while preserving the

894
00:55:50.189 --> 00:55:54.639
truthfulness is 11 route forward. Um, AND that might

895
00:55:54.639 --> 00:55:57.370
be a way to manage, could have been a

896
00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.959
way to manage nocebo effects in relation to, to

897
00:56:00.959 --> 00:56:03.280
the extent that they they arose in relation to

898
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.320
the COVID vaccination, any kind of medical treatment. So

899
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:13.500
thinking here about. Uh, Daniel Cannes decisions there, you

900
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.659
know, framing information in a specific way, instead of

901
00:56:16.659 --> 00:56:19.239
saying 30% of people might feel that you just

902
00:56:19.239 --> 00:56:23.850
say 7 in 10 people don't experience side effects,

903
00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:26.939
you're likely to be one of them, blah blah,

904
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:31.290
and so you're managing the expectations in a more

905
00:56:31.699 --> 00:56:32.790
positive valence.

906
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:37.060
Mhm. So, uh, I mean, this is sort of

907
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.949
also related to COVID because it was a public

908
00:56:40.949 --> 00:56:45.699
health issue. So how do nocebo effects manifest in

909
00:56:45.699 --> 00:56:50.189
public health and how relevant are they in that

910
00:56:50.189 --> 00:56:51.300
specific context?

911
00:56:52.239 --> 00:56:57.979
Uh, AGAIN, it's, it's unclear. So there have been,

912
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.800
um, stories that relate to things like wind turbines

913
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:10.560
causing outbreaks of illness, but are these just as

914
00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.340
a result of mass hysteria, which is a way

915
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.340
of saying, you know, it's it's on people's heads

916
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.939
and potentially then the placebo researcher sweeps in and

917
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.739
says, I could, I could colonize this particular phenomenon

918
00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:27.379
for my own and maybe it's all nocebo effects.

919
00:57:28.149 --> 00:57:30.780
So things like winter with another thing called Havana

920
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:36.820
syndrome. So diplomats that were associated with um visited

921
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:42.080
Havana in Cuba. There was If you look at

922
00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.840
something and you'll see there was sort of we

923
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.870
open the book with mentioning this, the idea again,

924
00:57:47.239 --> 00:57:52.449
nobody could understand what was the physical substrate of

925
00:57:52.449 --> 00:57:56.840
the of these clusters of conditions. Some people with

926
00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.830
so-called Havana syndrome, various as they say diplomats, people

927
00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:03.239
who visited, there was some idea that, you know,

928
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.834
they'd fallen. THROUGH some toxicity, or else maybe it

929
00:58:07.834 --> 00:58:12.225
was that they had succumbed to again some sort

930
00:58:12.225 --> 00:58:17.675
of more localized hysterical response, which again is a

931
00:58:17.675 --> 00:58:22.314
very negative connotation in saying that it was again,

932
00:58:22.395 --> 00:58:24.594
all in their heads. It didn't really exist and

933
00:58:24.594 --> 00:58:28.739
that they exaggerated as a result of it. They

934
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:31.070
fell ill. Um, I think again, we got to

935
00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.540
be careful, including when it comes to a public

936
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.340
health level. There may well be we got to

937
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.979
be be intellectually humble here scientists need to recognize

938
00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:45.979
it. It's particularly the medical community as well. Just

939
00:58:45.979 --> 00:58:48.179
because we don't have a current explanation doesn't mean

940
00:58:48.179 --> 00:58:51.199
that there's not going to be an explanation. And

941
00:58:51.199 --> 00:58:55.120
of course, it is possible that nocebo these could

942
00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:01.239
be manifestations of nocebo effects as well. Um, BUT

943
00:59:01.239 --> 00:59:04.280
you know, I also tend to think that the

944
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.639
more ordinary explanation sometimes is the most likely and

945
00:59:07.639 --> 00:59:09.080
it might be we just don't have all the

946
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.969
facts. We shouldn't rush to judgment and be too

947
00:59:12.969 --> 00:59:16.209
journalistic in our interpretations either. Mhm.

948
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.669
So this is something that I think we've been

949
00:59:19.669 --> 00:59:23.989
referring to throughout our conversation, but how does the

950
00:59:23.989 --> 00:59:28.350
nocebo effect tie to medical ethics? I mean, what

951
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:32.189
kinds of questions does it raise uh in the

952
00:59:32.189 --> 00:59:34.070
context of medical ethics?

953
00:59:34.899 --> 00:59:39.929
Yeah, it's a great question. Um, SO in many

954
00:59:39.929 --> 00:59:44.209
doctors are obliged to be nowadays they're obliged to

955
00:59:44.209 --> 00:59:47.590
be open and honest with patients and to respect,

956
00:59:47.919 --> 00:59:51.040
but particularly in the post-war era, Second World War,

957
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:54.370
you know, be open and honest with patients. You've

958
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:58.594
got to be truthful about the The state of

959
00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:03.114
their diagnosis, but also offering them treatment options and

960
01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:09.675
and disclosing to them relevant facts that could inform

961
01:00:09.675 --> 01:00:13.844
their decision on furnish some of the information they

962
01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:17.979
can make a choice and informed choice. To that

963
01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:21.340
end, um, the nocebo effect is is a sort

964
01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.699
of slightly disrupting force in healthcare ethics because uh

965
01:00:25.699 --> 01:00:29.300
you doctors also have a duty to first do

966
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.540
no harm and the Hippocratic goes, you know, sometimes

967
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.179
it's inevitable you can't, you can't undergo surgery without

968
01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:41.409
an incision. YOU know, but is there an unnecessary

969
01:00:41.409 --> 01:00:45.729
harm as a result of disclosing certain information. So

970
01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:48.290
it's a case of what's the trade-off between these

971
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.850
two ethical principles. The one is to respect the

972
01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.330
autonomy of the patient to be truthful with patients,

973
01:00:54.889 --> 01:01:00.399
versus you don't want to cause harm unnecessarily. So

974
01:01:00.399 --> 01:01:04.149
that's one source of tension. Another source of tension

975
01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:09.090
is potentially for justice and health care. So, um,

976
01:01:09.639 --> 01:01:14.439
is there a an unequal distribution of nocebo effects

977
01:01:14.439 --> 01:01:18.620
or placebo effects, which is an interesting question in

978
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:24.830
relation to how people fare in the clinic visit.

979
01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:31.419
Um, SO, Some patients may be um Subject to

980
01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:36.979
more unintentional discrimination biases may be very surprising. We

981
01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:39.189
know there's a body of literature, some of which

982
01:01:39.189 --> 01:01:43.860
is contested for sure, but there are interesting differences

983
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:47.699
in how people experience care systematically shows that, you

984
01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:51.030
know, on the basis of, you know, your sex,

985
01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:59.389
your age is, um. RACE ethnicity, body weight as

986
01:01:59.389 --> 01:02:06.010
well. So how your provider is responding to you,

987
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.110
the quality of information they give the time they

988
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:14.310
give cues of empathy towards the individual. Um, IT

989
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:16.909
would be surprising in a way if some people

990
01:02:16.909 --> 01:02:19.189
didn't fare a little bit more. So there's possibly

991
01:02:19.189 --> 01:02:21.669
an issue of justice in the distribution of these

992
01:02:21.669 --> 01:02:25.600
effects to that. Be a more overshadowed consideration in

993
01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:29.149
healthcare ethics and how it intersects with placebo studies,

994
01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:32.080
but that could be another area that's something I've

995
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.879
written a little bit about as well. But um

996
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.959
open question or some of us doing worse in

997
01:02:38.959 --> 01:02:42.780
the clinic visit because of nocebo effects. Mhm.

998
01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.330
And which kind of strategies can be adopted by

999
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:52.610
both clinicians and patients to reduce the nocebo effect?

1000
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.300
Yeah, so, um, some of it could be that

1001
01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.270
framing of information that we mentioned. Excuse me, so

1002
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:06.719
positively framing the information, we're following the lead of

1003
01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:15.080
empirical studies by Aliyah Crumman and her colleagues in

1004
01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.040
positive mindset, so saying, you might experience negative things,

1005
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:22.320
but that's the thing, things are going to improve

1006
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.929
for you. um. That the medication's working or whatever,

1007
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.729
of course that also induces certain ethical questions too,

1008
01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:32.889
is that really, is that really ethically honest or

1009
01:03:32.889 --> 01:03:34.850
do we need a higher order sort of disclosure

1010
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:36.649
but I'm going to tell you this information that's

1011
01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:40.129
therefore going. Um, I don't think any provider has

1012
01:03:40.129 --> 01:03:42.689
time to disclose that level of of of nuance,

1013
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:47.050
but, um, it could be that it's about framing

1014
01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:51.129
information. The other aspect is taking the time, it's

1015
01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:55.959
the words that one chooses to use, um. Showing

1016
01:03:55.959 --> 01:04:02.080
due sensitivity to patients, um. There's some suggestions among

1017
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.199
medical ethicists that, you know, it's about to reduce

1018
01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:09.679
nocebo effects could be via something called authorized concealment.

1019
01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.540
So you tell the patient, I think this is

1020
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.919
a psychologically sanitized and a bit unrealistic variety of

1021
01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:17.979
perspective telling the patient, you know, there are side

1022
01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:21.689
effects. I don't, you know, do you authorize me

1023
01:04:21.689 --> 01:04:23.409
to tell you that what the side effects are

1024
01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:25.570
and the patient can say yes or no, but

1025
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.399
I think that flags up the information that's probably

1026
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:32.030
emotionally relevant and you're more likely to induce the

1027
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.330
patient to get online and see what the hell

1028
01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.189
are these side effects that this doctor doesn't want

1029
01:04:36.189 --> 01:04:38.870
to tell me so. Um, I think that probably

1030
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.070
would be counterintuitive, but I think there are ways

1031
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:46.739
in which you can frame information, present information, present

1032
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:50.030
yourself as a provider, uh, easier said than done,

1033
01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:53.189
but that these things could be, if we could

1034
01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.169
adopt them a little bit more, that would be

1035
01:04:55.179 --> 01:04:57.699
beneficial. And then the other thing I I I

1036
01:04:57.709 --> 01:05:01.719
I I should mention here is um. The use

1037
01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:05.729
of generative AI is interesting here too, because we're

1038
01:05:05.729 --> 01:05:08.530
seeing I've done studies on this too. Doctors are

1039
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:14.050
increasingly using generative AI chatbots, including commercial chatbots which

1040
01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:18.050
they shouldn't be using, such as chat CPT to

1041
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:22.159
assist them with their documentation. So a letter writing

1042
01:05:22.159 --> 01:05:25.540
to patients, um, so many countries you can now

1043
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.120
get access to your online medical records, which could

1044
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.399
be another forum for inducing placebo and nocebo effects

1045
01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:36.000
too. But if your doctor is presenting it using

1046
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.750
one of the top usages for the. DOCUMENTATION according

1047
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.929
to doctors, those who adopted. So they may be

1048
01:05:43.929 --> 01:05:47.949
trying to write their notes more sensitively, um, and

1049
01:05:47.949 --> 01:05:52.320
using that as a tool to to present information

1050
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.709
in a way that is framed more in a

1051
01:05:55.709 --> 01:06:00.639
more desirable fashion. Uh, AND then second to that

1052
01:06:00.639 --> 01:06:05.080
is, um, Patients use of generative AI, which is

1053
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:10.070
a whole separate concern, um, but, uh, I don't,

1054
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.000
there's studies which suggest that generative AI is is

1055
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.919
much more empathetic than doctors and responding and blinded

1056
01:06:15.919 --> 01:06:22.080
clinic blinded trials, experimental trials. So patients might actually

1057
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.600
it's an interesting question that receive more placebo effects

1058
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.729
from a chatbot than they do from their their

1059
01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:33.790
their doctor. That's a whole other question and maybe

1060
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.510
a whole other hour of discussion, um, but yeah.

1061
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.870
Yeah, so one last question then. If, for example,

1062
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.949
there are doubts about the effectiveness of certain treatments,

1063
01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:51.590
how should doctors communicate about them to their patients

1064
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:55.189
to avoid inducing nocebo effects?

1065
01:06:56.050 --> 01:07:01.560
I think doctors should, they should communicate honestly, honestly.

1066
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.719
I mean, that's what you need to do that

1067
01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:08.280
if they're uncertain about the treatment, uh they've got

1068
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.919
to be honest about that. But a way to

1069
01:07:11.919 --> 01:07:15.320
frame it may be to say, look, uh, we

1070
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.600
don't know what the particular effects may be here,

1071
01:07:18.719 --> 01:07:21.409
but it may be that And then frame it

1072
01:07:21.409 --> 01:07:24.280
possibly by saying that this this might might work

1073
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.600
for you. We're all individuals here. Most of these

1074
01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.879
studies are population based studies. This might work for

1075
01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.360
you. Give it a go. Let's see how, you

1076
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.320
know, things you could still positively frame the information

1077
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.879
in a way that the individual leaves the clinic

1078
01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:41.199
thinking, I'm trying something. They have a more positive

1079
01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:46.750
effect, uh, more positive attitude that that. To the

1080
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:50.229
extent that these effects are relevant, uh, they could

1081
01:07:50.229 --> 01:07:54.250
be dialing them down the negative side effects. Mhm.

1082
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:59.550
OK. So, Charlotte, anything else about uh the nocebo

1083
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:02.219
effect that I might have missed in my questions?

1084
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.750
Anything else we should know or not?

1085
01:08:05.969 --> 01:08:08.770
I think probably the biggest area here, the most

1086
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:13.169
exciting area will be the use of generative AI

1087
01:08:13.169 --> 01:08:17.970
as it sort of gradually creeps in to both

1088
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:22.520
patients use of these tools to search for health

1089
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.209
information. So how these tools tend to be I

1090
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:27.790
don't know if you've ever played around with them,

1091
01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:31.279
but they are consistently very polite, no matter what

1092
01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:35.620
you say throughout them. Um, AND there may be

1093
01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:39.759
that consistency and and the the valence of the

1094
01:08:39.759 --> 01:08:43.279
responses that some of these chatbots can give rapidly

1095
01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:46.000
and in a conversational way to a patient when

1096
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.054
they're seeking. INFORMATION might might actually influence uh nocebo

1097
01:08:53.054 --> 01:08:59.332
effects, placebo effects, um, but may also um influence

1098
01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:02.082
when people do seek help from their provider. So

1099
01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:03.974
we're we're sort of entering a sphere, I think

1100
01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:06.703
of triadic care. You've got the provider, you've got

1101
01:09:06.703 --> 01:09:09.653
these chatbots that we tend to anthropomorphize and so

1102
01:09:09.653 --> 01:09:13.014
on, and you as a patient. So I think

1103
01:09:13.014 --> 01:09:16.779
that intersection will be a very interesting thing. Something

1104
01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.220
I'm I'm I'm focused on writing about at the

1105
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.979
minute, but I think that's an area that future

1106
01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:25.700
discussions in this field will get into. And indeed

1107
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:30.049
high clinicians lean on these tools as well, increasingly,

1108
01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:35.740
um, whether it is to improve their communication, um,

1109
01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:39.859
through the kinds of responses that they preferable responses

1110
01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:45.729
to patients. Uh, BUT they're they're increasingly using these

1111
01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:48.520
tools. They're not going to go away. So that

1112
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.120
would be the thing that I think's around the

1113
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.370
corner, but we don't yet have enough research on.

1114
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.790
And in general, we just should close by saying

1115
01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:59.439
we just don't have enough research into the nocebo

1116
01:09:59.439 --> 01:10:02.839
effect, and we do need more replications. Mhm.

1117
01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:06.819
OK, great. So just before we go, where can

1118
01:10:06.819 --> 01:10:09.569
people find you when you work on the internet?

1119
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.500
And by the way, would you like to tell

1120
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.750
us a little bit about your upcoming book?

1121
01:10:15.459 --> 01:10:20.060
Yeah, so um I'm on Twitter and Blue Sky

1122
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:23.939
and LinkedIn at CR Blaze um and you can

1123
01:10:23.939 --> 01:10:28.189
see my public here I should. Uh, MY Uppsala

1124
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:32.100
University web web pages, I don't update enough, but

1125
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.180
um my publications are available on Google Scholar, um.

1126
01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:40.459
And yeah, my, my, I also have a sub

1127
01:10:40.459 --> 01:10:45.060
stack laze on Doctor Bot where I write about

1128
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.899
AI healthcare ethics and other considerations. But yeah, I've

1129
01:10:49.899 --> 01:10:53.259
got a book coming out in September called Doctor

1130
01:10:53.259 --> 01:10:56.339
Bot when human doctors feel us and how AI

1131
01:10:56.339 --> 01:11:02.069
can save lives, um, which is somewhat um. PROVOCATIVE

1132
01:11:02.069 --> 01:11:08.709
title, but it's really about how uh humans, human

1133
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:12.029
doctors have an enormous task on their hands in

1134
01:11:12.029 --> 01:11:17.990
modern healthcare, and it's about high. Sometimes doctors do

1135
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:20.790
feel this, even though I mean they're they're working

1136
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:24.430
on incredible pressures, but I look at the psychological

1137
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:28.279
limitations of doctors on what it is they do,

1138
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:31.790
keeping up to date with information and and all

1139
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.189
the rest of it. And I look at how

1140
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:38.240
AI may prove to be an important work around

1141
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:41.950
um to improving care in the long term. So

1142
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:44.310
it's a It's a book that's focused on the

1143
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:48.109
psychology of the visit and what AI could do

1144
01:11:48.109 --> 01:11:52.149
to improve patient outcomes. It's a very patient centric

1145
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:56.839
book, but Possibly a bit provocative as well, but

1146
01:11:56.839 --> 01:11:58.520
they'll start a conversation, I hope.

1147
01:11:59.279 --> 01:12:01.879
Great. We're very much looking forward to it and

1148
01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:04.720
