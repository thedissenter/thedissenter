00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.359
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.920
of the Dissenter. I'm your host as always, Ricardo

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.960
Lops, and today I'm joined by Patrick Foote. He's

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.800
the creator of the YouTube channel Name Explain, where

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.040
he uncovers the origins of names and highlights many

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.959
other aspects of language. And today we're going to

7
00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:23.559
talk about his latest book, Immigrant Tongues, exploring how

8
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:28.745
languages moved, evolved and defined us. So Patrick, welcome

9
00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.674
to the show where I've been a very big

10
00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:33.235
fan of your channel for a long time, so

11
00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:35.104
thank you so much for doing this. Oh,

12
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.755
you're more than welcome. No, thank you so much

13
00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:38.595
for having me on. No, any excuse to chat

14
00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.525
with people. My job is mainly just me. I,

15
00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.154
I, I don't know if you can see, but

16
00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:45.075
my office is under the stairs in my house,

17
00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:47.435
so most of my time is spent just under,

18
00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.354
under the stairs in a windowless room alone. So

19
00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:51.825
it's terrific to be able to chat with someone.

20
00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:53.025
Yeah, thank you so much for having me on,

21
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:53.575
Ricardo.

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.080
Yeah, great. So uh let me first ask you

23
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.520
before we get into the actual book, uh, what

24
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.620
got you interested in languages and linguistics?

25
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.339
Ah, so great question. It kind of, I've, I've

26
00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:12.050
always been interested in English, like language from school.

27
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.050
Um, English was by and far my favorite lesson.

28
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.550
And it was only a bit later down the

29
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.639
line when I was in college, which isn't university

30
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:23.430
Hindu, it's a whole thing, but it it's basically

31
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.739
a higher education but a step below university. Doesn't

32
00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:28.930
matter, too much details. Um, I took a course

33
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.150
of English, uh, language and linguistics. It's kind of

34
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.239
like a something to fill in my, uh. My

35
00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.480
schedule I was like, oh yeah I'll do I

36
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.800
like English lit so I might like, and from

37
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.080
there I just kind of really fell in love

38
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.239
to it. There's something really fun about language and

39
00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.709
linguistics. I kind of refer to it so it

40
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.519
was like a word like it's like maths but

41
00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.029
for words that you add this, then you add

42
00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.480
this and you get this kind of word and

43
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.879
I kind of that sort of nitty gritty of

44
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.080
linguistics I really enjoy through that. And then I

45
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080
kind of, as I kind of wanted to make

46
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.680
a YouTube channel focusing on language, I kind of

47
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.209
wanted to think, well, what's a more unique aspect

48
00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.099
of language I could cover that no one else

49
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.339
is really focusing on at the time, almost well

50
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.099
well over 10 years ago now I began name

51
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.149
Explain. And I thought about oh etymology, no one's

52
00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.460
really kind of focusing mainly on etymology and of

53
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.259
names of places so I kind of just dove

54
00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.309
into it from there and yeah it's just been

55
00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.270
a it's been a it's been a great time

56
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.889
ever since.

57
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.820
Yeah, so I mean, I guess that uh one

58
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.360
of the questions we could start with is actually

59
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.580
what is a language? I mean, at what point

60
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.100
does a language become another and how do we

61
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.979
distinguish between languages?

62
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.979
Oh, that's a great question. So when does something

63
00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.470
become a language? Gosh, that's one of those big

64
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.199
old questions that everyone, that all linguists kind of

65
00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.119
want to know the answers to, I guess. I

66
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.279
think what, I mean, I'm tempted to say that

67
00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.639
what defines a language from gibberish is where multiple

68
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.520
people understand it. But there are instances of just,

69
00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.410
yeah, if someone, uh, is like a con language,

70
00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.429
for example, a constructed language, that's kind of a

71
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.000
language just one person knows. Does that count as

72
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.619
a language? Does it have to be defined by?

73
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.399
The, the ability for multiple people to speak it.

74
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.500
I think it's basically where structured sounds and in

75
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.660
turn their written forms have meanings behind them. I

76
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.770
guess at its core sense, that's what you could

77
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.139
define a language as being when the sounds aren't

78
00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.009
just nonsense gibberish, when they have, when those sounds

79
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.100
have extended meaning behind them. That's when it becomes

80
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.449
a language, it's even better when it's universally understood,

81
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.740
like we all know that when I go dog,

82
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.570
I'm not making a random sound, I'm saying the

83
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.100
name for those things with wacky tails and four

84
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.059
legs, like that's the core of language in my

85
00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.960
estimations.

86
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.630
So how can different ways of speaking the same

87
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.630
language keep being the same language, like for example,

88
00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.460
British English and American English or I mean and

89
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.369
Portuguese, European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.

90
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.080
So there's a great book, I think it's just

91
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.880
called A Short History of Language by a guy

92
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.720
called David Crystal, a fantastic linguist from here in

93
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.889
the UK. And he talks about this as well.

94
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.759
So you've got, um, languages and dialects. They're the

95
00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.479
main two ways of splitting these sort of things

96
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.630
up. And he said a great way to think

97
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.029
about this. Say if you've got 4 people at

98
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.750
a table, I can't remember the exact people, so

99
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.459
I'm gonna kind of go a bit different with

100
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.109
it. One's from Liverpool, one's from London, one's from

101
00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:33.500
Bordeaux, and one's from Paris. Say they can only

102
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.339
understand their own languages. The guy from London and

103
00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:38.619
the guy from Liverpool are gonna understand one another.

104
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.369
It's gonna be a very different form of English,

105
00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.459
but they're gonna understand one another. That's a dialect

106
00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.809
at play. While the guy from Bordeaux and the

107
00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.480
guy from Paris, they're gonna understand one another as

108
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.739
well. It's gonna be two very different forms of

109
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:53.940
French, but French nonetheless, that's kind of. There's not

110
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.269
really one definitive way to define when something's a

111
00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:59.070
dialect and when something's a language. You could argue

112
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.940
something like American English and British English or even

113
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.029
as you mentioned, um, continental Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.

114
00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:08.190
You could very well argue they're two completely different

115
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.070
languages, but I imagine if you were to be

116
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.350
speaking with a native Brazilian, you'd be able to

117
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.929
understand them quite easily, yeah?

118
00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:19.130
Yes, yes, I can understand them quite easily. I

119
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.670
mean there's a few words here and there that

120
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.970
are different, but yeah, for the most part we

121
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.130
can understand one another. Yeah. Yeah,

122
00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:28.049
same with if I'm when I'm talking to an

123
00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:30.250
American, it's, that's kind of the way to put

124
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.329
it, it's when you can understand what, despite the

125
00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:35.690
fact there's differences, you can still understand one another

126
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.049
fairly easily, whereas the guy from London and the

127
00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:40.450
guy from Bordeaux, they're not gonna understand each other

128
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.589
at all unless they speak French or English respectively.

129
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.529
So before we get into some of the languages

130
00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.929
whose migration you explore in your book, what are

131
00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:56.450
the different ways that languages migrate? I mean, how

132
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.910
can they do that?

133
00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.510
Oh gosh, it's all sorts of ways really, but.

134
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.549
It's mainly like physical movement and we don't, when,

135
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.480
when, when we think of things moving in this

136
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.799
day and age, we often think of being more

137
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.160
sort of digital, especially when we think about communication

138
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.399
moving. We think of what we're doing right now.

139
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.190
You're in Portugal, I'm here in the UK, yeah,

140
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.720
we're speaking to each other like we're in the

141
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.040
exact same room. Obviously in the past this kind

142
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.880
of movement of language wasn't possible. It was people

143
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.920
marching on their own 2 ft. It was a

144
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.600
ship sailing over oceans. That's how languages migrated in

145
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.279
the far past and even in the not so

146
00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.920
far past as well. It's, it's literally this physical

147
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.440
movement of people who speak one language, going somewhere

148
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.200
else and sticking around there for long enough for

149
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.070
the language to take hold. It literally is a

150
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.519
physical movement of people and in turn their languages.

151
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.799
Mhm. So of course, I mean, er I speak

152
00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.000
Portuguese or at least it's my native tongue, and

153
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.119
it derived from Latin, so, and that's actually one

154
00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.079
of the languages that you explore in your book.

155
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.399
So tell us a little bit about Latin, where

156
00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.239
did it originate exactly?

157
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.730
So Latin originated roughly I think it was called

158
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.279
lingara. I, I do mention it in the book.

159
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.809
Unfortunately, all the information from the book is and

160
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:20.079
doesn't stay in my head unfortunately. But it's a

161
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.880
region of, yeah, it's a region of Italy that

162
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.010
does equate somewhat to where Rome can be found

163
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.609
now, kind of down the uh western coast of

164
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.950
the boot. Uh, AND Latin kind of evolved from

165
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.549
there. It was inspired by a lot of other

166
00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:34.589
different languages spoken in the area. It wasn't the

167
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.619
only thing spoken in on the Italian peninsula at

168
00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.970
the time. There were all kinds of different languages.

169
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.109
And because it was the one spoken by Romulus

170
00:07:44.109 --> 00:07:46.820
and Remus, if we believe they existed, obviously the

171
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.549
origin of Rome is much more mythology than history

172
00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:52.339
at this point. But because that was the language

173
00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.459
they spoke and Rome out of all the empires

174
00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:59.660
and city-states that existed in Rome at in in

175
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.839
Italy at that time, cos that was the one

176
00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.929
that took off in a big way. It led

177
00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:07.250
to Latin taking over that entire peninsula and in

178
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.750
turn a huge chunk of Europe. So that Latin,

179
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.290
Latin wasn't special by any means. It wasn't, I

180
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.829
mean you could even kind of argue no language

181
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.209
is particularly special. No singular language is destined to

182
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.799
be more prominent than the than the other. It's

183
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:24.769
the people who speak it who end up allowing

184
00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:28.489
that language to become so big and vital in

185
00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:29.799
the on the world stage, and that's kind of

186
00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:31.290
what happened with Latin. It was just, it was

187
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.469
just another tongue of Italy. And it but it

188
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:35.359
happened to be the tongue, which took off in

189
00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:36.530
a big way cos of the people who spoke

190
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.119
it did some pretty, pretty big things, put it

191
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:39.719
bluntly.

192
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.669
Yeah, and one of those big things was conquering

193
00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:45.669
other peoples,

194
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.270
right? Yeah, that's, uh, if you've read the book,

195
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.630
which I know you have, thank you very much,

196
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:51.640
if anyone listening has read the book, a lot

197
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.719
of it is about conquering, whether that be the

198
00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:57.969
Romans conquering large parts of Europe or. Turkic speakers

199
00:08:57.969 --> 00:09:01.750
conquering uh Anatolia, uh, Asia Minor in modern day

200
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.650
Turkey maybe more or less, or even, uh, Spanish

201
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.679
or Portuguese or British people like like myself and

202
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.809
yourself conquering parts of what was called the New

203
00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:11.690
World, which we now know as North and South

204
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.049
America.

205
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.570
Mhm, YEAH, so we're going to get a little

206
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.289
bit into that later, but I mean as the

207
00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:24.250
Roman Empire spread across Europe, it er actually also

208
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.239
replaced other languages, right, or not?

209
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.330
Yeah, no, totally, it did, it replaced a load

210
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.229
of languages. I think the most interesting story of,

211
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.000
Languages being replaced in Europe, uh, the various Celtic

212
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.789
languages, I mean Celto-Iberian, I believe that would have

213
00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:41.950
been, was that spoken in Portugal? It was spoken

214
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.630
on the Iberian Peninsula. uh, BUT when we think

215
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.179
of Celtic languages today. It's so linked with where

216
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:52.289
I'm living right now, the UK, um, Welsh, er,

217
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.380
Cornish, Manx, Scottish Gaelic, Irish. They're all we have

218
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.900
left of Celtic languages this day, and it's kind

219
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.299
of for when you think of the Celtic speaking

220
00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:03.039
world, you kind of think of here, but that's,

221
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:08.020
that's so not the case. Celtic languages originated in

222
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.659
Europe. I think they might have even originated on

223
00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:12.320
the Iberian Peninsula. I can't remember that for sure.

224
00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:14.900
But there were loads of them all around the

225
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.809
continent. And eventually, thanks to Rome, all of them

226
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.099
died and the only ones that survived were the

227
00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:23.250
ones in the far outreaches of Europe, the ones

228
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.900
that you had to travel over the English Channel

229
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.020
to get to. And even then they're only in

230
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.239
the far pockets of the UK. They're in Cornwall

231
00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:33.260
and Scotland and Wales, which are very much more

232
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.770
inhospitable in the far past for the Romans to

233
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.820
get to, so those Celtic languages could hold on

234
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.229
there. Likewise in Ireland and the Isle of Man,

235
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.070
they could hold them there cos they're even further

236
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.770
removed by more ocean by the Irish Sea. You

237
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.690
don't, you don't wanna go through the Irish Sea,

238
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.729
it's a rough old place.

239
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.309
So I mean perhaps Latin will be a good

240
00:10:52.309 --> 00:10:54.549
example for us to explore here in terms of

241
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:57.890
how languages evolved from one another. So how did

242
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.630
the Romance languages then evolved, evolve from Latin?

243
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.320
So it's kind of a case by case scenario.

244
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.169
As I sort of talk about in the book,

245
00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:12.500
when Latin, when the Romans arrived in a new

246
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.140
part of what would become their empire in a

247
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.020
new part of Europe, let's say the Iberian Peninsula,

248
00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:19.859
an example. As mentioned, they, they, they weren't blank

249
00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:22.940
canvases, there are already multiple different languages being spoken

250
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.359
there. There were all those Celtic languages I mentioned

251
00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:29.330
to to name a few. Uh, Latin and the

252
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.729
Romans would come and be like, this is our

253
00:11:30.729 --> 00:11:34.200
land now, and the Romans weren't actually that tough

254
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.130
on language. They weren't like, no, you have to

255
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.359
speak Latin, you're Roman now, you must speak Latin.

256
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.450
They weren't like that at all. They kind of

257
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.429
just let people carry on doing their own thing.

258
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.289
But of course, as the Romans would have their

259
00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:48.330
higher power, Latin would have been a huge influence.

260
00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:51.369
So Latin would have been everywhere, even if you

261
00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:53.210
did, even if you weren't, if you were like

262
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.909
just a farmer in ancient Iberia. You wouldn't be

263
00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:00.239
forced to speak Latin, but the people you're sending

264
00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:03.119
your taxes to, they would be speaking Latin. So

265
00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:05.239
it kind of, a lot of these languages kind

266
00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:09.820
of evolved from Latin intermixing with the local tongues.

267
00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.679
And for example, so, and this evolved into something

268
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:17.000
known as vulgar Latin, which the vulgar Latin isn't

269
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.640
one specific language, it's multiple different forms of Latin

270
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.760
that kind of emerged. Across the continent. And it

271
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.440
was those vulgar Latins, these weird hybrids of Latin

272
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.919
and other local languages and dialects, which would eventually

273
00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:32.200
form languages like Portuguese, like French, like Spanish, like

274
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.280
even Italian. Italian's got a big Germanic influence because

275
00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:38.960
once Rome fell, uh, Germanic speakers took over the

276
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.679
peninsula. And so it even has that influence there,

277
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.440
even if you go eastwards, Romania, Romania is this

278
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.630
fascinating example of a romance language in the heart

279
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.919
of Eastern Europe. It's bizarre and great. I love

280
00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:53.520
it. And that is once again comes from, I

281
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.039
think, like a more Slavic the a more slag

282
00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.429
of, oh my God, I can't say anything right

283
00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:02.520
now, a more Slavic influence on the language happening

284
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.880
there.

285
00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:07.979
Yeah, no, Romanian is really a very interesting example

286
00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:11.580
because I, I mean it's a bit hard at

287
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.340
least if you look at the map geographically to

288
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.630
understand how Romance languages appeared er right next to

289
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.340
Italy, and Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and then suddenly

290
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.739
Romania, the other side of Europe.

291
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.049
So I mean, I, I would love to know

292
00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:30.734
as a Romance speaker yourself. Have you ever heard

293
00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:32.375
Romanian, like, have you ever

294
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.815
like, uh, just a little bit. I noticed that

295
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:40.434
there are some similarities there, but I can't really

296
00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:42.335
understand it that well. No,

297
00:13:42.695 --> 00:13:44.775
it's not like English and Dutch, like Dutch just

298
00:13:44.775 --> 00:13:46.494
looks like a silly version of English in many

299
00:13:46.494 --> 00:13:49.414
cases where like if, if, if you speak English

300
00:13:49.414 --> 00:13:51.414
you can kind of understand Dutch cos they look

301
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.015
so they look kind of alike to one another.

302
00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:54.804
That's not the case with Portuguese and Romanian I'm

303
00:13:54.804 --> 00:13:55.174
guessing.

304
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.650
Uh, NO, I don't think so. No, not that

305
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.000
I've ever heard much Romanian, but what I've heard,

306
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.650
uh, I didn't understand a lot. I noticed some

307
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.609
similarities, but that was about it, so. Yeah,

308
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.770
OK, that's interesting to know.

309
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.719
OK, so let's perhaps try to cover one or

310
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:18.280
two languages from each continent here. So, uh, in

311
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.679
the book when it comes to Africa, you talk

312
00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:24.390
about the Bantu languages. So what are the Bantu

313
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.280
languages and how did they spread across Africa?

314
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:32.400
So the Bantu languages, is, it's not one language

315
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.719
in particular, it's a large group of languages. It

316
00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:37.799
includes things like Swahili and Zulu, to just name

317
00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.239
a couple of them. They're probably two of the

318
00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:42.400
most. Swahili I think is the most spoken Bantu

319
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.320
language with Zulu being another, uh, pretty popular one

320
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.710
of them. They are a group of languages that

321
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.460
are part of the larger. Atlantic Congo language family,

322
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.140
once again, I would need to check that. If

323
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.419
you've got the book in front of you, Ricardo,

324
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.020
I say at the start, there's that list of

325
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.380
language families at the start that um explains it

326
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.380
quite succinctly where it is. But like I said,

327
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.059
my brain's a sieve, I write something then it

328
00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:07.099
just disappears straight away again and I'm working on

329
00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:09.419
the next thing. Uh, IT'S, so it's part of

330
00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:11.820
a larger, much larger language family, it's the most

331
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.659
dominant tongue, uh, it's the most dominant branch of

332
00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:18.719
that family. Started I believe in modern day Cameroon

333
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:22.140
thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago. Uh,

334
00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:23.940
AND when we think of Bantu tongues, it's kind

335
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.820
of like those textbook African languages. When we think

336
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.739
of like the languages of Africa, things like Swahili,

337
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.580
it, it's really is stuff like that, they're great

338
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.390
and they all began that one spot. And from

339
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.440
there through the great Bantu migrations and expansion of

340
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.520
the people, once again it's all about the people.

341
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.760
They just, the, the language is almost sort of

342
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.559
second place to this. It's, it's, it just happens

343
00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:48.080
to be the language these people are speaking. We

344
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.039
have started as one language called Proto-Bantu, and for

345
00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:52.559
one reason or another, I won't get into it

346
00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:54.349
because we talk about it in the book, uh,

347
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.799
it spreads, it spread pretty much across all of

348
00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:58.979
sub-Saharan Africa. It's incredible.

349
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.190
Yeah, yeah, no, no, it's, it's really interesting. I,

350
00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:05.710
I was seeing here because in the meanwhile I

351
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.340
opened your book and uh you say here that

352
00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:13.909
uh Bantu tongues include the likes of Zulu, Xhosa,

353
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:19.109
Lingala, Swahili, so I think those were the languages

354
00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:20.859
you were trying to refer to there.

355
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:23.140
They are the, thank you very much, as I

356
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.655
said. Like I might have wrote it, but the

357
00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:27.015
reason I write it down is so I don't

358
00:16:27.015 --> 00:16:28.234
have to keep it in here.

359
00:16:28.695 --> 00:16:33.294
Yeah, sure, yeah. OK, and what about, uh, let's

360
00:16:33.294 --> 00:16:36.174
talk about the Middle East now, what about Arabic?

361
00:16:36.255 --> 00:16:40.395
I mean, is there anything special about Arabic and

362
00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:44.255
um how did this, how did it spread across

363
00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:46.075
North Africa, for example?

364
00:16:46.974 --> 00:16:50.755
So Arabic is, it's one of, it's probably, hm,

365
00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:53.190
am I gonna make a bold claim here? I

366
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.390
might say Arabic is the Asian language that has

367
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.229
spread the furthest. Nothing else is coming to mind.

368
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:02.710
Maybe Mandarin, as, as the, well, we'll get to

369
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.069
that, I imagine. Uh, Mandarin has spread quite far

370
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.390
wide or just Chinese languages as a whole. But

371
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.550
Arabic, uh, when it comes to country that countries

372
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.270
that speak it dominantly, Arabic is probably the most

373
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.358
successful language of Asia. Uh, IT began in the

374
00:17:16.358 --> 00:17:19.310
Middle East in Saudi Arabia. No, sorry, not Saudi

375
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.358
Arabia, that, that country didn't exist yet on the

376
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:25.040
Arabian Peninsula. Uh, AND the main reason this one

377
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.520
spread was down to religion. It was the tongue

378
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.239
of Islam. And as the Islam, Islamic, uh, emirates

379
00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:35.459
and empires decided to expand to bring that religion

380
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.140
to more parts of the world, and in turn,

381
00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:41.290
Arabic came along for the ride too. Uh, IT

382
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.410
spread through there and of course it, if you

383
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.689
think about where the Arabian Peninsula is in the

384
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:49.989
world, to its, uh, east you have, uh, more

385
00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:52.010
of like, uh, more sort of centrally sort of

386
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.329
Asia. You get, um, and they did go that

387
00:17:54.329 --> 00:17:57.329
way. You've got countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, uh, very

388
00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:59.770
much Muslim countries, but then they went west as

389
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.369
well into North Africa, which is directly over there.

390
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.780
I mean you've got Egypt, you've got literally all

391
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.449
of North Africa. They're primarily Arabic speaking countries, or

392
00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:09.060
at least, and

393
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.930
they even arrived here in Portugal and Spain as

394
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.939
well.

395
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.099
Of course they did, yeah, that's a bit, that's

396
00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:15.770
something I don't actually talk about all too deeply

397
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.619
in the book. If I had to do a

398
00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:21.150
sequel. Uh, DEFINITELY the, cos there is still influence

399
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.089
in, uh, Portugal and Spain, but it's not as

400
00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:27.250
dominant as, um, North Africa is for sure. But

401
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.030
no, um, they did, and you, you see is

402
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.150
what I love is if you look at where

403
00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.339
Arabic is spoken, you can easily follow their pattern.

404
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.510
They clearly went Saudi Arabia, sorry, Arabia here all

405
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.109
the way across North Africa and then up across,

406
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.900
uh, Gibraltar into Spain. It's great. Mhm. But yeah,

407
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.010
like that's the main reason Arabic is so widely

408
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:52.699
spoken. Uh, BEYOND its homeland of Arabia. It mainly

409
00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:55.099
comes to religion, that that spread of Islam across

410
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.089
all these parts of the world and they took

411
00:18:57.089 --> 00:18:57.900
Arabic with them.

412
00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:03.630
Yeah. So er another way that language is spread

413
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.780
of course was through colonization. So tell us about,

414
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.010
for example, how English arrived in Ireland.

415
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.459
So English's arrival in Ireland is kind of the

416
00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:23.020
prototype for what English would do later down the

417
00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.839
line, so. Obviously English really hit the big time

418
00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:30.150
during the more sort of peak age of colonization

419
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.250
when it arrived in the Americas, when it arrived

420
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.530
in like parts of Australia, New Zealand. And even

421
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.469
further down the line were like the scramble for

422
00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:41.430
Africa, which is something else that we, we discussed

423
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.180
in the book and how English became so dominant

424
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.630
in various parts of the er continent. India as

425
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.489
well to name an example. Uh, HOW it arrived

426
00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:51.390
in Ireland is kind of where that all began.

427
00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:53.410
It was, it happened way later. A lot of

428
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.689
those stories, as I said, happened in kind of

429
00:19:55.689 --> 00:20:00.869
the 17th to 18th, 19th century. Uh, English's arrival

430
00:20:00.869 --> 00:20:04.209
in Ireland happened in the 13th century, I believe.

431
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:06.609
Way, way, way further back, and it makes sense

432
00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:09.750
that English would first out of every, any land

433
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.630
mass that English would arrive in that isn't Britain.

434
00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:14.189
It makes sense it would be Ireland just because

435
00:20:14.189 --> 00:20:18.109
of geographic proximity. Uh, THIS came about due to

436
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:21.750
some squabbling, putting it very lightly. Uh, SORRY to

437
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.750
upset my Irish. Uh, ANYONE who's Irish watching this

438
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.510
squabbling was a much, very much an understatement, um.

439
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.229
Ireland, English came to Ireland down to the fact

440
00:20:32.229 --> 00:20:34.810
that the English took over Ireland and for the

441
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.209
longest time through uh that came down to some

442
00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:41.170
kings and uh rulers in Ireland kind of being

443
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.729
banished from the country and then that banished uh

444
00:20:43.729 --> 00:20:46.130
ruler, uh going to England, hey, hey, can you

445
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.609
help me get my land back and it kind

446
00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:49.250
of all stemmed from there. We talk about it

447
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.810
more in the book, um, yeah, and from there

448
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.369
and then English had a hole, a big hold

449
00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:58.469
on Ireland for so long, part of. Uh, Ireland,

450
00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:00.510
Northern Ireland is still part of the UK to

451
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.869
this day, and even to this day, Irish, English

452
00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:05.709
is still the dominant tongue of, uh, Ireland.

453
00:21:06.689 --> 00:21:10.500
Mhm. Yeah, and I mean, and this is more

454
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.829
on my end of the globe I guess, um,

455
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.170
uh, talking about Spain and Portugal and how the

456
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.619
two empires formed and conquered, uh. Most or all

457
00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:28.140
I guess of Latin America. I mean why is

458
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.979
it that almost every country in the Americas below

459
00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:37.939
the US has Spanish as the official language except

460
00:21:37.939 --> 00:21:38.979
for Brazil?

461
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.930
Yeah, so there's also, um, sorry, I'm being real

462
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.250
potent. There's a, oh well, French Guiana isn't part

463
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.969
of that is literally just part of France. There's

464
00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:49.209
Suriname as well, which speaks Dutch. It, it's, it's

465
00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:51.729
an odd one. So that kind of, once again

466
00:21:51.729 --> 00:21:55.670
it comes down to resources and who wanted what.

467
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.790
Uh, SO I believe obviously Columbus was the first

468
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.329
to, I'm good, uh, for the podcast listeners, I'm

469
00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.569
doing big quotation. Bunny ears right now, discovered the

470
00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:07.329
Americas. He didn't discover it. There are already people

471
00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:10.229
living there. Uh, BUT he's the one who's kind

472
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:14.550
of seen as opening the Americas to Europe and

473
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.030
kind of it's, I think Columbus first landed in

474
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.619
Barbados, I believe, oh no, the Bahamas even, he

475
00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:24.459
first landed in the Bahamas. And then from there,

476
00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:27.020
once he was aware of it, the Spanish got

477
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.790
there. The Portuguese got there, it's just where they

478
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.510
landed and you, you're saying why it's below uh

479
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.849
the US. Mhm. I, you gotta remember that that's

480
00:22:39.849 --> 00:22:42.829
only how the world looks today that we see

481
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.489
in Canada English, the US, I mean Canada's French

482
00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:49.770
English, US English. There's a huge and for huge

483
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.849
chunks of time, parts of the US, well under

484
00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:55.319
Spanish rule, Florida I believe was a Spanish, uh,

485
00:22:55.329 --> 00:22:59.780
colony. When you think about how the land was

486
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.780
sort of split up in the past, not all

487
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.689
of America was under English speaking rule. There were

488
00:23:04.689 --> 00:23:07.880
parts of it under Spanish rule, uh, California, Florida.

489
00:23:08.219 --> 00:23:11.420
I mean, there's still huge Hispanic, Spanish speaking populations

490
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.260
in those more southern states, even in the northern

491
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.540
states as well. There's a huge Hispanic culture in

492
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.319
America, so you kind of say, oh, it's English,

493
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.699
not, not quite, and historically, definitely not. So it

494
00:23:21.699 --> 00:23:23.540
would kind of the, the, the end result we

495
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:30.209
have now. Of English, English, Latin languages. That's, that's

496
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:33.150
the Americas explained very simply, English, English, Latin languages.

497
00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:35.189
Uh, THE reason we have it that way today

498
00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:37.089
is that's kind of just the end result, or

499
00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:39.410
even the end result, just how it currently is

500
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.329
on our planet due to those foreign powers fighting

501
00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:45.250
over it for land, for wealth, for resources. That's

502
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.849
just kind of how it's settled out for now

503
00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:50.040
anyway. I, I, I can't, I don't imagine it's

504
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.489
changing any any time soon, but you know, this

505
00:23:52.489 --> 00:23:54.510
definitely isn't the end of history.

506
00:23:55.449 --> 00:23:58.609
Yeah, yeah, for sure. So uh I mean I

507
00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:01.130
guess we've already talked here a little bit about

508
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.650
also how English arrived in the what is now

509
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.969
the US and Canada and French in Canada as

510
00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:08.300
well,

511
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:09.729
so yeah.

512
00:24:10.569 --> 00:24:12.530
Uh, uh, NO, yeah, go ahead. Were you going

513
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.150
to say anything,

514
00:24:13.329 --> 00:24:15.400
or? Yeah, I was just gonna say how like

515
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.689
I have this little thought theory like are French

516
00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:24.329
Canadians Latin Americans? Cos by definition they're Americans who

517
00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:26.689
speak a Latin tongue. And that's just something I

518
00:24:26.689 --> 00:24:28.750
always like to think about, like, are French Canadians

519
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.949
Hispanic, well, not Hispanic, but are they Latinos? Like,

520
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:34.459
I wonder. But it's just a fun little musing.

521
00:24:35.459 --> 00:24:38.859
No, yeah, that that that's interesting. So I mean,

522
00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:41.020
uh, in the book you also talk about the

523
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.619
Caribbean, so, uh, how is it that there are

524
00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:46.719
Creole languages there?

525
00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:52.969
One word, slavery. Yay, no, yeah, well I say

526
00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:54.829
that's a very ironic yeah I put in there.

527
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.449
Uh, THE Creole tongues of the Caribbean are super

528
00:24:57.449 --> 00:25:01.589
fascinating. They, and it comes down to the fact

529
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:06.160
that there was so much slavery from Spanish, Portuguese,

530
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.250
I think the like Spanish, Portuguese and British Empires.

531
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.500
Stealing people from West Africa to work on their

532
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.660
plantations, their farms in their new land, they needed

533
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.020
people to work there, they, they weren't gonna do

534
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.339
the jobs themselves because, but why would they? They

535
00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:24.819
did want to try and get um indigenous peoples

536
00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:26.540
to help out, but I think a large majority

537
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.660
of indigenous populations of these kind of these uh

538
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.859
places we've wiped out or they kind of escaped

539
00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:34.020
into the depths of Brazil, you know, where we

540
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.050
still see them today and whatnot. Um, YEAH, so

541
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.290
they just literally stole because they would, cos the

542
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.790
people in Western Africa were deemed to be lesser

543
00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:44.839
for a variety of factors due to the color

544
00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:47.410
of their skin, due to the fact that they

545
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.239
were less, and once again the quote marks coming

546
00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:51.770
out are less civilized than how the Europeans were

547
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.880
living in that time. The European speakers, the European

548
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.140
people felt we're better than you, you're not real

549
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.020
people, we can steal you and put you somewhere

550
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.449
else to work. It's a horrible barbaric thing. And

551
00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:07.140
it did have a resoundingly huge impact on the

552
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.560
languages of the Caribbean, especially, uh, places like Haiti,

553
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.819
an example, uh, Cuba, uh, all, all across the

554
00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:20.410
Caribbean, these sort of um. These, uh, Pidgin languages,

555
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.729
these Creoles came into being due to just absolutely

556
00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:29.069
unexpected people intermingling with one another. Imagine just a

557
00:26:29.069 --> 00:26:31.630
few 100 years before sort of these Creoles came

558
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.160
into being. Western African people in places like Jamaica,

559
00:26:36.709 --> 00:26:40.869
seems like that can't happen, but unfortunately it did

560
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:43.109
and it, it, it, that's how we've ended up

561
00:26:43.109 --> 00:26:46.550
where we are today. One I do enjoy. And

562
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.859
I find this really funny, I don't think I

563
00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:49.229
mentioned this in the book and it's not so

564
00:26:49.229 --> 00:26:53.949
much about languages, it's about accents. Um, Jamaica. Ended

565
00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:57.750
up with a quite, ended up with Irish people

566
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.989
working there as well. I don't think they were

567
00:26:58.989 --> 00:27:01.270
slaves in the same way West African people were.

568
00:27:02.209 --> 00:27:03.689
But I think kind of a lot of Irish

569
00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:05.660
people ended up going to work in Jamaica as

570
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.209
well. And the Irish accent, when you think of

571
00:27:09.209 --> 00:27:11.790
two very different accents, the Irish and Jamaican accent

572
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.069
are two very, very, very different accents, but Irish

573
00:27:15.069 --> 00:27:17.670
actually had a huge part in forming that modern

574
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.329
Jamaican accent. And we hear it best of how

575
00:27:20.329 --> 00:27:22.510
they say the TH sound. If you say free

576
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.250
in an Irish or Jamaican accent, I won't do

577
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.609
it here because I don't want to offend anyone

578
00:27:27.609 --> 00:27:29.770
with my terrible impressions. But if you say free

579
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.010
in an Irish or Jamaican accent, they both use

580
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.209
that hard T-like sound for a free. And oh

581
00:27:35.209 --> 00:27:36.930
yeah, there, there is, there is a connection between

582
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.160
the two of them. And that's uh, it, it's

583
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.469
not something I mention in the book, but that's

584
00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:44.250
another great example of how, uh, people migrating can

585
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.170
affect languages and how we speak in different parts

586
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:46.829
of the world.

587
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.290
Yeah, uh, uh, no, uh, you know, it's, uh,

588
00:27:51.589 --> 00:27:53.849
while I was reading your book and when I

589
00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:59.410
arrived at these bits where, er, languages spread through

590
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.290
colonization. Uh, I mean, of course, it's really an

591
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.089
interesting read, it is, but at the same time,

592
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.430
it's really sad because it reminds me of the

593
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:14.010
awful, awful things that my ancestors, the ancestors of

594
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.609
the Spanish people, your ancestors as well, I imagine,

595
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:23.055
uh. The across the Americas, Africa, and so on

596
00:28:23.055 --> 00:28:24.084
and so forth. Right.

597
00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:27.814
It, it is, it's, it is terrible. And I

598
00:28:27.814 --> 00:28:30.334
guess, uh, myself and yourself have quite a different

599
00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.064
cos we are, like you said, we're the ancestors

600
00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:34.854
of those people. So we do, I guess, feel

601
00:28:34.854 --> 00:28:39.005
some kind of, oh darn, like that's bad. That's

602
00:28:39.005 --> 00:28:42.599
some really bad stuff like I believe um. The

603
00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:44.760
Portuguese did actually, I'm not, I'm not, once again,

604
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:46.160
I'm not trying to blame you per se on

605
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.479
this Ricardo, definitely not. But I think it's the

606
00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:50.640
Portuguese who have like the high like I think

607
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.000
the Portuguese brought more slaves to Brazil than literally

608
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.910
the rest of like uh the new world combined,

609
00:28:56.939 --> 00:28:58.719
like, oh my God, there were some awful things

610
00:28:58.719 --> 00:28:59.319
happening in

611
00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:03.280
this. Yeah, probably, probably. I think that in history

612
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.505
we are either. Number 2 or number 1 in

613
00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:11.584
terms of the nations that promote uh promoted slavery

614
00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:14.905
the most. So I, I, I think that if

615
00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:18.094
we're not 1 then it should be the UK,

616
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:19.984
but I, I'm not sure. So

617
00:29:21.064 --> 00:29:22.775
yeah, it should be us no that sounds very

618
00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:24.694
bad. What we should be number 1. No, that's

619
00:29:24.694 --> 00:29:25.984
the one thing you do not want to be

620
00:29:25.984 --> 00:29:29.089
number 1 in. No, um, and it, it kind

621
00:29:29.089 --> 00:29:31.290
of, it, it reflects so much on our modern

622
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.250
societies as well. Um, I don't know if this

623
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.010
is, this is a massive tangent. I don't know

624
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.449
if this is reflective in Portugal, but here in

625
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:41.209
the UK, especially in England, we're having a bit

626
00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:43.930
of a patriotism, nationality crisis. Like people are being

627
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.770
like, oh, what, why am I not allowed, why

628
00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:46.890
am I not allowed to be proud to be,

629
00:29:46.969 --> 00:29:48.569
there's always been this thing in the, the UK

630
00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:50.609
that like we're not like how you see in

631
00:29:50.609 --> 00:29:52.670
America, people raise the flag and salute the flag.

632
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.390
We've never really done that much here in the

633
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.599
UK and people are starting to be like, well

634
00:29:56.599 --> 00:29:58.270
what, what, why, why, why is it bad to

635
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.500
be proud to be British? And I kind of

636
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.630
wanna tell these people because we did a lot

637
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.369
of bad things in the past and that flag

638
00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:08.020
has a lot of blood and death and slavery

639
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.949
associated with it. It's got a bad reputation, whereas

640
00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:15.369
like the American flag has this image of freedom

641
00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:18.390
of fighting off these guys, it, it, it comes

642
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.719
with that kind of struggle. I think a lot

643
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:23.079
of this kind of national pride often is coincides

644
00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:25.560
with sort of a a national struggle, and to

645
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.400
fight for that pride and we've never really had

646
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.520
that here in the UK so that's why I've

647
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.359
always been a bit odd with patriotism and people

648
00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:34.599
are trying to. If you wanna know why, that's

649
00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.359
kind of why. So that's a, that's a really

650
00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:38.150
big tangent, but just, just something on my chest

651
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.150
I had to get out. I don't know if

652
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.380
that's the same in Portugal though.

653
00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:43.239
So one interesting thing that you talk about in

654
00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:46.380
your book is also languages that we can find

655
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.709
in Antarctica. So, uh I I mean, I, I,

656
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.280
what kinds of languages can we find there?

657
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.229
So Antarctica's a really interesting case in the realm

658
00:30:57.229 --> 00:30:59.930
of language cos it's kind of everything and nothing.

659
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.829
So many like uh it's weirdly linguistically diverse Antarctica

660
00:31:05.829 --> 00:31:08.800
because so many different countries have research bases on

661
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.550
the continent. That all kinds of languages have been

662
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.349
spoken there, English, Spanish, Portuguese, uh, Finnish, uh, Russian,

663
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.949
Chinese, uh Mandarin, Chinese, whatever, you know, the, the

664
00:31:17.949 --> 00:31:23.329
wider Chinese languages, Japanese, Arabic. It's resoundingly linguistically diverse.

665
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.150
The only problem is that those languages are only

666
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.030
there for like 6 months tops before they go

667
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.550
away again, cause you can't live in Antarctica permanently.

668
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.150
No one, no one lives in Antarctica, uh, 24/7.

669
00:31:35.189 --> 00:31:38.479
They come, they do research, they disappear again. So

670
00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:41.640
while there is this huge degree of linguistical diversity

671
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.599
that has existed in Antarctica, it's not like all

672
00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:46.719
these different speakers are kind of merging together with

673
00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:49.319
one another to make some sort of universal language

674
00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:51.890
or anything like that. They're literally there and go,

675
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.079
and they don't really interact too much with one

676
00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:55.400
another, so you do get all these languages in

677
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.949
Antarctica. Because people, I mean, I think it was

678
00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.339
decreed that Antarctica can only be used for scientific

679
00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:02.150
purposes, we're not allowed to mine it or claim

680
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.010
it as a country. So there's people there studying

681
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.469
science stuff, putting it scientifically, and then disappearing again.

682
00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:11.949
So yeah, it's a really fascinating case and it's

683
00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:14.550
kind of similar to what's going on up in

684
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.550
space as well. There's a whole chapter about languages

685
00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.589
in space. Sorry if I beat you to asking

686
00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:20.680
me about it, but it's kind of a similar

687
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.900
situation. Space is really linguistically diverse, but. It's not

688
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.760
there for long enough to have any real impact.

689
00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:32.449
So, um, how, uh, uh, this is also another

690
00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:34.489
thing that you talk about in your book and

691
00:32:34.489 --> 00:32:39.189
your channel as well. How do sign languages relate

692
00:32:39.189 --> 00:32:41.069
to spoken languages?

693
00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:46.270
So My kind of my gut answer to how

694
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.390
the sign languages relate to spoken languages is kind

695
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.510
of not at all. They're so different to one

696
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.910
another. I think a lot of people and myself

697
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.069
included before I kind of researched into it, I

698
00:32:58.069 --> 00:33:01.949
kind of presumed sign languages were like just a

699
00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:05.709
physical way of representing our spoken language or written

700
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:08.849
out language. Like if it it before I studied

701
00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:10.829
sign languages, if someone asked me how do you

702
00:33:10.829 --> 00:33:12.290
sign the letter A, I would have just gone

703
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.500
like, you know. I would have just done, done

704
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.819
that like, oh, surely you just do it as

705
00:33:15.819 --> 00:33:16.989
a neighbor, but that's not the case at all.

706
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.619
Sign languages are kind of, they are kind of

707
00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:22.170
like their own unique languages in the same way

708
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.060
and evolved. Granted they're a little bit more artificially

709
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.859
of their evolution, but they are so different to

710
00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:31.660
spoken languages and so com so completely different to

711
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.219
them. And they have their own stories as well

712
00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:36.020
behind them. They're, they're not that similar at all.

713
00:33:36.199 --> 00:33:39.739
I've spoken languages and sign languages are two completely

714
00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:42.020
different kettles of fish in, in my estimation.

715
00:33:42.829 --> 00:33:46.280
Mhm, YEAH, that's really interesting. So let me ask

716
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.270
you about another er Asian language. So how is

717
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.000
Mandarin spreading across the globe?

718
00:33:55.189 --> 00:33:57.589
So yeah, this is, this is the final chapter

719
00:33:57.589 --> 00:33:59.949
of the book. Oh, spoilers, so you know, make

720
00:33:59.949 --> 00:34:01.270
sure you've read it before you see this bit.

721
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.430
No, so there is a hypothesis that Mandarin might

722
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.280
become the world's next lingua franca. Uh, FOR those

723
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.708
who don't know, a lingua franca. Uh YEAH,

724
00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.438
explain what a lingua franca is, please.

725
00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:15.790
A lingua franca is basically a language that is

726
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.659
used when people who speak different languages interact with

727
00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.708
one another. For example, English. Once again, I just

728
00:34:21.708 --> 00:34:24.429
need to say, Ricardo, despite your English is superb

729
00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.389
and. Whenever I speak to someone, no, no, it's

730
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:30.010
absolutely superb. You're, you're, you're Portuguese, you're speaking English

731
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:32.469
better than I, better than I do. I'm always

732
00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.629
like, oh man, I really need to learn more

733
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:37.668
languages, but it's kind of the card you're dealt

734
00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:40.310
in life. Being a native English speaker is such

735
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.219
a double-edged sword because you kind of get to

736
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:46.110
this point where you just expect everyone else to

737
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.389
speak it, and English is our world's lingua franca

738
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.909
at the moment. It is the world's number one

739
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:56.300
language. When we think about. Situations where people from

740
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.199
different parts of the world come to communicate with

741
00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:01.179
one another, whether that be a UN meeting or

742
00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:03.979
even like the Olympics or my personal favorite, Eurovision,

743
00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:07.139
when it comes to something like that. It's 9

744
00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:09.860
out of 10 times they're speaking English because due

745
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.939
to the huge importance English has, due to the

746
00:35:12.939 --> 00:35:17.149
UK's empire and. What, what impact that empire had,

747
00:35:17.209 --> 00:35:19.050
it created the USA which is now the world's

748
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.729
only dominant superpower, and they speak English and we

749
00:35:21.729 --> 00:35:24.169
speak English. So it's kind of just resulted in

750
00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:27.300
English becoming our modern lingua franca. But uh going

751
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.459
back to Mandarin, there is this belief due to

752
00:35:30.459 --> 00:35:33.229
the momentum China is picking up on the world

753
00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:36.919
stage from production, from even from a cultural standpoint,

754
00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:39.610
uh, this is such a weird thing, like the

755
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.659
biggest film of last year, I don't know how

756
00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:45.340
to pronounce its name. It was an animated Chinese

757
00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.790
movie. It made like $2 billion or something. It

758
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.379
was the most successful financial, like financially successful film

759
00:35:51.379 --> 00:35:55.919
of 2025. And it was Mandarin, it was Chinese,

760
00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.080
like it's grown hugely popular. More and more people

761
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.100
are realizing, hey, China's becoming a such big dominant

762
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.050
player on the world stage, it might surpass the

763
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.699
USA, who knows? It's all a very big hypothetical,

764
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.500
but people are preparing for it. There are people

765
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.540
who are kind of studying Mandarin in the same

766
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.060
way. I'm guessing, Ricardo, were you taught English at

767
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.399
school?

768
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.360
Uh, YES.

769
00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.820
Yeah, cos cos it's seen as the language that

770
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.060
oh you must learn English to do so. Obviously

771
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.500
we're taught English at school, but that's cos it's

772
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.860
our native language. There are cases of um. Like

773
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.620
there's cases of people being taught Mandarin as kids

774
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.899
cos it's believed to be this is going to

775
00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:33.479
be the language you're going to need to know

776
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.620
in the future to to be a player on

777
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.060
the world stage. So it's all very hypothetical. Uh,

778
00:36:40.139 --> 00:36:41.780
WHETHER it actually happens or not remains to be

779
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.530
seen, but there is that sort of belief that

780
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.500
Mandarin might become the next English, for lack of

781
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.120
a better term.

782
00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.889
Uh, uh, DO you know if there's any other

783
00:36:51.889 --> 00:36:56.770
language besides Mandarin that could replace English as the

784
00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.570
lingua franca in the future?

785
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.080
So I have a really silly answer to this

786
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.040
one. HOLD on, I'll I'll I'll, I'll, I'll think

787
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.879
about it for a minute and then I'll say

788
00:37:05.879 --> 00:37:08.919
my silly answer. In regards to another language that

789
00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:13.080
could become the next lingua franca, it's. It's hard

790
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:19.100
to see, maybe like at a push, Spanish. Purely

791
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.159
because the fact that so much of the world

792
00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:26.260
speaks it. And because it's got influence, there's, there's

793
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.020
a lot of influential, influential countries that speak Spanish,

794
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.820
um, like Spain, of course, huge swaths of South

795
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.139
America, Mexico, Argentina, just, you know, off the top

796
00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:37.219
of my head. Potentially Spanish, but I also just

797
00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:40.139
don't see it fully being there. French is another

798
00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:42.100
great example. French is, I think it's called the

799
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.800
language of, um, oh, what's the word I'm looking

800
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.689
for? The, the language of bureaucracy, um, I can't

801
00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:49.570
remember what the exact term is, but French has

802
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.090
historically kind of been this lingua franca in politics,

803
00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:55.919
in, uh, government, in law as well. French is

804
00:37:55.919 --> 00:37:58.889
often used, so maybe French, uh, apart from them,

805
00:37:58.969 --> 00:38:01.010
I don't think any of them have the speaking

806
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.500
population or sway. That, um, English does, you could

807
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.260
argue something like Hindi, Hindi's spoken by so many

808
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.879
people and obviously Urdu, Hindi and Urdu are more

809
00:38:09.879 --> 00:38:11.159
or less one and the same tongue just with

810
00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:13.389
different written forms. There's more to it than that,

811
00:38:13.439 --> 00:38:15.439
but for for for simple sake, let's just say

812
00:38:15.439 --> 00:38:18.320
that. Hindi's got a huge speaking population cos so

813
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.780
much of India speaks it, but even then again,

814
00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.270
India isn't the biggest player on the world stage.

815
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.919
It's getting there, don't get me wrong, but it

816
00:38:24.919 --> 00:38:28.040
hasn't it hasn't got that sway just yet. English

817
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.360
is in this really unique spot where it's got

818
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.500
a huge speaking population. And those who speak are

819
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.139
quite influential and powerful countries like the USA like

820
00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:37.899
us here in the UK to name a couple.

821
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.379
Um, BUT then as for my silly answer I

822
00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:43.580
hinted towards, it's emoji, right? Emoji is like already

823
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.489
up. It's already the lingua franca. Like it's, it's

824
00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:50.639
already a universal tongue. Everyone understands emoji. It's brilliant.

825
00:38:50.689 --> 00:38:53.889
I love emoji to pieces. Like you could, you,

826
00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:55.810
a smiley face is a smiley face, no matter

827
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.239
the only issue with, uh, emoji is it hasn't

828
00:38:58.239 --> 00:39:00.530
really got a spoken form yet. We could try

829
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.750
and figure that out at some point, but, um,

830
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.889
it really, uh, I, I think emoji is one

831
00:39:05.889 --> 00:39:07.489
of the closest things we get to, to having

832
00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:10.189
another lingua franca on the world stage, like genuinely.

833
00:39:10.939 --> 00:39:13.669
And they're great, not only like it's easy to

834
00:39:13.669 --> 00:39:15.989
compare them to something like hieroglyphics cos they're logographic,

835
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.189
but emoji is so much more than that. While

836
00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:21.399
like a hieroglyph of an I can only really

837
00:39:21.399 --> 00:39:24.000
mean an I, an emoji can mean so many

838
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.439
different things. I love the upside down smiley face.

839
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.080
Let's say at face value, it's just a smiley

840
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.120
face turned upside down, but it holds so much

841
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.959
more deeper meaning to it. Like I always send

842
00:39:33.959 --> 00:39:35.560
that one to people where I'm annoyed, like, oh

843
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.070
great, the dishwasher just broke, upside down smiley face,

844
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.719
cos it just, it's so interpretable in so many

845
00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:42.520
great ways. And then you've got things like the

846
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.969
aubergine emoji as well, which, yeah, is an aubergine.

847
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360
But also eggplant, I don't know what term you

848
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:48.939
know for.

849
00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:51.570
Uh, EGGPLANT, yeah, yeah,

850
00:39:51.669 --> 00:39:54.070
eggplant, sorry, in British English they're known as aubergines.

851
00:39:54.149 --> 00:39:54.469
Uh, NO,

852
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.909
but, but I, I, I, I knew what you

853
00:39:56.909 --> 00:39:58.709
were referring to, yes. Oh, OK,

854
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.830
cool, yeah, like, yeah, it's just an eggplant, but

855
00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.070
also, yeah, something more. So that's my silly answer

856
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.669
to that. I think if I had to, if

857
00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.949
someone said like, hey, what's the next lingua franca

858
00:40:07.949 --> 00:40:10.229
gonna be? I would probably say emoji.

859
00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:15.449
Uh, THAT'S, that's funny. So, uh, uh, uh, two

860
00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:19.419
more questions then. Um, HOW does the migration of

861
00:40:19.419 --> 00:40:24.860
languages manifest in how people who speak different languages

862
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.399
deal with one another?

863
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:31.020
It can manifest in all different ways, it kind

864
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.590
of gives people. An understanding of their history. If

865
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:41.600
I'm talking to say an American in the US

866
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:45.250
who speaks English and wants to get like yeah,

867
00:40:45.629 --> 00:40:47.610
it makes me go, oh OK, I know who

868
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.300
you are, I know. How you got here, I

869
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.600
know that you're most likely, and it's not 100%

870
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.449
accurate all the time, but you have some sort

871
00:40:56.449 --> 00:40:59.610
of European ancestry running through you to get to

872
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.010
that point, and it kind of makes you realize,

873
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.100
oh, you're a product of this sort of thing.

874
00:41:03.439 --> 00:41:05.669
It can affect people in other ways too. Um,

875
00:41:05.969 --> 00:41:08.010
IT can be negative as well. So in the

876
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:12.429
book I talk about how Polish has become England's

877
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.610
second most spoken tongue behind English, of course. This

878
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.520
is a more recent thing. Uh, THIS is great,

879
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.600
this, and with this has come all kinds of

880
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.520
negative interpretations. Uh, I lived somewhere, um. I lived

881
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.000
somewhere before I moved to where I live in

882
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.679
the UK now, er we had a real high

883
00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:36.300
Polish population. And it was for a variety of

884
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.590
factors. You, you can read about it in the

885
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.510
book, but for a variety of factors, a huge

886
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:43.580
Polish migration happened in the early 2000s, and I,

887
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.870
I don't think it's still going on anymore. Cheers

888
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.429
Brexit, not cheers Brexit, don't, don't think I was

889
00:41:48.429 --> 00:41:52.510
being honest when I said that, um. And it

890
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.419
kind of made a real unpleasant atmosphere for a

891
00:41:55.419 --> 00:41:56.870
lot of the, a lot of English people were

892
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.949
angry, oh, the Polish are coming, they're taking all

893
00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.929
our jobs, we're all gonna be speaking Polish soon.

894
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.629
So that kind of manifested in a lot of

895
00:42:02.629 --> 00:42:06.550
negativity. It kind of made people angry that people

896
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.669
who were speaking a different language were coming here.

897
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.879
And when certain English speaking people in my old

898
00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:18.530
hometown with a high Polish population. When they started

899
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.729
speaking to someone and realized the person talking back

900
00:42:20.729 --> 00:42:23.689
to them was speaking say broken English in a

901
00:42:23.689 --> 00:42:27.760
thick Polish accent. It really shaped the impression, oh,

902
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.040
you must be one of those people who have

903
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.810
come over here to take all the jobs. Obviously

904
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.770
that's. It's not true. I was gonna say a

905
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.689
stronger word there, but I'll just say that's not

906
00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:38.189
true. Uh, IT so it can, it can have

907
00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:41.760
positive images, it can help us understand someone's history

908
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.600
in a very broad strokes, and it can unfortunately

909
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.639
shape someone's opinion on someone. Someone, a lot of

910
00:42:47.639 --> 00:42:49.689
people will judge people solely on the language they

911
00:42:49.689 --> 00:42:53.010
speak, not the quality of their character, which sucks,

912
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.209
quite frankly. I mean,

913
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.209
even sometimes just on the basis of their accent.

914
00:42:57.379 --> 00:42:57.389
Right,

915
00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.580
mhm, yeah, even just on their accent, gosh, yeah,

916
00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:03.459
even if they're speaking perfect English or perfect Portuguese

917
00:43:03.459 --> 00:43:05.139
in your case, not like, oh my gosh, sorry

918
00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:06.689
that I was just saying an example, your how

919
00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:08.060
your English should go. I'm not judging you by

920
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.139
your accent by any means, but, um, you could

921
00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:12.889
be speaking perfect English, but if you've got an

922
00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:15.379
accent of some kind, there are people out there

923
00:43:15.379 --> 00:43:17.260
who will judge you. They might even think lesser

924
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.379
because you're speaking in an accent different to theirs.

925
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.179
And of course it can change from accent to

926
00:43:21.179 --> 00:43:24.060
accent. Some accents have this real great reputation behind

927
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.719
them. Say like thinking like things like the Italian

928
00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:29.379
accent or the French accent or the Irish accent,

929
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.750
they're really beloved ones, or the I think the

930
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.679
Australians voted the most beloved accent. That, that can

931
00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:37.379
make people go, oh nice, cool. Whereas there's other

932
00:43:37.379 --> 00:43:40.080
accents out there that haven't gotten as good reputation.

933
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:43.719
I mentioned Polish in example, that's particularly in the

934
00:43:43.719 --> 00:43:46.139
UK to many people it's got a negative connotation

935
00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:49.639
to it. Uh, EVEN things like, uh, Asian, certain

936
00:43:49.639 --> 00:43:53.020
Asian accents, like, um, Middle Eastern kind of accents,

937
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.320
due to unfortunately like global events, they might have

938
00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.639
a more negative connotation about them to a certain

939
00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:02.520
demographic of people. Those people are idiots. I just

940
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.260
want to stress that clearly. If you're judging someone

941
00:44:05.399 --> 00:44:07.989
based solely on their accent, yeah, you're not, you're,

942
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.340
you're, you're not a friend of mine, mate.

943
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:15.729
Yeah, so, uh, one last question then, uh, I've

944
00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:18.889
already asked you, uh, I've already asked you about

945
00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.770
what you think could be the next lingua franca.

946
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.370
How do you look at the future more generally

947
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.330
of language migration and evolution?

948
00:44:29.739 --> 00:44:32.659
Gosh, it's a tough one to think what's gonna

949
00:44:32.659 --> 00:44:35.699
happen. I mean, language is gonna continuously move. And

950
00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:38.540
if you go so, so, so, so, so far

951
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.199
into the future, I guess hypothetically, yes, we, we

952
00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:43.340
would, we will reach this point where there is

953
00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.659
just one singular language. I'm talking like millions of

954
00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:50.300
years, hypothetically that may happen. But I think languages

955
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.540
just carry on moving and evolving and they're gonna

956
00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.260
move and evolve in new ways. Uh, THINK of

957
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.020
something, I, I think a great example of this

958
00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.820
is Korean. Due to a huge interest in sort

959
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.179
of South Korean culture. Think K-pop, think Squid Games,

960
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.169
think that, uh, Netflix film K-pop Demon Hunters. Uh,

961
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.500
South Korean, yeah, specifically South Korean media, not North

962
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.199
Korea. I don't know what they're doing up there.

963
00:45:11.419 --> 00:45:14.969
But South Korean media has become, uh, hugely interested

964
00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:17.219
in a lot of younger people, which has led

965
00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:19.060
a lot of younger people wanting to learn the

966
00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.020
Korean language. So I think a way languages are

967
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.989
going to migrate more. Is I, I'd like to

968
00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:28.750
think that we won't get language migrations in more

969
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.229
brutal fashions in the future in the way how

970
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.689
English ended up in the US or how, um,

971
00:45:35.229 --> 00:45:37.870
Portuguese ended up in Brazil. I hope we don't

972
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:39.590
end up with more migrations like that in the

973
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.030
future. I can't say it won't happen, but you

974
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.110
know, I, if you don't mind me talking about

975
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.030
more topical things, in a few, in, in, in

976
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.790
however many years' time, Venezuela might be speaking American

977
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.350
for all we know, and yeah, I say they're

978
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.100
speaking American. Uh, YOU know, stuff like that could

979
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.699
happen, even something like, this is all hypotheticals, uh,

980
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.219
Russian could become the dominant language of Ukraine, an

981
00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:04.979
example. Things like that could happen. We could see

982
00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:08.020
language migrations happen in more brutal fashions based on

983
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.899
current world events, but I'm more hopeful that won't

984
00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:13.659
happen. I'm more hopeful that we'll get the sort

985
00:46:13.659 --> 00:46:17.540
of more softer cultural migrations of languages, people actively

986
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.909
choosing to learn our language. Because it's something they

987
00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:23.070
want to learn, like young people here in the

988
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.709
UK wanting to learn Korean because they watch Squid

989
00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:26.729
Game, I think that's great.

990
00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:33.050
Yeah, so let's end on that hopeful note, uh,

991
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.030
and the book is again Immigrant Tongues exploring how

992
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:41.189
languages moved, evolved and defined this. I'm of course

993
00:46:41.189 --> 00:46:43.379
leaving a link to it in the description of

994
00:46:43.379 --> 00:46:46.790
the interview. And, and Patrick, just before we go

995
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.310
apart from your YouTube channel, which I will also

996
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.870
link in the description, where can people find you?

997
00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:53.629
On the internet.

998
00:46:54.209 --> 00:46:56.649
Gosh, people can find me pretty much everywhere on

999
00:46:56.649 --> 00:47:00.290
the internet. Uh, I'm on Instagram, Name ExplainYT. I'm

1000
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.159
on Blue Sky. Maybe just Name Explain or Name

1001
00:47:03.159 --> 00:47:06.129
ExplainYT, I cannot remember. I'm on YouTube as you

1002
00:47:06.129 --> 00:47:08.370
mentioned. You can find my books on Amazon or

1003
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.169
any other place you choose to buy books from.

1004
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.050
Uh, THERE'S a nameplain subreddit. I'm trying to think

1005
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:15.090
where else I am. I'm not on Twitter, that's

1006
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.810
for sure. I'm not on Twitter anymore, so don't

1007
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.010
try and follow me there cos. If someone's trying

1008
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.159
to claim to be me, that ain't me. They're

1009
00:47:21.159 --> 00:47:22.689
the places you can mainly find me. I mainly

1010
00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:24.479
hang on Instagram these days, it's a real fun

1011
00:47:24.479 --> 00:47:27.290
place when you do it right. I'm Reddit a

1012
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.399
lot as well. Uh, BUT yeah, mainly it's just

1013
00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:31.689
the YouTube channel which Ricardo, as you mentioned, you'll

1014
00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:33.689
have very kindly linked down below. But yeah, you

1015
00:47:33.689 --> 00:47:35.070
can find me if you just search Na explain,

1016
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.050
if you search Patrick Foote, I will probably pop
