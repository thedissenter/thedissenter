00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.299
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.619
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:11.170
today I'm joined again by Doctor Kostas Kempourakis, and

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.439
we're going to talk about his new book, Trusting

5
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:19.440
Science Why We Need to reconsider. School science teaching

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.430
and I'm also leaving links to our first two

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.920
interviews in the description of this one. So, Doctor

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.479
Kampoakis, welcome back to the show. It's always a

9
00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:29.549
pleasure to have you on.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.639
Thank you very much. It's always a pleasure for

11
00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.360
me too, to talk to you and discuss about

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.990
the books.

13
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.810
Great. So, uh, why did you feel the need

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.180
to write such a book now?

15
00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.590
Yeah, well, as you know, uh, during the pandemic,

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.520
there was a lot of discussion and questions regarding

17
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.560
what scientists can really know and how uh valid

18
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.159
the recommendations about the various measures that we're making

19
00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.919
were and uh I, I, I started wondering you.

20
00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:03.459
So why is this happening, uh, knowing that, of

21
00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.260
course, there is a lot of uncertainty inherent in

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.010
science, but at the same time, uh, the reactions

23
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.699
of people were sometime extreme. So I decided to

24
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:17.139
look into this and try to understand what might

25
00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:21.269
be the cause. Uh, OF, uh, this issue. There

26
00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:24.589
are several important ones, but in this book, I'm

27
00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:29.139
focusing on what I think is an underexplored question,

28
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.900
how much people really understand about science.

29
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.069
Right. And we're certainly going to get into the

30
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:42.059
COVID-19 pandemic later in our conversation. But more generally,

31
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.910
how do you look at the current state of

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.500
science communication and public trust in science?

33
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.089
On the one hand, scientists are among the most

34
00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:59.370
trusted professionals along with medical doctors. This is what

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.459
several polls show with the politicians and journalists being

36
00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.440
at the other end. At the same time, uh,

37
00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.279
it's not that everyone trusts scientists, you know, polls

38
00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.309
show percentages around 60, 70%. So there's an important,

39
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.679
uh, portion of people who are not uh ready

40
00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.220
to trust. And this is something. That should make

41
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.899
us wonder why this is the case. You know,

42
00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.020
in relative terms, there is trust, uh, but in

43
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.779
absolute terms, there are still people who are wondering

44
00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.979
uh if they should trust scientists. This brings us

45
00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.229
to science communication, which I think is not effective

46
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.419
in part because scientists are not actively involved, the

47
00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.809
experts, the real experts are not actively involved and

48
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.270
And another part, because whenever they do that, it's

49
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.429
not as effective as it should have been. Now,

50
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.350
the point I'm making is that we should not

51
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.470
blame scientists, we should not blame the public, but

52
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.860
we should look into the educational systems and see,

53
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:07.000
ask the question, have we really prepared Uh, students

54
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.000
to become thoughtful citizens who can ask the right

55
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600
questions about science and who are ready to understand

56
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.759
what science is about. And I'm sorry to say

57
00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.750
that the answer is more or less no.

58
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.880
Right, uh, but what do you mean by trust

59
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.729
in science? What do you trust

60
00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:31.210
exactly? Yes, uh, trust in general is to be

61
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.539
confident that someone can do and will do what

62
00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.399
you expect them to do. In other words, when

63
00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.710
we trust someone, we believe that that person is

64
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.029
willing and able to do what we expect them

65
00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:51.410
to do. Um, AND this brings us to two

66
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.220
important questions. The first one is whether scientists are

67
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.759
able to Understand nature and advise us when this

68
00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.509
is relevant. And the second is when they will

69
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.559
do that. And of course, in the vast majority

70
00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.580
of cases, uh, the answer is positive in both

71
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.160
uh because overall the scientific communities that are have

72
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.279
the expertise on specific issues are able to give

73
00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.798
us recommendations or at least, uh, they are the

74
00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.619
best ones to give us recommendations because there are,

75
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:25.279
of course, there will always be things that we

76
00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.089
will not know. And uh on the other hand,

77
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.450
we know that they have no reason not to

78
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.369
be willing to help us. Uh, HAVING said that,

79
00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.410
there always exist and there will always exist, and

80
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.529
there have always existed scientists who are not. That

81
00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.700
competent or who are not that goodwilling to help

82
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.369
us, but this does not represent the majority. For

83
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:53.130
the vast majority of cases, this works and this

84
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.209
is why we should trust them. But the big

85
00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:59.450
question is how we uh should be able to

86
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.089
identify when and how to do this.

87
00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.739
Um, WHY did you decide to focus on vaccination

88
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:10.029
in the book? Of course, it's not the only

89
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.940
topic you go through, but why such a focus

90
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.549
on it?

91
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.250
Yeah. Well, there are two reasons for this. Uh,

92
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.369
THE first one is that during the pandemic, there

93
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:21.529
was a lot of discussion about vaccines, and this

94
00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.049
is a question that concerns every citizen. It's not,

95
00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.369
of course, the only one or not even the

96
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.809
only important one. Climate change is another, but it

97
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.160
is something that has been uh bothering people forever.

98
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.529
And the other reason is that I'm, I'm teaching

99
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.320
a course here in Geneva and I'm giving, um,

100
00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:43.010
I'm giving classes on vaccination, and the history of

101
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.570
vaccination. And my endeavor in this story made me

102
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.890
realize that there's some issues that are not properly

103
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.250
understood, uh, even by my undergraduate biology students. And

104
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.369
so the combination of these, you know, the eternal

105
00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:03.380
questions about vaccines and my observations in what might

106
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.809
be difficult to understand made me focus on that

107
00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.880
because as I uh figured out in the end,

108
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.339
uh, If we look carefully at the history of

109
00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:19.940
vaccination, we can see what is that bothers people,

110
00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:23.059
what is that people do not like, and then

111
00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.579
this gives us insights about how to address it.

112
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.369
What happened during the COVID-19 pandemic that you think

113
00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:36.570
is illustrative of how the public reacts to scientific

114
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.010
claims, at least nowadays?

115
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.970
Yeah. Well, the first important thing is that for

116
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.329
some people, especially those of us who live in

117
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:48.489
the Western world, it was something entirely new. People

118
00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:53.549
in Asia had experienced. Uh, PANDEMICS like this at

119
00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:55.549
the shorter scale, of course, in the past, but

120
00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.989
it was not that new for them. It was

121
00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:00.769
too new for us here in the Western world.

122
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.549
And the second is that uh the reaction was

123
00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:07.100
immediate and that there was so much funding. Uh,

124
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.140
USED the transfer to the production of vaccines that

125
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.989
we ended up having safe and efficient vaccines that

126
00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:19.589
it was shown along the way too early. And

127
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.619
I'm saying too early in a negative sense because

128
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.029
not everyone was prepared to accept this as a

129
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:30.303
fact. To accept that, you know, the vaccines that

130
00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:33.183
were produced in less than a year could be

131
00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:35.923
safe first of all and then effective against disease.

132
00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:39.252
Thankfully, that was the case. So, all in all,

133
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.903
we were in a very difficult and uncertain uh

134
00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:46.942
situation with measures that, you know, uh disturbed the

135
00:07:46.942 --> 00:07:50.303
life of many people. And then we were asked.

136
00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:54.045
To get vaccines, to have a medical intervention uh

137
00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:57.936
with products that were produced very, very fast, which,

138
00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:01.216
of course, causes concern, uh, to people. So I,

139
00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:04.545
I think that in the first uh year or

140
00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:07.735
so of the pandemic, these reactions were natural and

141
00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:10.855
normal because that was a new situation and things

142
00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:12.205
were changing very fast.

143
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:21.049
In regards to vaccination. For people to understand about

144
00:08:21.049 --> 00:08:24.480
it. I mean, how do vaccines work?

145
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.769
Well, the important thing for people to understand is

146
00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:32.489
that simply put, with vaccines, we somehow simulate an

147
00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:37.419
infection. The difference is that Whereas the first time

148
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.619
that we will be infected, we may develop the

149
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:44.578
disease with vaccines, it's very unlikely to develop the

150
00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:46.499
disease. We may have some people may have some

151
00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:49.948
symptoms, but the important thing is that the, our

152
00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:55.580
immune system uh is prepared and The first time

153
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.179
it will encounter a pathogen, it will react as

154
00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:01.890
if, if it was the second. What we do,

155
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.619
in other words, is that we make our immune

156
00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:09.380
system ready to produce the necessary cells so that

157
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.989
it reacts efficiently and so that we avoid the,

158
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.690
the disease.

159
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.039
And uh of course, during this pandemic, uh MRNA

160
00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:25.200
vaccines were produced. So what should people know about

161
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.289
these vaccines that were produced and administered during the

162
00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:31.919
COVID-19 pandemic?

163
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.729
That was a new technology, uh, which also had

164
00:09:35.729 --> 00:09:38.859
its, you know, concerns, but it's one that works

165
00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:42.900
very well. In some cases, uh, it is much

166
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.940
more efficient than other methods. It's not the only

167
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.780
one, of course, but it seemed to work very

168
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.460
well and produce uh the necessary coverage uh and

169
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.179
the necessary protection for our organism. And DNA is

170
00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:00.140
something that exists in all our cells. It's not

171
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.940
something that we cannot find there. And it was

172
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.460
just uh a specific procedure in the process of

173
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.659
producing the necessary molecules that will make our immune

174
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:16.619
system react and prepare for the future infection. It's,

175
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.299
there's nothing unnatural, uh, in, in all that.

176
00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:24.070
Yes, I, I mean, one of the things I

177
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.260
heard from some people, some people who were worried

178
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.229
about these vaccines back in the pandemic, like 3

179
00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:37.429
or 4 years ago, was that they thought that

180
00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:42.340
because they were MRNA vaccines, they would be able

181
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.869
to get into our the genetic material in our

182
00:10:46.869 --> 00:10:49.700
cells. I mean, but does that make any sense?

183
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.429
No, this is not at all the case. Exactly

184
00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:57.020
because the process of all this does not entail

185
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.539
that these molecules will enter the nuclei where our

186
00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:04.859
DNA is found. In contrast, these stay outside the

187
00:11:04.859 --> 00:11:07.260
nuclei in what we call the cytoplasm, where the

188
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.059
proteins that we need for uh protection and to

189
00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:14.890
initiate the reaction of the immune system will produce.

190
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.109
So I would say it is exactly the opposite.

191
00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:20.010
There are other kinds of vaccines that might require

192
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.969
an integration of something. Uh, INSIDE the nucleus, but

193
00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:26.000
this is not what we have here.

194
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.539
Great. So, uh, but what leads to vaccine distress?

195
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.219
Why do people develop this kind of

196
00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:37.859
distrust? Yeah, I think there are two main reasons.

197
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.289
The first one, it is a medical intervention, uh,

198
00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:47.210
that is against. Something that we do not see.

199
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.309
So, when people are sick, they will immediately get

200
00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:57.559
uh whatever their doctors recommend to get over the

201
00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:00.719
sickness and disease that they're dealing with. In the

202
00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:04.690
case of vaccines, there's no disease yet. So we

203
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.159
are asked to make a medical intervention against something

204
00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:13.229
that is not there. And this makes people uncomfortable.

205
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:16.960
Uh, THE other part is that in some cases,

206
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:21.359
not very often, uh, there are, uh, secondary effects

207
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.919
of vaccines just because some people are more sensitive

208
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:27.989
to these molecules or for other reasons. These are,

209
00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:31.700
these are rare, but they do happen. So, the

210
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.219
combination of these two, the fact that we're asked

211
00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:37.460
to make a medical intervention and get something that

212
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.900
does not yet exist. And the fact that we

213
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.419
listen, people talking about side effects, autism is not

214
00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:46.619
one of these, but, you know, there are secondary

215
00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:50.099
effects. Some people, to put it simply react uh

216
00:12:50.099 --> 00:12:52.830
more than they should. Uh, TO the vaccine, as

217
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.539
if it was the pathogen itself, makes us concerned.

218
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.380
And so parents, for instance, are wondering why vaccinate

219
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.799
my healthy kid and Insert inside it, inside that

220
00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:09.679
the my boy or my girl, something that, you

221
00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:14.520
know, comes from a pathogen. It is a normal

222
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.820
reaction, I would say to, for a sensitive pattern,

223
00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:23.039
but it is not justified at all because what

224
00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:26.080
we need to think about is not only the

225
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.960
risk uh of having a secondary effect due to

226
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.479
the vaccine, which is very low, but also the

227
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:36.359
risk of dealing and dying from the disease, which

228
00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:39.950
is much higher in the case of infectious diseases.

229
00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:45.309
So this is more of um I guess philosophical

230
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:49.909
question, perhaps a political one as well. But is

231
00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:55.539
taking a vaccine a matter of individual liberty or

232
00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:59.140
of collective responsibility? Because, you know, there are some

233
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.530
people that When they were confronted with certain policies

234
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.909
that were, were set in place to in a

235
00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:13.409
way force people to take the vaccine, uh, they

236
00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:16.840
didn't like it and they said that they should

237
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.090
only take the vaccine if they wanted, that it

238
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.070
was a matter of individual. Liberty, but I mean,

239
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.780
what do you think about? Yeah,

240
00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:28.549
well, it depends on the vaccine and actually depends

241
00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:31.169
on the disease we're talking about. If we're talking

242
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:34.989
about a disease like tetanus, where the pathogen is

243
00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:38.270
not transmitted from one person to the other, then

244
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.799
it is entirely a matter of individual, uh, liberty.

245
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.630
If people do not want to be exposed. They

246
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.909
can have the vaccine if they want to take

247
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:50.789
the risk, they can. But in the case of

248
00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:55.030
infectious diseases, diseases where the pathogen is transmitted from

249
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.549
one person to the other, it's no longer about

250
00:14:57.989 --> 00:15:02.270
individual liberty. It's also about collective responsibility because we

251
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:08.590
should feel uh responsible and take actions not to

252
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:13.270
transmit pathogens, especially to vulnerable people. So, in other

253
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.010
words, with the SARS COVID-2, the vaccine, the, the

254
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.390
virus that caused the pandemic or with any other

255
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.690
virus or bacterium that are transmitted from one person

256
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.000
to another, uh, the question of vaccination that Not

257
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
only concern our personal protection, but also the protection

258
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.390
of others, especially people who are vulnerable, depending on

259
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.440
the situation, usually very young or very old, or

260
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.039
people who cannot be vaccinated because they have issues

261
00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:42.919
with their immune system.

262
00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:48.349
So another example that you explore in the book

263
00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:52.030
has to do with abortion. Uh, IN this particular

264
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:59.229
case, explain how science can inform decisions but cannot

265
00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:00.919
alone support them.

266
00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:04.229
Yeah. Well, this relates to the previous question you

267
00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:09.229
asked. So uh whether being vaccinated is a question

268
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:12.822
of individual. Liberty or collective responsibility is an ethical

269
00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:16.182
question. It's not a scientific question. Science can tell

270
00:16:16.182 --> 00:16:20.043
us what happens. It can inform our decisions, but

271
00:16:20.043 --> 00:16:22.773
then it depends on our morals and ethics to,

272
00:16:22.903 --> 00:16:25.742
to, to decide how to deal with this. Similar

273
00:16:25.742 --> 00:16:29.143
is the case with abortion or the termination of

274
00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:33.513
pregnancy as we can call it, because we cannot

275
00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:39.335
really define in Absolute terms when life begins. So

276
00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:42.356
the two cells that fuse during fertilization, the sperm

277
00:16:42.356 --> 00:16:45.776
and the ovum, these are alive. And so uh

278
00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:50.245
they have functions and so is uh the zygote,

279
00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:53.255
the fertilized egg that results from that and so

280
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:57.575
it is the plastocyst that implants on uh the

281
00:16:57.575 --> 00:17:02.580
mother's uterus and so on. However, We also know

282
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.800
that there's so many fertilized eggs that are never

283
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.709
implanted for whatever reason, and this is natural. So,

284
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.439
the fact that we have a bunch of cells

285
00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:17.540
that have the functions of life does not entail

286
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.420
necessarily that we have an individual with Rights. And

287
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.098
this is again a decision that can be informed

288
00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:27.020
based on our knowledge from science, but uh we

289
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.380
cannot be made on the basis of scientific facts.

290
00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:32.500
It has to do with our uh values. It

291
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.609
has to do with our morals and perhaps our

292
00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:39.140
legal decisions, our legal perceptions of what is happening.

293
00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:43.329
So the issue here overall is that science in

294
00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:47.930
many times can inform our decisions, but we need

295
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.489
to consider other aspects, our values above all, to,

296
00:17:52.609 --> 00:17:53.780
to decide what to do.

297
00:17:54.479 --> 00:17:58.060
Mhm. Yes, so in this particular case of abortion,

298
00:17:58.949 --> 00:18:01.500
of course, apart from the fact that it's hard

299
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.829
to tell exactly when life begins. Another thing that

300
00:18:06.829 --> 00:18:10.790
people usually discuss and they are worried about or

301
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:16.930
interested in is when exactly does uh A person

302
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.729
begin or when does the figures acquire personhood and

303
00:18:20.729 --> 00:18:25.359
that's more of a philosophical than a scientific question.

304
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:29.969
Correct. Exactly. Uh, uh, WE, the fact that we

305
00:18:29.969 --> 00:18:34.530
have living cells does not, uh, entail that we

306
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.890
have a person there, and the decision about this

307
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.810
bunch of cells is a person is an important

308
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.439
one, but it's not a scientific question. It's something

309
00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:47.589
that we need other uh kinds of uh thinking

310
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.359
in order to make a decision and it's quite

311
00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:54.359
more subjective because, you know, in different societies, different

312
00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:56.670
decisions are made. Mhm.

313
00:18:57.229 --> 00:19:01.229
So what, what are the aspects of how science

314
00:19:01.229 --> 00:19:05.030
works that you think are the most important for

315
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.819
the public to understand?

316
00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:10.969
There are many aspects of what we call nature

317
00:19:10.969 --> 00:19:15.369
science, what science is and what we do that

318
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:17.849
in my view, and that's the final recommendation in

319
00:19:17.849 --> 00:19:21.439
the book, should be taught to every future citizen.

320
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.770
But for many reasons, this is not what we

321
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.500
do. We tend to focus on content knowledge, which

322
00:19:29.729 --> 00:19:32.010
in my experience as a former teacher and teacher

323
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.245
educator, these are details that students will Soon forget.

324
00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:40.015
Whereas we should try to educate them to understand

325
00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:43.446
the mentality, the habits of minds, and the processes

326
00:19:43.446 --> 00:19:47.656
that scientists follow when they do science. And I

327
00:19:47.656 --> 00:19:51.215
have a list of specific features uh of science

328
00:19:51.215 --> 00:19:54.135
in my book that are important to understand, which

329
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:58.176
do not come from my normative philosophical analysis of

330
00:19:58.176 --> 00:20:01.176
what science is, but it comes from my analysis

331
00:20:01.176 --> 00:20:04.862
of the controversies. So I looked at specific controversies

332
00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:08.582
throughout the history of vaccination and I figured out

333
00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:13.342
what people were asking about and from this, what

334
00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:16.222
they could not understand. And just to be clear,

335
00:20:16.302 --> 00:20:19.702
I'm not blaming people for not understanding what they,

336
00:20:20.062 --> 00:20:22.421
what they failed to understand, but I'm blaming the

337
00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:26.121
educational systems that did not prepare them to do

338
00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:28.631
this. To put it simply, you know, if people

339
00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:32.760
cannot read, Uh, it's not themselves to blame, but

340
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.119
the educational system that did not teach them how

341
00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:37.319
to read. In the same sense, if people do

342
00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.079
not understand science, we should go back and look

343
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.640
at the educational systems and what they did in

344
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.839
order to prepare them for this. And in my

345
00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:47.150
view, this is something that we do not do

346
00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:50.239
very well, or perhaps we do not do at

347
00:20:50.239 --> 00:20:53.160
all. And this is uh what the book is

348
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.560
about is a call about reconceptualizing, reconsidering what we

349
00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.439
do in schools.

350
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.920
And what constitutes evidence in science? How is evidence

351
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.969
established?

352
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.510
Well, what we, what scientists are looking for are

353
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:18.319
data. Uh, WHICH are, uh, facts, uh, uh, information,

354
00:21:18.329 --> 00:21:23.119
observation that can be found out there. Now, this

355
00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:27.880
becomes evidence under a specific theoretical framework or theoretical

356
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:34.239
uh lens philosophical sometimes framework and the interpretations may

357
00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:38.500
differ. The important point of for science is that

358
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:44.069
whatever the case, we cannot uh make conclusions and

359
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:48.510
we cannot explain anything if we don't have data

360
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.589
which we have analyzed and interpreted and in that

361
00:21:52.589 --> 00:21:56.989
sense, that becomes evidence for or against the conclusion.

362
00:21:58.189 --> 00:22:00.550
Now, the problem, as I explained in the book

363
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.739
is that sometimes we do not have the evidence

364
00:22:04.109 --> 00:22:06.869
we want to have because we cannot have it

365
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.229
or because we have not yet found it. And

366
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:15.030
this is what causes misunderstandings because lay people sometimes

367
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.229
think that scientists can answer all questions or that

368
00:22:18.229 --> 00:22:21.030
they can have all the necessary evidence, but this

369
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.229
is not the case. So what we need to

370
00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:26.880
do is to explain to them what kinds of

371
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.814
data. Data we're looking for, how they become evidence

372
00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:34.135
in specific contexts, and what we, what kinds of

373
00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:38.094
inferences we can make from this. Unfortunately, we cannot

374
00:22:38.094 --> 00:22:40.694
have all that we need and we cannot understand

375
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:43.375
all that we want and that's a natural part

376
00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:44.155
of science.

377
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.969
So, how should people deal with uncertainty in science

378
00:22:51.969 --> 00:22:56.260
and with the fact that knowledge in science keeps

379
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.619
changing and getting updated all the time? Because I

380
00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:04.180
think this is a crucial aspect of how science

381
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.300
works that people fail to have a proper grasp

382
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.979
of and then possibly also leads to them uh

383
00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:14.969
distrusting science.

384
00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:17.729
Well, we have to learn to live with that.

385
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.709
We have to accept it. And unfortunately, The way,

386
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.520
sometimes the way science is portrayed in the public

387
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.250
sphere gives a sense of, you know, absolute knowledge,

388
00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:31.359
definitive knowledge. And there are people who use the

389
00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:35.869
word science or scientific to uh describe something as

390
00:23:35.869 --> 00:23:39.430
authoritative as certain. And of course, there are many

391
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.449
things we are certain about, but there are also

392
00:23:42.449 --> 00:23:45.790
things that we do not know because uncertainty is

393
00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.150
inherent in science. And as we explained with a

394
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:53.229
colleague in another book uh uh about uncertainty, it

395
00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:58.069
actually makes science advance because the more we do

396
00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:00.709
not know, the more questions we ask, and the

397
00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:04.750
more we end up understanding. This is something that

398
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.109
is not easy to accept, but whether we like

399
00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:13.189
it or not, science can offer the best possible

400
00:24:13.189 --> 00:24:17.150
answers to our scientific questions, but there will always

401
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.510
be things that we will not know.

402
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.119
So to illustrate uncertainty, tell us about it in

403
00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:30.250
the specific case of medicine and how the practice

404
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.030
of medicine is based on calculated risk.

405
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.400
Yes. We have uh epidemiological studies. We can tell

406
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.439
us a lot about how often we find one

407
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.959
or the other disease or even one or the

408
00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:48.119
other factor that causes disease, you know, exposure to

409
00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:53.619
chemicals or, you know, uh sites on. DNA associated

410
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:57.699
with diseases. And from that, we can estimate how

411
00:24:57.699 --> 00:25:01.030
likely it is for any person to develop one

412
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.430
or the other disease given their uh life habits,

413
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.589
given their family history and everything about this. But

414
00:25:08.589 --> 00:25:12.310
there's no way that we can absolutely predict what

415
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.790
would happen to one or the other individual. And

416
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.189
this is when some people get frustrated because, you

417
00:25:19.189 --> 00:25:21.530
know, we may say that a disease is very

418
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.430
rare, but when it happens to a person, it's

419
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.630
1, 100% for them, and that's difficult to deal

420
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.829
with. So a big issue is to make the

421
00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:34.989
distinction between the statistics, the epidemiological data, and what

422
00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:37.729
happens to each individual. And we need to understand

423
00:25:37.729 --> 00:25:40.510
that we can make inferences from the former about

424
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.040
the latter, but we cannot be certain. The other

425
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.500
thing has to do with the medical interventions and

426
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.859
I use the uh the concept of calculating the

427
00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:54.170
risk in the story of uh polio because when

428
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:57.369
they made the, the clinical trials in the 50s,

429
00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:59.739
they knew that there might be problems. They were

430
00:25:59.739 --> 00:26:02.810
not entirely certain about the vaccine. But at the

431
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.569
same time, the parents were so concerned about protecting

432
00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:08.800
their children, and I have to know that polio

433
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.969
was not the most deadly disease, but it affected

434
00:26:11.969 --> 00:26:16.250
children and it left them sometimes with difficult problems

435
00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:20.010
uh to deal with. That they decided, you know,

436
00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:22.930
to take the risk and vaccinate them in order

437
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.849
to refrain from having the disease. And in that

438
00:26:25.849 --> 00:26:32.280
case, they estimated that Things might or might not

439
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.949
go wrong and they decided to take the risk.

440
00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:38.199
And because the protocol they followed at the time

441
00:26:38.199 --> 00:26:41.229
was very, very good and they followed it carefully,

442
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.369
there were practically no problems. Unfortunately, when the government

443
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.560
took the, over the vaccine production on a larger

444
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.520
scale, things were not go very well and there

445
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.079
were people who developed disease because of the vaccine.

446
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.270
So the notion of calculated risk is that we

447
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.500
can estimate up to a point and sometimes very,

448
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.270
very, with a smaller march of error, uh what

449
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.150
could happen, but we can never be 100% sure.

450
00:27:13.469 --> 00:27:16.209
So, you just told us about the example of

451
00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:20.930
polio. Tell us also about uncertainty and risk in

452
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.689
the case of cancer. How do, how do doctors

453
00:27:24.689 --> 00:27:30.689
and medical researchers deal with uncertainty and risk in

454
00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:31.189
cancer?

455
00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:34.535
Yeah. First of all, cancer is not one disease.

456
00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:37.974
It's a collection of diseases that have to do,

457
00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:42.334
have this some similar features, but depending on the

458
00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:46.685
organs that are affected, you know, uh, treatment, uh,

459
00:27:46.694 --> 00:27:51.574
interventions, prediction can be very different. So, what we

460
00:27:51.574 --> 00:27:54.484
know in general is that people that have a

461
00:27:54.484 --> 00:28:00.609
family history uh of cancer are more likely. To

462
00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:03.780
develop it and should be more careful. And this

463
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.020
is not necessarily hereditary because, you know, there are

464
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.140
families that may be exposed to the same factory

465
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.099
in their environment and that and had developed cancer

466
00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:17.579
because of that. The point is that the family

467
00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:20.859
history can give us a good sense. Uh, TO,

468
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.469
you know, be on alert and, uh, try to

469
00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:27.829
help people avoid that. But of course, there are

470
00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:31.459
people who develop cancer without having any family history,

471
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.670
and this has to do with the specific environments

472
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.380
and the specific exposures that they had. And most

473
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.819
importantly, with the fact that we do not really

474
00:28:41.819 --> 00:28:45.219
know what is the cause of cancer. Sometimes they

475
00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:47.810
say that they are mutations, but in recent years,

476
00:28:47.939 --> 00:28:50.260
we have come to understand that the mutations are

477
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.619
not the cause, are perhaps the effect of uh

478
00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:58.219
problems in cellular interactions. So, all in all, because

479
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:00.420
in most cases, we do not really know the

480
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.060
exact cause even though there are cancers that are

481
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.780
due to specific mutations that we have identified. Uh,

482
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:12.709
WE cannot really do much except, uh, recommending clinical,

483
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:18.010
uh, examinations, clinical exams at, at particular ages in

484
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.920
order to avoid uh this as much as possible.

485
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.239
Why is it important for people to trust the

486
00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:30.640
experts and to what extent should they trust them?

487
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.579
It is important because the experts are those who

488
00:29:34.579 --> 00:29:38.900
know. And it is important to note that any

489
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.979
scientist can be an expert in very, very few

490
00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:46.290
domains and not in anything about science. So, even

491
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.930
though um I wrote a book about vaccines and

492
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.530
trust in science, I'm not an expert in vaccines

493
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.569
and I'm not the one to consult when a

494
00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:57.689
person has a question about vaccines. They are experts

495
00:29:57.689 --> 00:30:01.290
in vaccinology, pediatricians who have worked on that for

496
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.599
years, and they are the ones to consider. And

497
00:30:04.599 --> 00:30:07.089
of course, these people have no expertise in climate

498
00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:09.770
science, for which we have other people who are

499
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.750
working on that. So all in all, what we

500
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.020
need to do is to be able to identify

501
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.469
who are these people who really know what they're

502
00:30:19.469 --> 00:30:22.670
talking about. And luckily, this is something that can

503
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:27.150
be done because for each topic, there are specific

504
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.854
communities, scientific communities of experts who have a collective

505
00:30:31.854 --> 00:30:35.844
knowledge about uh a topic and this is who

506
00:30:35.844 --> 00:30:41.104
we should trust, not individual scientists, but the, the

507
00:30:41.104 --> 00:30:44.515
scientific community uh related to the topic as a

508
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:48.494
whole and their collective knowledge because all of them

509
00:30:48.895 --> 00:30:53.780
together, they filter. The evidence that is there, they

510
00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.530
discuss and they arrive at conclusions which I think

511
00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.099
we should trust because this is the best knowledge

512
00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:00.810
we can have.

513
00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:07.310
Right. But when it comes to identifying the experts,

514
00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:12.510
people should trust, how can lay people determine who

515
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.319
are the real experts when it comes to particular

516
00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:17.000
claims?

517
00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:19.989
Well, this is not really easy to do, but

518
00:31:20.469 --> 00:31:24.239
People at least should be aware that in each

519
00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:28.109
domain, there are people that have studies, uh, and

520
00:31:28.109 --> 00:31:32.750
have uh experience and have worked on specific topics

521
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:36.420
for years and have publications and are respected from

522
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:41.199
their peers. So all in all, people could be

523
00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:44.280
able to identify who are the experts in each

524
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.229
domain. And of course, the experts know one another

525
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.680
and they can tell us that. But exactly because

526
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.239
this is difficult to do, it is easier for

527
00:31:54.239 --> 00:31:57.954
people to trust the respective societies, the respect. Communities.

528
00:31:58.244 --> 00:32:01.805
So, for instance, if the American Cancer Society or

529
00:32:01.805 --> 00:32:05.354
the European Cancer Society or any other such society

530
00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:09.685
makes uh a statement about something, we should know

531
00:32:09.685 --> 00:32:13.805
that this comes from the consensus of the people

532
00:32:13.805 --> 00:32:16.885
involved in this society who are all experts. And

533
00:32:16.885 --> 00:32:20.285
this is what we should prioritize and not the

534
00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:23.405
view of an individual, even if that individual is

535
00:32:23.405 --> 00:32:26.045
an expert, uh who has a different view.

536
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:33.969
But when experts disagree, which sometimes happen, who should

537
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:34.719
people

538
00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:39.290
trust? If it is about individuals, we should look

539
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.209
at who these individuals are. But uh we should

540
00:32:43.209 --> 00:32:46.810
also see where these individuals belong. And for instance,

541
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.969
if we have an individual that represents the consensus

542
00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:56.060
view, who represents a scientific community against someone who

543
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.089
does not, then it is more uh rational to

544
00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:03.920
trust the person who represents the community and express

545
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.609
the consensus view. Now, having said that, in the

546
00:33:07.609 --> 00:33:10.849
history of science, we have had many macro scientists

547
00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:14.729
who opened new ways uh and changed what we

548
00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:18.280
what we know and how we understand it because

549
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.250
they had insights that the community did not have

550
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.229
and the community sometimes was very resistant. Of course,

551
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.680
this is the case, but this is less likely

552
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.040
to happen than the opposite. So in the case

553
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.479
that we have such a scientist who is a

554
00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.560
brilliant person and who sees what the community cannot

555
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.160
see, we could look at, you know, who this

556
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.079
person is. Is that person really an expert? And

557
00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:46.560
what the others say about his, her views. For

558
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.209
instance, if the views of that person have undergone

559
00:33:49.369 --> 00:33:52.969
Peer review and are published in an acceptable uh

560
00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:56.329
venue, a general, for instance, then we should carefully

561
00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:59.619
consider that. And there will be times when the

562
00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:02.959
scientific community for some time would not have made

563
00:34:02.959 --> 00:34:05.650
a definite decision as it was the case during

564
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.409
the pandemic, but in the end, there will be

565
00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.770
a consensus, we will arrive in the consensus. But

566
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.909
this is less likely to happen or at least

567
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:18.208
it happens less often than the other way around.

568
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:25.360
Uh, IN what circumstances should people hold a skeptic

569
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.639
attitude towards certain scientific claims? I mean, when is

570
00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.958
it warranted?

571
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.699
First of all, being skeptical is a healthy attitude

572
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:39.418
towards science and it is healthy attitude among scientists.

573
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.060
All scientists should be skeptical until we examine the,

574
00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.820
the relevant evidence and, you know, decide whether it

575
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.129
stands or the claim stands or not. But when

576
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:59.469
we see um Different claims. We should look at

577
00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:02.070
who is the expert. And when there's a new

578
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.750
claim about something that we have not seen, then

579
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.750
we should, we should try to see what is

580
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.629
the consensus view about that. So, in the book,

581
00:35:10.669 --> 00:35:14.310
I have a diagram that guides people to think

582
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.550
about this and make decisions, which I hope it

583
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.479
will be it will prove useful. It's not always

584
00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:24.810
easy, but there's specific elements that we should consider

585
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.919
that more or less relate to the expertise of

586
00:35:27.919 --> 00:35:31.000
the person and how far that person is from

587
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.320
the consensus view. This is a guide that can

588
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.919
help us better understand what the, what is happening.

589
00:35:39.459 --> 00:35:44.179
Uh, BUT what is the difference between being reasonably

590
00:35:44.179 --> 00:35:49.159
skeptic of certain claims and being a science denier?

591
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.459
Because I think that many times, uh, the difference

592
00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:55.250
is not very clear.

593
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.094
Yes, science deniers are. People, luckily, very few, uh,

594
00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:04.084
who make, of course, a lot of noise, uh,

595
00:36:04.094 --> 00:36:09.804
who think that in principle, scientists, uh, conspire to,

596
00:36:10.014 --> 00:36:12.534
you know, hide the truth, not let us know

597
00:36:12.534 --> 00:36:15.375
what is happening. They have bad intentions and all

598
00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:18.814
that. Uh, THERE'S not much we can do about

599
00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:21.254
these people. Of course, an interesting question to ask

600
00:36:21.254 --> 00:36:24.254
is, you know, what would these people like to

601
00:36:24.254 --> 00:36:27.750
see in order to change their mind? But I'm

602
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.750
more concerned about people who distrust science, people who

603
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.669
do not know what to think about science because

604
00:36:35.669 --> 00:36:38.870
they cannot really handle uh what is happening and

605
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.169
this is what we should pay attention to. I'm

606
00:36:42.169 --> 00:36:45.070
the first to say that no one should blindly

607
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:50.340
trust scientists. People should have the means to understand,

608
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.070
as a colleague described things to be informed outsiders

609
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.429
and understand what is happening to the extent that

610
00:36:56.429 --> 00:37:00.169
they can. And here comes the responsibility of the

611
00:37:00.169 --> 00:37:03.989
experts and of the scientific communities to make things

612
00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:07.580
as clear as possible uh to lay people. Uh,

613
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.449
SCIENTISTS have a real important responsibility to explain things

614
00:37:11.449 --> 00:37:14.060
to the public, in part because it is the

615
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.419
public through taxes that funds research in, in many

616
00:37:17.419 --> 00:37:20.739
cases, but also they have a moral responsibility because

617
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.820
if they do not do it, then someone else

618
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.090
might and might take things to a different direction.

619
00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:27.510
Mhm.

620
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:34.350
So we've already talked about how certain questions uh

621
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.510
have to deal more with philosophy than science. So

622
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.989
let me ask you now, what is the relationship

623
00:37:41.989 --> 00:37:44.340
between science and policy?

624
00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:52.300
There are specific disciplines in science that have an

625
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.050
impact on policy decisions. Climate change, climate science is

626
00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:01.489
one, vaccine science is another. Uh, THESE are scientific

627
00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:05.010
domains that inform political decisions, you know, what to

628
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.610
do about emissions in the first case, whether or

629
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.489
not to vaccinate people on the other. And this

630
00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:14.514
is where things get difficult and nobody or almost

631
00:38:14.514 --> 00:38:18.475
no one worries about quantum mechanics or cell biology

632
00:38:18.475 --> 00:38:21.314
because this may not be perceived to have a

633
00:38:21.314 --> 00:38:24.114
direct impact on our everyday life. But when it

634
00:38:24.114 --> 00:38:26.915
comes to climate science or vaccines, for instance, these

635
00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:30.074
do have an impact and this do uh affect

636
00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:33.715
the decisions made. And this is where people mostly

637
00:38:33.715 --> 00:38:38.179
react to. People are mostly concerned about the scientific

638
00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:40.979
knowledge that has an impact on everyday life and

639
00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:43.090
they are right to do so. And this is

640
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.489
exactly the science. I call it in the book,

641
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:50.090
Policy Science, science related to policy that we need,

642
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.780
uh, that the experts need to clearly explain to

643
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.260
laypeople.

644
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.520
Uh, BUT I mean, it's not the case that

645
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.439
when it comes to policy, we can derive, uh,

646
00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:09.209
the proper policies that we should adopt, uh, directly

647
00:39:09.209 --> 00:39:12.409
from science or from science, or we can determine

648
00:39:12.409 --> 00:39:14.120
them from science alone.

649
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.189
No. This is not, this can never be the

650
00:39:16.189 --> 00:39:20.050
case because there are always other factors to consider.

651
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.389
Let me give you an example. If during the

652
00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:25.830
first month of the pandemic, uh for you, that

653
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:30.469
was March 2020, all of us stayed inside our

654
00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:33.560
houses for two weeks, there would be no pandemic.

655
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.899
But it was practically impossible for everyone to stay

656
00:39:37.899 --> 00:39:42.510
inside. And uh we know what happened uh next.

657
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.600
So scientists, of course, recommending measures like, you know,

658
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.399
public, uh distancing and things like that, masks and

659
00:39:51.399 --> 00:39:55.199
all these things because we know that they can

660
00:39:55.199 --> 00:40:01.080
work, but the decisions made had or to also

661
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.770
consider, for instance, the economy. Or the mental health

662
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.479
of people. And this is why different countries um

663
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.330
made different decisions about uh the the measures they

664
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.550
took. With different results that we can now analyze

665
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.689
and understand. But there is no way that these

666
00:40:18.689 --> 00:40:22.169
decisions could have been made only on the basis

667
00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:25.760
of science because science might say, yes, if we

668
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.760
avoid contact, this will end, but people had to

669
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.350
earn their living and people had to work and

670
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:36.409
get uh they needed. So this was never that

671
00:40:36.409 --> 00:40:39.879
simple. And this is, this could have never been

672
00:40:39.879 --> 00:40:43.209
a decision that scientists alone could have made. The

673
00:40:43.209 --> 00:40:46.439
politicians make these decisions and they have to consider

674
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.489
different kinds of aspects, different kinds of factors. And

675
00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:51.929
this is what they did with more or less

676
00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:53.570
success depending on the country.

677
00:40:55.169 --> 00:40:59.129
So tell us about the case of eugenics from

678
00:40:59.129 --> 00:41:04.209
the last century. Was its implementation based on any

679
00:41:04.209 --> 00:41:06.879
solid science and evidence?

680
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.370
Yeah, well, this is an example of where, you

681
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:14.314
know, uh political decisions. CAN be made on sciences

682
00:41:14.314 --> 00:41:17.995
that is not solid. The sad fact is that

683
00:41:17.995 --> 00:41:24.034
until the late 1920s, most geneticists accepted the premises

684
00:41:24.034 --> 00:41:27.554
and the assumptions of eugenics, even though the evidence

685
00:41:27.554 --> 00:41:31.754
was not that strong. But for different reasons, people

686
00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:36.100
were convinced that we could improve. Uh OUR species,

687
00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:40.889
our societies with this. Along the way, they started

688
00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:43.459
to understand that this does not really work and

689
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:48.600
in the 30s, many started to react. But unfortunately,

690
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.750
it was too late for the people who were

691
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.699
sterilized in many countries and this happened even after

692
00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:58.270
uh the Second World War until the 70s in

693
00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.629
some countries. And later on in Nazi Germany, with

694
00:42:02.629 --> 00:42:08.300
uh the extreme application of these uh measures uh

695
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:14.219
to those who were considered unworthy of life. Um

696
00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:18.590
In retrospect, we know that there was really no

697
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.139
evidence, but at the time, it was a problem,

698
00:42:22.469 --> 00:42:27.070
especially in the beginnings, that most scientists would agree

699
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.939
that eugenics was something that we could rely on

700
00:42:31.939 --> 00:42:34.580
and that we could trust. And this, of course,

701
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.909
poses a question, well, here's a case where the

702
00:42:37.909 --> 00:42:41.750
community agreed, people might have trusted them and look

703
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.520
at the results. Well, this is the case, but

704
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.639
it wasn't the case for too long because at

705
00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:54.320
some point, there were reactions uh that made most

706
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.719
of them change their minds, you know, within a

707
00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:59.360
decade or so. A decade, of course, is a

708
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.159
lot, but then, We should note that it's not

709
00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:08.610
only about the scientists themselves. Policy decisions were different

710
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.080
in different countries. For instance, in Britain, there were

711
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.679
never any eugenics policies about sterilization. Uh, THEY tried

712
00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:20.879
to isolate what the people they considered feeble-minded, and

713
00:43:20.879 --> 00:43:22.879
this is the country where it all began, but

714
00:43:22.879 --> 00:43:25.239
they were never sterilizations to the extent that they

715
00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:27.719
were made, for instance, in the United States. So

716
00:43:27.719 --> 00:43:31.030
once again, it is the political decisions that are

717
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.699
important. And not only the scientific view.

718
00:43:35.489 --> 00:43:40.120
So we've already talked earlier about uncertainty, for example,

719
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:44.929
more broadly, what are the limitations of science that

720
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:46.760
people should keep in mind?

721
00:43:47.899 --> 00:43:52.500
Well, science is a human activity, we as humans,

722
00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:56.659
we're limited in many respects in our perception, our

723
00:43:56.659 --> 00:44:00.419
understanding. So, uh it has the limitations that any

724
00:44:00.419 --> 00:44:03.979
human activity can have. Of course, things change, the

725
00:44:03.979 --> 00:44:08.090
instruments we use improve our understanding of nature improves,

726
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.100
but we should not expect from science to give

727
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.729
us definitive answers about everything. There are many topics

728
00:44:17.729 --> 00:44:20.770
that we understand and know very well and they

729
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.649
are unlikely to change, but there are also things

730
00:44:23.649 --> 00:44:28.090
that are under development where our knowledge is less

731
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:32.260
certain. What we lay people should keep in mind

732
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:38.629
is that science gives the best rational answers to

733
00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:41.300
these questions. It is the best we can have

734
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.399
and we need to learn to live with that.

735
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.110
So one final question then, what do you think

736
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:53.790
should be taught in schools about science to improve

737
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.110
the ways people think about and deal with the

738
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.120
scientifically?

739
00:45:00.199 --> 00:45:02.560
All these that we have been discussing for the

740
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.330
last 45 minutes, all these aspects of science, all

741
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.239
these features of science that are not discussed so

742
00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:16.159
that students as future citizens end up having reasonable

743
00:45:16.159 --> 00:45:21.155
and rational expectations from the sci. COMMUNITIES. Students should

744
00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:24.314
be taught how to figure out who is the

745
00:45:24.314 --> 00:45:29.395
expert. They should understand that skepticism, healthy skepticism is

746
00:45:29.395 --> 00:45:32.635
very natural to have in science. They need to

747
00:45:32.635 --> 00:45:35.995
understand that science relies on solid knowledges that comes

748
00:45:35.995 --> 00:45:41.514
out from independent testing and different uh approaches to

749
00:45:41.514 --> 00:45:43.995
the same question, and that in the end, it

750
00:45:43.995 --> 00:45:46.594
is the consensus view of the community that we

751
00:45:46.594 --> 00:45:48.625
should trust more than anything else.

752
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.229
Great. So, the book is again interesting Science, why

753
00:45:54.229 --> 00:45:58.719
we needed to reconsider School Science Teaching. I'm leaving

754
00:45:58.719 --> 00:46:01.000
a link to it in the description of the

755
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.679
interview. And Doctor Kempoakis, just before we go, apart

756
00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:07.760
from the book, would you like to tell us

757
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.919
where people can find your work on the internet?

758
00:46:11.229 --> 00:46:15.000
Yes, I have a personal page with uh on

759
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.010
based on the name based on my surname, Camps.com,

760
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.439
where all the information about uh my books and

761
00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:22.590
my work is available.

762
00:46:23.879 --> 00:46:26.889
