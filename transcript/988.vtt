00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.859
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.550
Decent. I'm your host, Ricard Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.600
joined by Doctor Iris Mouse. She is professor in

4
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.649
the Department of Psychology at the University of California

5
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.450
Berkeley. Her research focuses on emotions and emotion regulation

6
00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:20.180
with an emphasis on their links to psychological and

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.809
physical health. And today we're going to talk about

8
00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:28.440
emotion, emotion regulation and some other related things like

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.819
reappraisal emotion goals and also the potential psychological effects

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.360
of us focusing too much on happiness. So, Doctor

11
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.270
Mouse, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

12
00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.770
everyone.

13
00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.790
Thank you so much for having me.

14
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.069
So I mean, uh about emotion, what is emotion

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.619
exactly? I, I mean, because I would imagine that

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.090
uh in different scientific disciplines, people would approach emotion

17
00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.580
in at least slightly different ways. So, in your

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.739
work, how do you approach it? And what is

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.190
basically perhaps the role and the importance of emotion

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.459
for our overall psychology,

21
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.629
let's say you hit on a, in a very

22
00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.349
understated way you hit on one of the biggest

23
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.300
debates in in the field actually. Um AND so

24
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.930
saying that there's slightly different approaches is little bit

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.989
of an understatement. Um But so the simple answer

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.550
to your question, what is an emotion is that

27
00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:39.449
um I define emotions as responses um that are

28
00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.099
um valuated in nature. So, have a good versus

29
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.809
bad um component um that are in response to

30
00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.160
internal or external stimuli. Um And um I consider

31
00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:59.169
emotions as involving um the whole human. So there's

32
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.330
experiences behaviors and physiological aspects to an emotional response

33
00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:10.639
um that tend to be at least um loosely

34
00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.119
coupled with one another. Um So, um that's how

35
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.729
I think of emotions. So I alluded to there's

36
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.490
um big divergences across researchers about exactly the nature

37
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.610
of emotional response. Um And the nature of how

38
00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:35.350
the various emotional components relate to one another. But

39
00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.929
I find this a good starting point. Um Yeah.

40
00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.059
Uh AND so, uh about the second part of

41
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.759
my question and when it comes to our overall

42
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.589
psychology, what would you say is the importance of

43
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.630
emotions? What is the role that emotions play there?

44
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.440
And particularly since we're going to focus a lot

45
00:02:55.449 --> 00:03:01.039
on psychological and physical health, I mean, basically, how

46
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.479
important are emotions in that regard?

47
00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:09.470
Yeah. So I think emotions are absolutely essential um

48
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:15.619
to all aspects of health, um psychological, physical health.

49
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.630
Um And um really, if we think about um

50
00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:27.149
emotions, um they're so integral to all aspects of

51
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.660
human functioning and human psychology, I sometimes sort of

52
00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.380
in my courses challenge students to think of any

53
00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.785
time when they experience uh no emotion at all.

54
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:45.335
Um And so, obviously, we can think of times

55
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:50.104
when we're not very emotional. Um But um I,

56
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:53.104
I think that um it's hard to think of

57
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.664
times when we have absolutely no emotion at all.

58
00:03:56.675 --> 00:04:01.470
Um And then of course, many of life's biggest

59
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:06.940
and most consequential events um are characterized by an

60
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:13.710
abundance um sometimes overabundance of um rich um emotional

61
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.959
experiences. Um So, in a way, I think emotions

62
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.500
are absolutely integral to um psychological and physical health.

63
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.480
Um AND all of human um psychology, and it's

64
00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:33.559
interesting actually that in a way psychology has little

65
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.899
bit ignored emotion um more so than other aspects

66
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.220
of psychology. So, cognition has been in the field

67
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.730
um topic of research um for um longer um

68
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.989
in modern empirical psychology. Here comes the cat. Um

69
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.760
And um we can talk about maybe why that

70
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.339
is. Um BUT it has changed. So in the

71
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.589
last 1020 years, uh emotions have uh very much

72
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.739
so become um a topic of research interest appropriately.

73
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.279
So, um and um there's been a recent paper

74
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.230
even that has sort of described what they call

75
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.130
the rise of activism in um psychology,

76
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:27.910
which is actually very interesting because I mean, at

77
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.940
least by now, I, isn't it? I mean, I,

78
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.779
I perhaps consensually is too strong a word to

79
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.510
use here, to use it to use here. Sorry.

80
00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.089
But isn't it the case that by now? We,

81
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.549
we've already sort of established that there's no strict

82
00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:49.450
division between emotion and cognition or emotion and reason

83
00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:53.489
because we actually need emotion to even be able

84
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.890
to reason.

85
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.220
Hm. Yeah. So I think there's kind of two

86
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.149
really interesting parts to, to that statement one way

87
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.730
is that I think, and that's maybe the simpler

88
00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:11.850
way to think about that um distinction between cognition

89
00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:14.980
and emotion. And that's the idea that they mutually

90
00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:20.204
constitute one another. So, um in other words, how

91
00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:24.424
we think directly shapes how we feel and how

92
00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.704
we feel directly shapes how we think. Um So

93
00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:31.665
there's a mutual interdependence if you will and they're

94
00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:35.605
very much so intertwined. But in that way of

95
00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:40.815
thinking, we can still distinguish between uh more cognitive

96
00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:45.579
and more emotional processes. Um But there's a second

97
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.619
way um that's less straightforward of thinking about that

98
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.459
distinction. And that basically sort of says, um you

99
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.130
basically wanna do away with the distinction such that

100
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.549
um responses that we call emotional in nature really

101
00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:10.630
um generalize um processes that we sometimes call cognitive

102
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.670
um and apply them to um um to how

103
00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:19.529
humans respond. And so, for example, Lisa Feldman Barrett

104
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.570
is a researcher who I think has advanced a

105
00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:27.489
model that's more aligned with that way of thinking

106
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.769
um or by basically general processes um constitute both

107
00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:40.750
emotional and cognitive responses. Um In my research, I

108
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.769
still um find it useful um to, to make

109
00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.890
the and maintain a distinction, at least in principle

110
00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:56.230
between more cognitive um appraisal processes thinking um versus

111
00:07:56.239 --> 00:08:01.600
more emotional um processes. Um And um yeah, I

112
00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:04.579
find it helpful. Um And also I think there's

113
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:10.010
some um grounding and in empirical science to um

114
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.019
distinguish those types of processes, even if we say,

115
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:16.760
say that they're very much so intertwined with one

116
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:17.359
another.

117
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.320
OK. And why do you think that at least

118
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:27.470
historically, people have focused more on cognition than emotion?

119
00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:33.119
Um That's a great question. Um I'm not a

120
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:38.000
historian of science. Um But I think there's um

121
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.558
one answer to that question is just that it

122
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.799
has been in, in incredibly difficult to do empirical

123
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:51.020
science on emotions. And so I think uh quite

124
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.780
frankly, researchers um were um unsure about how we

125
00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:03.559
could even study um these um very ephemeral processes

126
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.630
um of the mind. Um And um sort of

127
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.299
simply were hesitant, hesitant to, to do so until

128
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:15.130
um I think William James was sort of an

129
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.229
early precursor on sort of at least a talking

130
00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:24.900
in a principled and um at least in principle

131
00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:30.840
um empirically accessible way about um feelings and emotions.

132
00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:35.979
Um And then, um of course, um Sylvan Tomkins

133
00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:39.479
and Paul Ekman, starting in the fifties and the

134
00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:44.549
sixties, um 19 fifties, 19 sixties um um put

135
00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:47.919
emotion signs out on the map. They were the

136
00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:54.619
first ones to really start conducting um empirical work

137
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.099
as we understand it today um on emotions. And

138
00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:02.080
that I think started little bit of a, it,

139
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.900
it sort of opened the floodgates, I think because

140
00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:08.489
they were the ones to sort of step up.

141
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.820
And of course, their work drew a lot of

142
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.289
criticism. But I think it was really important to

143
00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:16.929
just show that you can, you have to get

144
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.130
started somewhere even if it's a really simplified first

145
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.570
approach. Um And so that, that I think really

146
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.530
analyzed the field into starting somewhere and then going

147
00:10:31.539 --> 00:10:35.049
from there. Um And today we ended up with

148
00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:40.599
just a immensely rich um body of research. Yeah.

149
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.500
And, and I, I mean, yeah, I, I, I'm

150
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.289
not sure if this uh has played a big

151
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:51.090
role or not, but I would imagine that also,

152
00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:54.869
at least in our Western tradition, I mean, people

153
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.479
have been looking down for a long time on

154
00:10:57.489 --> 00:11:02.200
emotions. I mean, it's basically about uh reason and

155
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.119
about being reasonable and about taming your emotions and

156
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.695
ideally donating them because I mean, apparently people thought

157
00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:13.765
that if you could do that, you would reason

158
00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:16.734
even better, even though we now know that you

159
00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:20.924
can't even reason without emotions. But anyway, at least

160
00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:25.375
there's some legacy of that kind of thinking about

161
00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:27.354
uh emotions, I guess.

162
00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:31.234
Yeah. And so, and that very much so um

163
00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:35.919
um reappears in the research today. Um And I'm

164
00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:39.729
sure we'll talk about that um later. Um But

165
00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:43.320
that distinction between reason and emotion, of course, goes

166
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.679
back a long time. There's the platonic ideas about

167
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:53.840
sort of, um, human passions, um, hijacking human reason.

168
00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:59.116
And ideally we should be guided by mostly reason

169
00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:02.145
and not so much the passions. Um, OF course,

170
00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:07.156
there's a Aristotelian view that's different from that and

171
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:12.296
that doesn't sort of see emotions as just negative,

172
00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:17.476
um, harmful animal like, but rather, um, thinks about

173
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:21.185
emotions, I think in a much more, um, in

174
00:12:21.216 --> 00:12:24.122
a, that's much more aligned with modern thinking about

175
00:12:24.132 --> 00:12:29.512
emotions. And so Aristotle um proposed something that's um

176
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:33.312
more aligned to sort of like feeling, um the

177
00:12:33.322 --> 00:12:38.182
right amount of an emotion in the right way

178
00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:42.552
and to the right extent as being um conducive

179
00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:46.700
to, to the good life. Um So it's a

180
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.559
view of emotions that's not so starkly negative animal

181
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:58.119
like um and um rather, like, we do have

182
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.869
to modulate emotions as the view, but we can

183
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.929
still use them and they're very important um for

184
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.784
uh for making decisions and conducting in our life

185
00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:13.794
in a way that's uh virtuous and, and a

186
00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:18.945
good life. Um And that view reappeared of course,

187
00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:23.104
in various different shapes and forms. Um So, hume,

188
00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:29.090
for example, arguing, um that um um reason is

189
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:33.190
and ought to be um the servant of the

190
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.590
passions. Um And so, um there's another sort of

191
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:41.989
historical view of emotions is really integral to making

192
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.559
good decisions. Um But I think your starting point

193
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.590
is really well taken that at the early part

194
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:56.099
of the 20th century, there was a really negative

195
00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:59.479
view that was, uh, in part, sort of like

196
00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:05.119
Freudian psychoanalytic, right. That saw emotions as the source

197
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.919
of, um, all, many, the most horrible things about

198
00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:15.960
humans aggression, um, destructive impulses, the, the, the aid

199
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:20.789
basically being the seat of emotions. Um, AND I

200
00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:23.909
think actually you're absolutely right that, that sort of

201
00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:31.030
fed into, hesitant to, to study these bad things

202
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.820
and when people study them, they studied them as

203
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.989
something to be controlled and how we sort of

204
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.590
can get rid of them. Yeah. Um, I think

205
00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:46.539
that's a really interesting observation. Um, CAN I make

206
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.400
one more point about this? Yes,

207
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:48.929
of course.

208
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.609
And one of the most, I think it's like,

209
00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:55.210
just the fascinating observation, sort of like how people

210
00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:59.260
think at the most fundamental level about emotions, like,

211
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:05.369
are emotions good or are they bad? Um, AND,

212
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.049
um, uh, we've actually started to study how, um,

213
00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:15.570
lay people think about, uh, emotions, um, sort of

214
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.479
like, akin to these philosophical debates. Most lay people

215
00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:26.150
have intuitions about emotions that are sort of like

216
00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:31.080
either of the sort of platonic flavor where they

217
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.799
think no emotions are to be feared and controlled

218
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:38.340
and these are bad things that I should get

219
00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:42.429
rid of. But then some people, lay people, not

220
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.010
philosophers, um have, um, sort of the more Aristotelian

221
00:15:48.289 --> 00:15:55.849
hume, like intuitions about emotions where they think emotions

222
00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:59.909
are to be embraced, they're important um, in our

223
00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:03.619
lives. Um, AND, um, give our lives meaning and

224
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:09.979
richness. Um, AND, um, that extends to unpleasant emotions.

225
00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:13.770
Um, YEAH. So there's a really interesting parallel to

226
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.780
that philosophical, um, debate and how lay people think

227
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:20.020
about emotions.

228
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.130
So, when it comes to classifying emotions in terms

229
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.349
of them being good or bad, we're talking about

230
00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:32.119
violence here. Right. That's usually the term that psychologists

231
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.340
use or not.

232
00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:37.219
Yeah. So that's very interesting. Um, AND I would

233
00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:41.830
say no. Um, SO, um, and I should check

234
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.320
my own. I think there's a habit of doing

235
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.520
that and I myself have that habit and I

236
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:53.130
should check myself because, um, um, we can up

237
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.159
so one of the most basic ways in which

238
00:16:57.169 --> 00:17:02.159
we differentiate uh among different emotions is by valence.

239
00:17:02.609 --> 00:17:08.790
Um And um there's emotions that feel good, pleasant,

240
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.989
like joy, um, hope, love, um, excitement, um, peace,

241
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.589
calm. Um And there's emotions that, um, feel unpleasant,

242
00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:28.520
um, anger, sadness, despair, fear and so forth. Um

243
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.939
And sometimes we jump to the conclusion that pleasant

244
00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:37.689
emotions are those that are good and those that

245
00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:41.199
we should strive for and we assume that all

246
00:17:41.209 --> 00:17:49.270
people want to feel pleasant, emotions and conversely unpleasant

247
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.630
emotions are those that are bad that people want

248
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.489
to avoid, uh and that are harmful, but it

249
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:03.250
turns out that, um, that mapping doesn't, um mm

250
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.030
uh isn't completely accurate um, with regard to what

251
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.979
emotions people want to feel and also what emotions

252
00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:17.280
people um should want to feel. Um, SO, um,

253
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.170
Maya Tamir who's a, um, psychologist, um, at the

254
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:27.890
Hebrew University, um, has studied, um, the cases, um,

255
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.069
really in depth, um, where, um, the exact opposite

256
00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:35.540
is true and sometimes those are the most interesting,

257
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.449
um, cases where people, um, pursue what's called contra

258
00:18:40.689 --> 00:18:46.285
hedonic. They, uh, my cat is especially active. He

259
00:18:46.295 --> 00:18:51.555
loves the topic. Um, SO, um, uh, basically, um,

260
00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:57.155
sometimes, um, more than sometimes people pursue unpleasant emotions

261
00:18:57.165 --> 00:19:00.515
and avoid pleasant emotions and that can be quite

262
00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:02.515
adaptive in people's lives.

263
00:19:03.689 --> 00:19:07.839
Ok. But, but when it comes to pursuing unpleasant

264
00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:11.869
emotions, do we know within those particular cases or

265
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.469
contexts, people still experience them as unpleasant or not?

266
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.270
Hm. Ha. That's really, so you mean when people

267
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.329
pursue unpleasant emotions, um, are they still truly unpleasant?

268
00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:35.469
Um, OR does it kind of then feel good?

269
00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:38.300
Um, LIKE, let's say, or

270
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.969
perhaps if we would ask people in those particular

271
00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:47.760
contexts, whether they fought, they had experienced a positive

272
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.589
or negative or a good or bad emotion, they

273
00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:56.209
wouldn't say it was bad even though it wasn't

274
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:59.130
pleasant. I, I mean, it's a bit confusing perhaps.

275
00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.010
But yeah, that's what I'm asking.

276
00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:06.109
It's a great question and um, many psychologists ask

277
00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:08.380
that too. And so I think there's sort of

278
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.020
two parts to this, um, one part is that

279
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:18.849
we need to distinguish um the, the phenomenology of

280
00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:24.130
the emotion, what it feels like from its consequences

281
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.989
um for my functioning for my health and so

282
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.349
forth. So, um and so when I say pleasant,

283
00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:37.670
unpleasant, I'm just referring to what it feels like.

284
00:20:37.709 --> 00:20:42.569
Um And so, uh, Maya Tamir and others research

285
00:20:42.579 --> 00:20:49.359
has established that unpleasant emotions can have um benefits.

286
00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:53.859
Um And so we might call them good for

287
00:20:53.869 --> 00:20:57.829
something else. So, for example, in research, um, with

288
00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.969
Brett Ford, they've shown that um when people, um

289
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.819
are about to sort of head into a contentious

290
00:21:05.829 --> 00:21:12.989
uh negotiation, um they um tend to um favor

291
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.959
um feeling anger over other emotions, anger being generally

292
00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:22.979
an emotion that's experienced as unpleasant. Um And they

293
00:21:22.989 --> 00:21:28.000
do so because anger has these functional benefits in

294
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.160
their lives, it makes them slightly more energetic um

295
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.099
effective negotiators. And so that's sometimes what we mean

296
00:21:36.109 --> 00:21:41.839
by good. Um WHEN we um talk about um

297
00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:48.810
uh emotions. Um SO that said, um so that's

298
00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:50.989
sort of like a simpler way of answering your

299
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.869
question, right? That we have to distinguish the various

300
00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.209
purposes that emotions serve um to talk about pleasant,

301
00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:05.829
unpleasant, good, bad and emotions serve uh hedonic purposes

302
00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:10.935
um in people's lives, generally, people want to feel

303
00:22:10.944 --> 00:22:15.354
pleasant, want not to feel unpleasant, but emotions also

304
00:22:15.364 --> 00:22:20.125
serve a bunch of other purposes. Um THAT um

305
00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:25.375
we could call instrumental purposes. Um EMOTIONS can also

306
00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:28.885
make us fit in or not fit in with

307
00:22:28.895 --> 00:22:32.614
our culture and other people that's independent of the

308
00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:38.729
valence dimension. Emotions can also help us achieve um

309
00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:43.380
performance goal like the negotiation context that I just

310
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.339
mentioned and that's also independent of, um, the hedonic

311
00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:55.000
or feeling or valence dimension. Um Now they're sort

312
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.290
of like, and there we got maybe a tiny,

313
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.170
little bit more into the weeds. Once you say

314
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.160
that emotions independent of their valence can serve these

315
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:10.290
other purposes. It's entirely possible that then there's a

316
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.489
feedback loop such that emotions truly don't just simply

317
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:21.670
feel pleasant or unpleasant because in realizing my anger

318
00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:25.550
serves a purpose in my life, I might come

319
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.920
to experience it as um less aversive, less unpleasant.

320
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.569
I sort of relish uh relish my anger almost.

321
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:39.459
And then we get into sort of states that

322
00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:44.390
are mixed feeling states. Um And we encounter those

323
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.469
like really interesting emotional states. Um WHEN we think

324
00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:54.469
about um righteous uh moral outrage, right? Where probably

325
00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:57.270
that, that has an unpleasant element to it, but

326
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.599
also an element of um pleasant, well, feeling righteous.

327
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:09.119
Um So, um that, that's sort of like, uh

328
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.810
one answer to your really interesting question, that sort

329
00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:16.790
of this very basic valence dimension isn't quite so

330
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.800
basic when we take a closer look and um

331
00:24:23.349 --> 00:24:28.459
wanting or feeling pleasant is not quite such a

332
00:24:28.469 --> 00:24:33.199
simple um pursuit. And in fact, it's not what

333
00:24:33.209 --> 00:24:37.760
most humans do um exclusively most of the time.

334
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:43.099
Yeah, actually, when you mentioned, uh uh when, how

335
00:24:43.109 --> 00:24:46.599
people sometimes went to feel angry in the context

336
00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:49.810
of negotiation? I mean, I uh it came into

337
00:24:49.819 --> 00:24:53.469
my mind, another context where I've heard many people

338
00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:56.619
saying that they want to feel angry. There is,

339
00:24:56.709 --> 00:25:01.390
for example, in a competition context, like for example,

340
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.229
in sports or particularly combat sports, I've heard many

341
00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:08.469
people saying that when, for example, in M MA

342
00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:11.270
wrestling and so on, when they are going out

343
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.750
into the rink, they really want to feel angry,

344
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.380
they don't want to feel good, they want to

345
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.250
feel angry and tense and all of that because

346
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.849
that's what drives them to really uh fight, I

347
00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:25.349
guess.

348
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.099
I think that's a great example that I've heard

349
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:34.930
a lot as well. Um And um similarly, some

350
00:25:34.939 --> 00:25:41.369
people want to, at some level, I use the

351
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.930
term broadly, worry, feel some anxiety, it serves a

352
00:25:45.939 --> 00:25:49.890
purpose in their lives. Some people want to. And

353
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.459
again, I use the term broadly feel sadness. Um

354
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:57.069
And so um absolutely

355
00:25:58.369 --> 00:26:01.900
and so to get into another topic, but also

356
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.390
a related when, what is the emotion regulation?

357
00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:12.250
Um Another actually really complicated question that sort of

358
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.540
there's a lot of division in the field about.

359
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.930
Um I like again a pretty simple definition um

360
00:26:18.939 --> 00:26:24.209
of emotion regulation as altering your emotions um in

361
00:26:24.219 --> 00:26:28.800
accordance um with a goal that can be implicit

362
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.209
or explicit.

363
00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:34.420
So, I mean, do you think that in the

364
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.650
sort of cases and contexts we were just mentioning

365
00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:41.489
uh that would count as an example. Do you

366
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.510
think that people do emotion regulation in those cases

367
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.390
or not,

368
00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:50.229
um in the cases where they um sort

369
00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:55.380
of where they are basically competing, negotiating stuff like

370
00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:55.599
that.

371
00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:02.079
Um Yes, I think so. Um So, um uh

372
00:27:02.089 --> 00:27:06.239
and it sort of like we're heading into right

373
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.000
away, sort of like one of the areas that

374
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.959
has made it difficult to um draw the line

375
00:27:13.969 --> 00:27:20.069
between what is emotion reactivity versus what is regulation

376
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:25.000
of emotion. Um Because say you mixed martial arts

377
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.930
wrestler uh might sort of pump themselves at feel,

378
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:33.189
sort of induce some level of anger. But probably

379
00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:37.349
if you ask them, they don't necessarily say, oh,

380
00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:40.339
I'm gonna regulate my emotions so that I feel

381
00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:42.869
a little bit more anger so that I can

382
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.150
whoop my adversaries as a little bit better. Um

383
00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:50.939
um But I still think so it heads into

384
00:27:50.949 --> 00:27:54.800
a really interesting sort of gray zone um where

385
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.339
emotion regulation and that's why I included the implicit

386
00:27:59.349 --> 00:28:04.750
goal idea where emotion regulation is um automatic or

387
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760
to some degree unconscious. Um So people are not

388
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.579
necessarily aware that there's a goal activated um to

389
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:18.010
regulate emotions. Um um And then you could ask,

390
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.849
well, how do we know that someone is regulating

391
00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:27.810
or simply um um emotional in a particular way

392
00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:33.069
um without um any goal to alter their um

393
00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:38.209
their emotions. Um And I think one answer is,

394
00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:42.125
um I think we don't know, um we can't,

395
00:28:42.135 --> 00:28:48.415
we don't yet have really convincing measures um of

396
00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:54.885
these implicit unconscious ways of regulating altering our emotions

397
00:28:54.895 --> 00:28:59.385
according with implicit goals. Um But we have a

398
00:28:59.395 --> 00:29:03.760
little bit of understanding that um um and at

399
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:08.390
least in principle, um the distinction again is a

400
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.829
useful one between emotional reactivity that um people differ

401
00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:20.160
on um without um um the activation of a

402
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:25.000
particular goal to alter the emotional response.

403
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.900
But if it's done implicitly, if it's sort of

404
00:29:29.949 --> 00:29:36.250
subconscious, um how do you know uh that people

405
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.869
are doing it? I mean, it must be hard.

406
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.239
Right?

407
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:45.079
Yes. So it's incredibly difficult to, and that's why

408
00:29:45.089 --> 00:29:48.770
I said, I don't think we have very guns

409
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:55.130
good evidence base for knowing um that people have

410
00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:01.599
actually engaged in unconscious or implicit emotion regulation. Um

411
00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:07.119
What we do know is that one unconscious processes

412
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:11.800
um including goal based processes play a really important

413
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:17.069
role um in psychology in general. But we also

414
00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:21.030
know is that um some of the most interesting

415
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.670
individual differences and group differences in emotion regulation seem

416
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.449
to at least um partly play out on a

417
00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:37.469
implicit um not always consciously accessible level. Um So

418
00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:45.069
just for example, there's socialization processes um that um

419
00:30:45.099 --> 00:30:49.520
sort of inculcate or teach Children um that they

420
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:55.140
can or can't regulate their emotions. Um Sometimes we,

421
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.500
we call that implicit models um of emotion.

422
00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:02.199
Could you give us an example of that, please?

423
00:31:02.959 --> 00:31:07.719
Yeah. So um uh emotions um are can be

424
00:31:07.729 --> 00:31:13.520
seen um as um either um something that's um

425
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.880
controllable, that's not super dangerous um that I can

426
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:24.280
do something about. Um And um we would um

427
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.589
ask about um this kind of, you could call

428
00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:32.410
it an implicit model or a mindset. Um BY

429
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:39.939
asking people um very straightforward, are emotions controllable in

430
00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:44.739
general. Um Can humans do something about the emotions

431
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:49.170
that they have? Um And um uh that sometimes

432
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.939
also a controllability or malleability mindset with the term,

433
00:31:54.319 --> 00:31:58.130
um The um the other end of the spectrum

434
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.030
is a, what's sometimes called a fixed uh mindset

435
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.219
or entity mindset. Uh And that's um basically the

436
00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:11.020
idea that uh emotions are very difficult uh to

437
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:19.150
control that they are overwhelming forces. Um So, the

438
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.420
reason why I brought that up as an example

439
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:28.520
of implicit emotion regulation or process that feeds into

440
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.599
implicit emotion regulation is that I think people in

441
00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:37.719
general are not always aware of the beliefs that

442
00:32:37.729 --> 00:32:43.250
they have about emotions in that way. Um So,

443
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:47.439
um and yet those beliefs have very important consequences

444
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.920
for whether and how we regulate our emotions.

445
00:32:52.589 --> 00:32:56.609
So, do these beliefs this kind that, of course,

446
00:32:56.619 --> 00:32:59.410
as you mentioned, there can stem from the way

447
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.180
we are socialized. Do they play a role in

448
00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:06.800
the degree to which we are able to regulate

449
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.920
our emotions?

450
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:16.089
Yes. So, um and that's why um they came

451
00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:21.119
up as one really important aspect of implicit or

452
00:33:21.189 --> 00:33:27.900
unconscious processes in emotion regulation. Um And um there's

453
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:34.060
um two sort of really fundamental beliefs about emotions

454
00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:37.780
that play a role here. One is, um, are

455
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.790
emotions good or bad. And we already talked about

456
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.829
that a little bit earlier. Right. And it sort

457
00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:48.790
of translates to the belief. Should people control their

458
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.790
emotions or should they not? Should they control that

459
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.810
sort of like the platonic, um, view if you

460
00:33:57.819 --> 00:34:01.290
will, um, should they not, should they be guided

461
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.849
by their emotions? That's more the, the hum, um,

462
00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:09.739
view. That's one really basic distinction. The other really

463
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:16.409
basic belief is, can people control their emotions or

464
00:34:16.418 --> 00:34:20.120
can they not um with the first being, sort

465
00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:24.449
of the view that emotions are um not so

466
00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:28.728
dangerous that they don't necessarily overwhelm us. Um And

467
00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:32.668
the second view being that emotions are these dangerous,

468
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.810
overwhelming forces that I can't necessarily control or that

469
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.270
people can't necessarily control. So the second belief is

470
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.149
the one that seems to have really important implications

471
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:52.188
for people's ability to regulate their emotions. Um And

472
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.708
it makes perfect sense because if you think about

473
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.149
it for a moment, if you don't believe that

474
00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:04.149
emotions are controllable, you're not even going to try

475
00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:08.989
to regulate them. So, um and that has been

476
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.449
borne out in the research, um such that in

477
00:35:13.459 --> 00:35:20.409
general, people with um more controllability beliefs, people who

478
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:24.489
believe that emotions can be controlled um tend to

479
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:32.250
engage in um more um uh adaptive, more effective

480
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.689
emotion regulation.

481
00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:39.989
And so, apart from this sort of um emotion

482
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.429
regulation related beliefs, what are some of the other

483
00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:51.790
factors that explain both individual and group differences in

484
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.310
emotion regulation.

485
00:35:55.409 --> 00:36:02.040
Um So, beliefs are a really important um factor

486
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:06.919
here. Um There's a bunch of other factors that

487
00:36:06.929 --> 00:36:12.260
I think play a role um that have to

488
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.840
do with how people um judge and think about

489
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.169
their emotions in general. So, and a lot of

490
00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:25.679
it has to do with um socialization processes. Um

491
00:36:25.689 --> 00:36:30.580
So, for example, um when um we think about

492
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:37.020
um should emotions um be controlled, um culture seems

493
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:40.330
to play um an important role in sort of

494
00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:46.449
setting up that particular um belief about emotions and

495
00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:52.629
downstream um consequences for emotion regulation. So two cultures

496
00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:55.610
that have been kind of often contrasted with one

497
00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:01.090
another are um East Asian um more interdependent cultures

498
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:07.320
and um uh European um or European American, more

499
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:13.179
independent cultures. Um AND generally, um um as a

500
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:18.389
function of these differences in self construal and beliefs

501
00:37:18.399 --> 00:37:21.260
about the, the nature of the self. And what

502
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:26.419
is um the role that individuals should play in

503
00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:31.570
social context? Um People differ with regard to um

504
00:37:32.129 --> 00:37:34.979
how they think um or the extent to which

505
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:38.550
they think emotions should be regulated and then emotion

506
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.689
regulation. So there's a pretty stable um pattern such

507
00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:48.870
that um East Asian interdependent cultures tend to endorse

508
00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:54.709
emotion suppression. Um MORE so than Western independent cultures

509
00:37:56.129 --> 00:37:58.830
and do, do the benefits that we get from

510
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.209
emotion regulation depend on the context. I mean, are

511
00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:08.080
there perhaps contexts where uh trying to regulate your

512
00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:14.399
emotions more might actually not be beneficial or not.

513
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.520
Yeah. Yeah. So it's a super fascinating question and

514
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.870
I think we wanna back up for a moment

515
00:38:21.879 --> 00:38:25.129
and think a little bit more about what emotional

516
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:27.870
regulation is and make a couple of distinctions that

517
00:38:27.879 --> 00:38:30.030
I think are really important when we answer that

518
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.560
question. Um So um emotion regulation is not sort

519
00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.550
of like one monolith, but people can go about

520
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.070
regulating their emotions in several different ways. Um And

521
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.879
um one of the sort of like core models

522
00:38:48.889 --> 00:38:53.600
that the field uses um to um distinguish um

523
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.419
various types of emotion regulation is based on um

524
00:38:57.459 --> 00:39:03.000
James Gross's um process model of emotion regulation. And

525
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.439
the, the, the model is actually a pretty simple

526
00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:11.070
and really useful one. And basically, idea is when

527
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.790
people have an emotion, you sort of go through

528
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.830
a process, you encounter a situation, you play, you

529
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.870
pay attention to the situation, you appraise the situation

530
00:39:25.879 --> 00:39:30.090
in a particular way and then you respond um

531
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.449
with your experience physiology and behavior to that situation.

532
00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:39.770
So that's the process of emotion now to regulate

533
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:45.669
that emotion, you can intervene or alter each of

534
00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:51.350
those four steps. So, um let's say, um somebody

535
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:57.149
is um uh anxious about giving a public speech

536
00:39:57.159 --> 00:40:02.304
or something. So, so they can change that emotion

537
00:40:02.864 --> 00:40:07.165
in by intervening at four different points. Um First,

538
00:40:07.225 --> 00:40:09.864
they can change the situation. They can say I'm

539
00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:15.020
gonna cancel this speech and voila no emotion. Um

540
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.860
Second, they can say I'm gonna change what I

541
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:21.520
pay attention to, um, big, like I could choose

542
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.580
to pay attention to the friendly, um, person who's

543
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.280
sitting in the front rather than the scowling, uh,

544
00:40:29.389 --> 00:40:32.919
skeptical people who are sitting at other places in

545
00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:36.209
the audience. Um, SO that's sort of altering my

546
00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:40.969
attention and again, it'll change my emotion. Third, I

547
00:40:40.979 --> 00:40:45.889
can change my appraisal of the situation. So, for

548
00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:51.310
example, um I could um tell myself that this

549
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.169
is sort of one event if I think about

550
00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:57.739
sort of like the history or the arc of

551
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.290
my life or the whole universe, this is just

552
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.050
like the teensiest blip and that might do away

553
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.449
with a lot of anxiety. And then, so that's

554
00:41:08.459 --> 00:41:13.760
appraisal change sometimes called reappraisal. And then fourth, um

555
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.449
we can change the emotional responses. Um And so,

556
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.850
um um focusing for a moment on um the

557
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.320
response of anxious behavior, I could just try to

558
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.850
tamp down on that behavior and keep sort of

559
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.679
like a non anxious, neutral phase rather than showing

560
00:41:36.689 --> 00:41:39.500
um that I'm sort of terrified on the inside.

561
00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:45.209
Um So that's sort of like four groups of

562
00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:51.320
emotional regulation that people often distinguish. So now, and

563
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:55.110
I needed to make that distinction because before answering

564
00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.149
your question about whether emotion regulation is kind of

565
00:42:00.159 --> 00:42:07.320
moderated or whether emotional regulations effects on health and

566
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.870
well being are moderated by the context because to

567
00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:14.750
answer that question, we first to need, we first

568
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.070
need to understand the effects of emotion regulation on

569
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.550
well being in general. Um And then we can

570
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:29.889
understand whether there are boundary conditions or context um

571
00:42:29.899 --> 00:42:35.169
moderation. So backing up, so I backed up two

572
00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:39.320
steps. Now I'm backing up what set. Um And

573
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.739
so that like we'll give you like the super

574
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:48.070
simplified answer, which is that in general, when people

575
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.330
kind of studied emotion regulation, they often they, or

576
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.139
there's a lot of research that has focused on

577
00:42:56.149 --> 00:43:01.209
reappraisal, changing our re appraisals or const controls of

578
00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:09.590
emotional situations and expressive suppression, just tamping down on

579
00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:15.000
the emotions that I show in my behavior. And

580
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:20.760
the first lines of research very generally indicated that

581
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:26.649
people who use reappraisal, especially people who use reappraisal

582
00:43:26.659 --> 00:43:30.979
very effectively tend to do better. They have greater

583
00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:36.800
well being, they have um better social relationships. Um

584
00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:40.899
There's even the hints that they have better um

585
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:46.570
um physical health um in, in some like certain

586
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:51.600
domains, in contrast, people who tend to use expressive

587
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.120
suppression, they feel something on the inside, but they

588
00:43:55.129 --> 00:43:58.459
don't show it on the outside, um tend to

589
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:04.139
be less psychologically healthy um and have less good

590
00:44:04.149 --> 00:44:08.340
social relationships. Um So, two really important domains of

591
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:12.280
well being and functioning. Um And then again, sort

592
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.659
of hints that even physical health um might be

593
00:44:16.669 --> 00:44:21.060
negatively impacted. Um So that was sort of like

594
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:26.189
the first line of findings in emotion regulation research.

595
00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:29.820
Um Now we come to finally, I come to

596
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:34.280
your question that is, well, are there context effects?

597
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:40.500
Um Are those sort of simple relationships always necessarily

598
00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:45.500
true? Um Is it the case that reappraisal is

599
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.260
good for everybody to use? And in all contexts,

600
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.159
is it the case that suppression is bad for

601
00:44:52.169 --> 00:44:55.520
everybody to use? And in all contexts and as

602
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.360
you can imagine, like for most things in life,

603
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.800
um no, they're not all good or all bad.

604
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:07.040
Um And um so there's in fact really interesting

605
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:14.300
um boundary conditions and moderators. Um And so um

606
00:45:16.389 --> 00:45:23.050
one interesting or I wanna give you two examples

607
00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.729
for um moderators, one for reappraisal and one for

608
00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:32.479
suppression um just to keep things symmetrical. Um So

609
00:45:32.919 --> 00:45:38.090
reappraisal has been shown um like I said to

610
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.370
be um beneficial in lots of different contexts for

611
00:45:41.379 --> 00:45:45.479
lots of different people. Um And actually reappraisal is

612
00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:49.929
one of the most. Um I think culturally and

613
00:45:49.939 --> 00:45:55.100
across people stable effects um that I've seen. So

614
00:45:55.159 --> 00:45:59.649
I love cultural differences and um sort of have

615
00:45:59.659 --> 00:46:03.370
looked or always interested in sort of looking at

616
00:46:03.379 --> 00:46:06.610
how things might play out differently in different cultures.

617
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.050
And I want to preface sort of what I

618
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:14.040
say about boundary conditions. Um BY saying that um

619
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:19.360
I've been actually really um struck by how stable

620
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:24.520
these benefits of reappraisal appear to be. Um So

621
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.610
recent research in my lab, for example, looked at

622
00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:34.239
um appraisal in Mexican American adolescents. Um AND it

623
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:39.739
was good um across time for anhedonia symptoms. Um

624
00:46:40.209 --> 00:46:44.139
uh WITH uh Qing Zao, we've looked at um

625
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:49.110
Chinese American immigrants and again, adolescents found that the

626
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.719
reappraisal was good for them and that sort of

627
00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:55.550
dovetails with a lot of other research. Um But

628
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.199
one particular context where um we and others have

629
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:04.389
found that reappraisal seems to hit some limits is

630
00:47:04.399 --> 00:47:10.870
um when we look in particular um types of

631
00:47:10.879 --> 00:47:17.610
um um uh situational adversity and in particular, um

632
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:24.270
more, um when people face more um controllable um

633
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:30.290
stress. Um So, um the idea is that sometimes

634
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:35.280
um it can be really good to regulate your

635
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:41.669
own emotions, make yourself feel better, feel less negative

636
00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:45.909
and more positive emotions. Um And those seem, and

637
00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:50.959
that's what reappraisal is really effective at. But sometimes,

638
00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:53.169
and this goes back to something that we talked

639
00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:57.570
about earlier. It might not be the best idea

640
00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:03.979
to tinker with your own emotions. Um But rather

641
00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:07.860
sometimes it might be a better idea to actually

642
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:12.379
alter the situation that you're in. Um And that's

643
00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:18.419
the case when you're facing a controllable, stressor or

644
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:23.540
controllable adversity, let's say you're in a fight with

645
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.469
um with your best friend. Should you then tell

646
00:48:27.479 --> 00:48:31.239
yourself, oh, it's just a blip in time. It's

647
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.199
not as bad as it looks, I'm gonna feel

648
00:48:33.209 --> 00:48:39.600
better. Um Or should you feel some of that

649
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:45.939
sadness or anger or worry and use those unpleasant

650
00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:50.459
emotions in turn to fuel a motivation, hash it

651
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:53.949
out with your friend, apologize to your friend and

652
00:48:53.959 --> 00:48:56.889
so forth. And so the argument is that, um

653
00:48:56.899 --> 00:49:01.610
when you face controllable adversity, things that you can

654
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.610
and maybe should do something about it might be

655
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:11.139
better to um, not self regulate, um using reappraisal.

656
00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:17.659
And so, um, few different studies um have indicated,

657
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:23.379
um that, um, that's indeed the case. So, um,

658
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:30.250
um found that people who were in um more

659
00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:35.810
controllable, who had experienced more controllable life stress in

660
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:41.439
the past 18 months, uh previous to assessment, the

661
00:49:41.449 --> 00:49:46.040
better they were at emotional regulation, the more depressed,

662
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:50.629
um They actually felt um people who are in

663
00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:55.469
uncontrollable life stress, um the better they were at

664
00:49:55.479 --> 00:50:00.659
emotion regulation via reappraisal, the less depression they felt.

665
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:05.659
So you see almost like this teeter totter of

666
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:12.830
self regulation versus situation regulation. Um Another study um

667
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.929
that um Brett Ford and Oliver John and Phoebe

668
00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:24.080
Lamb um headed um found that um Clinton voters

669
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:32.199
um after the 2016 presidential election where Donald Trump

670
00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:38.030
won and Hillary Clinton lost um when they um

671
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:45.030
um uh used reappraisal as assessed with surveys or

672
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.979
by experimental manipulation um when they like used reappraisal

673
00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:58.699
and effectively reduce their negative emotions, they were actually

674
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:06.040
less likely to then go out and um protest

675
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.000
or try to do something about the situation that

676
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:14.020
was very stressful for them as Clinton voters. And

677
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:18.479
that again, hints at that um teeter Totter of

678
00:51:18.489 --> 00:51:22.860
self regulation that might sometimes come at the cost

679
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:28.330
of situation regulation and doing something about bad situations.

680
00:51:29.139 --> 00:51:33.080
Mhm. So that was a long answer to your

681
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:37.159
question about reappraisal and it can sometimes be bad.

682
00:51:37.169 --> 00:51:39.550
Um, WE can stop there or I can tell

683
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.560
you about when suppression might be not so bad.

684
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.060
Oh, ok. But just before we get into that,

685
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.899
I mean, one example was coming to my mind.

686
00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:52.260
Well, while you were explaining all of that, hopefully

687
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.110
it's a good example. I'm not sure. But uh

688
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.270
I mean, perhaps a case, uh perhaps there's a

689
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.550
particular kind of case where um I mean, doing

690
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:07.439
emotion regulation would not be so good. So for

691
00:52:07.449 --> 00:52:11.580
example, if you are um a man was brought

692
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.850
up in a very, with very strict masculine norms.

693
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:21.020
And for example, you, you associate uh stoicism with

694
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:24.560
being very masculine. And for example, you experience a

695
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.790
loss, a family member of yours die and then

696
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.830
you are at the funeral and you just try

697
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.010
to suppress or regulate some of your emotion and

698
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.135
you avoid crying because I, I mean, crying is

699
00:52:39.145 --> 00:52:42.004
not manly or something like that. I mean, perhaps

700
00:52:42.014 --> 00:52:47.054
that would be uh something that would have uh

701
00:52:47.135 --> 00:52:52.205
potentially negative psychological consequences. I mean, I I'm not

702
00:52:52.215 --> 00:52:54.985
sure if the example is the best one, but

703
00:52:54.995 --> 00:52:56.364
what do you think about it?

704
00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.429
Yeah, I think it's a great example. Um And

705
00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:03.550
first of all, you hit on a really important

706
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:09.270
gender difference um in expressive suppression where men um

707
00:53:09.939 --> 00:53:14.709
across various cultures and um groups that have been

708
00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:19.540
studied tend to um say they use expressive suppression

709
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:23.850
more than women. Um And so that's a gender

710
00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.169
stereotype that we have and that seems to be

711
00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:31.870
borne out in socialization in, in how and degrees

712
00:53:31.879 --> 00:53:37.600
to which men versus women use expressive suppression. Um

713
00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:41.919
And it's a great example because in general, expressive

714
00:53:41.929 --> 00:53:48.419
suppression has been associated with bad outcomes. Um LIKE

715
00:53:48.429 --> 00:53:51.350
I said earlier, like in terms of psychological health,

716
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:57.760
um and um uh and social functioning. Um AND

717
00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:03.399
um and that seems to um be um true

718
00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:07.449
across the genders um and across a number of

719
00:54:07.459 --> 00:54:13.439
different groups that said, um your example actually is

720
00:54:13.449 --> 00:54:19.239
a great one in hinting at potentially a boundary

721
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:24.439
condition to the harms of expressive suppression. And that's,

722
00:54:24.719 --> 00:54:29.159
that stems from the idea that there's sort of

723
00:54:29.169 --> 00:54:33.949
two reasons why expressive suppression might be bad. One

724
00:54:33.959 --> 00:54:37.370
is that sort of like it, it's, and you

725
00:54:37.379 --> 00:54:40.290
could think of it as inherent to the suppression.

726
00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:44.149
I have an emotional impulse and in sort of

727
00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:46.739
like almost like a Freudian way I tamped down

728
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.100
on it. And that sort of like makes the

729
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:56.090
impulse um grow stronger and more harmful um hydraulically

730
00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.899
almost. Um And there's some um physiological measures um

731
00:55:00.909 --> 00:55:07.050
that are consistent with that, but also um suppression

732
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:11.209
might be um bad for a second reason that's

733
00:55:11.219 --> 00:55:14.729
not sort of inherent to the process but has

734
00:55:14.739 --> 00:55:17.699
to do with how people think about the process.

735
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:22.649
And um some people think that suppression is actually

736
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:28.780
the culturally appropriate and correct thing to do. Um

737
00:55:28.989 --> 00:55:33.899
So in sort of coming back to the distinction

738
00:55:33.909 --> 00:55:38.209
of independent and interdependent cultures in independent cultures, we

739
00:55:38.219 --> 00:55:41.729
think of um, emotions sort of as something that

740
00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:45.489
we ought to express. It's part of being authentic,

741
00:55:45.969 --> 00:55:49.469
part of the norm. If you're sad and you

742
00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.610
are grieving, you can cry even if you're a

743
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:59.790
man. But um in other cultures, emotions are not

744
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.830
seen as so acceptable. I mentioned that earlier so

745
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.879
that if the interdependent view of emotions as something

746
00:56:07.959 --> 00:56:15.429
that can upset social harmony and individual emotions um

747
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.840
ought to sometimes at least be adjusted to the

748
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:23.439
context. And so, if we think of emotions in

749
00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:28.689
that way, expressive suppression might be more valued in

750
00:56:28.699 --> 00:56:35.719
a cultural context, specifically in interdependent cultures. And so,

751
00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:44.030
um there's um some indication that accordingly, we then

752
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:49.370
see that expressive suppression in those cultural contexts is

753
00:56:49.379 --> 00:56:54.580
not quite as harmful and sometimes um even beneficial.

754
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:59.530
Um So, um going um back to the study

755
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.530
I mentioned earlier that was um led by Gerald

756
00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:06.939
Young um um look and he looked at um

757
00:57:06.949 --> 00:57:11.560
expressive suppression in Mexican American adolescents uh and its

758
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:17.739
relationship with um depressive symptoms. And he argued that

759
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:22.939
um actually in um the Mexican American cultural context,

760
00:57:22.949 --> 00:57:27.820
um positive emotionality um highly valued. It's sort of

761
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:31.379
like the ethos of simpatia if you will. Um

762
00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:36.885
But negative emotions are very much so not valued.

763
00:57:36.895 --> 00:57:41.784
Um And um consistent with the idea that the

764
00:57:41.905 --> 00:57:47.564
effects of expressive suppression depend on the cultural view

765
00:57:47.574 --> 00:57:53.324
of expressive suppression. He found that suppression of positive

766
00:57:53.334 --> 00:57:59.879
emotions was linked with greater depressive symptoms, but suppression

767
00:57:59.889 --> 00:58:04.419
of negative emotions was actually linked with lower depressive

768
00:58:04.429 --> 00:58:08.879
symptoms. Um In this sample, um indicating that there

769
00:58:08.889 --> 00:58:13.840
are really important um moderators, not the case that

770
00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:17.979
it's always bad or always good. So in the

771
00:58:17.989 --> 00:58:22.189
broadest sense, we come back to the takeaway that

772
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:27.370
no single emotion regulation strategy is always good or

773
00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:30.389
always bad, but it depends on the context.

774
00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:34.020
So I think that perhaps we could say here

775
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:39.149
that uh at least one underlying or current theme

776
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:42.639
here uh has to do with the culture and

777
00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:46.520
cultural context. We've talked here for example, about differences

778
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:51.489
between independent and interdependent cultures. So for example, the

779
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:57.719
differences between uh Western cultures and East Asian cultures.

780
00:58:57.729 --> 00:59:00.510
So I I mean, isn't it the case that

781
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:05.879
when it comes to, for example, um understanding mental

782
00:59:05.889 --> 00:59:09.629
health that perhaps even when it comes to the

783
00:59:09.639 --> 00:59:12.919
mental health professionals themselves that perhaps they have to

784
00:59:12.929 --> 00:59:17.919
take into account the cultural context where the patients

785
00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:21.179
come from because it seems at least very obvious

786
00:59:21.189 --> 00:59:25.320
to me that this would have clinical implications or

787
00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:25.719
not.

788
00:59:26.439 --> 00:59:29.709
Yes. Um Absolutely. And I think that's one of

789
00:59:29.719 --> 00:59:35.739
the really important implications here that um and we

790
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:41.399
want, I think um construe culture broadly. Um YOU

791
00:59:41.409 --> 00:59:45.780
know, we focus a little bit on interdependence, independence,

792
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.439
East West. Uh But of course, ethnicity is a

793
00:59:49.449 --> 00:59:57.379
really important driver of values, beliefs, particular ecologies that

794
00:59:57.389 --> 01:00:02.830
people live in. Um TYPES of adversity that they

795
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.330
face. Um Gender is another way of thinking about

796
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:12.054
culture. Um And so culture broadly, construed. Absolutely is

797
01:00:12.064 --> 01:00:17.135
really important for um the implications and thinking about

798
01:00:17.145 --> 01:00:22.205
this for mental health and interventions um and helping

799
01:00:22.215 --> 01:00:26.044
people use emotional regulation to serve them in their

800
01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:28.729
lives. Absolutely.

801
01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:32.050
And, and that do you think that were among

802
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.969
those different uh aspects or factors that you mentioned

803
01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:40.169
there? Like ethnicity, gender. Uh Would you also list

804
01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:44.850
among them socio-economic status or not? Yes.

805
01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.520
Yeah, I think so. Um In, in, in that

806
01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:53.469
socio-economic status, of course, is deeply intertwined with um

807
01:00:53.479 --> 01:00:58.310
ethnicity, race, gender um and so forth. Um And

808
01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.939
also in that it constitutes a ecology. If you

809
01:01:02.949 --> 01:01:07.510
will, what kinds of values and beliefs will people

810
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.034
encounter um in the environments? Um What kinds of

811
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:16.794
adversity, what levels of adversity will they encounter and

812
01:01:16.804 --> 01:01:22.715
so forth? Um So we talked about um controllability

813
01:01:22.725 --> 01:01:29.649
of adversity as one of the um factors that

814
01:01:29.659 --> 01:01:35.040
um moderates um the effects of reappraisal, right? Um

815
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:40.469
How effective emotion regulation via reappraisal tends to not

816
01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:44.979
be as beneficial when people can and should do

817
01:01:44.989 --> 01:01:49.729
something about situations that they're in. Um And so

818
01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:55.310
one extension of this is to say, well, let's

819
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.770
look at S CS as um a factor that's

820
01:01:59.979 --> 01:02:05.780
related to um controllability, right? The more resources people

821
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.979
have the higher in SES, they have the more

822
01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:12.899
control over their environment they tend to have. Um

823
01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:18.139
And um by extension, then reappraisal should be less

824
01:02:18.149 --> 01:02:22.860
um beneficial for people higher versus lower in SES.

825
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:27.060
Um And we tested that idea in um three

826
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:32.860
different samples um together with um Alison Troy, um

827
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:36.929
and Terry mccrae and found um evidence that that's

828
01:02:36.939 --> 01:02:40.469
the case. So, um, people lower in S CS,

829
01:02:40.479 --> 01:02:46.290
um tended to benefit more from uh reappraisal and

830
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.850
that might be due to the fact that uh

831
01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:54.810
lower ses covaries with, um having less control over

832
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.689
the context. And therefore, um, and I say that

833
01:02:58.699 --> 01:03:02.439
a little bit um with, with some pain, um

834
01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:04.909
because I think there might be a cost to

835
01:03:04.919 --> 01:03:08.719
the person in some other ways, but at least

836
01:03:08.729 --> 01:03:12.399
when we look at mental health, there's a benefit

837
01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:14.159
to self regulating.

838
01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:21.010
Mhm. And so, uh are there ways of improving

839
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:25.570
our emotion regulation? I mean, anything that we can

840
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:31.560
do individually to improve how we regulate our emotions

841
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:34.040
or the extent to which we are able to

842
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:34.530
do it?

843
01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:40.379
Um Yes, first there's, you know, good old therapy.

844
01:03:40.389 --> 01:03:46.260
Um And so, um, you know, cognitive behavioral therapy,

845
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:51.739
um is one of the ways, um that, um,

846
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:58.810
very much so helps people um recognize, um when

847
01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:03.860
and why they use maybe dysfunctional types of emotional

848
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:09.879
regulation that teaches them how to and what kinds

849
01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:15.139
of regulation they might use that might benefit them

850
01:04:15.149 --> 01:04:18.610
in their lives. Uh And also teach us techniques

851
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:24.780
um in essence, restructuring, automatic thoughts um uh is

852
01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:29.229
a way of um teaching people to use reappraisal.

853
01:04:29.239 --> 01:04:33.770
So that's one really important piece. Um I wanna

854
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:39.429
also um talk about um recent, more recent extensions

855
01:04:39.439 --> 01:04:45.469
of um C BT that incorporate um mindfulness and

856
01:04:45.479 --> 01:04:52.000
acceptance um into the therapy. And um those um

857
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:55.399
I think um are sort of like a spin

858
01:04:55.409 --> 01:05:01.239
on C BT that sort of are very relevant

859
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:05.479
to emotional regulation. Um But they make a really

860
01:05:05.489 --> 01:05:12.159
interesting extension um by, at their core, relying on

861
01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:15.620
emotional acceptance. Um

862
01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:19.780
BY the way, when you mentioned acceptance, there, are

863
01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:24.229
you tying it to acceptance and commitment therapy or

864
01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:26.219
not or there? Oh, ok.

865
01:05:26.229 --> 01:05:30.699
OK. Yes. So, um um so it's acceptance and

866
01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:33.780
commitment therapy is sort of like one of those

867
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:37.370
recent. Um I mean, there's divergent opinions I think

868
01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:41.320
on whether they are cognitive or like a completely

869
01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:46.679
new thing. Uh But um regard um there's sort

870
01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:51.260
of um mindfulness based cognitive therapies, but also acceptance

871
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:56.629
and commitment therapy that all sort of incorporate themes

872
01:05:56.639 --> 01:06:02.699
of mindfulness and emotional acceptance into the therapy. And

873
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:07.270
um why am I talking about those when answering

874
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:12.050
your question about how people can improve emotion regulation?

875
01:06:12.459 --> 01:06:16.669
Um Because at first glance, you might think, well,

876
01:06:16.679 --> 01:06:22.000
this is emotional acceptance, accepting your emotions as they

877
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:26.699
are, that sounds like the exact opposite of emotion

878
01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:32.540
regulation, right? And so, um to me, these are

879
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:37.030
incredibly interesting extensions and they bring into the fold

880
01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.379
of emotion regulation, emotional acceptance. And so in the

881
01:06:41.389 --> 01:06:46.639
last, I don't know, like uh 1015 years, um

882
01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:49.820
the emotion regulation field I think has started to

883
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:55.459
grapple with what is emotional acceptance? Um How does

884
01:06:55.469 --> 01:07:01.159
that play into emotion regulation? Does it undermine the

885
01:07:01.169 --> 01:07:06.760
whole idea that emotion regulation or reappraisal is such

886
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:10.000
a great thing? Because we do know that emotional

887
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:16.399
acceptance has benefits. And so that sort of like

888
01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:20.239
could be seen as an issue, right? Emotion regulation.

889
01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:24.320
Researchers over here talking about how you should regulate

890
01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:27.979
your emotions and then people over there who say,

891
01:07:27.989 --> 01:07:32.370
oh just accept your emotions and sort of magically

892
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:38.639
that will improve your um well being. Um So,

893
01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:44.030
to me, it's really interesting to think about why

894
01:07:44.649 --> 01:07:49.070
um emotional acceptance um could be beneficial and how

895
01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.389
it relates to emotion regulation. Um Maybe we can

896
01:07:53.399 --> 01:07:55.250
talk a little bit more about acceptance at the

897
01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:59.750
moment. Um I wanna sort of just briefly answer

898
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.649
your question about how people can improve their emotion

899
01:08:02.659 --> 01:08:06.310
regulation in one more um way because sort of

900
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:12.590
not everybody has the capacity to um go to

901
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.919
therapy, right? It's really expensive, you have to have

902
01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:21.060
access to a therapist. And so um there's um

903
01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:28.020
um I think recent um developments in uh mobile

904
01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:36.169
assistant assisted um um interventions. Um NO, even apps

905
01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:42.930
um that um um deliver um often it's sort

906
01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:46.439
of coach um uh coached in sort of mindfulness

907
01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:50.520
interventions um that deliver interventions at a, in a

908
01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:56.509
much more accessible manner that um can help people

909
01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.770
regulate their emotions um better. Um There was a

910
01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:05.899
recent study um by David Yeager and colleagues um

911
01:09:07.118 --> 01:09:11.528
that delivered a 30 minute um what they called

912
01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:17.269
synergistic mindset intervention. Um um That was based on

913
01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:22.310
the idea that basically, if you change people's beliefs

914
01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:29.169
about emotions, that's sort of a really um uh

915
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:36.500
effective way to help them regulate their emotions better.

916
01:09:36.529 --> 01:09:42.319
Um And so they um basically taught people two

917
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:50.089
things, first, emotions and your own mind is controllable.

918
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:55.430
So it goes back to that controllability belief and

919
01:09:55.439 --> 01:10:02.140
second uh emotions aren't these like including stress, aren't

920
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:09.220
these super dangerous, terrible things. Um And so, um

921
01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:13.479
they call that a synergistic mindset because you needed

922
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.970
to teach both of those. And they found, um

923
01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.830
that's a 30 minute intervention and they found a

924
01:10:20.839 --> 01:10:25.600
bunch of uh benefits associated with that that was

925
01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:33.189
uh mediated by emotional regulation. So, um that's a

926
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.910
couple of thoughts on how people can be helped

927
01:10:38.919 --> 01:10:43.319
and taught to regulate their emotions in better ways.

928
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:47.009
Um Somehow we got into acceptance, which I think

929
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.279
is really important. Uh Maybe we can talk about

930
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:52.089
it, but I don't know whether you want to

931
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.520
talk about acceptance.

932
01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:56.500
Uh Yeah. No, actually I was going to just

933
01:10:56.509 --> 01:10:59.620
comment briefly on it. If I say something wrong

934
01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:04.109
here, please correct me. But actually, I mean, when

935
01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.000
it comes to mindfulness specifically, and that idea coming

936
01:11:08.009 --> 01:11:12.350
from, for example, Zen Buddhism that, that people apply

937
01:11:12.359 --> 01:11:17.290
to mindfulness where um they teach you that it

938
01:11:17.299 --> 01:11:21.770
doesn't really matter much what goes on in your

939
01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:24.689
mind. The sort of the sort of thoughts that

940
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.350
your mind produces the sort of feelings because that's

941
01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:33.759
just something that happens. You have really no control

942
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:37.850
over but what you, how you react with and

943
01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:40.939
what you do with it, it's something that you

944
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:44.060
can control, not the thoughts but you, what you

945
01:11:44.069 --> 01:11:47.640
do about them actually, for me, uh what I

946
01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:50.319
mean, when you try, when you tie it to

947
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:55.080
accepting what goes around in your mind is, is

948
01:11:55.089 --> 01:11:57.459
a sort of, I, I always tied it to

949
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:02.240
a sort of e emotion regulation or control because

950
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:07.959
it's actually about you uh being able over time

951
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:13.370
to, to react, how you want to your own

952
01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:16.970
feelings, your own thoughts and so on. So, so

953
01:12:16.979 --> 01:12:19.220
I, I mean, at least for me personally, it

954
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:21.250
does, there doesn't seem to be, even though the

955
01:12:21.259 --> 01:12:24.709
word there is, is acceptance, there doesn't seem to

956
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.810
be uh much contradiction there. But I mean, maybe

957
01:12:29.819 --> 01:12:31.020
I'm wrong. I don't know.

958
01:12:31.959 --> 01:12:35.060
So, yeah, I think that's exactly one way in

959
01:12:35.069 --> 01:12:40.459
which um emotion regulation researchers have reconciled this sort

960
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:46.419
of like um apparent um or seeming tension that

961
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.529
basically they said, well, so it's kind of like

962
01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.790
a type of reappraisal of your own emotional response.

963
01:12:55.799 --> 01:12:59.479
Maybe that's what you mean. Right. Um, BECAUSE sort

964
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.629
of acceptance sort of is at the level of

965
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.109
the initial emotional response I think, and you sort

966
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.189
of, rather than thinking about that response as something

967
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:19.129
that's, um, uh, important right to, to, to regulate

968
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.439
and tinker with you simply let it be, you

969
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:29.410
don't judge it, you maybe mindfully observe it with

970
01:13:29.419 --> 01:13:34.669
curiosity, but you don't try to sort of tinker

971
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.810
with that initial emotional response. Um OR the, the

972
01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:44.819
feeling state, you very much so and acceptance seems

973
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:49.600
to empower people to do that, you very much

974
01:13:49.609 --> 01:13:53.620
so decide how you wanna respond to it, sort

975
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:59.319
of the downstream um actions, right? I feel angry.

976
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:03.930
Am I gonna hit somebody? No. Um And so

977
01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.529
some people have argued that like it's a type

978
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:10.379
of reappraisal of your own emotions if you will,

979
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:15.549
I'm not sure that that's actually completely right because

980
01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:23.580
um it, it really emotional acceptance really is encountering

981
01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:33.080
your emotions without judgment without um trying to alter

982
01:14:33.089 --> 01:14:37.319
them. I truly let them be it, it like

983
01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:39.680
you said, it's, I don't give them a lot

984
01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:43.759
of importance, but I also don't try to alter

985
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:47.959
them. So I do think emotional acceptance is different

986
01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:53.799
from reappraisal um in that way. Um I do

987
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:58.220
think to me it's more about sort of once

988
01:14:58.229 --> 01:15:01.799
you have an experience to, to let it be.

989
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.890
Um, I absolutely agree and there seems to be

990
01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:10.410
like a positive relationship between acceptance and um precisely

991
01:15:10.419 --> 01:15:15.890
not um having the, the space not to act

992
01:15:15.899 --> 01:15:20.589
on your emotions. Um But to me, acceptance seems

993
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.879
more about like, um it's the like that the,

994
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:30.709
the inverse of experiential avoidance you allow the experience.

995
01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.509
Um But also you're not afraid of it, um

996
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.649
because you don't see it as defining um yourself

997
01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.870
as being identical with yourself. Um So to me,

998
01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:52.549
acceptance and reappraisal actually play a really um interesting

999
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.950
um synergistic role and sort of live seem to

1000
01:15:55.959 --> 01:16:01.680
live alongside one another um rather than being one

1001
01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:03.790
and the same process.

1002
01:16:04.299 --> 01:16:06.629
Yeah. No, I, I mean, uh I was just

1003
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.740
pointing to the fact that perhaps uh what seems

1004
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:15.370
initially to be a sort of contradiction there between

1005
01:16:15.379 --> 01:16:20.350
emotion regulation and acceptance, perhaps it's not such a

1006
01:16:20.359 --> 01:16:23.910
big contradict, a contradiction. I mean, that more or

1007
01:16:23.919 --> 01:16:28.200
less what I was saying, not necessarily waiting, acceptance

1008
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.279
to reappraisal. So,

1009
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:33.600
yes. Ab OK. Yes, I think we have the

1010
01:16:33.609 --> 01:16:37.729
exact same response then. Yeah. Yeah, but we don't

1011
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:42.029
know yet a lot about, about um acceptance, like

1012
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:46.000
it's been like a little ignored by emotion regulation

1013
01:16:46.009 --> 01:16:50.109
researchers uh for, for, for a while. And so

1014
01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.229
I think it's a very, there's starting to be

1015
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.870
more and more research from the emotion regulation field

1016
01:16:55.879 --> 01:16:58.910
um on it. Um And I think that's a

1017
01:16:58.919 --> 01:17:05.359
really um interesting um development um because you know,

1018
01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:09.040
we've talked a lot about reappraisal, truth be told,

1019
01:17:09.049 --> 01:17:14.689
reappraisal is a pretty complicated um abstract process. I

1020
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.189
don't know whether that's a reaction you have. You

1021
01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.540
know, you're like talking about thinking about your emotional

1022
01:17:20.549 --> 01:17:23.359
situation in a way that sort of changes it.

1023
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:28.359
Um That's a little bit abstract and complicated. And

1024
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:32.649
um what I like about acceptance is that um

1025
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:38.899
at least in theory it's uh more straightforward. Um

1026
01:17:39.209 --> 01:17:40.339
And yeah,

1027
01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.890
yeah. II, I mean, this is all very complicated.

1028
01:17:43.899 --> 01:17:46.549
Don't get me wrong when I talk about mindfulness

1029
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.770
to this day. I'm not sure that I 100%

1030
01:17:49.779 --> 01:17:55.319
understand. What's that thing about just letting your thoughts

1031
01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:59.180
popping, pop into your head and not doing anything

1032
01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:01.694
about it. I mean, it's a weird as well.

1033
01:18:02.185 --> 01:18:05.234
It's true too actually. And that's why I quickly

1034
01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:08.984
added, like in theory, it's more straightforward because you're,

1035
01:18:08.995 --> 01:18:11.325
you're right. I mean, you know, that's why you

1036
01:18:11.334 --> 01:18:16.174
have like meditation courses that are many, many weeks

1037
01:18:16.185 --> 01:18:21.274
and hours and, and days um long. Um And

1038
01:18:21.345 --> 01:18:26.310
uh you know, like it sounds so straightforward, just

1039
01:18:26.319 --> 01:18:30.609
let your emotions naturally unfold, think of them like

1040
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:33.370
clouds in the sky and so forth. But when

1041
01:18:33.379 --> 01:18:39.970
we do experimental studies, um somehow it's actually not

1042
01:18:39.979 --> 01:18:44.649
easy at all to actually do this for our

1043
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:50.330
participants. Um And no matter what metaphors we use,

1044
01:18:50.339 --> 01:18:55.229
uh it's, it's tricky. Um And I've wondered a

1045
01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.169
lot about why that is. Um And um I

1046
01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.600
mean, one idea of course is that we're so

1047
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:08.140
used to thinking about our emotions. This goes back

1048
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:10.459
all the way to something that you said much

1049
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:13.560
earlier. We're very much so used to think about

1050
01:19:13.569 --> 01:19:21.700
our emotions as dangerous, um, potentially overwhelming negative things

1051
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:26.600
that, uh, we quickly should do something about lest

1052
01:19:26.609 --> 01:19:31.490
they overwhelm us. Um And so maybe acceptance is

1053
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.200
such a difficult thing because it goes against, um,

1054
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:37.229
those beliefs.

1055
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:42.069
So to get into the last topic of our

1056
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.890
conversation today, let's talk a little bit about happiness

1057
01:19:45.899 --> 01:19:49.049
here because uh I mean, this is uh you're

1058
01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:52.310
not the first person that I talk with about

1059
01:19:52.319 --> 01:19:54.950
this, but uh it seems that there are some

1060
01:19:54.959 --> 01:20:00.089
paradoxical effects when it comes to valuing and seeking

1061
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.049
happiness,

1062
01:20:01.359 --> 01:20:07.450
right? Yes. Um Happiness, one of my favorite um

1063
01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:10.899
topics and of course, it's deeply intertwined with everything

1064
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:15.649
that we talked about happiness, of course, has, you

1065
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.169
know, like is an emotional state, at least to

1066
01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:24.020
some degree, right? Um uh Happiness has been studied

1067
01:20:24.029 --> 01:20:29.020
as um subjective well being made of in large

1068
01:20:29.029 --> 01:20:32.600
part, like there's an evaluative, more cognitive piece to

1069
01:20:32.609 --> 01:20:36.979
it, satisfaction with life, but then abundance of positive

1070
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:41.899
feelings and not so much negative feelings, hedonic balance

1071
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:47.319
sometimes it's called um so um inherently related to

1072
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:52.049
everything that we've been talking about. Um And um

1073
01:20:52.779 --> 01:20:58.450
you mentioned the paradoxical effects of um valuing happiness.

1074
01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:02.720
And um I first became sort of interested in,

1075
01:21:02.729 --> 01:21:06.479
in this um sort of as a, um, immigrant

1076
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:10.000
to the US, um, coming from Germany. I noticed

1077
01:21:10.009 --> 01:21:16.160
that, um, uh, in the US happiness, of course,

1078
01:21:16.169 --> 01:21:20.020
is colloquially and sort of in general talked about

1079
01:21:20.029 --> 01:21:23.310
much more. Right. We, we've all heard sort of

1080
01:21:23.319 --> 01:21:27.660
like the stereotype of people asking, uh, you know,

1081
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:30.259
how's life in the US? And people will be,

1082
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:33.580
it's great. And sort of like when you first

1083
01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:37.649
move from Northwestern Europe, it's sort of like, oh

1084
01:21:38.419 --> 01:21:43.720
what? Really? Um So there's a cultural difference that

1085
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:47.799
kind of motivated um me to look at um

1086
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:54.200
how that um value might play out in um

1087
01:21:54.830 --> 01:22:00.830
helping or hindering um people from obtaining happiness. Um

1088
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:06.680
And so we've um actually just finished um a

1089
01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:11.950
big paper um together with uh Felicia Zit and

1090
01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:15.740
um Brett Ford and Oliver John that looked at

1091
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:21.890
um this value across um um five different um

1092
01:22:21.899 --> 01:22:27.229
larger samples. Um So um the idea is that

1093
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:33.169
in general people value happiness, there's some cultural differences,

1094
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:37.950
but that's a overwhelming value around the world. Um

1095
01:22:38.339 --> 01:22:43.319
And it like makes perfect sense, right? Because happiness

1096
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:45.770
feels good as we talked about earlier and it

1097
01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:52.129
also helps people be have better lives, like helps

1098
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:58.049
people be more successful, contributes to greater mental health,

1099
01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:01.950
greater social well being and so forth. Um And

1100
01:23:01.959 --> 01:23:05.669
um I also want to say that there's, of

1101
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:12.109
course, lots of um interventions, social, psychological and others

1102
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.430
um that we already talked about that basically are

1103
01:23:15.439 --> 01:23:19.020
based on the notion that um helping people become

1104
01:23:19.029 --> 01:23:23.140
happier is a good thing and it works. So,

1105
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:26.390
Sonia Lerski, of course, has amazing research on that

1106
01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:31.790
Barbara Fredrickson and others. Um At the same time,

1107
01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:40.299
um we had a sneaking, um, uh suspicion that

1108
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:45.000
you could overdo it. Um And or do it

1109
01:23:45.009 --> 01:23:48.569
in the wrong way. Um The idea being that

1110
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:54.500
if you are sort of singularly focused on being

1111
01:23:54.509 --> 01:24:02.100
happy, becoming happier, there's a paradox in there where

1112
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:09.669
if we're focused on say doing better in math,

1113
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:12.450
you work hard, you set up an expectation, I'm

1114
01:24:12.459 --> 01:24:16.209
gonna do better and you might not do as

1115
01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:21.589
well as your expectation, you're disappointed and you work

1116
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.120
harder and become better. So no paradox there when

1117
01:24:27.129 --> 01:24:32.100
we think about happiness, happiness has an emotional component,

1118
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:39.350
right? So as you highly value happiness and you

1119
01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:46.350
encounter times when you fall short of this value,

1120
01:24:46.359 --> 01:24:53.600
this expectation, you feel disappointed, that's an emotional state

1121
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:58.270
that's in direct conflict with the very goal that

1122
01:24:58.279 --> 01:25:02.259
you have, which is happiness. And so that's at

1123
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:06.770
the core of the paradox. Um And so um

1124
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:14.129
we recently examined this um um value of happiness

1125
01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.060
in greater detail. Um We used to think of

1126
01:25:17.069 --> 01:25:22.609
it as a one dimensional construct that's aligned along

1127
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:28.240
sort of strength of the value of happiness. Um

1128
01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.779
But we noticed something um and others noticed um

1129
01:25:32.839 --> 01:25:36.649
that, that might be too simplistic an idea where

1130
01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.759
the strength of the value itself might not be

1131
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:47.560
enough to um engage these paradoxical effects. Um The

1132
01:25:47.569 --> 01:25:51.279
reason for that being that you might have a

1133
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:57.689
really strong value of happiness and you might fall

1134
01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.029
short of your expectation, but you might handle that

1135
01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.270
shortfall without, without stumbling on it, you might not

1136
01:26:09.279 --> 01:26:12.990
react with greater disappointment, but just kind of like

1137
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.270
roll with it. Um And in cases like that,

1138
01:26:17.379 --> 01:26:23.509
and we call this aspiring to happiness. It's people

1139
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.919
who sort of endorse happiness is extremely important to

1140
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:31.669
me just that you it could be pretty innocuous.

1141
01:26:32.549 --> 01:26:35.370
But then there's the second case and we call

1142
01:26:35.379 --> 01:26:39.850
this being concerned about happiness and this is the

1143
01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:44.399
case and we go back to beliefs and our

1144
01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:49.080
own reactions to our own emotions. Here, you have

1145
01:26:49.089 --> 01:26:57.180
people who worry who are concerned when about their

1146
01:26:57.189 --> 01:27:01.740
own level of happiness. Um And they believe that

1147
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:07.819
it means something negative about their lives uh about

1148
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:10.879
how they're doing in the world. And they need

1149
01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:16.299
to negatively elaborate on their own level of happiness

1150
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.259
um by being disappointed by judging their own experiences.

1151
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:27.009
And so it turns out um when we look

1152
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:34.600
across five different um samples um about 1500 people,

1153
01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.169
they reliably differ in terms of aspiring versus concern

1154
01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.330
about happiness. People who are concerned about their own

1155
01:27:45.339 --> 01:27:52.600
happiness, who react um with elaborate negative elaboration to

1156
01:27:52.609 --> 01:27:57.120
their own happiness levels. They go on to um

1157
01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:03.439
show the paradoxical effects, the more they value happiness

1158
01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:08.120
in this concerned way, the less happy, the more

1159
01:28:08.129 --> 01:28:11.419
depressed they go on to be. And then in

1160
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:14.299
the last part of the research, we wanted to

1161
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:17.979
look at this idea that this is because they

1162
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:23.359
respond with greater negative meta emotion exactly when they

1163
01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:27.529
ought to be happy, when they experience positive things

1164
01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.839
in their daily lives. Um And we found that

1165
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:36.549
was the case. Um So when, um um uh

1166
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.229
and we match sort of like the intensity of

1167
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.250
the positive events, like, let's say a birthday party,

1168
01:28:42.379 --> 01:28:46.850
people who are concerned about their own happiness, um

1169
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:55.700
undermine those experiences uh by injecting negativity, disappointment, and

1170
01:28:55.709 --> 01:29:00.549
judgment into those experiences. And over time it feeds

1171
01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.390
into exactly the thing that they want to avoid,

1172
01:29:04.399 --> 01:29:08.890
which is less happiness um and greater levels of

1173
01:29:08.899 --> 01:29:17.509
depressive symptoms. Um So, uh the, the, the conclusion

1174
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:24.220
is that absolutely, there are these paradoxes in focusing

1175
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:29.009
in the wrong way on our own happiness um

1176
01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:35.330
that we should try to avoid um if we

1177
01:29:35.339 --> 01:29:39.089
um if we want to avoid the negative downstream

1178
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:44.089
consequences um of those and maybe it goes back

1179
01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.970
to something that we talked about earlier, which is

1180
01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:53.189
emotional acceptance. So, in a way, um you know,

1181
01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:00.879
be happy about what you have versus having trying

1182
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:04.509
to have um what you think you're gonna be

1183
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.810
happy about might be the way to go.

1184
01:30:09.339 --> 01:30:14.430
But then these beliefs that people have about happiness,

1185
01:30:14.439 --> 01:30:18.370
their expectations and so on are also shaped by

1186
01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:19.009
culture.

1187
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:27.490
Right? Yes. Yeah. So um going back to the

1188
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:34.529
observation that um at least anecdotally, some cultures seem

1189
01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:40.790
to value happiness in a different way or think

1190
01:30:40.799 --> 01:30:45.450
of happiness in a different way. Um IS, is

1191
01:30:45.459 --> 01:30:50.049
borne out by some research. It's really, it's really

1192
01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:56.490
complicated as, you know, comparing um mean level reports

1193
01:30:57.109 --> 01:31:02.370
across cultures is tricky because people in different cultures

1194
01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:06.000
use scales in different ways and make judgments in

1195
01:31:06.009 --> 01:31:10.319
different ways. Um There's something called a contrast group

1196
01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:13.439
effect. So it's really hard to do that. Um

1197
01:31:13.689 --> 01:31:15.899
One thing that we have tried to do um

1198
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:19.229
to get around that is to examine the links

1199
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:26.479
between values, how people think about happiness and outcomes

1200
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:32.819
um across different cultures. Um So, in um research

1201
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:37.100
that was um done um led by Brett Ford,

1202
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:44.000
um um we compared um us um samples to

1203
01:31:44.009 --> 01:31:49.770
Russian, German and East Asian samples um and found

1204
01:31:49.779 --> 01:31:58.540
that um the cultures that um valued happiness more

1205
01:31:58.549 --> 01:32:04.069
in a socially engaged way did not show the

1206
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:09.390
paradoxical inverse relationship that I talked about earlier. So

1207
01:32:09.479 --> 01:32:11.790
it's a little bit of a complicated design. I'll,

1208
01:32:11.799 --> 01:32:16.649
I'll simplify in the US. We saw that valuing

1209
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:24.169
happiness was less linked with socially engaged um meanings

1210
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.569
of happiness. Um LIKE spending time with other people,

1211
01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:34.009
helping other people. Um In um Germany, that link

1212
01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:40.620
um was um absent in Russia, the link started

1213
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:44.279
to flip. And then in East Asia, there's sort

1214
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:47.620
of like a gradient of interdependence. If you will,

1215
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:50.770
the link uh flipped more strongly. So in East

1216
01:32:50.779 --> 01:32:56.870
Asia, valuing happiness was more strongly associated with socially

1217
01:32:56.879 --> 01:33:01.970
engaged uh understandings of happiness. And to the extent

1218
01:33:01.979 --> 01:33:08.140
that that was the case, valuing happiness was associated

1219
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:11.770
with greater benefits. So we see a flip of

1220
01:33:11.779 --> 01:33:15.529
the relationship such that in East Asia, Japan and

1221
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:19.819
Taiwan, in this case, um valuing happiness was associated

1222
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:23.799
with better outcomes and that was explained by this

1223
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:25.740
more social focus.

1224
01:33:26.379 --> 01:33:30.000
Mhm So let me ask you then one final

1225
01:33:30.009 --> 01:33:33.609
question. S uh so at the very beginning of

1226
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.580
this section of our conversation on happiness, you mentioned

1227
01:33:37.589 --> 01:33:41.439
that cross culturally, at least as far as we

1228
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:47.049
know, it seems that uh everyone values happiness, uh

1229
01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:49.569
at least uh I mean to, to a higher

1230
01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:53.359
or lesser degree, it seems that everyone values happiness

1231
01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:56.509
out there. So uh I would like to ask

1232
01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.520
you because there are people that pick uh on

1233
01:34:00.529 --> 01:34:03.759
these results, like the ones that you mentioned there

1234
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:08.279
about the paradoxical effects of valuing and seeking happiness

1235
01:34:08.589 --> 01:34:12.270
and they tweak them and say that the conclusion

1236
01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:16.540
then is that people should just ditch happiness, that

1237
01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:20.790
happiness shouldn't matter, that people should seek other things

1238
01:34:20.799 --> 01:34:25.569
in life. I mean, is that really warranted? I

1239
01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:30.430
mean, does that conclusion follow from the these results

1240
01:34:30.439 --> 01:34:34.779
on the paradoxical effects of valuing and seeking happiness?

1241
01:34:36.609 --> 01:34:40.779
That's a really great question. Um To some degree,

1242
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:46.560
I wanna say yes, it's warranted. Um And like,

1243
01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:52.589
and that doesn't mean that um the, that we

1244
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.259
should, uh, give up on happiness. Um, BUT it's

1245
01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:01.200
sort of one way to think about this is

1246
01:35:01.209 --> 01:35:08.419
that there's better ways to actually go about achieving

1247
01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:14.310
happiness and those ways go via just focus on

1248
01:35:14.319 --> 01:35:18.359
something else. So doesn't mean let's just be miserable

1249
01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:21.339
and wallow in our misery, but rather let's take

1250
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:24.459
the focus away from happiness. And the cross cultural

1251
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:28.259
research is sort of consistent with that. And so,

1252
01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.569
um the idea being engage in things, sometimes these

1253
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:40.669
are called positive activities um that will make you,

1254
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.149
that will have the downstream effect of making you

1255
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:51.160
happy. Um And um interestingly dose might precisely be

1256
01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:55.270
the more social things that um I talked about

1257
01:35:55.279 --> 01:36:01.240
being with other people um expressing gratitude, loving kindness,

1258
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:08.060
meditations. Um um um THOSE are actually uh some

1259
01:36:08.069 --> 01:36:12.850
of the most um sort of proven ways of

1260
01:36:12.859 --> 01:36:17.649
increasing well being in a lasting way. Um So,

1261
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:22.399
um the conclusion I think is absolutely founded that

1262
01:36:22.410 --> 01:36:25.959
in a way, let's just ditch the direct focus

1263
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:31.930
on happiness. Um But ironically, happiness um as it

1264
01:36:31.939 --> 01:36:36.279
moved, John Stuart Mill quote uh might just appear

1265
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:41.040
as a side effect of uh focusing on these

1266
01:36:41.049 --> 01:36:44.240
other um pursuits and activities.

1267
01:36:44.729 --> 01:36:46.850
Mhm But, but perhaps I should have been a

1268
01:36:46.859 --> 01:36:49.899
little bit more specific here because I, I was

1269
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:54.600
talking about people who say that we should ditch

1270
01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:58.660
happiness, but then to focus our efforts into, for

1271
01:36:58.669 --> 01:37:03.390
example, grinding at our work and stuff like that.

1272
01:37:03.399 --> 01:37:08.540
So perhaps that specifically is not so much of

1273
01:37:08.549 --> 01:37:12.750
a good uh piece of advice or is it?

1274
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.839
No, I think that's a really bad piece of

1275
01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:20.100
advice. Um And uh I would definitely not want

1276
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:23.479
the last word to be like start grinding in

1277
01:37:23.490 --> 01:37:28.020
your work. Um I think the uh but thank

1278
01:37:28.029 --> 01:37:31.520
you for clarifying that. I think that uh where

1279
01:37:31.529 --> 01:37:35.000
I was coming from is that um we should

1280
01:37:35.009 --> 01:37:40.160
not ditch happiness as an all ultimate and well

1281
01:37:40.169 --> 01:37:43.850
being as the ultimate goal for many people, but

1282
01:37:43.859 --> 01:37:48.399
we should ditch it as the direct um thing

1283
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:52.479
that we're heading towards, right? But rather um direct

1284
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:57.080
our attention towards some, some other things um with

1285
01:37:57.089 --> 01:38:00.580
the delightful side effect and the very much to

1286
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:05.520
my mind wanted side effect um of um actually

1287
01:38:05.529 --> 01:38:10.879
ultimately increasing um happiness and well being uh for

1288
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.720
people. So I don't think we wanna ditch that

1289
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:15.330
as a goal. That's a little bit what I

1290
01:38:15.339 --> 01:38:18.299
meant by like, should we all just like wallow

1291
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:22.629
in misery? Absolutely not. Um So as a um

1292
01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.439
goal, we don't wanna abandon it, but we, I

1293
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:29.080
think want to rethink about how we go about

1294
01:38:29.089 --> 01:38:34.790
um and how single mindedly and how um worriedly

1295
01:38:34.799 --> 01:38:38.520
we go about pursuing uh pursuing it as a,

1296
01:38:38.529 --> 01:38:39.950
as a goal. Yeah.

1297
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:44.819
Ok, great. So where can people find you and

1298
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:46.330
your work on the internet?

1299
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:53.709
Um So probably the best um place to look

1300
01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.890
me up is at UC Berkeley emotion and emotion

1301
01:38:56.899 --> 01:39:01.370
regulation lab. Um AND we're posting our, our work

1302
01:39:01.379 --> 01:39:05.770
there um and uh describe it. Um So that's

1303
01:39:05.779 --> 01:39:09.029
probably the best place to found it. E lab,

1304
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.370
E er lab.

1305
01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:14.879
