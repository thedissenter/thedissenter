00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.119
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.170
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.359
today I'm joined by Doctor Jonathan Lossus. He is

4
00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:14.640
the William H Stanford Distinguished university professor at the,

5
00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.489
at Washington University in Saint Louis. And today we're

6
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.079
going to talk about his book Improbable Destinies, Faith,

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.489
Chance, and the Future of Evolution. So Doctor Losses,

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.649
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.549
Ah, the pleasure is mine. Thank you, Ricardo.

10
00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:36.578
So let me start by asking you, uh, how

11
00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.569
were you influenced by the work of Steven J.

12
00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.339
Gould? And I mean, what aspects of his work

13
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.769
influenced you the most?

14
00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.979
Well, I was very much influenced, uh, as a,

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.709
as a boy, I was very interested in science

16
00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:56.240
and evolution. And, uh, my father was also interested

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.130
in these topics, and we subscribed to a magazine

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.880
called Natural History Magazine, for which Stephen Jay Gould

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.739
wrote a column every month. And his columns were

20
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.949
extremely well written, and they were about matters of,

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.199
of evolution. And many of his, uh, his famous

22
00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:16.519
scientific ideas were discussed in these, these columns. So

23
00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.559
I, I grew up reading his ideas about the

24
00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:22.199
evolutionary process. Then I had the great fortune to

25
00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.500
take a class with him at university in my,

26
00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.800
my first year at college where he basically talked

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.839
about the same things as he did in his

28
00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.800
columns. The, the course was rather humbly titled The

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.239
History of Earth and of Life. And it was

30
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.830
just about his ideas of Of the evolutionary process

31
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.260
and so on. And so, in my formative years,

32
00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.680
I, uh, I, I learned a lot about him.

33
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.150
As for which particular ideas, um, I mean, it's

34
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.980
hard to pick them out. His worldview about the,

35
00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:58.360
uh, importance of contingency and chance, about, uh, the,

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.910
the importance of processes other than natural selection, guiding

37
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.309
evolution, and so on. It was, it was his

38
00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:09.309
whole worldview that, uh, that I learned as I

39
00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.470
grew up. Now, I'm not saying that I subscribed

40
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.910
to everything that he, uh, believed in, but it

41
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.220
certainly had a great influence.

42
00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.610
Sure, and and what were his main ideas about

43
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.250
evolution?

44
00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.059
Well, he had a number of ideas. Uh, HE'S

45
00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:28.330
probably most famous for the theory called punctuated equilibrium,

46
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.710
the idea that for long periods of time, a

47
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.940
species would remain basically unchanged, and then it would

48
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.979
change to a great deal over a short period

49
00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.139
of time, uh, perhaps linked with the process of

50
00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.330
turning into a new species. Uh, SO that, that

51
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.479
was probably his most famous idea, but he also

52
00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.970
argued that we can't, uh, we, we can't interpret

53
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.929
every feature we see in an organism as an

54
00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.570
adaptation, something sculpted by natural selection, that there are

55
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.240
other processes that also can lead to evolutionary change.

56
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.970
And he also argued that uh that all of

57
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.889
evolution did not occur occur at the level of

58
00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.759
selection on populations. Sometimes, well, for example, he might

59
00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.850
say, why are there so many species of rodents,

60
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.610
several 1000 so few of monotrenes, the platypus and

61
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.690
the echidna, and that might not have anything to

62
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.369
do with rodents being more adaptable. It might be

63
00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.820
something. Some other factor that just uh caused them

64
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.309
to speciate more frequently. So those, those were a

65
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.899
number of, of his uh scientific ideas.

66
00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.000
And apart from natural selection, which other mechanisms play

67
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.320
a role in evolution?

68
00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.710
Well, the other mechanisms that play a role are

69
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.059
things like gene flow, the exchange of genes between

70
00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:57.410
populations, um, mutations, the extent to which mutations occur

71
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.380
in more in some ways than others. Uh, INBREEDING

72
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.600
between populations, and I am blanking on one. There

73
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.720
is one more that I is just not popping

74
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.419
into my head. Well, it'll come back to me.

75
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.979
And then, of course, as the point I made

76
00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.540
a moment ago, in addition, evolution occurs not just

77
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.170
due to the processes that work within a population,

78
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.220
but in addition, uh, they work at selection at

79
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.540
other levels, at selection favoring some types of species

80
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.459
over others, as I just mentioned a moment ago.

81
00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.100
The last process is genetic drift, uh, which is

82
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.420
an important one for Gould, that random changes that

83
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.470
occur just for no selective reason. Most frequent in

84
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.589
small populations.

85
00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.100
Uh, WHAT about the role of chance events like

86
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.980
for example, the asteroid that led to the extinction

87
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.299
of the dinosaurs and the leather rise of the

88
00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:55.329
mammals?

89
00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:59.140
Well, that was an important idea that gold championed

90
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.049
that. That stuff happens, basically, that could change the,

91
00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.489
uh, the direction of evolution, like the asteroid that

92
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500
that hit Earth 66 million years ago, that essentially

93
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.279
wiped out the dinosaurs, except for the birds, and

94
00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.700
a lot of other creatures, and gave mammals their

95
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.519
real chance to flourish. And that was just A

96
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.000
a happenstance. What if that asteroid had zoomed right

97
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.600
past the planet without hitting Earth? We would be

98
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.799
in a very different place today. So yes, Gould

99
00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:34.179
argued that what he called contingent events, unpredictable, not,

100
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.959
uh, yeah, not unpredictable contingent events could radically change

101
00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:40.119
the shape of evolution.

102
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.890
Uh, WHAT is convergent evolution and does it go

103
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.779
in any way against frameworks like rules based more

104
00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.700
on unpredictability and non-repeatability?

105
00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.220
Well, convergent evolution is the phenomenon that occurs when

106
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:05.790
two species independently evolve the same features and uh

107
00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.839
Oftentimes it is the result of species adapting to

108
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.160
the same environment in the same way. They are

109
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.239
experiencing the same natural selection pressures, and they evolve

110
00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.529
the same adaptation. So often it is taken as

111
00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.130
evidence of adaptive evolution. Uh, SOME people have argued

112
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.600
that that. Convergent evolution is very common in the

113
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.549
natural world and that it goes against Gould's argument

114
00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:40.709
of the importance of, of happenstance and the unpredictability,

115
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.679
the unpredictability of evolution, because it indicates that in

116
00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.760
fact, the same thing does happen repeatedly and that

117
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.920
in some sense one could predict if convergent evolution

118
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.549
is common, that a population experience of a particular

119
00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.049
environment will evolve in a particular way.

120
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.510
And how do we study the mechanisms behind evolution,

121
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.739
like, as we mentioned earlier, natural selection, but also

122
00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:11.670
genetic flow, genetic drift, and so on.

123
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.579
Uh, WELL, there's two main approaches. One is to

124
00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.700
actually study populations and measure what's going on, measure

125
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.720
whether natural selection is occurring or measure the extent

126
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.140
of gene flow between populations. And one of the

127
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.820
things that we have realized as evolutionary biologists in

128
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.820
the last few decades is that evolution uh can

129
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.760
occur very rapidly. This is something that Charles Darwin.

130
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.350
Thought did not happen and uh it's amazing Darwin

131
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.350
was right about so many things for which there

132
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.429
was no evidence in his day. He just figured

133
00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:49.549
it out, but this is one thing he, he

134
00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:52.230
got wrong, and that is he thought that evolution

135
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.260
proceeded extremely slowly, so slowly that it would take

136
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.230
thousands of years to see any sign of it.

137
00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:02.100
And for that reason, Darwin never even proposed that

138
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.299
you could try to, to study it as it

139
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:06.380
occurred because it would take too long. But we

140
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.500
now know that's wrong, that when natural selection pressures

141
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.250
are strong, when the environment changes or uh population

142
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.089
experiences a different environment, they can adapt very quickly.

143
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.299
And what that means is that we can actually

144
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:24.100
observe evolution as it happens over, over, not just

145
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.000
a human lifespan, sometimes a couple of years. Uh,

146
00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.989
SO that is one approach to the, the study

147
00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:30.950
of evolution is studying it in the here and

148
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.830
now, see what's happening. The other approach is to

149
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.590
look at the fossil record and see the changes

150
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.030
that have occurred over the eons and try to

151
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.710
figure out the processes that um That led to

152
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.349
those changes. And so to some extent in the

153
00:08:46.349 --> 00:08:49.750
here and now we can study the process and

154
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.780
with the fossil record we can see the pattern

155
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.789
and the real challenge is to connect the two,

156
00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:56.030
to take what we know about what goes on

157
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.859
in short periods, and can we extrapolate or somehow

158
00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:02.229
apply that to understand what's gone over long periods

159
00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:02.750
of time.

160
00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:07.909
When we want to understand the evolutionary origins of

161
00:09:07.909 --> 00:09:12.140
any particular kind of trait, where should we start

162
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.429
from?

163
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.849
Well, Probably. Uh, THE first place to look at

164
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:21.809
is the fossil record, to see if we can

165
00:09:21.809 --> 00:09:25.409
see the record by which that trait has evolved,

166
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.489
when it occurred, in what species, how often it

167
00:09:29.489 --> 00:09:34.140
occurred, and to get the, the historical record. Then

168
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.390
if it's possible to study how that trait is

169
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.630
functioning today, is natural selection favoring it? Is it

170
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.599
still changing? In a few cases, you can actually

171
00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:49.719
do experiments to, to try to simulate the evolutionary

172
00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:52.390
origin of that trait, uh, and to try to

173
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.830
understand the processes that may have under underlain that

174
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.549
evolution.

175
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.469
And what do you think of adaptationist approaches to

176
00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:05.659
evolutionary biology? I mean, since not all traits are

177
00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:06.669
adaptations.

178
00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:10.250
That's a, that's a great question, and that's a,

179
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.609
a topic that has been debated for decades. That's

180
00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:17.049
certainly what Gould, uh, one of the strong points

181
00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:21.609
that Gould made was arguing against the primacy of

182
00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:27.239
adaptationism as the explanation for uh evolutionary patterns. Uh,

183
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.849
I have. I have mixed feelings on this. On

184
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:32.729
the one hand, I think it's no doubt that

185
00:10:32.729 --> 00:10:36.489
natural selection is the strongest evolutionary force. And so

186
00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:39.869
it is reasonable to ask when you see some

187
00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:42.690
feature, particularly an odd feature, to try to figure

188
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.880
out How could natural selection have favored that? How

189
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.200
could the evolution of this trait actually be beneficial

190
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.200
to organisms? At the other hand, however, we need

191
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.080
to recognize that adaptation and natural selection aren't the

192
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.280
only processes, and there, there are other reasons that

193
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.159
a trait might evolve and particularly along those lines.

194
00:11:05.989 --> 00:11:10.700
It's important to remember that for natural selection to

195
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.260
happen and to lead to evolutionary change, you need

196
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.659
variation in a population. If all individuals had brown

197
00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:22.460
eyes, then, uh, evolution couldn't occur because there's no

198
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.859
variation to, uh, for natural selection to favor. So

199
00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:28.739
not until a mutation occurs and someone has blue

200
00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:33.260
eyes or green eyes. Once there's variation, then Evolution

201
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.530
can occur, and the reason I emphasize this is

202
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:42.020
that the production of variation is as important as

203
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.979
what natural selection does with it. If certain types

204
00:11:45.979 --> 00:11:48.700
of variation are more likely to occur in a

205
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.619
population due to mutations or whatever, the map may

206
00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:57.140
bias evolution in certain directions, or conversely, if variation

207
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.260
for a trait never appears, then it can't evolve.

208
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.390
For example, People have studied, tried to select individuals

209
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.869
that are asymmetric on the left side or the

210
00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:11.190
right side of their body that, uh, they've done

211
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.429
this a lot in fruit flies and in other

212
00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:17.849
organisms. Try to pick individuals that, um, have longer

213
00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:21.030
left legs than are bigger left wing, bigger wings

214
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.830
on the left side of their body than the

215
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.789
right side of their body. You just can't do

216
00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:28.989
it. And the reason is there is no gene.

217
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.809
Through wings on the left side, there are just

218
00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:34.210
genes that affect the size of wings in general,

219
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.479
both left side and right side. So there's no,

220
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.530
no genetic variation that can be favored to cause

221
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.369
left-winged fruit flies. Now you can get fruit flies

222
00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:45.929
that are more variable, but it's balanced. It's either

223
00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:48.789
left or right side. So, uh, the point is

224
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.869
that the production of variation and the mechanisms underlying

225
00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:58.190
that can guide evolution. As much as natural selection,

226
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.020
or at least both of these processes are important,

227
00:13:01.229 --> 00:13:04.469
and the production of variation is something that isn't

228
00:13:04.469 --> 00:13:08.469
necessarily regulated by natural selection. The, so, adaptation, in

229
00:13:08.469 --> 00:13:10.780
other words, is limited by the, the variation that

230
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.669
can be produced.

231
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:17.359
So in studying evolution and gathering more evidence to

232
00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:20.880
support it and also understanding how it works, how

233
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.510
it plays out. Tell us about experimental evolutionary science.

234
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.000
What is it and how is it done?

235
00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:34.880
Well, um, When natural selection was first proposed as

236
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.289
the mechanism of evolution by Darwin, excuse me. Um,

237
00:13:40.469 --> 00:13:44.630
THE idea didn't actually catch hold right away, that

238
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.549
Darwin convinced much of the learned world that evolution

239
00:13:47.549 --> 00:13:50.500
had occurred, but they were, the world was much

240
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.770
less convinced that natural selection was the mechanism. And

241
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.349
it wasn't until the early 1900s, about a century

242
00:13:57.349 --> 00:14:01.190
ago, that the field of genetics took off and

243
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.109
people came to understand that natural selection was a

244
00:14:05.109 --> 00:14:08.979
powerful force and a lot of The evidence supporting

245
00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:12.099
this came from experiments in the laboratory on organisms

246
00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:15.299
like fruit flies where you could take a population

247
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.179
of fruit flies and measure the size of their

248
00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:21.179
wings and only keep the ones with the biggest

249
00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:23.940
wings and breed them with each other and again

250
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.419
in the next generation pick the ones with the

251
00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:29.419
biggest wings or the most spots on their side

252
00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:34.580
or any other trait and almost invariably. That population

253
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.020
would evolve the trait being favored. Excuse me. And

254
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.289
so that laboratory proof that, that is experimental evolution

255
00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:47.260
and such research has continued for a century, and

256
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.530
it's basically shown that you can select on almost

257
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.549
any trait in a laboratory population and get an

258
00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:56.820
evolutionary response. Not every trait. I've always already talked

259
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.179
about when you can't get a response, but almost

260
00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:02.679
every trait, showing the power of natural selection. Well,

261
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.559
in recent years, people have taken this approach into

262
00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:09.909
the field and studied organisms in a natural context

263
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:13.039
to measure natural selection and see if evolution occurs

264
00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:15.000
as a result of it. And so that's an

265
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.679
area that's really taking off and is showing that

266
00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:21.479
what we've learned in the lab pretty much transfers

267
00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:22.570
to the field as well.

268
00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:26.659
So in your book you talk about experiments done

269
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:32.049
with, for example, fruit flies, bacteria, foxes, field mice.

270
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.820
Could you tell us about at least one or

271
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.539
two of these examples and experiments that can be

272
00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:41.299
run and have been run on them?

273
00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:47.909
Sure. Well, the first experiment that really got attention

274
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:51.669
was one done on guppies on the island of

275
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:54.789
Trinidad, done, that work was now 40, done 40

276
00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:58.030
years ago. It was uh initiated by John Eler,

277
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.960
uh, an evolutionary biologist now in Australia. And basically,

278
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.010
he was aware of previous work on these guppies.

279
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.179
So guppies, as most people know, are these colorful

280
00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:11.059
fish that you see in pet stores, and many

281
00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:15.020
people, hobbyists keep them. And, but few people know

282
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.020
where they live, and where they live is in

283
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.369
the mountainous streams of Trinidad and Northern South America.

284
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.609
And in those streams, there's an interesting pattern that

285
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.150
in Lower parts of the streams, the, the fish

286
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.030
are quite bland in coloration, but higher up in

287
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.590
the stream, higher in the mountains, the fish are

288
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:42.200
quite colorful. And it turns out that this pattern

289
00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:46.359
is associated with the presence of larger predatory fish.

290
00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:51.739
And so the idea that had been proposed was

291
00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:55.739
that uh that female guppies prefer to mate with

292
00:16:55.739 --> 00:16:58.340
males that are very colorful. We don't know why.

293
00:16:58.539 --> 00:17:00.940
It's certainly true, we now know, and that, but

294
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.940
still, still trying to figure out why, but they

295
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.339
do. And so in areas high in the mountains

296
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.858
where there are no predators, the flashiest, most colorful

297
00:17:08.858 --> 00:17:12.459
guppy male gets the most matings and passes on

298
00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:15.479
its genes. However, lower down in the stream where

299
00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:18.790
the predators occur, the males are too conspicuous, and

300
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.920
the, the predators pick them off. And so even

301
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.959
if females prefer gaudy colored males, they don't last

302
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.598
long enough, and so natural selection favors a more

303
00:17:27.598 --> 00:17:33.119
camouflaged color. Well, that's a, a reasonable hypothesis, but

304
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:36.000
as we always say in, in many aspects of

305
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.819
science, correlation does not prove causation. That's what experiments

306
00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:44.010
are for. ACTUALLY test whether the the process we

307
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.099
presume causes the correlation actually does. And so that

308
00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.150
is what Endler did. He took some guppies from

309
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.790
a pool where there were predators and they were

310
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.569
bland guppies, and he just moved them slightly up

311
00:17:55.569 --> 00:17:58.380
the stream past a waterfall that the predators couldn't

312
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.699
get, get past. So, and in fact, this pool

313
00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:04.780
was empty. So we put these bland guppies in

314
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.890
the empty pool, no predators. And just watched them.

315
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.099
And very quickly, after just a few, uh, a

316
00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:14.589
few years, the males have evolved to become quite

317
00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:18.000
colorful, just as predicted. And that experiment was then,

318
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.339
uh, repeated in other, in other pools in Trinidad,

319
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.500
also in laboratory greenhouses and, in little swimming pools,

320
00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:28.729
and the results are very consistent. And they demonstrated

321
00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:33.385
that predation is the selective pressure affecting color. AND

322
00:18:33.385 --> 00:18:36.295
guppies. And so that was a brilliant experimental program.

323
00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.505
I should say it's continued to this day, led,

324
00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:41.744
uh, particularly by David Resnick at University of California

325
00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:44.704
Riverside looking at many other features of the guppies

326
00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:48.935
and how predation affects its evolution. So that, that's,

327
00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:52.545
uh, that's probably the first really high profile experimental

328
00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:56.520
work in evolution. Experimental work on evolution in nature.

329
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.260
Um, MY own work with colleagues at the University

330
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.380
of California, Davis, and, and elsewhere on the length

331
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.699
of lizard legs. It was uh similar in scope.

332
00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:10.060
What we did is we worked in the Bahamas

333
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.260
where a very common lizard that I've spent my

334
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.380
life studying the brown aolus lizard, occurs, and the

335
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.619
brown onol occurs almost everywhere, even on tiny little

336
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:25.050
islands. And I mean, islands that are the size

337
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.699
of, uh, a pitcher's mound, well, small islands, that's

338
00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:32.219
the size of the infield on a baseball diamond

339
00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:35.780
or size of a basketball court, say. And you

340
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.500
can find these little brown and holes. And this

341
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.689
work was done in the Bahamas and on many

342
00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:45.300
of the larger islands. There's a larger lizard that

343
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.579
occurs only on the ground that uh that eats

344
00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:52.280
smaller lizards. It's called the curly tailed lizard. Excuse

345
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.209
excuse me. Now, one more thing I need to

346
00:19:55.209 --> 00:19:56.650
tell you, two more things I need to tell

347
00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.930
you. Um, THESE types of lizards, I spent my

348
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.000
career studying. There are 400 species of them throughout

349
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.250
the Caribbean islands, Central and South America, very diverse

350
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.130
group. And one feature that varies among different species

351
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.010
is how long their legs are. And moreover, there

352
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.849
is a relationship between how long their their legs

353
00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:20.089
are and the size of the. Of the branches

354
00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:22.209
they use because they're mostly up in the trees,

355
00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:24.489
though some come down to the ground. The lizards

356
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:27.930
that occur on broad surfaces have long hind limbs.

357
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.380
Ones that use narrow surfaces have short hind limbs,

358
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.239
and we actually know functionally why that may be

359
00:20:34.449 --> 00:20:36.369
that on a broad surface, like a big tree

360
00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:39.050
trunk, the longer your legs are, the faster you

361
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.770
can run because you can take longer strides. But

362
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.410
on narrow surfaces, long legs are a disadvantage because

363
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.410
it's hard to to grab the surface, and actually

364
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.729
shorter legs are more efficient. And so, for various

365
00:20:51.729 --> 00:20:55.099
reasons, it seemed that leg length in these lizards

366
00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:58.910
was an adaptation to using different surfaces. But again,

367
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.040
as I mentioned a moment ago, correlation does not

368
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.479
prove causation. The ideal thing to do is to

369
00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:08.520
do an experiment that make lizards use different surfaces

370
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.599
and see if they adapt. And so what we

371
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:13.550
did is we took these tiny islands that had

372
00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.199
the brown annoles that had long legs, no, I'm

373
00:21:16.199 --> 00:21:19.000
sorry, um, I need to tell you one other

374
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.319
thing. We, we found some islands that had no

375
00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:24.510
anols at all, small islands. That we're empty of

376
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.430
the holes. We now know the reason, and that

377
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.910
is hurricanes come through every, every now and then,

378
00:21:28.949 --> 00:21:31.079
and because the islands are, are low lying, they

379
00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:33.819
just wipe everything off. But then, if the lizards

380
00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:36.469
get there, which they do naturally colonize islands, they

381
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:38.979
can establish a population and, and persist till the

382
00:21:38.979 --> 00:21:41.319
next hurricane. So what we did is we used

383
00:21:41.319 --> 00:21:43.880
these little islands as little test tubes, and we

384
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.959
basically took the brown and owles and established them

385
00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:49.119
on these small populations. And I want to be

386
00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:51.520
clear here, the brown and Oles are native to

387
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.500
this area that we took lizards that occurred 100

388
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.599
yards away on a bigger island. And so we're

389
00:21:56.599 --> 00:22:00.400
just sim simulating the natural process of colonization, which

390
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.199
we've seen occur naturally. So we put the lizards

391
00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:08.599
on the islands. And then we um. We introduced

392
00:22:08.969 --> 00:22:11.530
the curly tail lizard, also native to the area,

393
00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:14.290
also on the next island over to half the

394
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.300
islands, uh, deciding randomly which which islands got curly

395
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.729
tail lizards and which ones didn't. And the reason

396
00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:24.130
we did that is that we expected that the

397
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.530
brown and Os would use the ground a lot.

398
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.310
In the absence of curly tail lizards, but when

399
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.150
we introduced these predators, which basically only use the

400
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.469
ground, the lizards would move up into the bushes

401
00:22:35.469 --> 00:22:37.989
to get away from them. And moving up in

402
00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.750
the bushes, they would have to use the narrow

403
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.430
surfaces, because these were islands that didn't have very

404
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.430
thick vegetation. And so the predators were a way

405
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.310
of, of causing the lizards to change their habitat

406
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.109
use. And the question is, once they're up in

407
00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:53.170
the, in the, in the bushes, using the narrow

408
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.949
surfaces, would they evolve shorter legs? And the answer

409
00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:00.060
is yes, they did. We measured, we could measure

410
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.270
uh natural selection. It was quite strong on limb

411
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.339
length, and over, uh relatively short periods of time,

412
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.510
lizards did evolve shorter legs to use the narrow

413
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.060
surfaces. So those are 22 of the first studies

414
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.810
that, that tested evolutionary hypotheses experimentally in the field.

415
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.459
Now that this approach has become much more common,

416
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.260
and many people are, are looking at a wide

417
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.319
variety of organisms in many different contexts to, to

418
00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:26.660
ask these sort of questions.

419
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:32.469
That's really fascinating. And what brings about variation in

420
00:23:32.469 --> 00:23:36.680
evolution? Is it simply mutation or are there other

421
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.869
factors?

422
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.420
Well, mutation is the ultimate source of variation, and

423
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.339
we know that it occurs, although any given mutation

424
00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.119
occurring in any individual is very uncommon, but given

425
00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:53.020
enough enough individuals in a population in enough years,

426
00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:56.619
mutations occur all the time. And so that is

427
00:23:56.619 --> 00:24:00.400
the. The ultimate source of variation, but another process

428
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.670
I mentioned earlier is genetic exchange among populations that,

429
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.280
uh, a mutation may occur in one population and

430
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.400
then subsequently an individual from that population migrates to

431
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.280
another uh another population bringing that, uh, variation with

432
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.780
it. So gene flow in a more, uh. In

433
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.699
the moment is a much more potent force of

434
00:24:21.699 --> 00:24:25.069
variation than mutation, but mutation is where the, the

435
00:24:25.069 --> 00:24:29.119
variation comes from, uh, eventually or initially.

436
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.130
Right. What factors play a role in speciation and

437
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.689
the diversification of species?

438
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.140
Well, this is a topic that has long been

439
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.979
controversial, and the more we learn, uh, we learn

440
00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:43.900
more, but there's still a lot of debate. But

441
00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:47.380
I would say the two main processes, and the

442
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.060
question is. How important each one is. First is

443
00:24:51.069 --> 00:24:57.089
isolation. Two populations that do not exchange genes, uh,

444
00:24:57.449 --> 00:25:02.010
they can diverge for many reasons, so that eventually

445
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.010
they become different species. And by different species, I

446
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.890
refer to the classic definition of a species being

447
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:14.209
two populations that cannot successfully interbreed. And so the

448
00:25:14.209 --> 00:25:18.119
more populations. Just evolve differently, the more likely they

449
00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:22.479
are to evolve differences that keep them from interbreeding.

450
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.599
Now, the other factor is natural selection, that we

451
00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:30.760
know that populations that adapt to different environments or

452
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.079
adapt in different ways may uh evolve again so

453
00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:38.920
they can't interbreed, not because they're evolving necessarily for

454
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.760
that reason, but just a consequence of different adaptations.

455
00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:45.020
So those are the two main factors. The real

456
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.209
debate that occurs is, do you, do you need

457
00:25:49.209 --> 00:25:55.579
isolation? If, if, if natural selection is favoring two

458
00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:58.819
different types in the same population, can they evolve

459
00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:02.260
into different species without being isolated? Or will the

460
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.540
genetic exchange between them prevent them from diverging? And

461
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.300
that's a topic that has been controversial for half

462
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.219
a half a century, and, and the debate still

463
00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:11.689
continues.

464
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.069
I understand. Uh, AND how fast can evolutionary change

465
00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:21.310
occur? Do we really need, I don't know, thousands

466
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.189
of years, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of

467
00:26:24.189 --> 00:26:27.069
years for evolutionary change to occur?

468
00:26:27.949 --> 00:26:31.670
Well, no, certainly not for adaptive change. We've, we've

469
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.869
seen that that can occur in years. Uh, DEPENDS

470
00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:37.989
on the generation, length of the organism. It will

471
00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:40.949
be faster in fruit flies and elephants then, but

472
00:26:40.949 --> 00:26:46.069
evolution can occur very rapidly. Speciation, of one species

473
00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:48.430
turning into another or one species splitting into two

474
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.260
species. Takes longer. Uh, OCCASIONALLY it can occur pretty

475
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.099
quickly, but in most cases, it's a longer process.

476
00:26:57.689 --> 00:27:01.880
How predictable is evolution? I mean, is to what

477
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.010
extent can we predict evolution?

478
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.050
That is another controversial question. You are full of

479
00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:14.650
controversial questions of. It depends in part on the

480
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.290
scale of what you're asking. If uh, if you

481
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.199
put a, well, I, I, as I've told you,

482
00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:25.469
experiments in, in the laboratory with fruit flies or

483
00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:29.869
or other organisms, if you select. On some trait

484
00:27:30.709 --> 00:27:33.680
You can usually get a change in that trait

485
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.719
and usually. One you could predict, uh, if you

486
00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:41.050
select for larger wings, larger wings will evolve. Now,

487
00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:44.760
if you, if you try to I say how

488
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.599
the larger wings will evolve, that can be less

489
00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:51.619
predictable is it that they evolve, uh. Well, you

490
00:27:51.619 --> 00:27:53.020
would have to talk about the structure of the

491
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.619
wing, but there are different ways that a wing

492
00:27:54.619 --> 00:27:57.180
can be large. And can you predict, if you

493
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.260
just predict, if you just select on larger wings,

494
00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:01.540
can you predict how the larger wings will be

495
00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.239
constructed? Maybe not so much. So, um, So the

496
00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:10.319
less, there, there's a lot of wiggle room and

497
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:13.989
even in the short term of the details of

498
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.319
how evolution occurs, and over longer periods or more

499
00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:22.680
substantial changes, evolute, this is the argument that Gould

500
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.680
and people like him would argue, no, you can't

501
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.109
predict it, unexpected things will happen, asteroids will hit.

502
00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:32.119
A major mutation you couldn't predict will occur that

503
00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:35.229
will send evolution in a different direction. Other people

504
00:28:35.229 --> 00:28:40.469
argue that no, there are best solutions to problems

505
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:43.560
posed by the environment and that populations will find

506
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.579
those best solutions. They would argue there might be

507
00:28:45.579 --> 00:28:47.699
a best way to build a large fruit fly

508
00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:51.400
wing, and populations will evolve that best way. And

509
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.060
this is a, this is the debate between Gould

510
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.609
and his detractors.

511
00:28:56.689 --> 00:29:00.229
Mhm. Are the life forms we find on earth

512
00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:06.699
mostly inevitabilities, or are they mostly evolutionary flukes?

513
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.780
Well, that, I mean that gets to the heart

514
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.099
of the question that Gould was famous in his,

515
00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:15.750
uh, his fabulous book that laid out his ideas.

516
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.670
There's a book for the general public that I

517
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.719
highly recommend to everyone called Wonderful Life. Uh, HE

518
00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:23.959
said something to the effect of, uh, if we

519
00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:26.719
could rewind the tape of life. This is a

520
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:29.640
metaphor that increasingly as tapes no longer exist, no

521
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.750
one understands it. But if you could go back

522
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.780
in time and start again, Would you get the

523
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.469
same outcome? And in particular he says would humans

524
00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:43.739
have evolved? And his answer was absolutely not. All

525
00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:48.140
kinds of random things happen asteroids and ice ages

526
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.380
and, well, just random things that could send evolution

527
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.569
in a different direction. And so the particular path

528
00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:59.680
that evolution occurred. It is unpredictable. Now, there are

529
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.760
other people influenced by the ubiquity of convergent evolution

530
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.219
who take the opposite view. They, they argue that

531
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.119
That there are best solutions that natural selection drives

532
00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:15.540
for, and the human form is one of those,

533
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.160
those uh, those best solutions. And so they argued

534
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.880
that the evolution, perhaps not of humans exactly like

535
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.800
us, but of human-like organisms was inevitable. And in

536
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.540
fact, there is a, uh, a, a very fun

537
00:30:31.869 --> 00:30:35.479
example of this that someone has has suggested a

538
00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:38.510
guy named uh Simon Conway Morris, a very prominent

539
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:44.939
paleontologist from England, uh, A different paleontologist years ago

540
00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:51.489
pointed out that through time, life brain size tended

541
00:30:51.489 --> 00:30:53.510
to increase. If you just looked at the brains

542
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.150
of the first vertebrates 500 million years ago and

543
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.869
just plotted brain size through time, there has been

544
00:30:58.869 --> 00:31:02.050
an increase. And this was true. Even in the

545
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.410
age of dinosaurs, as dinosaurs evolved from their origin

546
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.650
240 million years ago till they disappeared, the brain

547
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.489
size got bigger, and it turns out that this

548
00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:17.770
paleontologist discovered a type of dinosaur very similar to

549
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.810
Velociraptor, the famous raptor from the Jurassic Park movies

550
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.810
that have the largest brain relative to body size.

551
00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:30.359
Of any dinosaur that existed, it occurred right before

552
00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:33.760
the asteroid hit. And if you think about Velociraptor

553
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.359
and its relatives, here's an animal that walked on

554
00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:39.319
two hind legs. It had grasping hands. Remember in

555
00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:41.449
the first Jurassic Park movie, it, it turns the

556
00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:45.079
doorknob up and had a big brain with eyes

557
00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:48.280
forward, kind of like us. And so what this

558
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.359
paleontologist had suggested was that dinosaurs were on the

559
00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:57.670
way to producing a humanoid type, very intelligent organism.

560
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.280
And he even sketched out how that evolution might

561
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.520
have proceeded. Very fanciful. I mean a fun idea.

562
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.729
Well, Simon Conway Morris has cited this as evidence

563
00:32:08.729 --> 00:32:13.449
that if the asteroid had not hit Earth, the

564
00:32:13.449 --> 00:32:18.000
mammals would not have flourished. Us human mammal humans

565
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.839
would not have evolved. But something like us would

566
00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:23.469
have evolved from dinosaurs, and so he was arguing

567
00:32:23.469 --> 00:32:29.060
that. The evolution of a human-like organism was inevitable.

568
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.469
Uh, SO that's the debate. Gould would have said,

569
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.150
nope, we're just a lucky fluke, and if things

570
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.739
had happened differently, if that asteroid hadn't hit Earth,

571
00:32:37.109 --> 00:32:39.420
humans are nothing like us would ever have appeared.

572
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:44.349
Simon Morris argues we're inevitable. Now, I think that

573
00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:47.670
um most people would lean more to Gould's side

574
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.880
on this than Conway Morris's, but not every, everyone,

575
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.760
and Many people would be in the middle on

576
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.599
this debate. I haven't even answered your question yet,

577
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.040
and that question is, what about life on other

578
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.199
planets? You know, I think that's what you were

579
00:33:00.199 --> 00:33:03.800
asking. Um, WERE you asking that? Should I address

580
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.640
that question?

581
00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:07.560
Uh, I, I mean, before we get to that,

582
00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:10.119
because I also have that question here to ask

583
00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:13.839
you, let me just ask a more, uh, another

584
00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:16.599
kind of question. So, uh, I mean this is

585
00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:20.109
something that you mentioned related to Gould's work, but.

586
00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:27.050
Then if we replayed life's tape again, should we

587
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.930
expect the same results or not?

588
00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:36.479
Well, it depends on how uh deterministic. So, Gould

589
00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:40.589
would say no, Conway Morris would say yes, uh,

590
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.790
to some extent, you could argue, if we Went

591
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.380
back in time and everything were exactly the same

592
00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:51.699
well then it would have played out. The same

593
00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:55.020
way that because everything would occur exactly the same

594
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.390
way. Uh, YOU know, the raindrops would have fallen

595
00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.319
in the same way, the comets would have hit

596
00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:03.369
the planet or not, and so on, the asteroids,

597
00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:08.639
uh. And there's a long philosophical debate on this

598
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.280
topic. There are some people who would argue that

599
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.679
there is truly indeterminacy in life, that at the

600
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.800
quantum mechanic level, how, you know, where an electron

601
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.040
is and so on is indeterminate. So that if

602
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.510
you went back in time and started up again,

603
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.879
that source of indeterminacy might lead the events that

604
00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:34.688
occur through time to be different. And so, the

605
00:34:34.688 --> 00:34:38.049
possibility that something different could happen does exist, that

606
00:34:38.049 --> 00:34:41.128
the asteroid would miss Earth instead of hitting, or

607
00:34:41.128 --> 00:34:44.790
other events would be at least subtly different. So

608
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.080
that suggests that there is a scope because If,

609
00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.050
if, if the events were deterministic, then of course

610
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.330
life would have to follow the same path if

611
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.969
every atom was in the same place. But if

612
00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.050
that's not the case, there is the possibility for

613
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.010
evolution taking different courses, and Gould would argue that

614
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.689
it would. Conway Morris would argue, no, that wouldn't

615
00:35:04.689 --> 00:35:09.530
matter because natural selection, the, the favored, uh, types

616
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.570
would remain the same. The, the favored solutions to

617
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.409
the problems posed by the environment.

618
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.770
And is it possible for us to ever be

619
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.010
certain of the correct answer there?

620
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:25.800
Well, Yes and no. The, the interesting thing about

621
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.399
this is Gould's, Gould idea, let's go back in

622
00:35:28.399 --> 00:35:31.120
time, replay the tape. He then said, but of

623
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.439
course, that's impossible. This is just a gedanken experiment,

624
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.120
a German word. This is just a thought experiment.

625
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.129
But in fact, people have come up with two

626
00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:43.800
ways of testing Gould's idea. One is to look

627
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.260
at convergent evolution, at the fossil record and consider

628
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:53.409
the evolution that and consider uh different species experiencing

629
00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:56.250
the same environment to sort of be like replaying

630
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.729
the tape. If they're experiencing the same environment, do

631
00:35:58.729 --> 00:36:01.250
they evolve in the same way? That's one way,

632
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:05.030
of course, it's a little indirect. The other way

633
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:09.830
is some fabulous laboratory evolution experiments where people have

634
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.909
taken uh populations of microbes such as E. COLI

635
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:19.489
and taken genetically identical populations and split them into

636
00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:26.030
multiple subpopulations, so they start out completely identical. And

637
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.870
then you put them in a new environment, not

638
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.389
when they're adapted to. And you ask, do these

639
00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:37.939
identical, these initially identical populations experiencing the same environment,

640
00:36:37.949 --> 00:36:40.030
absolutely the same, as much as we can control

641
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.550
it in a lab environment, do they evolve in

642
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.780
the same way? And uh one of the greatest

643
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.540
experiments in the history of science was the first

644
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.739
to do this. It was a project by a

645
00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:54.060
researcher named Richard Lensky at Michigan State University and

646
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.679
many colleagues. Well, they did exactly what I described,

647
00:36:57.969 --> 00:37:00.570
and what's fabulous about this experiment is it has

648
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.889
continued now for more than 30 years. Yes, more

649
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:06.320
than 30 years, and so they have been able

650
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.879
to follow evolution in these microbes for, I think,

651
00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:15.090
now over 80,000 generations, for 12 populations. Again, they

652
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.320
started all identical. They've been exposed to the same

653
00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:22.250
environment, but they've evolved independently, and the results have

654
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.169
been spectacular. What they've found is That as a

655
00:37:26.169 --> 00:37:29.110
generality they have evolved in the same way in

656
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.469
many respects, but in a few key ways they

657
00:37:32.469 --> 00:37:36.169
have not, and there have been one particular major

658
00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:39.469
adaptation that evolved in only one of the 12

659
00:37:39.469 --> 00:37:43.790
populations. It evolved at about 30,000 generations and in

660
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.229
the subsequent 50,000 more generations, none of the other

661
00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:52.139
11 populations have evolved this adaptation, showing that. Even

662
00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:55.860
in as constant situations could be created in the

663
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.689
environment, something different happened in one population, something major

664
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:05.699
different. So, those are such experiments are the closest

665
00:38:05.699 --> 00:38:07.580
we can get to actually testing the idea of

666
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.500
replaying the tape.

667
00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:13.360
Right. So let us delve into the question of

668
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.669
life on other planets, then, which will be my

669
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:19.520
last question. Uh, SO can all of these tell

670
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.120
us anything about life on other planets and what,

671
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.830
what it might look like?

672
00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:27.590
Well, this is, this is a, a fun question.

673
00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:30.560
Uh, IF you look at science fiction movies, um,

674
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.290
Star Wars, Star Trek, whatever, uh, uh, uh, the,

675
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.199
the Pandora, was those movies, uh, Avatar, those movies.

676
00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:42.840
You know, the, the life on other planets is

677
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.120
remarkably similar as it's portrayed, uh, in these movies

678
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.399
to life on Earth. Uh, YOU know, a little

679
00:38:49.399 --> 00:38:51.639
bit different, maybe an extra eye in the forehead

680
00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:54.959
or maybe only 3 fingers, but they're basically humans

681
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:56.840
and other animals we're familiar with. I, I thought

682
00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.639
that was, uh, really funny in the first Avatar

683
00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:03.679
movie. They were just Either living organisms or extinct

684
00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:05.520
ones, you know, but with an extra pair of

685
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.320
legs or something else, but they were completely recognizable

686
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.879
life forms. And I think that the uh underlying

687
00:39:13.879 --> 00:39:17.560
idea is that, well, life will evolve in the

688
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.659
same way on other planets. I think that's ridiculous.

689
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:26.379
Um, FOR one thing, You know, even though we

690
00:39:26.379 --> 00:39:30.459
now understand that there are many planets around other

691
00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:33.820
stars in the universe, even in our galaxy, that

692
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.500
are somewhat similar to Earth, they're not identical to

693
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.610
Earth. They're undoubtedly different in all kinds of ways.

694
00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.739
And so the likelihood that they would, uh, that

695
00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:47.300
the natural selection, if it operated, would occur in

696
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.340
the same way, is very low because the actual

697
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.100
environments would be different. And um, There's no telling

698
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.939
that natural selection would work, that natural selection works,

699
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.780
causes evolution because of the particular way that, that

700
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.870
traits are inherited due to DNA in On earth,

701
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.929
but DNA, there could be other ways of inheritance.

702
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.560
There could be multiple sexes. Oh, you know, I

703
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.199
know this is a controversial topic, but there could

704
00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:21.139
be Multiple sexes that all have to unite to

705
00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:23.699
reproduce more than, more than the sperm and the

706
00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:26.570
egg. There could be all kinds of different uh

707
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:29.739
ways that that evolution occurs that would shape it

708
00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:33.729
in different ways. And frankly, I think that much

709
00:40:33.729 --> 00:40:35.739
of the research, when we go to Mars or

710
00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:39.560
whatever to try to detect life. Uh, IT'S detecting

711
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.000
life by signs that indicate life on Earth, and

712
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.239
I think there's a little bit of a lack

713
00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:50.050
of imagination in And uh In failing to, to,

714
00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.750
to investigate whether life could be based on something

715
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:57.010
other than carbon atoms or take different forms. And

716
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.899
if that were the case, Life might be radically

717
00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:02.699
different. Uh, I like the minority of science fiction

718
00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:06.030
films in which. Life on other planets is, you

719
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.629
know, completely unlike life on, on our planet. And

720
00:41:10.629 --> 00:41:13.189
um, I think, personally, I think that's much more

721
00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:15.969
likely. And there are some people who are researching

722
00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:18.959
this sort of idea. The the problem is If

723
00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:21.600
life has occurred in some different way, we may

724
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.919
not even be able to recognize it. We might

725
00:41:23.919 --> 00:41:26.060
not know what to look for and may not

726
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.350
recognize it when we see it. So my guess

727
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.120
is that life on other planets will not be

728
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.790
very familiar to us at all for a number

729
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.439
of reasons.

730
00:41:36.989 --> 00:41:40.620
Great. So the book is again Improbable Destinies Fate,

731
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.820
Chance, and the Future of Evolution, and I'm leaving

732
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.100
a link to it in the description of the

733
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.860
interview and Dr. Losses, just before we go apart

734
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.810
from the book, where can people find your work

735
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.770
on the internet?

736
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.199
Well, um, I have a website that has copies

737
00:41:57.199 --> 00:41:59.139
of lots of my papers. Last name is L

738
00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.739
O S O S. AND it's an unusual last

739
00:42:01.739 --> 00:42:03.570
name, so it's not that hard to Google me.

740
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.889
That's probably the best way or go to Google

741
00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:08.929
Scholar or just, uh, you know, Google my name

742
00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:10.739
and, and a lot of my research will come

743
00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:11.129
up.

744
00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:14.659
OK, great. So thank you so much for taking

745
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:16.260
