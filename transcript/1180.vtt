00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.750
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.800
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops, and

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.449
today I'm here with Olivia Bentley. She's a porn

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.159
star, a NASCART, a fitness influencer, a sex therapist,

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.489
and she also has a master's degree in education.

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.825
So today we're going to. Talk basically about her

7
00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:23.825
life as a sex worker and some of the

8
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:27.024
ideas she has about sex work and what she

9
00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:30.764
thinks about some of the assumptions people make about

10
00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.654
sex workers. So Olivia, welcome to the show. It's

11
00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:35.125
a huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.615
Thank you. Likewise, Ricardo. Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.470
Yeah, so tell us first, I mean, to start

14
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.740
off with, uh, tell us a little bit about

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.180
your background. I mean, how you got into sex

16
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.779
work, the kind of sex work you do, even

17
00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.139
though I've already spoiled a little bit of that

18
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.759
in the introduction and your work as a sex

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.520
therapist.

20
00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.500
Sure, um, well, certainly it didn't, I, I didn't

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.260
like wake up, you know, um, I didn't wake

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.620
up as a child and think that I was

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.220
going to be here. Life happened, um, you know,

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.050
if we want to be realistic about life, but,

25
00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.339
um, I was getting a divorce from my ex

26
00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.959
and my son was very young and my ex

27
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.339
was weak. He's an alcoholic. And sadly, we are

28
00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:29.830
both like the same age and he's on kidney

29
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.569
dialysis right now, just to give you an idea

30
00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:36.470
of where we went in terms of growth. And

31
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.430
so he wasn't growing and I was trying my

32
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.230
damnedest to get him to clean up and be

33
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.269
a father. And I was a stay at home

34
00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:48.110
and I was actually getting my doctorates, my doctorate's

35
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.089
in jurisprudence. I was going to become a lawyer.

36
00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.610
Um, AND so very interesting. Yeah, because since then

37
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.529
I've met so many of them as clients and

38
00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.089
they're like, Oh, please don't. You're better off where

39
00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:02.809
you're at. So they're all working 60 hour weeks

40
00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:04.930
and they have health problems and they're like, Girl,

41
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.680
you make just as much money as me. Stay

42
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.889
where you're at. So, but, so I kind of

43
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.009
was at this point where I needed to, I

44
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.250
stayed too long and it wasn't good for my

45
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.369
son. So I decided I'm going to just make

46
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.210
a move and I'm going to boldly go out

47
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.660
there. Um, AND try to do my own thing.

48
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.050
And so I went to the sex industry thinking

49
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.929
it would just be short term, and I'll continue

50
00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.570
to get my degree and move on and whatever

51
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.850
I decide to do. And that's what happened. I

52
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.770
stayed for, for quite a while and I've done

53
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.449
different things, but, um, I, we tend, like, there's

54
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.649
an old saying in the industry, oh, she'll be

55
00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.410
back. A girl gets mad and says, I'm out

56
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.809
of here. And the girls will kind of giggle

57
00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.770
and say she'll be back, give it a month.

58
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.639
She'll go out there in the real world and

59
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.449
find out how, how good she's got it in,

60
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.850
in some ways comparatively. Um, BUT that's all, you

61
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.449
know, that's all, uh. Up to the eye of

62
00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.889
the beholder, of what, of what they, of what

63
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.770
they like and they prefer in their day to

64
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.559
day and who they wanna work with and what

65
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.889
they wanna deal with. Um, BUT we don't always

66
00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.809
have it so bad. It's kind of interesting. Uh,

67
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.830
THE perceptions people have.

68
00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.809
Yeah, it's really interesting, and, and I mean, let

69
00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.149
me just ask you this because I'm really curious.

70
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.009
Before you got into sex work and the porn

71
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.740
industry. Um, DID you have any role models? I

72
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.740
mean, were there, for example, any female porn stars

73
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740
or other kinds of sex, sex workers who you

74
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100
looked up to and thought, oh, I, I want,

75
00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.380
I would really like to be like her. I

76
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740
mean, did you have any influences or not

77
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.179
at all? My, my ex-husband and I enjoyed watching

78
00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.259
porn together. Um, I thought, you know, who I

79
00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.179
thought was really, really hot and cool at the

80
00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.270
time. Um, WHAT is it? What is her name?

81
00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.410
Um, GOSH, she's a millionaire, but then she got

82
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.250
on drugs. Jenna Jamison. Do you know who that

83
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.289
is? Oh, oh, yes, yeah. OK. So when she

84
00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.860
was early when she started and she didn't lose

85
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.649
all that weight and whatever she's done with the

86
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.750
drugs, and I feel really bad for her because

87
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.690
at the time when we were watching her, she

88
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.649
was like at the top of her game. She

89
00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.630
decided to become her own owner. She wasn't going

90
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.190
to. Allow these producers to kind of live off

91
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.269
of, off of her skin per se, and she

92
00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:27.470
started her own production company and made millions on

93
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.790
her own. And I thought it was that business

94
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.750
intelligence about her that I found attractive at the

95
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.170
time. And I thought, well, that's inspiring, a woman

96
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.309
that's going to start running the show for herself

97
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.510
and make her own money for herself and not

98
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.589
get, not get exploited in that. I mean, we're

99
00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:45.109
choosing to exploit ourselves, but we should be getting

100
00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:47.910
the majority of the fruit of our labor for

101
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.529
doing so.

102
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.320
Yeah, I mean, actually, when you, before I asked

103
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.709
you the question, I was imagining, imagining that you

104
00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:59.200
would be saying someone or mentioning the name of

105
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.720
someone like Kendra Lust or someone like that just

106
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.959
because she's also very much into fitness, so, but

107
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.160
I mean, that was just the name that came

108
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.980
to mind, so.

109
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.459
To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure

110
00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:13.359
I've heard of Kendra Lust, but I have to

111
00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:16.839
be totally honest with you. Um, THIS has not

112
00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.119
been. A lifestyle choice for me. This has been

113
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.839
a career choice. So, although I've enjoyed watching some

114
00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.160
porn and I'll get off to it here and

115
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.399
there, I really don't even know who's who, and

116
00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.799
I really don't give a shit. But, um, but

117
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.279
I mean they're all hot and they're all great

118
00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.239
and I, and probably today I'd work with one,

119
00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.480
I'd work with anybody, but you know, I just

120
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.559
really pay attention to who's who in the, in

121
00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.739
the world, and yet here I am in it

122
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.540
and I'm making a name for myself despite.

123
00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:50.279
Yeah, sure. So, and a bit about sex therapy.

124
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.540
I mean, tell us about that. What kind of

125
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.959
work do you do there?

126
00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.540
Well, um, just, you know, as an escort, as

127
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.820
a companion, um, as a professional, we do, it's

128
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.149
kind of like High-end luxury, it's a high-end luxury

129
00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.660
service where you can come in and relax, get

130
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.209
your physical needs met, but some people wanna talk.

131
00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:18.600
And so, um, over the years, I mean, I'm

132
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.109
just there to be a, like your best friend,

133
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.880
like, you know, whatever you want me to be

134
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.600
for that hour or two days, your wife, your

135
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.920
girlfriend, your, your bestie. We are, you get to

136
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.799
lay it all out on the line and be

137
00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:32.880
yourself and open up in the bedroom in ways

138
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.339
that other people don't know you like that, right?

139
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.309
And so it's pretty cool. And so what will

140
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.799
happen is it'll open Pandora's box and people will

141
00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:45.109
get very comfortable. Expressing things to me. And so

142
00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:47.970
over the years, like, for example, I would have

143
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.029
soldiers from Iraq. They, they were in the Iraq

144
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.790
War. For a while, they were coming in and

145
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.750
seeing me and there's, and so such messed up

146
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.829
stories and these wonderful men that put their lives

147
00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:02.500
on the line, that went out and sacrificed for

148
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.425
us, and now they're coming back. With some mental

149
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.325
issues. And they're describing, well, suddenly something triggered me

150
00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:11.205
and suddenly I was in my car and then

151
00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.045
I got pulled over. I don't even remember what

152
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:15.085
happened, but it was some kind of post trauma

153
00:07:15.085 --> 00:07:17.765
circumstance, and then they end up in jail. So

154
00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:20.626
that kind of stuff really upset me and letting

155
00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:23.045
them just open up and lay it all out,

156
00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:25.566
even if, you know, that maybe they'll cry or

157
00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:27.522
whatever. What have you. I've even had somebody give

158
00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:29.861
me a Purple Heart. You know, that's how much

159
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.661
I meant to them, just getting to come and

160
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:33.941
see me on the regular and open up. And

161
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:36.302
that's why I decided to give um people in

162
00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:39.462
law enforcement and military 25% off. I have a

163
00:07:39.462 --> 00:07:43.421
25% anytime discount that I've had for years that

164
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.261
I'm known for, um, due to, due to stuff

165
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:49.342
like that. So, when people come in and open

166
00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:52.671
up like that and then they leave really relieved.

167
00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:54.269
You know, it's like, my God, it's like I

168
00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:57.149
just had this awesome therapy session, lady. We got

169
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.790
to get it on. You're gorgeous. You took good

170
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.869
care of me. You gave me a massage. I

171
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:03.510
got, I felt so comfortable. I got to open

172
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.510
up and talk about some things that really make

173
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.489
me uncomfortable that I wouldn't really want to talk

174
00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:12.269
with anybody else about. Then I'll coin the phrase,

175
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.260
this was like therapeutic for me. So I have

176
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.019
made mention of that. And at one point it

177
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.760
went, that mentioning went viral. And so that's why

178
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.089
I got the reputation as the sex therapist that

179
00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.290
some people will. Laugh at and mock, which is

180
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.570
that's fine, you know, by all means, you know,

181
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.080
let's, let's laugh about some stuff too. But there

182
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.489
truly is a therapeutic value to to seeing somebody

183
00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:40.489
and spending quality time and having good intimacy with

184
00:08:40.489 --> 00:08:40.950
a woman.

185
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.770
Yeah, and the thing is, is that people have

186
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.570
many assumptions about the kinds of men that pursue

187
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.479
sex workers, that I mean, pay for sex, but

188
00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:56.200
I mean, what Uh, I mean, do you, do

189
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.710
you have any sort of, uh, let's say, uh,

190
00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:04.309
portrait of the typical men that approaches you in,

191
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.719
uh, to pay for sex? I mean, are they

192
00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:11.219
just regular men or as we sometimes hear from

193
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.919
people who are against sex workers like conservatives and

194
00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:20.353
certain kinds of Feminists that men who pursue or

195
00:09:20.362 --> 00:09:25.213
or men who pay for sex are just losers

196
00:09:25.213 --> 00:09:28.163
who can't get a woman and they are abusers

197
00:09:28.163 --> 00:09:30.492
and accusations like that.

198
00:09:30.932 --> 00:09:34.732
No, it's, it's, it's literally across the board. It

199
00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:38.492
is across the board 100%. So it's whatever you're.

200
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:41.705
Wanting, for me, it's it's whomever I'm willing to

201
00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:44.306
spend time with. And I'm not going to spend

202
00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:48.546
time with some piece of crap abuser. Sorry. I

203
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.346
mean, they'll they'll they'll come to book girls and

204
00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:52.945
what have you, but it's really up to the

205
00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:56.026
girl, what kind of backbone, what is she made

206
00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:58.625
out of character wise, as far as who she's

207
00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.659
going to take on as a client. And so

208
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:05.460
my guys are extremely normal, um, and I have

209
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.020
married clients too, like, like couples that they want

210
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.580
to partake together, you know, conservatives, a ton of

211
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.260
conservatives. I did the Candace Owens show and I,

212
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.619
I got a whole slew of conservatives that just

213
00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:21.460
feel comfortable meeting me, you know, just the way

214
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.344
I Articulate, um, and so I, I have a

215
00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:28.585
lot of conservative clients, um, a lot of law

216
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:31.765
enforcement due to and military due to that, uh,

217
00:10:32.224 --> 00:10:35.385
that discount that I'll hand out. But just everybody

218
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.885
from across the board, your mailman, your, your lawyer,

219
00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:43.905
you know, normal decent people, um, that for whatever

220
00:10:43.905 --> 00:10:45.984
reason they're wanting, you know, for them it's a,

221
00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:48.145
it's a luxury thing or maybe it's a stress

222
00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:51.760
reliever, what have you. And they, and as much

223
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.919
as these guys work, they deserve it. They work.

224
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.840
Everybody's working so much. Every time I ask, you

225
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.520
know, what do you do? I work. What do

226
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520
you do for fun? I work. Like, God, I

227
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.359
meet a lot of working businessmen. So, and, you

228
00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:09.320
know, here we are in America, it's America, baby.

229
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.799
So what do you think? What, what are you

230
00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.659
doing? We're working.

231
00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:14.770
Yeah, and I mean it's interesting that you mentioned

232
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.549
the Candace Owen show, the episode you did there,

233
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.450
because, uh, and you mentioned that you have some

234
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.210
conservative clients because I mean the I listened to

235
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.729
that episode and the entire show, she was trying

236
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.960
to paint you as a bad person, as someone

237
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.929
who was, I mean, mentally flawed in some weird

238
00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:39.234
way, in some weird. Weird conservative kind of approach,

239
00:11:39.255 --> 00:11:41.455
and I mean we can we can get into

240
00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:44.294
that a little bit more later, but I mean

241
00:11:44.294 --> 00:11:47.734
that was the kind of take I was getting

242
00:11:47.734 --> 00:11:50.335
from her. That was the kind of energy I

243
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.614
was getting from her. Did you feel that at

244
00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:52.875
all?

245
00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:57.025
Or yeah, it was pre it was totally preconceived.

246
00:11:57.094 --> 00:12:00.575
It was, she didn't do that naturally. What she

247
00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:04.070
did was After we met on the Whatever podcast,

248
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.229
and I kind of, um, gave her, I was

249
00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:08.909
pretty quiet. Uh, I just thought the Whatever podcast

250
00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:10.760
was kind of, it was a little immature in

251
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.590
a way, just the forum. Um, BUT I gave

252
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.669
her a little kickback on some of the stuff

253
00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.809
that she was saying because she was just there

254
00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:22.020
to be, to, to kick it up and insult

255
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.335
us and get and get things going. Get the

256
00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:27.065
controversy going, get the girls mad, get the girls

257
00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.784
raging so he would have a good tagline for

258
00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:34.065
his bit. Um, AND then she, I called her

259
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:35.825
or I got a hold of her. I emailed

260
00:12:35.825 --> 00:12:38.534
her and then the producer got a hold of

261
00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:42.025
me within 24 hours and said we will fly

262
00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:44.445
you out this week and I was very surprised

263
00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:47.190
to hear back so quick. She at the time

264
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.590
was pregnant, and she was just like, do anytime.

265
00:12:50.789 --> 00:12:52.510
So it was like, wow, but I was a

266
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.229
little intimidated just to fly out a day or

267
00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:56.750
two on a dime. So I said, give me,

268
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.710
give me till next week. And then, but the

269
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.349
whole premise, I said, this is what I want

270
00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:04.229
to do. I was in varsity debate. I was

271
00:13:04.229 --> 00:13:06.364
going to become a lawyer. Lawyer. And when we

272
00:13:06.364 --> 00:13:09.844
were in varsity debate, we, we debated policies and

273
00:13:09.844 --> 00:13:12.325
she's, she's a debater, right? That's where she got

274
00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:15.065
her start with with Charlie Kirk, um, going over

275
00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.085
to the colleges. So I said, you go get

276
00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:21.424
your evidence against prostitution. I'll get my evidence for,

277
00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:25.005
and let's have a little mash up. That's not,

278
00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.804
of course, what they did. They said, can we

279
00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:29.325
get your speaker notes the night before? And I,

280
00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:31.809
and I'm like, no. You can't have my speaker

281
00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:34.969
notes the night before. What she did was she

282
00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:37.489
went and had her staff run a background check

283
00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:41.059
on me and she got the wrong woman. And

284
00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:43.219
the whole idea was to get a bunch of

285
00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:45.380
dirt on me and then slam me once I

286
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.460
came in. And so they've done a background check

287
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.099
on a woman who was, who has a child

288
00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:53.539
who lives in another state. And my child, my

289
00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:56.780
son's always been awarded to me. He's always been

290
00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.940
with me. He's, he's my, he's my man. He's

291
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.080
always been with me. Like we're super close. So,

292
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.859
um, she starts out in the interview, so you're

293
00:14:05.859 --> 00:14:08.299
estranged from your son. He lives in another state.

294
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.640
That's the first thing.

295
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.960
Oh my God.

296
00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:14.950
So I'm like, oh boy, here we go. She's

297
00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:16.690
going to come up with a bunch of wild

298
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.169
stuff. So just get ready. She's going to come

299
00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:22.929
at you. So, um, and I think if I

300
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.609
were to do it again, I would have said,

301
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.289
hey, I thought based on what I spoke with

302
00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:29.090
the producer, we were going to have an actual

303
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.750
debate. I've got my speaker notes here and maybe

304
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.530
held our feet to the fire a little bit

305
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.809
more on expectations because that was a switch in

306
00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:41.849
bait. Um, BUT those, so, some of the, I

307
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:43.559
mean, that's how it works sometimes with those interviews.

308
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.650
You gotta be careful if you wanna, you know,

309
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.369
these got you folks that are, are using you

310
00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:52.400
for clickbait, um, so, and I decided to brave

311
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.750
it, so I knew what I was getting into.

312
00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:55.900
Yeah,

313
00:14:56.849 --> 00:14:59.330
yeah, I, I mean, we're definitely going to address

314
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.010
some of the accusations she made there or some

315
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.530
of the assumptions she came up with because they

316
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.250
are actually not original at all. I mean, it's

317
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.409
actually what we tend to hear in debates with

318
00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:16.729
uh between conservatives and sex workers. It's always the

319
00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:20.130
same kind of Arguments they use, but do, do

320
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.469
you think that pornography and sex work more generally

321
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.210
is for anyone, or do you think that perhaps

322
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.929
there are to be successful as a sex worker

323
00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:36.070
and to like being a sex worker, uh, women

324
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.770
particularly should have certain kinds of traits.

325
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.380
It's a tough one because, you know, if I

326
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.780
hadn't had so many um negative experiences with my

327
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.140
ex and negative experiences with, you know, even growing

328
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.859
up, growing up with my, my, watching my dad

329
00:15:54.859 --> 00:15:57.940
and my mom, I don't know that I would.

330
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.159
HAVE gotten in the sex industry. I mean, I

331
00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:05.289
really do love the idea of families. I love

332
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.159
the idea of families, men and women getting married

333
00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.039
and having lots and lots of babies. We need

334
00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:13.599
them and having happy families. Now, now, having said

335
00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:16.880
that, even when I was married, my ex and

336
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.960
I like to watch some porn. It was, it

337
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.840
was, it was kind of a fun little kink

338
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.880
and a kick. A lot of people do it

339
00:16:24.479 --> 00:16:26.869
way more than, I mean, that's why it's not

340
00:16:26.869 --> 00:16:30.659
getting banned, right? Um, A lot of people tend

341
00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:34.150
to dip into it, um, for the, the artistic

342
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.400
value and, and to get them, get them creatively,

343
00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:41.710
get them going, get their juices going. So, um,

344
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.570
You know, I'm, I'm in the space, and I

345
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.809
just feel like you really need to, um, stick

346
00:16:51.809 --> 00:16:56.450
to your guns on running the show, running the

347
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.679
show on your own, on your own terms. And

348
00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:03.440
make sure that you do not put up with

349
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.680
any crap, because that's the thing, like this industry

350
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.439
can chew you up and spit you out. I

351
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.589
don't recommend that everybody go get into it. I

352
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.319
don't really want teens watching porn. I don't. I

353
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:20.868
want those websites to verify people with their ID

354
00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.479
and make sure that those adults going on adult,

355
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.358
I'm serious. I, which is funny because most of

356
00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:29.739
my colleagues would say, What are you talking about?

357
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.290
You're gonna cut into our bottom line. I care

358
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.219
about safety and I don't want kids getting on

359
00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:39.099
the internet, seeing a bunch of porn, and even,

360
00:17:39.219 --> 00:17:40.939
you know, cause it, it gets pretty wild out

361
00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:43.500
there. Uh, IT'S not all healthy porn. It's not

362
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.130
all, you know, I mean, again, that's the eye

363
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:51.849
of the beholder, but Um, But If you are

364
00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:56.380
gonna go into the industry, go in with your

365
00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.229
eyes wide open, do not be your own boss

366
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:04.780
and, um, run it like a business, like run

367
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.140
it like a legit business, get an escort. Make

368
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.699
sure you're testing. Make sure you're vetting and screening

369
00:18:11.699 --> 00:18:14.540
your clients. You know where they work. You've seen

370
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.689
their ID. You know them. If anything were to

371
00:18:17.689 --> 00:18:20.699
happen, you know, there's just a lot of safety

372
00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.459
considerations. So you've gotta have, you've gotta be a

373
00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:29.270
tough customer to be in the industry. Right. Yeah,

374
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.239
and by the way, do you think that online

375
00:18:32.239 --> 00:18:37.109
platforms like OnlyFans and other platforms like that, uh,

376
00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:41.280
give more power to sex workers to have control

377
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.079
over their own content that perhaps working for a

378
00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:47.280
production company wouldn't.

379
00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:51.880
Yes, it's all a racket game. So let's say

380
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.089
if you, let's say you want to, um, be

381
00:18:55.089 --> 00:18:56.930
a porn star and you want to get an

382
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.390
award and you wanna have that much recognition that

383
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.550
people across the nation are gonna recognize you, right?

384
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.920
Um, ALL you need to do is hire a,

385
00:19:06.969 --> 00:19:08.449
and I was, I was doing it, and then

386
00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:09.800
I was like, man, I don't really want to

387
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.260
invest my time in this. You hire a manager

388
00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:15.410
and you just, it's very formulaic, and then they

389
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.609
start promoting you. You enter all of the contests,

390
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.410
you show up to all the ABNs, you pay

391
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.369
in, and eventually you get your reward, having paid

392
00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:27.449
in and done a lot of mark, you, you

393
00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:31.189
pay a PR company basically. Um, SO that's one

394
00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:33.349
way to do it. If you do it that

395
00:19:33.349 --> 00:19:36.670
way, you will be taken advantage of in the

396
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.469
sense that they're just gonna give you your, your

397
00:19:40.469 --> 00:19:43.829
shoot rate, which is however many, you know, thousands

398
00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:46.339
of dollars that is. You're gonna work for them,

399
00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:48.109
and then they're gonna take that video and they're

400
00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:49.709
gonna go make a ton of money off that

401
00:19:49.709 --> 00:19:52.550
video. But you, but if, but some people will

402
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.469
do that because they're like, yeah, but if I

403
00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:59.040
go get famous over this. And people are, everybody

404
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.199
knows my name. I can still work my OnlyFans

405
00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:05.459
with more people coming in or what have you,

406
00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:10.069
um. Some people that don't, that they just wanna

407
00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:12.229
go to OnlyFans and just make their own money,

408
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.050
you can market yourself in your own way, um,

409
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.109
that, that can be successful. OnlyFans was hugely, hugely

410
00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:23.140
successful for the Instagram stars during COVID. All those

411
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.829
Instagram stars ran over to OnlyFans and brought all

412
00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:30.780
of their followers and made just a ton of

413
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.010
money. Um, I hear the money's not as good,

414
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.310
but I mean, it's however much you want to

415
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.150
put into it as far as marketing goes, right?

416
00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:43.089
Does that kind of give you a. Yeah,

417
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:46.020
yeah, I, I think so. I was actually also

418
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.479
going to ask you, do you think that if

419
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.900
uh a girl is interested in getting into sex

420
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.410
work, whether it, whether it is uh porn or

421
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.930
escorting or some other kind of sex work. Uh,

422
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.140
PARTICULARLY if it's porn because your image will be

423
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.189
out there, the videos will be out there. Do

424
00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:10.949
you think that before taking that step, they should

425
00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:17.150
consider the possible future consequences of them being exposed

426
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.640
on the internet like that, and, and apart from

427
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.670
that, what would you say are perhaps some of

428
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.920
the Uh, cons of doing pornography and sex work

429
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.439
that they should consider before take, uh, before making

430
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:33.630
such a decision.

431
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.459
Yes, and um. Yes, and just a real quick

432
00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:42.260
note on OnlyFans, like I do like, I do

433
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.819
like that people are able, adults, grown adults are

434
00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:46.869
able to go on there and do their thing.

435
00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:49.979
There's married couples doing it just for fun, like

436
00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:53.339
hobbyists. So, and, and I do like that they

437
00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:56.300
take less money. So all power, you know, power

438
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.939
to, um, OnlyFans. Um, I just don't want to

439
00:21:58.939 --> 00:22:00.579
see everybody and their dog jumping on it as

440
00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:02.540
a means of, of, um, making a living because

441
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.430
it's just not going to happen. But, um. Um,

442
00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.010
WHAT now, what was it?

443
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:14.109
Uh, BASICALLY, what, uh, considerations should people have before

444
00:22:14.109 --> 00:22:18.020
getting into sex work or pornography, more specifically?

445
00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:21.660
Do consider it, do consider it because it's, it's,

446
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.770
this is one of these things where, um, people,

447
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.319
porn stars that I know that have done really

448
00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:30.780
well, um. HAVE said you're either in or you're

449
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.489
out. You're either all the way in or you're

450
00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:36.380
out because why, why hover in it to some

451
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.599
degree and only make X amount when if you

452
00:22:38.819 --> 00:22:41.260
totally exploit yourself when you're all in, then you're

453
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.780
gonna make way more, you know, way more money

454
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.819
to build up your portfolio, what have you. It

455
00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:50.739
depends on, it depends on you. Um, I'll, I'll

456
00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:53.939
just give you my, my thing. I wanted, I

457
00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:58.020
was invited to do an HBO special, um, years

458
00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.979
ago when I first went to the world-famous Bunny

459
00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:02.819
Ranch. That's where I started. So I went over

460
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:05.859
there after the divorce and started working with that

461
00:23:05.859 --> 00:23:08.579
crew, and they had a huge HBO special going

462
00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:11.619
on that was bringing in tons of people. I

463
00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:14.219
didn't want to exploit myself and get that much

464
00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:17.380
fanfare and be known everywhere and be just, and

465
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.699
then be pigeoned into the sex industry. I still

466
00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:22.140
had a, you know, I went and got a

467
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.020
master's degree. I went and did all sorts of

468
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.979
other things. I've came and gone. I've been a

469
00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:30.339
teacher. I've done wealth management to prove that I

470
00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:31.859
can get out in the real world and really

471
00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:34.579
hustle and, and use my brain and make good

472
00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:39.020
money that way too. Um. So I've been able

473
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.180
to do. To be, to go and be a

474
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:49.140
famous, notable porn star and sex actress around the

475
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.180
world with clients from around the world, yet stay

476
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.439
under the radar enough to go become a teacher

477
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.099
in the public school system. Think about how I

478
00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:01.640
was able to do that. So it depends, because

479
00:24:02.099 --> 00:24:04.505
what do you, what, what What you want later

480
00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:06.834
on. Are you, is this just a temporary thing?

481
00:24:06.944 --> 00:24:09.785
Are you like totally sold that this is what,

482
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:13.064
you know, just be ready. Because since I just

483
00:24:13.064 --> 00:24:17.464
started getting more outwardly, I started marketing more outwardly

484
00:24:17.464 --> 00:24:20.305
within maybe the last 5 years, and I finally

485
00:24:20.305 --> 00:24:26.829
got recognized in the gym. OK, and it How,

486
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.069
how did you, what did you feel about that?

487
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.969
I'll tell you, I'll be honest, it really made

488
00:24:31.969 --> 00:24:35.290
me uncomfortable at first. I was like, what? Somebody

489
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.650
walked up and he's like, Are you Olivia? And

490
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.760
I'm just like, Uh, um, but I didn't know,

491
00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:43.699
I didn't know where to look. I, I like,

492
00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:47.280
yes, I am. And he's like, 00, are you

493
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.579
taking clients? And I was flattered, but it was

494
00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:55.020
really awkward. I got real red in the face.

495
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.380
I'm like, and then I'm like, oh, I have

496
00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.619
no makeup on. I'm in my gym stuff, you

497
00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:00.760
know, so it just threw me in this weird

498
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.979
headspace and then, and then we figured it out

499
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:06.540
and we laughed about it. But um, yeah, I,

500
00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:08.260
you know, I didn't know that I was gonna

501
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.040
end up feeling all awkward and funny and embarrassed

502
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.150
and I did. So you, so Just being honest

503
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.310
about how I've felt over the years, um, can

504
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.069
maybe help whoever's watching this that, that would, that

505
00:25:23.069 --> 00:25:25.939
is considering these questions, right?

506
00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:28.589
Yeah, I mean, I guess that it also depends

507
00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:31.750
on the woman, right, because I've heard porn stars

508
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.109
saying that they get the thrill of um imagining

509
00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:40.839
that after they shoot a scene, for example, they

510
00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:44.670
will be watched. By other people, particularly men, and

511
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:49.630
they like getting recognized on the street, and they

512
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.589
like fans approaching them and so on and so

513
00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:55.550
forth. So I guess it depends a little bit

514
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.189
on their, uh, personality traits, and some of them

515
00:25:59.189 --> 00:26:02.430
maybe are a little bit more on the exhibitionist

516
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.489
end of the spectrum, and so they like, uh,

517
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.619
um, they like that a little bit more,

518
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.069
right. Yeah. Whereas I, because I'm, I'm, I'll do

519
00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:15.119
extroverted things, but I think I am truly am

520
00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:18.079
an introvert, um, based on where I tend to

521
00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:20.880
go because it's funny cause I, you know, OnlyFans

522
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.829
is so weird to me. I've always enjoyed, um,

523
00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:28.229
discreet escorting where everything's just undercover, you know, we're

524
00:26:28.229 --> 00:26:31.380
meeting, we're having our private time, nobody knows nothing.

525
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.599
And then all of a sudden I'm exploiting myself

526
00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:36.849
on OnlyFans and it felt so weird and And

527
00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:38.250
I just like, Oh my God. And I put

528
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.369
it out there and, oh God, I don't know

529
00:26:40.369 --> 00:26:42.290
who's looking at this, but knock on wood, I

530
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.010
hope this goes well. And then, you know, a

531
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.089
month later, I'll meet, I'll get booked for this,

532
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.609
and this client will be very attractive, like, you

533
00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:52.199
know, a fitness orientated client. And I'll be like,

534
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.689
My goodness, how did you know about me? And

535
00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:57.599
he'll mention, oh, I saw, I like your OnlyFans.

536
00:26:57.959 --> 00:26:59.609
And I'm like, Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

537
00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:01.969
she's watching, you know, and then I kind of

538
00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:04.410
get a little bashful and giggly. Oh my gosh,

539
00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.489
this guy's been watching me, you know, because you

540
00:27:06.489 --> 00:27:09.530
don't know who's watching you. So it, it's, it's

541
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.729
kind of a giddy thing though. It's like, you

542
00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:14.689
know, it does, it makes me laugh.

543
00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:17.839
Yeah, um, but I mean, let, let me take

544
00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:23.150
advantage of the fact that you mentioned, uh, exploiting

545
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.510
yourself, I guess that's the word you use there

546
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.599
on OnlyFans to get into some of the ideas

547
00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:33.479
or the common assumptions and perhaps some misconceptions that

548
00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:38.750
people have about uh. Born actresses and actors and

549
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.770
um sex work more generally. I mean, do, do

550
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:48.650
you think uh sex work is always necessarily exploitative

551
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.619
because that's one of the arguments I've heard from,

552
00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:54.810
uh, sex negative feminists.

553
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.880
Hm. Well, I mean, we're choosing to do it.

554
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.189
I mean, we're choosing, and, and somebody, I mean,

555
00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:03.400
you could say, I mean, I'm, I'm making the

556
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.479
joke, the joke, you know, I'm choosing to exploit

557
00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:10.560
myself. Um, BUT, and then others would say maybe

558
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.839
that it's more like, to them, it's like artistic

559
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:19.439
expression. It's artistic sexual expression. Um, SO you could

560
00:28:19.439 --> 00:28:24.780
argue either point. But I mean, uh, I mean,

561
00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:27.810
exploit exploitative would be more like, I mean, I'm

562
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.060
cracking a joke. That would be like people doing

563
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.579
stuff against their will, you know, people think doing

564
00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:35.260
things, not really, not because they're really there to

565
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.839
run their own business, um, and, and assert themselves

566
00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:41.444
the sex. THE way they want to assert themselves,

567
00:28:41.494 --> 00:28:44.175
they're being coerced or they're, you know, and there

568
00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:46.625
is some of that in the industry too. Um,

569
00:28:46.814 --> 00:28:49.694
WE don't like that. Nobody likes that. There's goods

570
00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:52.415
and bads in every industry. So that's why a

571
00:28:52.415 --> 00:28:57.060
lot of police officers, they They don't mind the

572
00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.010
way Nevada's running their, running their sex industry uh

573
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.589
in the controlled fashion that they are, and um,

574
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.819
they don't really have problems with the brothels or

575
00:29:07.819 --> 00:29:11.859
these legitimate establishments, and they don't have many problems

576
00:29:11.859 --> 00:29:15.219
with legitimate escorts that go and buy licenses and

577
00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:18.400
run their business on their own. Um, IT'S these,

578
00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:21.739
it's always leads to a dude. It's these asshole

579
00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:27.300
pimps, these bad human, um, traffickers, you know, guys

580
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.869
that wanna get a hold of people and take

581
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:31.000
advantage of, of the weak.

582
00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.859
Yeah, that's the kind of idea I have about

583
00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:37.500
sex work. I mean, the only thing that can

584
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.640
bother me is if people do not have a

585
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.780
choice when doing it, if they get into it

586
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.074
just because they are financially. DESTITUTE or because they

587
00:29:49.074 --> 00:29:52.305
have a pimp or someone who takes advantage of

588
00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:55.395
them, because otherwise I mean if they're doing that

589
00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:59.435
out of their own free will, free choice, that's

590
00:29:59.435 --> 00:30:01.834
perfectly fine with me. So what do you think

591
00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:02.194
about that?

592
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.400
Yes, yeah, and I mean the girls that I,

593
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.349
uh, that some of my colleagues over the years

594
00:30:09.569 --> 00:30:11.689
that I've been friends with for years, uh, you

595
00:30:11.689 --> 00:30:15.119
know, they're, we've run everything just like a legit

596
00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:17.810
business. We have S corps, we have accountants, we

597
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.430
have marketing folks, um, and we're all doing things

598
00:30:21.969 --> 00:30:24.369
that is what is comfortable for us, so we're

599
00:30:24.369 --> 00:30:28.790
all running different. We're presenting and marketing ourselves differently.

600
00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:32.040
So like one of my girlfriends, she, she won't

601
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.359
do porn on, on film. She, she wants to

602
00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:38.479
do more of a girlfriend experience. That's what she's

603
00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:42.239
trying to relay when she does her beautiful pictures.

604
00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:45.060
So she has some. You know, she's got maybe

605
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.880
in a thong or she's got, you know, some,

606
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.160
uh, some boobs going on, but she's not fully

607
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.439
naked in her, in her stuff or what have

608
00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:55.880
you. That's her choice. That's what she's comfortable doing.

609
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.160
Whereas I went ahead and decided to jump on

610
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.839
in and do some hardcore stuff, which people were

611
00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:02.979
like, oh my gosh, I can't believe. You do

612
00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:05.540
that, Olivia. I didn't know that about you, because

613
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.969
before I was running more of the GFE just

614
00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:11.599
being, you know, pictures like in something like this.

615
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.140
Um, AND that was a choice that I decided

616
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.060
to do. I decided to switch it up. But

617
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.579
these are all consensual decisions that grown adults are

618
00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:20.099
making.

619
00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:24.079
You, you know, it's very interesting. I don't know

620
00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:28.280
what idea you have about people who are against

621
00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.319
sex work. I mean, you've already debated Candace Owens

622
00:31:31.319 --> 00:31:34.500
and I imagine you've had other conversations with people

623
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.079
who are against it, but I've had conversations on

624
00:31:38.079 --> 00:31:42.599
the show with psychologists, for example, even political scientists.

625
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.739
I mean, believe it or not, we can also

626
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.359
uh and learn more about people's attitudes towards sexuality.

627
00:31:49.454 --> 00:31:52.625
Through political science and I mean the thing is,

628
00:31:52.694 --> 00:31:56.255
is that uh most people who are against sex

629
00:31:56.255 --> 00:32:00.505
work, against pornography, um, and those, those kind of

630
00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:03.614
things, the uh they have they tend to have

631
00:32:03.614 --> 00:32:06.935
specific kinds of traits, so I mean politically they

632
00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:10.275
tend to be more conservative, of course, and then

633
00:32:10.655 --> 00:32:16.055
for example, they tend to prefer uh monogamic relationships

634
00:32:16.055 --> 00:32:19.310
and so I mean they don't really. LIKE the

635
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:24.469
idea of people out there having access to sex

636
00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:27.810
workers or having lots of casual sex because they

637
00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:31.390
get that as a threat, particularly women, because then

638
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.849
they think that those women, the sex workers or

639
00:32:35.109 --> 00:32:39.829
the porn stars, are actual competition and so they

640
00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:43.130
might lose their husband or their partner or someone

641
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.354
like that, and then they also tend to. Below

642
00:32:47.354 --> 00:32:51.604
on sociosexuality, that is, they tend to not really

643
00:32:51.604 --> 00:32:56.285
like having sex with people who, with whom they

644
00:32:56.285 --> 00:32:59.525
don't have some form of emotional connection and they

645
00:32:59.525 --> 00:33:02.224
don't, they usually have a very low number of

646
00:33:02.484 --> 00:33:06.604
uh lifetime sexual partners. They don't like to have

647
00:33:06.604 --> 00:33:10.444
sex with lots of people, um, and they score

648
00:33:10.444 --> 00:33:13.885
low on, or they score high, sorry, they score

649
00:33:13.885 --> 00:33:18.599
high on. Uh, SEXUAL disgust, that is, they, they,

650
00:33:18.719 --> 00:33:22.239
they don't really like to, um, they don't like

651
00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:25.520
promiscuity, let's use that kind of term. So, I

652
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.839
mean, I mean, is that the kind of picture

653
00:33:28.839 --> 00:33:33.699
you've seen from people you've had debates and discussed

654
00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:36.760
with about sex work or not? What your, what

655
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.119
is your take on that?

656
00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:41.770
Um, THERE'S a lot of people over the board

657
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.569
on a lot of things. So there's, um, there's

658
00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:46.329
this really buffed up military guy that I see.

659
00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:48.369
He's an alpha male. He's a, he's a client.

660
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:50.329
He likes to book me from time to time,

661
00:33:50.369 --> 00:33:52.770
and we just have a ball. He doesn't, he

662
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.089
doesn't watch porn. He's like, he goes, all alpha

663
00:33:56.089 --> 00:34:00.569
males know that watching porn kills your productivity. So

664
00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:02.535
I I don't, I don't get down with porn,

665
00:34:02.614 --> 00:34:03.734
but I'm going to book you once in a

666
00:34:03.734 --> 00:34:05.694
while and have a good time in person. So

667
00:34:05.694 --> 00:34:09.215
that's an example, interestingly enough, of an alpha male

668
00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:11.135
that's saying, I'm not down for porn, but here

669
00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:12.614
I am in the industry and I like to

670
00:34:12.614 --> 00:34:15.844
book you. I want this in person situation. Um,

671
00:34:16.175 --> 00:34:18.074
I've met a ton of women who have a

672
00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:22.975
low sex drive. That, that is, that's why they

673
00:34:22.975 --> 00:34:27.074
have a negative perception. Um, THEY think we're stupid.

674
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.958
Um, AND, and that's an interesting thing. I had

675
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:34.260
a, here's, here's one that's fascinating, uh, in terms

676
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.600
of like perceptions and misperceptions if you will. There

677
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.708
was a guy that was booking me. And in

678
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:47.520
town, he's booking me and he's a client. And

679
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.800
there's a girl in town who is married and

680
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.300
she's stuck in an unhappy marriage and she's conservative.

681
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.870
Well, she meets him and they start having an

682
00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.560
affair and they're telling, I love, you know, just

683
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.600
I love you, and, and the guy that she's

684
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.679
married to isn't being very nice to her, and

685
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:09.000
she finds out about me and she was saying,

686
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.419
oh well, yeah, but she's girls in those industries,

687
00:35:11.479 --> 00:35:13.879
you know, they're, she's just really dumb. She's dumb.

688
00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:17.719
And what's, what's funny is because through the gossip,

689
00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:19.840
the chains of gossip, what have you, it's come

690
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.360
full circle where, where this guy that I, that

691
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.719
I made a client, there's no, I'm not, he's

692
00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:25.959
not going to hurt me. He's not going to

693
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:28.060
come play me. He's not gonna lie to me.

694
00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:30.360
Um, HE was lying to her and broke her

695
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.399
heart, and she's stuck in this abusive relationship, but

696
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.879
I'm the dumb one. And, and it was just

697
00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:39.070
kind of funny because the person who was talking

698
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.949
with her, who then confided in me, this is

699
00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:44.510
all through the gym, by the way. He thought

700
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.209
it was interesting how her assumption. Being this married

701
00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:52.129
lady in a more conservative situation, yeah, she's starting

702
00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:53.729
to have an affair, an emotional affair, cause she's

703
00:35:53.729 --> 00:35:56.770
not happy, but she's, her perception of me is,

704
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.929
well, she's dumb. She's dumb. That's why she's in

705
00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:02.409
that industry where, meanwhile, I'm looking at her situation

706
00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:08.010
like, You're dumb because, you know, like you're stuck

707
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.370
with this guy that's not treating you right. I'd

708
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.850
never allow that. This other cat who was, he's

709
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.209
a total player. I'd never let him just have

710
00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:17.570
sex with me for free and tell him he

711
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.310
loves me because he's lying, you know, um, it's

712
00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:24.090
totally up to, you know, the eye of the

713
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.290
beholder is very fascinating. I, I get a lot

714
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.610
of different, different stuff. And then I'll get really

715
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:34.050
supportive females. That, um, they're just just they're just

716
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.689
cool and supportive, just in general, and they'll just

717
00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:38.100
do a shout out and hey, I just want

718
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.290
you to know, um, it's cool what you're doing,

719
00:36:42.489 --> 00:36:44.209
you know, keep up, keep up the good work,

720
00:36:44.219 --> 00:36:47.010
or, or, or they'll say something refreshing about, you

721
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.580
know, sex or something, so.

722
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.040
You know, uh, uh, uh, I, I also want

723
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.959
to give you a little bit more ammunition if

724
00:36:54.959 --> 00:36:58.919
you ever have another debate with a conservative like

725
00:36:58.919 --> 00:37:00.979
and the so and so or some other person

726
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.840
because there's actually many studies out there to debunk

727
00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:09.360
many of the claims they make. So, for example,

728
00:37:09.479 --> 00:37:13.120
there's that idea that uh porn stars, I mean,

729
00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:15.639
the, the study I'm going to mention uh was

730
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:18.780
done specifically. With porn stars, not with other kinds

731
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.260
of sex workers, but uh there's that idea that

732
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.729
porn stars are damaged goods, particularly the girls, and

733
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.979
they did a study back, I think, in 2012

734
00:37:29.979 --> 00:37:35.449
with 177 porn star, female porn stars, and they

735
00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:39.139
compared them to a similar number of women from

736
00:37:39.139 --> 00:37:42.500
the general population. And actually one very interesting thing

737
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.280
they found was that Uh, porn stars scored higher

738
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.959
in terms of sexual satisfaction, self-esteem, social support, and

739
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:58.260
even spirituality. So, I mean, there's a very interesting

740
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.439
data point.

741
00:37:59.979 --> 00:38:03.820
It's very interesting, yeah. I've heard too, but I'm

742
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.139
not sure that, I mean this could be some

743
00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:07.739
of it, but I, I meet a lot of

744
00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.020
people from different backgrounds in the industry, so I'm

745
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.500
not drawing any conclusions, but, um, people that are

746
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.379
really super hypersexual, um, maybe have had um prior

747
00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:23.070
trauma. It's like trauma can lead, um, they were

748
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.750
saying like military people can sometimes deal with a

749
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:30.310
lot of promiscuity, um, people in fight or flight

750
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.530
type situation jobs where they nearly lose their life

751
00:38:34.739 --> 00:38:37.149
half the time and then they just kind of

752
00:38:37.149 --> 00:38:39.149
like, it's all or nothing. So then they like

753
00:38:39.149 --> 00:38:42.550
they want to keep having these experiences because these

754
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.810
sexual experiences like. It's like a, I mean, they've

755
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.250
correlated it to like a rush of cocaine, but

756
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:52.370
it's a natural, um, rush of, of, um, happy,

757
00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:57.090
awesome feelings. So, um, people have argued that hypersexuality

758
00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.159
can be linked to potentially, um, unresolved post-trauma. So

759
00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:04.949
that might be, but that would be affecting everybody

760
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:11.709
all around. Um. But I know a lot of,

761
00:39:11.929 --> 00:39:14.530
I know women in the industry that they'll laugh

762
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.250
and they'll say I was never molested. Um, MY

763
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.810
parents were in a really good relationship. I went

764
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.010
and I got a master's degree. I went and

765
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.729
became a scientist. I know a girl that went

766
00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:27.689
into biology, but she was like, I like the

767
00:39:27.689 --> 00:39:31.030
money that I'm making doing this, and I'm able

768
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.449
to maintain the type of lifestyle that I want

769
00:39:34.649 --> 00:39:38.429
to be happy on the daily. Yeah, she wasn't

770
00:39:38.429 --> 00:39:38.600
happy that much.

771
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.169
Yeah, and the other thing, look, there, there's actually

772
00:39:43.169 --> 00:39:46.729
a very interesting book that got published early this

773
00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:51.129
year called The Sexual Evolution by Nathan Lentz. Nathan

774
00:39:51.129 --> 00:39:54.840
Lentz is an evolutionary biologist and at a certain

775
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.050
point in the book, he talks about uh transactional

776
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:02.812
sex, and there's actually also transactional sex. In other

777
00:40:02.812 --> 00:40:07.462
animal species, so for example, uh, penguins, the males

778
00:40:07.462 --> 00:40:13.772
might trade rocks for nest building for sex. Chimpanzees

779
00:40:13.772 --> 00:40:18.762
might trade meat from small animals for sex, and

780
00:40:18.762 --> 00:40:23.032
actually there's very interesting experiments where if you teach

781
00:40:23.032 --> 00:40:27.936
chimpanzees. IS to use money. One of the first

782
00:40:27.936 --> 00:40:30.855
things they use the money for is to have

783
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:34.795
sex with the female. So, you know, it's, it's,

784
00:40:34.855 --> 00:40:37.815
it's not only a human thing, it's the only

785
00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:41.595
thing is that we as humans tend to moralize

786
00:40:41.595 --> 00:40:44.416
sex and other animals don't do that.

787
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:49.530
So yeah, yeah. Um, THAT is funny, um, for

788
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.770
sure, and I'm so big on, um, acts of

789
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.050
service. I just, I love acts of service, but

790
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.679
I'm good to you back. And you know, the,

791
00:40:57.899 --> 00:41:00.610
the, the regulars, we call them regulars in the

792
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.850
industry. I have people that I've seen for years.

793
00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:06.324
And there's no drama in our relationship. It's just,

794
00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:08.114
it's very, I'm gonna take care of you, you're

795
00:41:08.114 --> 00:41:09.985
gonna take care of me. What are we gonna

796
00:41:09.985 --> 00:41:12.284
do today? OK, how do you, what do you

797
00:41:12.284 --> 00:41:13.364
want me to dress like? Do you want me

798
00:41:13.364 --> 00:41:15.245
to bring something real fun, you know, let's have

799
00:41:15.245 --> 00:41:19.645
some fun and let's catch up. And we took

800
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:23.245
care of each other. Case closed, you know, no

801
00:41:23.245 --> 00:41:29.629
problems, no dramas. So Yeah, to each their own.

802
00:41:30.409 --> 00:41:32.209
Yeah, by, by the way, tell us a little

803
00:41:32.209 --> 00:41:35.409
bit more about that. I, I'm interested, uh, what

804
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:40.169
kinds of relationships do you have with your clients?

805
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:44.250
Because I've read, for example, and I've interviewed actually

806
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.939
last year. Uh, A former general attorney from California,

807
00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:52.899
Gerald Mosley, and he, he wrote a book because

808
00:41:52.899 --> 00:41:57.060
he was interested in researching, uh, sex work and

809
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.979
he wrote a book titled Sex Workers and Their

810
00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:04.050
Clients in Their Own Words, and some of the

811
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.620
statements he cites there, I mean, there are sex

812
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:12.314
workers who said that they actually have. Pretty good

813
00:42:12.314 --> 00:42:17.435
and positive relationships with their clients and their fans.

814
00:42:17.514 --> 00:42:20.354
I mean that they, for example, give them gifts,

815
00:42:20.435 --> 00:42:24.195
they send them nice messages and they treat them

816
00:42:24.195 --> 00:42:28.264
very well. Some of them just uh go uh

817
00:42:28.264 --> 00:42:30.915
just go to them to talk. I mean, they

818
00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:33.915
don't even have sex. So what kinds of relationships

819
00:42:33.915 --> 00:42:36.754
do you develop with your clients?

820
00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:41.800
Um, PRETTY meaningful ones, um. And, and they get

821
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.090
kind of sentimental cause I've been talking about retiring

822
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.219
and then They'll say, oh, you know, they'll want

823
00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:49.219
to make sure we get together, or they'll say,

824
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.459
can I, can I still contact you even after

825
00:42:53.459 --> 00:42:55.739
you make that announcement? Can I still from time

826
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.020
to time. So these folks are getting a hold

827
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.090
of me at the holidays, you know, Happy Thanksgiving.

828
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.540
How are you? Happy, you know, Merry Christmas. Are

829
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.550
you gonna have a good Christmas this year? So,

830
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.159
and so when you, when that happens, when it's

831
00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:10.530
these holidays and we reach for the phone and,

832
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.860
oh, I've got to say, say something, I've got

833
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.709
to make sure I mention. We do that with

834
00:43:15.709 --> 00:43:19.310
friends and family. So these folks consider me a

835
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.550
friend, because they're like friend and family because they're

836
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.030
getting a hold of me, or they'll remember my

837
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.429
birthday. And I'm like, I can't remember. I can't

838
00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:30.510
believe they remembered my birthday. So, um, it's, it's

839
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.689
ongoing relationships with positive, healthy relationships with my clients.

840
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:40.110
And we're, we're friends, basically, and we support each

841
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.600
other. So Um, I've had like one, if one

842
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.439
was, gosh, I just got laid off. I'm having

843
00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:48.719
an issue here. Hey, I know so and so

844
00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:51.080
over, you know, in your town. Let me give

845
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.919
a call and try to, try to set you

846
00:43:52.919 --> 00:43:54.879
guys up with, you know, give you a hook

847
00:43:54.879 --> 00:43:58.639
up. I, I'll, I've helped people. Like I've gone

848
00:43:58.639 --> 00:43:59.719
out of, you know, out of my way to

849
00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:03.879
help people. Um, PEOPLE have stayed in touch with

850
00:44:03.879 --> 00:44:08.290
me. We've, we've been friends. This, this, my last

851
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.810
client that came recently, he flew in from another

852
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.850
state and we, we spent a good 4 to

853
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.610
5 hours together and we talk a lot and,

854
00:44:17.729 --> 00:44:19.330
and of course there's a lot of physical touch

855
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.649
and love, but he's a really awesome guy and

856
00:44:21.649 --> 00:44:24.209
he brought me cause I'm getting into, I have

857
00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:27.250
my concealed carry. So I like to shoot. I

858
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.010
like to practice with my gun. Um, AND he

859
00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.159
brought, he brought me a really nice holster. He's,

860
00:44:33.169 --> 00:44:35.810
uh, ex law enforcement, and so this holster was

861
00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.989
so awesome. So, and to me that was romantic,

862
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.330
so funny. I don't want a handbag. I just

863
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.870
want a really nice holster and take me shooting

864
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.010
and teach me a new thing and, and I'll

865
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.530
be fine. But, um, no, we have, I feel

866
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.489
blessed. I, and I'm gonna be totally honest with

867
00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:58.229
you. Um, I think God, when I did the

868
00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:00.879
interview with Candace Owens, I was, I've always been

869
00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:05.479
born and raised a Baptist Christian. And we, we

870
00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:07.560
know now, we know now as governments are coming

871
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.439
out and they're starting to divulge that we do

872
00:45:09.439 --> 00:45:11.840
have proof of alien life. So that, that kind

873
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.790
of throws an interesting spin onto just Perceptions and

874
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.370
what have you, but um, I have gotten more.

875
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:25.120
Um, I would say more spiritual, more religious, even

876
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.969
if you will, since due to just the election

877
00:45:28.969 --> 00:45:32.209
and what I've been seeing happening, culturally, some of

878
00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:35.120
the stuff that I've been seeing, um, I've been

879
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.129
praying, I pray. So, I pray, um, every day,

880
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.169
and one of the things that I often pray,

881
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.810
and when I'm counting my, my gratitudes is I

882
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.330
thank God for my clients. I always tell him,

883
00:45:49.459 --> 00:45:53.290
thank you so much. You always bring me the

884
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:58.010
right people, the right people. Everybody cause we screen,

885
00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.330
I mean, I'm just, I'm, I'm having to reject

886
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.250
a lot of people, but he, when it's a

887
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.729
go and it and it works, he always brings

888
00:46:04.729 --> 00:46:09.320
me the right people, the quality people, normal people

889
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.090
that will be your friend for, for years to

890
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.719
come. I got that.

891
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.600
Yeah, no, that's really awesome, and I guess that,

892
00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:19.780
er, I mean I, I'm not religious to be

893
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.969
honest, but I guess that Jesus, at least him,

894
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.419
was not against sex workers, right?

895
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.540
Yeah, I guess, yeah, according to the Bible, um,

896
00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:34.280
Candace Owens has a different take, but I tried

897
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.320
to point that out. I was like, look at

898
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:42.149
how many hookers are in the Bible, Candace. What

899
00:46:42.149 --> 00:46:46.669
did they call them? They were, uh, concubines, concubines.

900
00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:48.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

901
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.120
you know, and, and, you know, and there are

902
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.639
other things that people say, for example, people, uh,

903
00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:57.810
the, the ones that are more right wing conservatives,

904
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:03.010
of course, tend to accuse. Uh, PORNOGRAPHY and porn

905
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:07.239
stars of promoting promiscuity, I mean, which is an

906
00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:11.000
interesting take because if, if it was like that,

907
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.719
then, uh, I mean, pornography is doing a, a

908
00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:19.439
really bad job of promoting promiscuity because just recently

909
00:47:19.439 --> 00:47:24.639
I interviewed, uh, Justin Le Miller. He's a sexologist

910
00:47:24.639 --> 00:47:28.864
and a psychologist and He, we, we talked about,

911
00:47:28.905 --> 00:47:32.485
um, the most common sexual fantasies that people have,

912
00:47:32.544 --> 00:47:34.725
but toward the end of our conversation, we also

913
00:47:34.725 --> 00:47:39.725
talked about the most common number of uh lifetime

914
00:47:39.725 --> 00:47:44.155
partners that people have, and most people, the vast

915
00:47:44.155 --> 00:47:50.445
majority of people have 56789 partners their, their whole

916
00:47:50.445 --> 00:47:54.139
life. And I mean if you look at data

917
00:47:54.139 --> 00:47:59.209
from Gen Z, uh, actually people are having, uh,

918
00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:03.840
less sex and they're starting their sex lives later.

919
00:48:04.179 --> 00:48:08.179
Uh, THERE are many 20-something year olds who are

920
00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:14.429
still virgins and lots of data, uh, uh. Pointing

921
00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:16.629
to the fact that there are many people that

922
00:48:16.629 --> 00:48:20.629
over the last year haven't done, haven't had sex

923
00:48:20.629 --> 00:48:24.669
at all, so I mean, I don't understand where

924
00:48:24.669 --> 00:48:28.510
they uh pick that idea that we are living

925
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:32.489
in a promiscuous society. I don't know where they

926
00:48:32.899 --> 00:48:33.739
get that from.

927
00:48:34.229 --> 00:48:37.790
Yeah, I agree. Um, I'm, I don't like the

928
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.179
way things are going with the porn world. And,

929
00:48:41.229 --> 00:48:44.270
and what's happening is like things like the younger

930
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.389
generations are just doing weirder, weirder stuff, like kink

931
00:48:47.389 --> 00:48:51.350
stuff, like, uh, throwing up on camera, and people

932
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.389
like that and want to pay for that. That

933
00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:55.469
what is so hot? What is good about that?

934
00:48:55.629 --> 00:48:59.620
That's gross. Just weird things are just going down

935
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.939
weird rabbit holes for the shock value of it.

936
00:49:03.219 --> 00:49:06.899
Like, I remember when, um, anal was huge. Anal

937
00:49:06.899 --> 00:49:10.979
was like, oh, that's the most hardcore thing you

938
00:49:10.979 --> 00:49:13.500
can do in the industry is anal, and that's

939
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.250
not the case anymore. Now it's, how many dicks

940
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.179
can you stick in, in, you know, in, in

941
00:49:19.179 --> 00:49:23.219
your butt at one time. So some of this,

942
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.530
some of that stuff. It's for the shock value,

943
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.929
but I don't think it's healthy to be watching

944
00:49:28.929 --> 00:49:32.969
that the majority of the time. I, you know

945
00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:35.810
what a lot of guys want from me, and

946
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:39.149
I try to film it if I can, kissing,

947
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:45.629
kissing and making out. Making out, old fashioned making

948
00:49:45.629 --> 00:49:49.649
out. And when I started watching porn, when back

949
00:49:49.649 --> 00:49:51.850
in the day when you could just maybe if

950
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:53.409
you could get it on a channel and it's

951
00:49:53.409 --> 00:49:57.360
kind of fuzzy. Porn first started coming out, it

952
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.600
was kind of fuzzy. I'm like trying to get

953
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.800
the HBO. It's a little pixelated. It was really

954
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.639
nice soft porn, where it was this beautiful soft

955
00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:07.389
woman. And, you know, and it's like her skin

956
00:50:07.389 --> 00:50:09.760
and everything. And then he's caressing her, and there

957
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.199
was way more foreplay. They're making out, they're kissing,

958
00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:17.040
and then it's going on, and it's just a

959
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.439
calmer. A more wholesome sexual take on sex, right?

960
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.129
And now nowadays it's crazy town. Well, I'm concerned

961
00:50:25.129 --> 00:50:28.250
with Crazy town. I'm concerned with what impact is

962
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.530
Crazy town having on people, and people aren't going

963
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.370
out and having sex. People aren't going out and

964
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.189
meeting. They're online. Not a good idea.

965
00:50:37.649 --> 00:50:41.949
So look, I wanted to ask you because, interestingly,

966
00:50:42.209 --> 00:50:46.649
there are feminists who are for sex work. I

967
00:50:46.649 --> 00:50:48.520
mean for sex work. What I mean by that

968
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.800
is that they support sex workers and then there

969
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.040
are feminists who are, you, I mean, we tend

970
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.229
to call them sex negative feminists who are just

971
00:50:59.239 --> 00:51:02.520
straight out against sex work, they are against pornography,

972
00:51:02.669 --> 00:51:05.479
against escorting and all of that. I mean, do

973
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:10.120
you identify as a feminist, and I mean, and

974
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.280
whether or not you identify as one, what would

975
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.959
you like feminists to know about sex work?

976
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:24.770
Well, um, sex is really fun. If, if you

977
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:30.540
want to determine what gets you off. So you

978
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.370
could think of it, um, as, I know a

979
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.570
lot of feminists think, yes, but this is for

980
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.574
the man, for the No. What about you? Have

981
00:51:38.574 --> 00:51:41.254
you ever had an orgasm, my lovely lady? It

982
00:51:41.254 --> 00:51:44.314
actually feels pretty good. If you figure out how

983
00:51:44.314 --> 00:51:47.054
to give yourself one, and then if you figure

984
00:51:47.054 --> 00:51:50.165
out how to instruct a male on how to

985
00:51:50.165 --> 00:51:53.294
give you one, it can be a really fun

986
00:51:53.294 --> 00:51:57.455
experience. So, um, to each their own, if you

987
00:51:57.455 --> 00:52:01.875
don't like sex and the whole sexual imagery just

988
00:52:02.334 --> 00:52:06.189
bothers you. That's fine, but you've got to realize

989
00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:09.750
that that is your issue, not everybody else's, because

990
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:15.520
we are by nature, sexual beings. Yeah, right, for

991
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.040
sure. Like you said across the board, you're noticing

992
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.120
in animals. Animals are, are even behaving and, you

993
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.840
know, give and take for, for sexual stuff, right?

994
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.320
We, we like sex. Sex is fun for, for

995
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.709
most of us, um, for, for the ones that

996
00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:32.820
have a negative association. To it. My, I ask

997
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.139
you this, go figure that out. Go, go get

998
00:52:36.139 --> 00:52:38.979
a therapist and figure out why you have a

999
00:52:38.979 --> 00:52:42.560
negative association to it. I, um, I did work

1000
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.060
with a gal who does clinical sex therapy, and

1001
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.300
we did, um, we did an Instagram reel together.

1002
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.620
I was trying to help promote her work. She's

1003
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.010
really fantastic. She grew up in a kind of,

1004
00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:00.419
um, Upbringing where her religious beliefs, they were really

1005
00:53:00.419 --> 00:53:09.239
making the religious beliefs were projecting. Unnaturally negative, uh,

1006
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.620
stereotypes about sex, misinformation about sex. A lot of

1007
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.179
people have reached out to me who've been in

1008
00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:19.379
some wild religious, uh, upbringings have said that. So

1009
00:53:19.379 --> 00:53:21.780
then they have this warped sense of, of, of

1010
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.780
what, what is, if sex is good, they think

1011
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.639
it's awful. They have all, you know, and, um,

1012
00:53:26.699 --> 00:53:28.580
they want to throw up, you know, the opportunity

1013
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.020
arises, they want to throw up, and that's their

1014
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.540
reaction versus, you know, so she wanted to go,

1015
00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:34.540
what's, she wanted to go figure out what's going

1016
00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.169
on in my head. To where I'm not, I

1017
00:53:38.169 --> 00:53:40.850
don't even like sex, and it was her upbringing.

1018
00:53:41.169 --> 00:53:43.810
She became a sex therapist, and she is so

1019
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:47.489
dang amazing, she can actually have an orgasm without

1020
00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:52.399
even being touched just through breathing techniques. That's how

1021
00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:55.919
anatomically amazing we are as humans in the sexual

1022
00:53:55.919 --> 00:53:58.560
realm. You don't even have to go out and

1023
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.520
have sex with a partner. Of course, it's even

1024
00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.800
so much better, and it's, you know, emotionally satisfying.

1025
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.280
But to, but like the ultimate, um, sexual health

1026
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.629
is being able to breathe yourself into an orgasm,

1027
00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.520
and that's what she can do now, from all

1028
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.560
the headwork that she's done to to to finding

1029
00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.600
out why did I not ever like it in

1030
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.479
the first place, and a lot of it's upbringing.

1031
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.179
No, it's very interesting that you mention religiosity because

1032
00:54:23.179 --> 00:54:28.090
actually there's work by people like Nicole Brosi, she's

1033
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:31.739
a neuroscientist and a psychologist. I've had her twice

1034
00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:35.139
on the show and we talked about the idea

1035
00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:39.020
of porn addiction and actually what she found through

1036
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:43.570
her work is that. Um, PEOPLE who identify as

1037
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:47.850
porn addicts, they don't really have an addiction. What

1038
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.850
they have is that they are usually highly religious

1039
00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:56.649
people who morally condemn porn, and so what happens

1040
00:54:56.649 --> 00:54:59.530
when they watch porn is that they feel a

1041
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:03.179
sort of moral incongruence. They feel bad about themselves.

1042
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:08.399
Themselves they condemn themselves morally and pornography morally and

1043
00:55:08.399 --> 00:55:13.669
so they have psychological issues by for watching pornography,

1044
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.679
but, but it's only because they condemn it morally.

1045
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.760
It's not because the porn itself is harming them,

1046
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.209
you know. OK, gotcha. Yeah, so, uh, I mean,

1047
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:30.360
and do, do you think that uh sex work,

1048
00:55:30.709 --> 00:55:33.629
because I actually heard this kind of argument from

1049
00:55:34.409 --> 00:55:39.250
some sex workers who are also feminists themselves, and

1050
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.905
they say that uh. Contrary to what many people

1051
00:55:42.905 --> 00:55:45.504
say when they say that for example sex work

1052
00:55:45.504 --> 00:55:49.745
can be or is degrading to women, they say

1053
00:55:49.745 --> 00:55:53.185
that it is empowering. I mean, do you feel

1054
00:55:53.185 --> 00:55:55.264
that? Do you think that sex work can be

1055
00:55:55.264 --> 00:55:56.064
empowering?

1056
00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.439
Yeah, absolutely. I, I have felt very, very empowered

1057
00:56:00.439 --> 00:56:05.290
by it, and um. Just to kind of backtrack

1058
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:09.129
like. I've met some sex addicts or porn porn

1059
00:56:09.129 --> 00:56:13.110
addicts that um. Autism might have been a factor

1060
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.530
of why they're having, I mean they're having some

1061
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.510
functional issues in, in general, so then they're going

1062
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.939
to porn and then, you know, um. I haven't

1063
00:56:21.939 --> 00:56:25.530
met, uh, uh, well, I can see though, the

1064
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:29.399
relation, the inverse relationship between like uber religious people,

1065
00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.850
um, have been on a cycle, if you will,

1066
00:56:32.179 --> 00:56:34.100
of like watching the porn and then feeling really

1067
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.419
guilty, feeling bad and going back and doing it

1068
00:56:36.419 --> 00:56:39.419
again. Um, SO any of those things, if it

1069
00:56:39.419 --> 00:56:41.419
affects you negatively, you know, it's, it's not a

1070
00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:46.520
good thing. Um. I just, you know, it's just

1071
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.000
funny when, when feminists talk. I, I, I know

1072
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.280
so many women that are in really bad, unhealthy

1073
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:57.080
relationships, really bad, unhealthy relationships, but they would look

1074
00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.479
at a girl in the, uh, sex industry and

1075
00:56:59.479 --> 00:57:02.000
say, oh, that poor girl. Where I know girls

1076
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.919
in the sex industry that are on their 3

1077
00:57:03.919 --> 00:57:07.540
house that have a portfolio, that are doing things

1078
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.889
on their own, on their own terms. They go

1079
00:57:09.889 --> 00:57:12.260
to the gym, they're, you know, they're kicking butt.

1080
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.560
Um, THEY'RE way better off where they're at versus

1081
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.719
where they were if they had been back in

1082
00:57:18.719 --> 00:57:22.139
that abusive marriage that they had come from, so.

1083
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.850
You know, every single, every single human experience is,

1084
00:57:26.909 --> 00:57:29.409
is to their own and, and, and unique, and

1085
00:57:29.409 --> 00:57:32.679
I just listen to, to everybody and um try

1086
00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:34.969
not to be too judgmental and, and not to

1087
00:57:34.969 --> 00:57:39.540
typecast on one, any one particular issue. There are

1088
00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.850
some behavioral trends.

1089
00:57:41.379 --> 00:57:44.179
Yeah, I mean that's one of the things that

1090
00:57:44.179 --> 00:57:47.580
even though I, I mean I've learned about the

1091
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.419
psychology as I, as I told you before, the

1092
00:57:50.419 --> 00:57:54.500
kinds of psychological traits that people who are against

1093
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.379
sex work tend to have, so I understand that

1094
00:57:57.379 --> 00:57:59.939
they have those traits, but at the same time,

1095
00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.780
I mean, it always feels really hard for me

1096
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:10.969
to understand how particularly adult uh adults. Don't or

1097
00:58:10.969 --> 00:58:15.489
have such a hard time learning that there are

1098
00:58:15.489 --> 00:58:19.760
people who have different lifestyles, who have different interests,

1099
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:24.409
and they are not necessarily bad people or immoral

1100
00:58:24.409 --> 00:58:28.129
people or there's not necessarily something wrong with them

1101
00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:33.254
psychologically just because. They, for example, like to have

1102
00:58:33.254 --> 00:58:36.975
sex with different people and they, I mean, have

1103
00:58:36.975 --> 00:58:41.415
values different from your own values. I mean, that

1104
00:58:41.415 --> 00:58:45.495
just by itself is not something bad, right? But

1105
00:58:45.495 --> 00:58:48.975
I, sometimes it's really hard for people to learn

1106
00:58:48.975 --> 00:58:49.774
that, I guess.

1107
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:56.969
Yes, definitely, um. I just, I want people to

1108
00:58:56.969 --> 00:58:59.860
be safe and I want them to be happy

1109
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.110
and, and I just, I know a lot of

1110
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:08.379
people that are faking, um. Faking their happiness so

1111
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:11.100
they can look all prim and proper and they

1112
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.040
don't, and they, and they avoid any human judgment,

1113
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:18.139
um, whereas if they wanted to just do, throw

1114
00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:19.540
caution to the wind and do whatever the hell

1115
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.000
they wanted to do, whatever felt right for them,

1116
00:59:22.379 --> 00:59:24.810
um, they want to avoid that, that kind of,

1117
00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.959
um, public. I guess, uh, fear of just public

1118
00:59:29.959 --> 00:59:34.989
rejection, if you will, um. I say do what

1119
00:59:34.989 --> 00:59:37.629
you do what makes you happy, do what makes

1120
00:59:37.629 --> 00:59:42.469
you happy. So whatever that that is, um. Life

1121
00:59:42.469 --> 00:59:45.060
is just so interesting in, in this world with,

1122
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:49.040
with sex and relationships, and um I just, I

1123
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.000
strongly encourage people to meet people in person. And

1124
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.199
and have like discussions and stuff like what we're

1125
00:59:56.199 --> 00:59:57.520
doing. Um,

1126
00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.560
YEAH, of course, I mean, that's one of the

1127
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.719
things I really learned by reading, as I mentioned

1128
01:00:04.719 --> 01:00:08.760
before, Gerald Mosley's book, Sex Works and the sex

1129
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.159
workers and their clients in their own words. I

1130
01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:14.080
mean, just go out and ask people what they

1131
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.584
think. Think about what they do, right? Don't make

1132
01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:20.675
assumptions because many of these accusations that come from

1133
01:00:20.675 --> 01:00:24.794
people who are against sex work is just them

1134
01:00:24.794 --> 01:00:30.354
making assumptions about um how life is for a

1135
01:00:30.354 --> 01:00:31.475
sex worker,

1136
01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:37.229
right, right. Yeah, I, I, you'd be, you'd be

1137
01:00:37.229 --> 01:00:41.449
shocked. Some people would be shocked to, um, even

1138
01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:44.149
understand what we've, some folks have experienced in the

1139
01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:47.459
industry. Uh, THERE'S, I was. Just to give you

1140
01:00:47.459 --> 01:00:49.129
an example, you know, and this kind of goes

1141
01:00:49.129 --> 01:00:50.790
like to all the women or the haters out

1142
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.590
there that just think we're stupid and whatever, I

1143
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:57.189
was paid $70,000 to go to Lake Tahoe for

1144
01:00:57.189 --> 01:01:01.870
two days with a very nice gentleman. $70,000. It

1145
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.919
made my year. That was just one. Agreement that

1146
01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:08.149
I was made and and how was I treated?

1147
01:01:08.409 --> 01:01:10.919
Like a queen. I would, you know, we stayed

1148
01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:13.840
at the Ritz. I got to go to, I

1149
01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.600
had five-star meals. I was allowed to go. He

1150
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.199
said, Hey, do you want to go, uh, shopping?

1151
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.899
I want to take, I'm not even a shopper.

1152
01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:22.750
I'm not a shopper. I told you. I was

1153
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.590
saying, I, bring me a good holster and take

1154
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.229
me shooting, shooting. I'm a tomboy. And the guy's

1155
01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:29.310
like, I like shopping. And he goes, I want

1156
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.850
to dress you up. Let's go. You know. So

1157
01:01:31.909 --> 01:01:34.310
there's times when I'm thinking, I'm on cloud nine.

1158
01:01:34.379 --> 01:01:36.770
I can't even believe I'm getting paid like this.

1159
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.469
I'm being treated like a princess. Um, BUT not

1160
01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:45.250
every man brings that notion. It, it, it's Everybody's

1161
01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:49.419
different on how they regard, um, like men regard

1162
01:01:49.419 --> 01:01:51.939
women, right? So some men that approach me are

1163
01:01:51.939 --> 01:01:54.699
not all nice. Some want to abuse me. You

1164
01:01:54.699 --> 01:01:56.659
get that all fleshed out from the very get-go.

1165
01:01:56.939 --> 01:01:59.060
You, you know, you have your, if you have

1166
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.540
your system tightened in place on how to vet

1167
01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.500
people and make sure that you do get good

1168
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.729
company, you're not going to have a. OF crap

1169
01:02:05.729 --> 01:02:07.129
come through your door. You're not going to have

1170
01:02:07.129 --> 01:02:09.050
to deal with somebody like that. They're going to

1171
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.000
show their cards well in advance, and they're not

1172
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.129
gonna want to, if you're saying, I need to

1173
01:02:14.129 --> 01:02:17.189
know where you work. I need your ID, and

1174
01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:19.010
I'm gonna have you put half down in a

1175
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:22.899
deposit, like that person's going to be serious and,

1176
01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:24.889
you know, if you do get somebody who's not

1177
01:02:24.889 --> 01:02:29.600
as pleasant, call up their employer. Take care of

1178
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.639
the situation. I had a man fired. I had

1179
01:02:32.639 --> 01:02:35.639
a woman fired once for harassing me, pretending that

1180
01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:38.719
she was a client. She had some, naturally she

1181
01:02:38.719 --> 01:02:42.290
works in mental health. This would surprise not one

1182
01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.530
sex worker. A woman that works in mental health

1183
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.209
for a living is harassing a prostitute that she

1184
01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:49.239
has a crush on or whatever the deal was.

1185
01:02:49.459 --> 01:02:50.810
You know, I found out where she worked and

1186
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:54.449
I got her fired. So, again, that goes back

1187
01:02:54.449 --> 01:02:56.929
to what is the woman who's walking into the

1188
01:02:56.929 --> 01:03:00.030
sex industry made out of? Because if you walk

1189
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:02.909
in and you're really weak, and you're used to

1190
01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.790
letting people beat you up and abuse you anyhow,

1191
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.989
that's probably going to happen to you until you

1192
01:03:07.989 --> 01:03:09.949
put your foot down. But that's going to happen

1193
01:03:09.949 --> 01:03:15.590
to you anywhere. OK? So, um, I just, I

1194
01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:19.340
think The women in this industry that are really

1195
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.219
successful, they've been around the block, they've experienced life,

1196
01:03:23.629 --> 01:03:27.500
and um, They've got their head on straight to

1197
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.379
be able to be successful and keep going. And

1198
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:32.699
some are just flat out just crazy, just having

1199
01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:36.780
crazy, just having wild sex. I've I've heard wild

1200
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.929
stories about, um, the ones that I hear are

1201
01:03:39.929 --> 01:03:41.979
really wild are some of the porn stars that

1202
01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:45.340
are just crazy off the chain, and they are

1203
01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.729
just going from one guy to the next doing

1204
01:03:47.729 --> 01:03:51.080
all these wild, you know, having wild, wild situations.

1205
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:55.620
Um. But I would say that there's a lot

1206
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.739
of wild people off the chain in in in

1207
01:03:57.739 --> 01:04:00.360
the industry, right, that are doing crazy things.

1208
01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.060
I mean, I guess more power to them as

1209
01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:11.000
far as long as they're safe, right? Yes. So

1210
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
let me just ask you one more question because

1211
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.639
I was just looking at the time, I don't

1212
01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:16.860
want to take much more of your time. So,

1213
01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.800
uh, what would you say then, uh, is the

1214
01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.260
role that sex plays in your life?

1215
01:04:24.679 --> 01:04:28.159
Uh, IT, it makes me feel, it's interesting, it

1216
01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:32.020
makes me feel like valid. I know that. It's,

1217
01:04:32.219 --> 01:04:35.379
it makes me feel validated. Um, BUT, you know,

1218
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:40.060
we're getting men coming after us 24/7, always throwing

1219
01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:44.780
themselves at us. So, um, but oddly enough, if

1220
01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.739
I go, you know, a week without having a

1221
01:04:47.739 --> 01:04:49.699
date or something, I start feeling like, uh, you

1222
01:04:49.699 --> 01:04:51.459
know, I want, even though people have been giving

1223
01:04:51.459 --> 01:04:53.600
me attention, I know I'm sexy. I want to

1224
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.840
go have a date. I wanna go have an

1225
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.860
interaction, a positive, fun, sexy interaction with a guy,

1226
01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:04.219
um, and get the juices flowing. So it's, it's

1227
01:05:04.219 --> 01:05:06.330
a need for me too. It validates me. It

1228
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.479
makes me feel good. It makes me work out.

1229
01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:12.419
It makes me like motivated to go work out

1230
01:05:12.419 --> 01:05:14.860
and invest the amount of time that I do

1231
01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.060
into my body, um, and to, to try to

1232
01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:22.310
be healthy. I think our sex drives, they drive,

1233
01:05:22.469 --> 01:05:25.310
they, they drive us. They're drivers. They, you know,

1234
01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:26.790
they're, they're driving us to want to go to

1235
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.270
the gym. They're driving us to want to make

1236
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:31.229
X amount of money. I think sex drive is

1237
01:05:31.229 --> 01:05:35.689
huge. So, um, use it or lose it, and,

1238
01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:37.820
you know, I think you'll have more fun if

1239
01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.820
you, if you, if you use it.

1240
01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:44.310
Yeah, for sure. So, look, thank you so much

1241
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:46.909
for doing this, but just before we go, where

1242
01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.989
can people find you on the

1243
01:05:48.989 --> 01:05:53.260
internet? Um, I am on X, so it is

1244
01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.620

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:19.729

1251
01:06:19.729 --> 01:06:21.489
tried to get me to buy it. I just

1252
01:06:21.489 --> 01:06:23.449
decided to do for a lot of money and

1253
01:06:23.449 --> 01:06:25.010
I was like, Thanks a lot, jerk. So it's

1254
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:30.860
