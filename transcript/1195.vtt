00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.559
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.520
today I'm joined by Caitlin Bailey. She's a sex

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.119
worker rights advocate, a comedian, a writer, the host

5
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.319
of the, the oldest profession podcast, and today we're

6
00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.879
going to talk about some of the history and

7
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.079
misconceptions that people have about sex workers. So, Caitlin,

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.299
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.520
Thank you so much for having me. I really

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.260
appreciate being here.

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.229
OK, so we say that prostitution is the oldest

12
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.580
profession in the world, right? So how old is

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.990
it actually, and how can we know that? I

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.889
mean, do we look at archaeology, anthropology, or what?

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.259
Uh,

16
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.950
ARCHAEOLOGISTS will absolutely quibble with you on this. I

17
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.630
believe that midwifery is probably the oldest profession. We

18
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.549
would not have made it past the Homo erectus

19
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.349
stage as a species without very skilled, uh, midwives,

20
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.150
um, but sex work or the exchange of erotic

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.785
services or sex for something of value pre. Dates

22
00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:08.464
us as a species and is certainly older than

23
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:12.665
money. Uh, MONKEYS do this, penguins do this, other

24
00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:16.144
species of birds do this, um, and there's a

25
00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:19.294
lot of evidence to suggest that our, uh, our

26
00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:20.525
ancestors did this.

27
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.250
Yeah, no, that's very interesting because just earlier this

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.870
year I interviewed Nathan Lentz. He published the book

29
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.059
The Sexual Evolution. He's an evolutionary biologist and that

30
00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:34.269
at a certain point we talked about transactional sex

31
00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.830
in other species, and I guess that some of

32
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.029
these conservative people would just think, oh my God,

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.500
it's outrageous. Come on, you're having transactional sex. That

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.099
might be nat that can be natural, right?

35
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.029
Yes, it's uh. It's as natural as hunting.

36
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.550
So, uh, what are the oldest depictions of, uh,

37
00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.440
prostitution or other kinds of sexual practices in human

38
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.639
history?

39
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.050
So, I make the argument that uh sex for

40
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.929
meat is probably the first exchange. We have one

41
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.630
of the most, excuse me, forgive me, it is

42
00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:17.839
6 a.m. here. Um. And I, uh, I performed

43
00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.199
last night, so I'm still, still acclimating to, to

44
00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.509
talking.

45
00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.679
You could, you could have told me, and we

46
00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.669
would, we would have scheduled the interview

47
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.520
later. I, you're absolutely right, and, uh, and also

48
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.160
I just, I wanted to, I wanted to do

49
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.070
this. So thank you very much for being flexible.

50
00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.330
This was a. Self-inflicted, um, scheduling snafu, but I,

51
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.270
uh, I scheduled this when I was on the

52
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.070
East Coast, so it would have been a 9

53
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.690
a.m. interview, which was a much more reasonable endeavor

54
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.139
and now I am on the West Coast, uh,

55
00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.550
and with the time change and, uh, you know,

56
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.380
it's, yeah, uh. So your question is like what

57
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.300
are some of the examples of like the earliest,

58
00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:02.850
uh, earliest exchanges of prostitution, um, so before written

59
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.699
history, right, before we have any cultural evidence of

60
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.949
like organized or formal prostitution. I think that there's

61
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:14.470
a lot of physiological evidence to suggest that sex

62
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.179
for meat is probably one of the first exchanges.

63
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.350
We have one of the most dramatic menses of

64
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
any species. If any other animal bled the way

65
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.229
that we do, they'd pass out and die in

66
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.369
the wilderness. They could not handle it. And so

67
00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:35.250
because of this, people with uteruses spent a huge

68
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.410
chunk of our history walking around in an almost

69
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.690
constant state of iron deficiency. And so there's a

70
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.490
lot of incentives around, you know, women who, uh,

71
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.949
sometimes have children or sometimes bleeding or like trying

72
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.889
to entice or cajole or bully or bribe. Men

73
00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.710
to go and kill things for us and so

74
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.970
I think that there are probably a lot of

75
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.899
old rituals, a lot of ancient religious practices, um,

76
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.050
and also certainly examples of either solo or organized

77
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.369
prostitution, all in the interest of getting men to

78
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:19.559
bring women meat, um, fast forward. Tens if not

79
00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:23.329
hundreds of thousands of years, I think some of

80
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:28.769
the earliest temples, sort of ubiquitously right on every

81
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:35.410
continent feature fertility goddesses, often eroticized fertility goddesses, and

82
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.489
there's a lot of examples that temple prostitution is

83
00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:43.290
a pretty common practice that you see throughout the

84
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.429
world, right? Worshippers coming. Having sexual experiences with, uh,

85
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.200
you know, priestesses that are channel, channeling, you know,

86
00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:57.519
various, uh, iterations, various deities, um, in exchange for

87
00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.079
something of value, the way that you might leave,

88
00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:02.359
um, you know, an offering at a church or

89
00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:07.320
a temple today, what relationship this has to sort

90
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.696
of like brothels. Prostitution or like how that evolves.

91
00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:13.825
We know that they come together, um, certainly in

92
00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:16.425
biblical times, there's a lot of like switching back

93
00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:20.925
and forth between like temple prostitution and tavern prostitution,

94
00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:25.346
but um, I believe, um, and I'm biased on

95
00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:28.425
this and I'm probably stretching past, uh, you know,

96
00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:32.171
the archaeological evidence. But I think that priestess, prostitutes

97
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.191
built the foundations of civilization. I think it was

98
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:38.611
us that gave people a reason to come together

99
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.891
without killing one another, that domesticated plants and animals,

100
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:45.772
that invented scripts, that tamed fire, that created a

101
00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:48.971
lot of the rituals that allowed people to gather

102
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:51.471
and create what we would recognize as culture.

103
00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.989
But wait a minute, you mentioned eroticized temple goddesses,

104
00:05:57.109 --> 00:06:02.109
so are you saying that there were forms of

105
00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:05.779
pornography thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago?

106
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.489
Yes.

107
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.149
Oh, OK, so it's not, uh, it was not

108
00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.440
invented by capitalism.

109
00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.480
No, no, it certainly wasn't invented by the internet.

110
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.350
So it's, yeah, I think as soon as we

111
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.070
started scratching things into walls, uh, depicting each other's

112
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.750
bodies, uh, doing sexy things was one of the

113
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.149
first things that we did, whether that was art,

114
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.220
whether that was religion, whether that was sex work,

115
00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:33.790
whether there are clear lines between all of those

116
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.070
things is for other people to decide.

117
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.179
So there were, there were public depictions of sexual

118
00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.779
practices.

119
00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:47.100
Absolutely, yes, 100%. Yeah, and you know, they say

120
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.899
there's a, there's an old joke, the difference between

121
00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.820
pornography and erotica is like about 20 years. And

122
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.109
so I don't know what it is when it's

123
00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:56.359
20,000 years.

124
00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.239
But, OK, look, but since you are a, yeah,

125
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.359
since you are a sex worker rights advocate, what

126
00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.920
is a sex worker? I mean, what do you

127
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.980
define, uh, how do you define a sex worker?

128
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.640
So I define sex worker very broadly in part

129
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.760
because I am an activist and so I think,

130
00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:23.869
you know, having a big tent, having a broad

131
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:28.959
coalition is really important. And so anyone who's engaging

132
00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.720
in any kind of eroticized labor, um, sex work

133
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.679
is a broad umbrella term. Refers to people doing

134
00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:42.779
both criminalized, uh, you know, full service in-person exchange,

135
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.200
whether that's happening, you know, like on the street

136
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.880
or in cars or in hotel rooms or brothels

137
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.760
or massage parlors, but it also refers to people

138
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.700
who are doing like touchless performances, right, whether that's

139
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.160
peep show or uh OnlyFans or porn star, uh,

140
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.040
forms of like dominatrix or like BDSM work um.

141
00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:05.933
I think it also includes like phone sex operators,

142
00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:08.493
foot fetish models, people that sell their panties that

143
00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:12.092
have never shown their face, uh, you know, people

144
00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:15.053
engaged in a wide variety of things that people

145
00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:18.773
outside of the exchange might not recognize as erotic

146
00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:21.132
but are. You know, there's a woman I know

147
00:08:21.132 --> 00:08:22.923
who has a client who likes to be tickled

148
00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:25.243
by feathers. He pays her hundreds of dollars an

149
00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:29.412
hour for that exchange. They know it's sexual. Good

150
00:08:29.412 --> 00:08:32.306
luck prosecuting that. You know, uh, I want to

151
00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:36.645
include Hooters waitresses. So, you know, there's a very

152
00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:42.385
broad and I would say fortunately, unfortunately slippery kind

153
00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:47.065
of relationship and like the word whore has become

154
00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:50.645
or has always been a sort of flexible category

155
00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:55.065
that stretches to include, uh, you know, women with

156
00:08:55.065 --> 00:09:01.090
opinions. So sex work. Um, IT'S also a similarly

157
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.030
broad category, um, of folks, a wide variety of

158
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.469
people doing a wide variety of things for a

159
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:09.969
wide variety of reasons.

160
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.549
But do you think that when advocating for sex

161
00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:17.510
workers it's important to distinguish between the different types

162
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:22.710
of sex work with their own peculiarities or it's

163
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.750
not necessary?

164
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.989
I think that, you know, the devil's in the

165
00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:31.309
details in terms of like policy specifics and the,

166
00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:35.260
you know, the political or, you know, advocacy. Needs

167
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.940
of strippers who are working at a brick and

168
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.580
mortar establishment and OnlyFans models and you know in

169
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.179
person in-service workers are different, but the uniting factor

170
00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.900
is that we all face the same stigma and

171
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.940
we all, we should all stand together to support

172
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.859
each other fighting for a safer, healthier, uh, more

173
00:09:56.859 --> 00:09:58.440
just future for all of us.

174
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.239
And, and in terms of how you approach sex

175
00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:06.419
work, do you have a feminist approach to it

176
00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.039
or

177
00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:10.960
not? I identify as a feminist. Um, I believe

178
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.239
that sex workers were the first feminists. We were

179
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:18.359
certainly in spaces that feminists spent a long time

180
00:10:18.359 --> 00:10:23.150
fighting to get into, uh, long before, uh, feminists

181
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.859
were invited into them. Um, BUT I don't, I

182
00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:30.099
don't know if there's a distinction between like feminist

183
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:35.380
advocates and anti-feminist advocates within the sex work, you

184
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.580
know, like I think that laws that help just

185
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.380
like that, I think that the distinction between, like

186
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.380
there is a distinction of course between like adult

187
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.250
consensual sex workers and victims of human trafficking.

188
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.210
Sure, we're going to talk about that,

189
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.585
yeah, yes. And also the decriminalization of sex work

190
00:10:57.005 --> 00:11:02.044
helps both sex workers and survivors of prostitution. And

191
00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:04.085
so, you know, I think it's important for sex

192
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:07.684
worker rights advocates to include people that identify as

193
00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:11.284
survivors of prostitution that do not identify as adult

194
00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:13.825
consensual sex workers that hate the phrase sex work

195
00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:18.325
in our coalition, right, in our uh in our

196
00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:21.210
community. Um, SO I don't really know what the

197
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.859
distinction would be, but like I'm a feminist. Most

198
00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:26.530
sex worker rights advocates I know are feminists, but

199
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.549
I also know a lot of feminists that fight

200
00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:32.289
against our work. So, yeah.

201
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.869
Yes, that that's actually what I was going to

202
00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:39.229
ask you because there are these sort of more

203
00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:45.229
sex negative feminists, uh, gender critical feminists, and, and

204
00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:48.169
even, I mean, people who are not necessarily feminists

205
00:11:48.169 --> 00:11:51.429
but more conservative people who have this sort of

206
00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:56.500
more moralistic and patronizing approaches to sex work. So

207
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.820
what do you make of them, particularly when they

208
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.450
identify as feminists?

209
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.960
Sure, I mean this is, uh, this is part

210
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.619
of the feminist movement that, you know, in the

211
00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:08.700
US at least goes back to the Seneca Falls

212
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.859
Convention of 1840. You know, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who

213
00:12:12.859 --> 00:12:16.679
was the first, you know, feminist woman to suggest

214
00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:20.900
that women have the right to vote. Convened what

215
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.169
we would recognize as sort of like the modern,

216
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.270
you know, like feminist movement, and her and Susan

217
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.390
B. Anthony wrote Victoria Woodhull, who was the first

218
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.750
woman to run for president, the first woman to

219
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.789
address Congress on the issue of suffrage, the first

220
00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:36.950
woman to open up, you know, her own brokerage

221
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.049
firm. Out of our history because she was a

222
00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:44.710
sex worker and so there was an interest among

223
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.849
the Elizabeth Cady Stanton's and Susan B. Anthony's of

224
00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:53.650
the world to distinguish themselves from notorious women, women

225
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.880
with bad reputations, uh, women. Victoria Woodhull because they

226
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:03.349
didn't want to tarnish the emergent feminist movement of,

227
00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:09.080
you know, upper class white, often married women who

228
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.549
thought, many of whom thought that like asking for

229
00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:13.349
the right to vote was too radical. They were

230
00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:18.030
asking for things like. You know, property rights, the

231
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.010
right for, you know, women to maintain property even

232
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.190
in marriage. So it's, it's interesting to think about.

233
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.900
And then of course that tension continues into what

234
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.190
we recognize as the porn wars in the 1970s

235
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.289
and like luminaries with brilliant women like Gloria Steinem

236
00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:40.590
end up spending huge amounts of their advocacy energy.

237
00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:46.119
Trying to eradicate the oldest profession and criminalize pornography

238
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.260
in the name of creating, you know, a safer

239
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.820
space for women. Women like, you know, Andrea Dworin

240
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.500
or Catherine McKinnon genuinely believe that we should be

241
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.700
fighting porn rather than fighting for access to contraception

242
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.419
or abortion rights. And of course, you know, we

243
00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:06.669
live in a porn saturated world and we. Lost

244
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:09.530
access to safe and legal abortion in half of

245
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.409
the US, so, you know, I believe that my

246
00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:17.409
feminist foremothers were wrong about where they should be

247
00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:20.210
spending their energy, and I think that this tension

248
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.409
within the feminist movement is kind of a fatal

249
00:14:22.409 --> 00:14:26.929
flaw that has, uh, I don't know, I don't

250
00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:29.090
know how academic how academic it is. It's very

251
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.440
early in the morning if I cuss on this

252
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:30.909
podcast.

253
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.739
Um, uh, uh, YEAH, I guess it depends on

254
00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:36.059
the word, the specific word, because this will, I

255
00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:38.250
mean, this will be on YouTube, but anyway, yeah,

256
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.119
well, you know, maybe you can beep it or

257
00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:42.159
whatever, but it, it's really, I mean, it, it's

258
00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:46.559
fucked us, like, you know, from the beginning, women

259
00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:51.080
have spent too much time fighting other women trying

260
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.239
to police our own sexual choices rather than finding

261
00:14:55.239 --> 00:15:00.119
and fighting for shared ground. Because like sex workers

262
00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:03.299
and anti-sex feminists want a lot of the same

263
00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:03.760
things.

264
00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:08.719
Yeah, and I find it very interesting er when

265
00:15:08.719 --> 00:15:12.799
those kinds of attitudes come from feminists particularly, but

266
00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:17.429
because shouldn't feminists be in favor of women er

267
00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:22.840
consensually having sex, whether it's sold or not, whether

268
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.960
it's for money or not, er I I mean

269
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.479
and making their own sexual choices.

270
00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:31.010
Right, and I think that like, you know, smart

271
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.650
people can disagree about the corrupting influence of like

272
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.559
money or capitalism or the economy or, you know,

273
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.250
what it means to commodify oneself or, you know,

274
00:15:42.369 --> 00:15:46.440
like the soul eroding work. Of turning yourself into

275
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.229
a brand, but that's as true of YouTubers as

276
00:15:49.229 --> 00:15:51.799
it is for OnlyFans models. And when we sort

277
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:56.119
of separate out erotic labor, sexual labor, I think

278
00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:59.840
we blind ourselves to the shared like labor conversation

279
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.739
that we can be having. Um, YOU know, again,

280
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.960
I, I spend a lot of my time talking

281
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.559
about how we can and should stand together against

282
00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:14.359
exploitation, but when prostitution becomes a symbol of exploitation,

283
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.719
we end up directing our energies at all of

284
00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:19.039
the wrong things, and we are not going to

285
00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:24.719
get to a safer, healthier, more gender equitable future

286
00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:27.000
by trying to like erase tits from the internet.

287
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.049
I mean, I get the sense, please correct me

288
00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:33.969
if I'm wrong because you're probably much more into

289
00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:36.289
feminism than I am. I mean, I also identify

290
00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:38.679
as a feminist, but you probably know much more

291
00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:40.820
than I do about it, but I get the

292
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.809
sense that many of these feminist women that position.

293
00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:49.580
Themselves against sex work or specific kinds of sex

294
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.479
work that uh I mean they're sort of moralizing

295
00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:57.099
attitudes that they have towards sex workers stem a

296
00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:01.619
lot from their attitudes about sex more broadly.

297
00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:06.680
Yeah, and I think that it's important. To contextualize

298
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.160
that and understand that a lot of people, including

299
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.839
feminists, are coming to this conversation having experienced sexual

300
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.739
trauma and so, you know, I, I know that

301
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.890
that's true and, and, you know, like Andrea Dorkin

302
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.079
writes openly about this, but there are a lot

303
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.479
of feminist thinkers who are informed by their own

304
00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:30.800
personal experience and you know it's difficult once somebody's

305
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.250
experienced that kind of, of, of trauma, not. To

306
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.709
universalize it. And so I do have deep empathy

307
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:41.969
for people, you know, especially like, you know, the,

308
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.770
the browbeaten wives of the early 19th century, right,

309
00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:49.069
with like, you know, drunk husbands having no legal

310
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.790
recourse, like coming home, spending all of the family

311
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.989
money on brothels and bars, beating their families, you

312
00:17:56.989 --> 00:18:01.270
know, I understand how a sex negative attitude could

313
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.969
emerge from those conditions.

314
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.839
Yeah, but, but I mean, but we have to

315
00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:09.959
take that into account and they are probably not

316
00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:16.839
considering, uh, how sex workers themselves experience sex work,

317
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.400
right, and I think that there is, you know,

318
00:18:19.689 --> 00:18:23.824
sort of like. Catastrophicizing that could happen or again,

319
00:18:23.864 --> 00:18:27.425
like, you know, imposing your own experience on, onto

320
00:18:27.425 --> 00:18:31.484
others and like, you know, charity, charities in general

321
00:18:31.484 --> 00:18:35.925
have this kind of like dark underbelly history of

322
00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:42.699
people imposing their own fantasies. Or narratives on the

323
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:44.579
people that they may think that they're trying to

324
00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:47.500
help, but you can't help people that you can't

325
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.099
hear. So if you're not listening to their own

326
00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:53.099
experiences, if you're not open, uh, you know, coming

327
00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:56.099
to the table with curiosity and empathy, but rather

328
00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:59.380
the sort of like moralizing tone, it's very easy

329
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.859
to do violence, uh, even in the name of

330
00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:04.540
charity and Christian Concern.

331
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.359
Yeah, that's actually why I'm doing this series that

332
00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:11.390
I call humanizing sex workers on my channel and

333
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.140
podcast, because I actually think that people should try

334
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.579
to talk with sex workers themselves instead of assuming

335
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.000
the kinds of experiences they have.

336
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.479
And that's the secret, right? Uh, YOU know, it's

337
00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.680
easy to, um, you know, hold all kinds of

338
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.314
crazy ideas. About people you've never met, right? You

339
00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:34.704
know, we saw this with the LGBTQ plus movement,

340
00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:37.354
right? Like a lot of stigma and shame is

341
00:19:37.354 --> 00:19:40.435
made possible in a world before people realize they

342
00:19:40.435 --> 00:19:44.114
already know and love a gay person. And so

343
00:19:44.114 --> 00:19:45.795
we just need to work towards a future where

344
00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:49.635
people realize that they already know and probably really

345
00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:51.655
like a sex worker in their lives.

346
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.359
Um, HOW do you look at, uh, stigma surrounding

347
00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:00.160
sex work in society nowadays? Do you think that

348
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.880
sex work is still as stigmatized as it was

349
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.800
a few decades ago or perhaps a little bit

350
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.459
less?

351
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:11.750
It's interesting. I feel like I am, I'm starting

352
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.260
to, uh, I'm, I'm almost 40. And I feel

353
00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:21.000
like in my relatively short life, I've watched the

354
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
pendulum swing both ways. Growing up, I feel like

355
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.660
we were moving towards a more accepting future. And

356
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.400
within the last, like, I don't know, 5 to

357
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.140
7, maybe 10 years. I've seen kind of a

358
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.359
complicated swing back, um, and part of that is,

359
00:20:43.449 --> 00:20:46.380
is visibility, right? Like the trans community experienced this,

360
00:20:46.469 --> 00:20:50.020
right? Like visibility does not necessarily lead to more

361
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.260
rights. So OnlyFans, the ubiquity of porn on the

362
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.140
internet, uh, conversations that we're, you know, like having

363
00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.459
around like sex and culture and sex negative culture.

364
00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:03.290
Like you see this next generation coming up with

365
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.849
a lot of like very retro kind of like

366
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.689
reactionary um ideas that I recognize from my, my

367
00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:13.489
grandfather about like purity, culture, um, or, you know,

368
00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:16.089
like sex negative, um, you know, and I'm like

369
00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:17.250
talking to young people, I'm like, I don't think

370
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.810
you know what you're asking for. Like you want

371
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.650
less, you want more censorship in in movies? What

372
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.410
is like, what, what, what is, what, what is

373
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.410
this coming from? Um, AND also sex workers have

374
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.130
never been more active. Belgium just became the first

375
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.930
country in Europe to decriminalize sex work. There are

376
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.699
more sex workers having conversations with legislators as constituents

377
00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:40.160
than at any other point in human history. So

378
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.170
there's a lot of reason for hope and there's

379
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.689
a lot of reason for caution, and the history

380
00:21:44.689 --> 00:21:47.729
has always been complicated, uh, and the, you know,

381
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.369
the modern moment is no exception.

382
00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:54.069
Yes, actually, you know, I, I thought because I

383
00:21:54.069 --> 00:21:57.589
have um conflicting thoughts about it because on the

384
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:59.709
one hand, I look at, for example, the fact

385
00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:04.140
that nowadays, um, sex workers are, and porn stars,

386
00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:07.550
for example, are on social media and people follow

387
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.630
them more or less openly and, and some of

388
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.699
them get celebrated publicly, but at the same time,

389
00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:18.406
I mean, for example, just recently. Recently on X

390
00:22:18.406 --> 00:22:24.056
slash Twitter, uh, prostitutes, uh, from Nevada got their

391
00:22:24.556 --> 00:22:28.956
accounts banned, suspended, and, uh, not only that, but

392
00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:32.156
also just recently I released an interview on my

393
00:22:32.156 --> 00:22:35.576
channel with Nina Hartley, and we have a fantastic

394
00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:39.036
conversation about pornography and, uh, feminism and so on,

395
00:22:39.395 --> 00:22:43.982
and, uh, I, I thought that for example. Uh,

396
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:48.562
THINGS like the MILF category in porn would be

397
00:22:48.562 --> 00:22:53.631
contributing to fighting against ageism in porn, uh, and,

398
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:57.881
uh, interracial sex without fighting against racism, but actually

399
00:22:57.881 --> 00:23:02.602
she educated me on the fact that probably it's

400
00:23:02.602 --> 00:23:07.082
not really like that, that we are contributing to

401
00:23:07.082 --> 00:23:09.962
the fetishization of certain people.

402
00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:12.939
Yeah, absolutely, and I think that part of that

403
00:23:12.939 --> 00:23:17.000
is a part of the creator culture in general,

404
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.660
right? You know, I think what's happening to porn

405
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.660
stars or OnlyFans stars is a very similar thing

406
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.849
that's happening to TikTok stars or influencers is that

407
00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:30.979
we're kind of flattening ourselves for the for the

408
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:33.900
algorithm, um, and so, you know, we all live

409
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.699
in these kind of media silos and sex workers'

410
00:23:37.699 --> 00:23:41.709
media silos are more. Siloed, um,

411
00:23:41.969 --> 00:23:46.930
yeah. Yeah, so I mean, let me, uh, run

412
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.890
through you some of the most common claims made

413
00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.489
by people who are against sex workers, not just

414
00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:58.050
the sex negative feminists, but also the more conservative

415
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.729
type of people. Uh, YOU'VE already mentioned this briefly

416
00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:06.010
earlier, but they claim that sex work is always

417
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.449
exploitative. So what do you reply to that?

418
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.810
I mean, sex work is work and maybe work

419
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.689
is always exploitative, but it's no more, there's more

420
00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:24.270
trafficking and more overt exploitation in agriculture and fishing

421
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.229
and mining and domestic labor than there is in

422
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.235
porn or prostitution. That's, and that's just. Stone cold

423
00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:34.316
fact, right? That's not, that's not me spitballing. That's

424
00:24:34.316 --> 00:24:36.796
according to like the US Department of Labor Statistics,

425
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.676
right? That's according to the World Health Department, Amnesty

426
00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:44.426
International, uh, you know, these, there's empirical evidence to

427
00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:48.276
suggest that there is, there is not more traffic.

428
00:24:48.316 --> 00:24:52.862
Like trafficking is not overrepresented in. Sex work, it

429
00:24:52.862 --> 00:25:00.541
is overrepresented amongst vulnerable populations. Now the criminalization of

430
00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:05.342
sex work does lead to more vulnerabilities, which leads

431
00:25:05.342 --> 00:25:11.302
to more exploitation, but there's nothing inherently exploitative about

432
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:12.222
erotic labor.

433
00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:15.020
Yeah, uh uh uh we're going to come back

434
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.099
to that bit about criminalization because I want to

435
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:21.219
ask you specifically what you think is the best

436
00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:24.579
legal and political approach to sex work, but we're

437
00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:27.180
going to get there. I, I was just, I

438
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.140
was just going to say that it's interesting when

439
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.739
people talk about, for example, sex trafficking, and they

440
00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:38.300
use that to make the claim that because they're

441
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.302
sex trafficking, then. Uh, PROSTITUTION and sex work more

442
00:25:42.302 --> 00:25:46.062
generally should be abolished, should be banned, but they

443
00:25:46.062 --> 00:25:48.853
don't make the same argument when there's trafficking in

444
00:25:48.853 --> 00:25:50.802
the case of a of

445
00:25:50.802 --> 00:25:52.113
agriculture reconstruction

446
00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:52.542
and so

447
00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:56.333
clothing, your iPhone, I mean like we live in

448
00:25:56.333 --> 00:26:01.572
a deeply extractive exploitative economy. There's absolutely examples of,

449
00:26:01.822 --> 00:26:05.003
you know, horrific violence, but if the presence of

450
00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:08.985
exploitation is enough to abolish. Industries then like we've

451
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.906
got to get rid of industry and so I

452
00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:13.426
don't see people giving up fast fashion. I don't

453
00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:16.145
see people giving up, you know, the food that

454
00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:18.786
they eat. I don't see people giving up um

455
00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:23.336
other examples of like more obvious harm. Um, IT'S

456
00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:26.066
just easier for them uh to try to judge

457
00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:29.546
and shame, um, and make life harder for sex

458
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:33.306
workers again in the name of charity and concern.

459
00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:34.739
And it's Yeah, I, I

460
00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:37.459
actually, I actually think that this kind of attitude

461
00:26:37.459 --> 00:26:41.619
towards sex work and then connecting sex trafficking to

462
00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:44.239
it has much more to do with people's own

463
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.900
moral values than with simply the legal aspects of

464
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.099
it.

465
00:26:49.229 --> 00:26:53.069
Yeah, I mean people just can't imagine. Themselves doing

466
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:55.699
this work and so they fight to make it

467
00:26:55.699 --> 00:26:58.349
impossible for other people to do this work, but

468
00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:03.069
they don't do that with soldiers or people that

469
00:27:03.069 --> 00:27:06.109
work in slaughterhouses or people that work in mines.

470
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.250
There are a lot of industries that are horrific

471
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.479
for people's mind, body, and soul. Sex work is

472
00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:15.420
not in the top 10.

473
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.410
Yeah, and I guess they also don't give up

474
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:22.209
construction even though if you go to Qatar or

475
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:26.329
Dubai, there's lots of slaves working there in construction.

476
00:27:26.849 --> 00:27:30.689
So, so, uh, I mean, and, and the other,

477
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.989
another kind of argument that they have is that.

478
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:39.119
Sex work is never a choice that people are

479
00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:41.160
always cursed into it.

480
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.040
Uh, WHAT do you say it just doesn't matter

481
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.880
how many sex workers stand up and say I

482
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:53.520
made a choice, uh, like, you know, any, I

483
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.469
mean, we've written books, like we've, we've done seminars.

484
00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.300
There's so many of us. I travel the world

485
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.609
performing and meeting other. Adult consensual sex workers, people

486
00:28:06.609 --> 00:28:09.050
who chose this work, people who felt called to

487
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.849
this work, and so it's interesting, you know, when

488
00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:15.359
you're talking to ideologues that believe this stuff, you're

489
00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:22.329
either too privileged to be representative, or people are

490
00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:27.060
speaking for you, so. You know, because your experience

491
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.979
does not align with their trauma porn fantasy, they

492
00:28:30.979 --> 00:28:33.859
say you're not representative, and it doesn't seem to

493
00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:37.520
matter how many of us non-representative sex workers there

494
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.020
are.

495
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.089
Yeah, it's very interesting. Back in uh last year

496
00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:45.130
actually, I interviewed Gerald Mosley. He wrote this book

497
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.839
Sex Workers and Their Clients in Their Own Words,

498
00:28:47.849 --> 00:28:52.290
and he basically collected, uh, statements from different sex

499
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.050
workers tackling each of the claims made by abolitionists

500
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.030
and, uh, at a certain point there he, um,

501
00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:03.410
basically quoted someone, I can't remember her exact name,

502
00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:08.800
but she was. Referring to uh feminists trying to

503
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.160
represent sex workers, and she was pissed off and

504
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.959
saying, I don't want these feminists representing me because

505
00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:19.760
they don't, they know nothing about my experiences in

506
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.760
sex work and so they just want to ban

507
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.800
it, prohibit it, abolish it, and they, they know

508
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.599
nothing about it, so they, I don't want them

509
00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:29.500
representing me.

510
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.560
Yeah, absolutely. It's, it's ridiculous to me how many

511
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.920
people are out there trying to speak for people.

512
00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:41.660
Who have written books.

513
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.329
So, uh, also another kind of claim that they

514
00:29:47.329 --> 00:29:50.469
make is that sex work tend to be associated

515
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.650
with poverty and the lack of other employment opportunities.

516
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.449
So what do you make of that?

517
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.729
I mean, sure, but again, if you're listing industries

518
00:30:02.989 --> 00:30:07.500
where, you know, poor folks are overrepresented, sex work

519
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.229
is not in the top 10, you know, I

520
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:15.270
don't see folks calling to abolish domestic labor even

521
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.005
though there are not a lot. Of like middle

522
00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:21.925
class college educated people, you know, cleaning homes and

523
00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:27.084
hotel rooms, um, uh, same, same again, agriculture work,

524
00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:32.474
mining work, backbreaking work. So uh yes, sex work,

525
00:30:32.535 --> 00:30:36.599
uh, is an option, uh, for folks that. You

526
00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:38.839
know, it's a low barrier to entry. Um, IT'S

527
00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:42.439
something that, you know, people can do, uh, anywhere,

528
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.199
so I understand why it is an option for

529
00:30:45.199 --> 00:30:48.959
people that don't have many options, but there are

530
00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:50.880
a lot of people with a lot of options

531
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.800
who are doing this work, and that is not

532
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.910
true for, uh, mining or agriculture, um, and you

533
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.599
know, there are people that are running community farms,

534
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.530
but I mean like backbreaking. Uh, THE agricultural work.

535
00:31:08.819 --> 00:31:11.819
Yeah, it's also interesting that uh many of these

536
00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:14.979
people also assume that uh in the particular case

537
00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:21.260
of prostitution that they always have negative experiences interacting

538
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.920
with their clients and so on, and that's actually

539
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:27.160
not true at all. I mean, maybe some of

540
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.500
them do, but there's many, many sex workers out

541
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.060
there that say that they have very positive experiences

542
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.479
with their clients. That they don't feel they don't

543
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:39.040
feel abused nor anything like that. No,

544
00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:41.160
it's, it's a mixed bag, you know, my, my

545
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.800
mother worked in, uh, in sales her whole life,

546
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.520
you know, so like, you know, the relationship and,

547
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.619
and sex work is a, is a sales job.

548
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.829
So, you know, customers can be annoying, uh, they

549
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:55.920
can be abusive, and they can also be incredible

550
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.040
and friendly. I mean, my mother is still, still

551
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.959
friends with people that she sold furniture to decades

552
00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:03.969
ago. And so, you know, for me, I had

553
00:32:03.969 --> 00:32:07.770
lovely experiences with clients. I had irritating experiences with

554
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.359
clients. I had a couple of like off-putting experiences,

555
00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:14.770
one or two like scary experiences with clients, but

556
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.489
I experienced a lot more sexual violence in my

557
00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:20.849
recreational dating life than I did as a paid

558
00:32:20.849 --> 00:32:21.369
escort.

559
00:32:22.969 --> 00:32:27.089
What about when they say that sex work objectifies

560
00:32:27.089 --> 00:32:28.880
women? What do you think about that?

561
00:32:29.089 --> 00:32:32.469
Uh, SOCIETY objectifies women and sex workers profit from

562
00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:32.910
that.

563
00:32:34.689 --> 00:32:37.290
Well, you know, it's funny because I interviewed Alice

564
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.359
Little and she told me, oh yeah, I am

565
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:44.650
objectified, so what? There's, there, there's positive ways of

566
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.300
being objectified. So that's what she told me. Yeah,

567
00:32:47.489 --> 00:32:50.540
it's, yeah, I mean, it's, it look, again, it,

568
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.969
it I was objectified as a waitress. I was

569
00:32:54.969 --> 00:32:58.729
objectified as a barista. Sex work was the only

570
00:32:58.729 --> 00:33:00.930
job where I got to take some of that

571
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.270
power back and turn that into an advantage.

572
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:09.989
Yeah, should we worry about occupational health and safety

573
00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:10.979
in sex work?

574
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.790
Absolutely, we should, we should worry about occupational safety

575
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.430
and health, um, across the board. I think that

576
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.250
like public health is a is a public concern,

577
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.390
but I don't think that we get there with

578
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.545
mandatory. STI tests or registries. I think we do

579
00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:29.425
that by reducing barriers to access. I think that

580
00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:32.464
STI testing should be free. Um, I think that,

581
00:33:32.545 --> 00:33:34.964
uh, you know, it should be easy to get,

582
00:33:34.974 --> 00:33:38.224
uh, treatment, um, and testing. You should be able

583
00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:40.334
to tell your doctor the truth, whether the work

584
00:33:40.334 --> 00:33:43.900
that you're doing. Is criminalized or not without fear

585
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.650
of repercussion or being outed, but we're really far

586
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.260
away from that future and so like we still

587
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.579
live in a world where where sex work is

588
00:33:52.579 --> 00:33:57.739
criminalized, condoms are used as evidence against people. So

589
00:33:57.939 --> 00:33:59.780
you know I think that we have a shared

590
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.439
interest in encouraging safer sex practices across the board

591
00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:05.959
whether people are being paid for that or not,

592
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.060
but sex workers are definitely um. Even with criminalized

593
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:17.360
condoms, uh, sex workers on average, practice safer sex

594
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.699
than the hookup culture.

595
00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:25.060
You know, all, all the, every time I watch

596
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.820
or listen to a debate between someone who is

597
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.148
against sex work and a sex worker. The debate

598
00:34:33.148 --> 00:34:37.188
always goes the same direction. They always try to

599
00:34:37.188 --> 00:34:41.748
come up with arguments to say or claim that

600
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:45.509
the sex worker must be a flawed woman or

601
00:34:45.509 --> 00:34:49.188
some sort of damaged good, because if, if they're,

602
00:34:49.268 --> 00:34:52.748
if they've not been victims of sexual abuse, they

603
00:34:52.748 --> 00:34:55.553
must have had a bad relationship. With their fathers,

604
00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:58.593
if not that they must do alcohol or drugs,

605
00:34:58.634 --> 00:35:01.474
if not that they're probably addicted to sex, if

606
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:04.073
not that they don't just don't care about the

607
00:35:04.073 --> 00:35:06.793
consequences and so on and so forth. I mean,

608
00:35:07.073 --> 00:35:08.384
what do you think about that?

609
00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:12.694
I mean, I think that the, the messier reality

610
00:35:12.694 --> 00:35:18.989
that this sort of perpetual myth. Tries to kind

611
00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:25.399
of paper over is that sexual violence is ubiquitous.

612
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:31.939
Most people have experienced some form of sexual violence,

613
00:35:31.949 --> 00:35:35.879
and that's as true of nursing and teaching and

614
00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:39.620
comedy and accounting and lawyers as it is in

615
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.580
sex work. So you meet a lot of sex

616
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.239
workers who have experienced sexual violence, but again. That

617
00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:52.239
is not overrepresented. And so sex workers, sort of

618
00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:57.520
very similar to the like formal BDSM community have

619
00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.520
language around consent, negotiated consent, ongoing consent that is

620
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.469
sort of wholesale missing from most like vanilla or

621
00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:14.189
mainstream sexual discourse, and so. You know, a lot

622
00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:17.870
of sex workers talk about taking the power back,

623
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:22.530
right? They talk about how sex work allows them

624
00:36:22.709 --> 00:36:27.209
a container for, uh, you know, their erotic energy

625
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:32.719
that feels safe and controlled and negotiated. Um, BECAUSE

626
00:36:32.729 --> 00:36:36.590
the consequences of that energy in the world are

627
00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:40.250
pretty violent. And so, you know, I'm not saying

628
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.810
that sexual violence isn't a problem, but prostitution and

629
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.050
pornography do not cause rape.

630
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.060
Yeah, but then there's also those sorts of claims

631
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.260
that conservative people make that, oh, pornography and sex

632
00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:03.239
work cause sexual violence. Sex work impacts birth rates,

633
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.179
it negatively affects relationships. Sex work leads to social

634
00:37:08.179 --> 00:37:10.899
decadence, porn addiction, I mean,

635
00:37:11.659 --> 00:37:15.850
yeah, sure, I mean. I, I, I think that

636
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:21.939
argument would. Feel more persuasive to me if I

637
00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:25.699
didn't know so many people who had never sold

638
00:37:25.699 --> 00:37:30.389
sexual services that were victims of sexual violence or

639
00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:33.929
and or sexual dysfunction, uh, who were deeply unhappy

640
00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:37.699
in their relationship. Like, you know, sex workers are

641
00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:42.020
not, uh, are not the only people or especially

642
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.419
women who are like suffering in this culture. It's

643
00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:47.949
not a causal relationship.

644
00:37:49.139 --> 00:37:54.739
Uh, I mean, the supposed relationship between pornography, for

645
00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:57.989
example, and sexual violence, if anything, it would be

646
00:37:57.989 --> 00:38:01.030
the other way around because it's like sexual violence

647
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.270
goes this way and porn conception goes the other

648
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:09.750
way over time. So if anything, watching more pornography

649
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.610
reduces the sexual,

650
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:13.989
and there's a lot of evidence to, to support

651
00:38:13.989 --> 00:38:15.750
that and like there's also a lot of evidence.

652
00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:20.822
To suggest that the availability of uh of sex

653
00:38:20.822 --> 00:38:23.103
work or the like sort of easy making it

654
00:38:23.103 --> 00:38:27.822
easier for people to do sex work reduces reduces

655
00:38:27.822 --> 00:38:32.782
violence against women where Craigslist erotic services was available,

656
00:38:32.992 --> 00:38:37.623
the female homicide rate dropped on average 17%. When

657
00:38:37.623 --> 00:38:42.583
Rhode Island decriminalized indoor prostitution, reported rapes dropped 30%.

658
00:38:43.016 --> 00:38:46.335
You see very similar numbers in places where, you

659
00:38:46.335 --> 00:38:49.315
know, like online sex work becomes suddenly more available

660
00:38:49.315 --> 00:38:52.555
or where like brothels become legal. There's actually an

661
00:38:52.555 --> 00:38:56.696
inverse relationship between like the more sex work, the

662
00:38:56.696 --> 00:38:59.885
more open and available and easier sex work is,

663
00:39:00.095 --> 00:39:03.615
the less sexual violence there is. Now, there's a

664
00:39:03.615 --> 00:39:06.575
couple of like causal relationships around that. I don't

665
00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:09.939
like the argument that sex workers like absorb. The

666
00:39:09.939 --> 00:39:12.610
sexual violence, right, like of men in our society,

667
00:39:12.669 --> 00:39:14.540
I think it's a lot more complicated than that.

668
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.629
I think in part, like specifically the female homicide

669
00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:21.229
rate with like Craigslist erotic services is that Craigslist

670
00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:26.790
erotic services allowed women that would otherwise never consider

671
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.550
prostitution. To do prostitution in kind of a secret

672
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.209
way, like you could post an ad, it's free,

673
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.719
no one would know, meet somebody at a hotel

674
00:39:36.719 --> 00:39:39.550
room. So this allowed people to get out of

675
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:45.229
acute abusive relationships. Before they were killed, like, so

676
00:39:45.229 --> 00:39:49.530
sex work creates sort of an escape hatch for

677
00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:53.750
violent relationships. Women have been using sex work to

678
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.510
get the money they need to flee for literally

679
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.310
all of human history. Before we had domestic violence

680
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:04.590
shelters, brothels often served that function in a society.

681
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.189
It was a place that desperate women could run

682
00:40:07.189 --> 00:40:07.500
to.

683
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.770
You know, one of the funniest accusations I've ever

684
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:18.169
heard directed at sex work was a conservative religious

685
00:40:18.169 --> 00:40:21.870
guy from Brazil having a debate with the Brazilian,

686
00:40:22.229 --> 00:40:25.969
uh, OnlyFans content creator, and at a certain point

687
00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:30.449
he said that sex work causes the collapse of.

688
00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:34.676
Civilizations and I'm like, oh, OK, fine. So I

689
00:40:34.676 --> 00:40:36.716
read, I read Jared Diamond's work and the work

690
00:40:36.716 --> 00:40:39.156
of other people who studied the collapse of civilizations.

691
00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:44.436
They talk about political corruption, economic inequality, overexploitation of

692
00:40:44.436 --> 00:40:50.476
resources, uh, I mean natural disasters. Where's the sex

693
00:40:50.476 --> 00:40:51.216
work? Sure,

694
00:40:51.756 --> 00:40:55.771
I mean. What sex work does or like the

695
00:40:55.771 --> 00:40:59.062
acceptance of like prostitution and promiscuity does is it

696
00:40:59.062 --> 00:41:01.822
does cause the collapse of patriarchy. And if you

697
00:41:01.822 --> 00:41:05.582
think patriarchy is civilization, then fine, yeah, it's hard

698
00:41:05.582 --> 00:41:07.142
to have a patriarchy if you don't know who

699
00:41:07.142 --> 00:41:10.142
the dads are heard, but I just don't think

700
00:41:10.142 --> 00:41:14.191
that that's that important to a functioning, functioning civilization.

701
00:41:14.701 --> 00:41:19.149
No, me neither. So let's get into uh. OK,

702
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:23.310
so how should we approach sex work legally and

703
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:29.649
politically? I mean, because there's full criminalization, partial criminalization,

704
00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:33.949
the Nordic model, legalization and the criminalization. I mean,

705
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.830
what's the best

706
00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.129
approach? I mean, sex workers all over the world

707
00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:39.895
have been asking for the same thing. For generations,

708
00:41:39.986 --> 00:41:42.466
which makes it, which makes it easy. We all

709
00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:46.045
want decriminalization. We want to make it so that

710
00:41:46.226 --> 00:41:49.785
people that do this work are not arrested, evicted,

711
00:41:49.986 --> 00:41:53.666
fired, or lose custody of their children just for

712
00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:58.946
engaging in this work because buying, selling, and facility.

713
00:41:59.062 --> 00:42:01.902
Facilitating sexual services is not a crime. That's what

714
00:42:01.902 --> 00:42:06.902
decriminalizing sex work means. Now, legalization or regulation, which

715
00:42:06.902 --> 00:42:09.181
forces sex workers into brothels, this is what you

716
00:42:09.181 --> 00:42:13.011
see in Nevada and Germany and Amsterdam, is a

717
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:15.461
legal model that does not increase the negotiating power

718
00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:17.461
of sex workers. It's a model that really only

719
00:42:17.461 --> 00:42:22.409
benefits brothel owners. The criminalization of clients or, you

720
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:25.649
know, third party folks like landlords or managers or

721
00:42:25.649 --> 00:42:27.850
pimps, this is the model that you see in

722
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.840
Sweden and Norway. Everywhere that this policy has been

723
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.689
implemented, violence against sex workers goes up. And so

724
00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:38.290
because we know what prohibition does to markets, we

725
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.669
know that you cannot criminalize half a transaction without

726
00:42:41.669 --> 00:42:44.889
pushing it further underground. And when you specifically criminalize

727
00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:49.550
clients, you, you undermine all of the safety strategies

728
00:42:49.689 --> 00:42:53.689
that sex workers use to keep ourselves safe. So

729
00:42:53.689 --> 00:42:57.129
that's the argument against the sort of end demand

730
00:42:57.129 --> 00:42:59.030
approach that we have in the Nordic countries,

731
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.863
yes. Yes, and this is, yeah, this is, um,

732
00:43:02.002 --> 00:43:04.683
it's unfortunately a policy that goes by many names,

733
00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:07.883
uh, because when people understand what it is, they

734
00:43:07.883 --> 00:43:09.903
see how dumb it is, so they just keep

735
00:43:10.363 --> 00:43:12.443
changing the name. So it used to be called

736
00:43:12.443 --> 00:43:15.643
the feminist model or the equality model or the

737
00:43:15.643 --> 00:43:18.643
Nordic model or the Swedish model or the end

738
00:43:18.643 --> 00:43:21.782
demand model or the John Law model or the

739
00:43:21.962 --> 00:43:26.482
client criminalization model. Um, MOST recently I've heard partial

740
00:43:26.482 --> 00:43:30.726
decriminalization, which is an infuriating. Framing of of this

741
00:43:30.726 --> 00:43:30.916
law,

742
00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.716
what does that mean exactly? I mean, what does

743
00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:35.075
the argument in practice?

744
00:43:35.436 --> 00:43:39.055
Yeah, so the argument that the prohibitionists are trying

745
00:43:39.055 --> 00:43:44.236
to make is that it's partial decriminalization because you're

746
00:43:44.236 --> 00:43:49.436
decriminalizing the seller, right, the sex worker, uh, while

747
00:43:49.436 --> 00:43:54.236
criminalizing who they construe as the perpetrator, right, the

748
00:43:54.236 --> 00:43:57.595
buyer, the pimps and johns. But of course in

749
00:43:57.595 --> 00:44:03.010
practice. The, the, you know, sex worker faces a

750
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:07.689
lot of legal consequences, including eviction, uh, because renting

751
00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:09.889
to a known sex worker becomes a crime under

752
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:12.290
this law. So, you know, when you're trying to

753
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.570
take someone's livelihood away, that's not often construed as

754
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:22.594
like helpful, so. Yeah, this is not a model

755
00:44:22.854 --> 00:44:26.415
that sex workers want. It's not a model that

756
00:44:26.415 --> 00:44:29.695
reduces violence, and it's not even a model that

757
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:34.094
reduces the amount of prostitution if that was a

758
00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:36.175
goal, which I don't, I, I don't, I don't

759
00:44:36.175 --> 00:44:38.135
think that's a good goal, but if that was

760
00:44:38.135 --> 00:44:40.254
your goal, this policy doesn't achieve it.

761
00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:45.679
Mhm. Um, AND I mean, what kinds of, er,

762
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:50.000
legal protections, if any, do you think sex workers

763
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.840
should have?

764
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.030
I mean, I think that sex workers should have

765
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.209
the same legal protections as anyone. I think we

766
00:44:57.459 --> 00:44:59.830
should be able to report crimes committed against us.

767
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.989
I think that we should have access to like

768
00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:05.229
banking and technology platforms that we all need to

769
00:45:05.229 --> 00:45:07.729
move our lives forward. I think that we should,

770
00:45:08.149 --> 00:45:11.889
uh, you know, have access to support and services,

771
00:45:12.149 --> 00:45:14.435
um, and like I said earlier. I think that

772
00:45:14.435 --> 00:45:16.455
we should be able to tell like our doctor

773
00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:18.665
and social worker and the people in our lives,

774
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:22.635
uh, the truth about our work without fear of

775
00:45:22.635 --> 00:45:26.735
arrest or, uh, losing our, you know, bank account,

776
00:45:26.905 --> 00:45:30.705
social media, uh, like access to the internet, um,

777
00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:33.094
and so those are the rights. I don't think

778
00:45:33.514 --> 00:45:39.199
that sex workers are served. By, uh, putting ourselves

779
00:45:39.199 --> 00:45:46.010
on a stigmatized list, so registration, licensing, mandatory brothels,

780
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.179
or legal schemes that sort of like try to

781
00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.969
separate out sex workers from the rest of the

782
00:45:51.969 --> 00:45:54.590
population, I think is a a a primrose path

783
00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:57.280
uh to know we're good. If we lived in

784
00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.449
a less whorephobic society. I maybe we could talk

785
00:46:01.449 --> 00:46:04.280
about that, but we, but we don't. So, um,

786
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.449
yeah, I think it's really, really important not to

787
00:46:07.449 --> 00:46:12.770
pursue laws that end up, uh, forcing sex workers

788
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.129
onto stigmatized lists.

789
00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:17.290
Oh OK, so I have this question, I've been

790
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.330
talking with several sex workers, but this is still

791
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.489
not completely clear to me. So when it comes

792
00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:26.949
to how we should deal with people who facilitate

793
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.929
er sex work or the selling of sex like

794
00:46:30.929 --> 00:46:34.354
owners of. Brothels and pimps and so on, I

795
00:46:34.354 --> 00:46:38.165
mean, which are the ones that perhaps we should,

796
00:46:38.334 --> 00:46:40.614
or, or do you think that some of them

797
00:46:40.915 --> 00:46:44.955
should be criminalized, like for example, uh, people, pimps

798
00:46:44.955 --> 00:46:48.094
who force women into sex work in some way.

799
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.889
Yeah, I mean people that commit violent crimes should

800
00:46:50.889 --> 00:46:53.889
be prosecuted for those violent crimes. But like, you

801
00:46:53.889 --> 00:46:57.219
know, I've, I've worked as a waitress and I've

802
00:46:57.219 --> 00:47:01.010
worked as an actress and so like managers exist

803
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.090
in both of those professions and they're, they're great

804
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:08.070
managers and they're shitty managers, but those jobs are,

805
00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:10.229
are, you know, are necessary. They serve a purpose,

806
00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:14.085
right? Like. You know, and it's very similar in

807
00:47:14.085 --> 00:47:18.285
sex work, right? So like, you know, uh, managers

808
00:47:18.285 --> 00:47:21.395
or like third party facilitators, whether they're like brothel

809
00:47:21.395 --> 00:47:23.045
owners or people on the other end of a

810
00:47:23.045 --> 00:47:24.805
phone line or like you can use the word

811
00:47:24.805 --> 00:47:27.565
pimp, but it's like somebody who's facilitating, right? Somebody

812
00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:31.325
who is like doing the work of advertising that

813
00:47:31.325 --> 00:47:36.122
sexual services are available, doing. The like scheduling or

814
00:47:36.122 --> 00:47:38.622
like the screening if that's a part of it,

815
00:47:38.842 --> 00:47:41.681
um, that's real labor and so if you're able

816
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:44.102
to just like show up to a hotel room

817
00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:47.562
and pay somebody either a percentage of like what

818
00:47:47.562 --> 00:47:49.902
you earn or like a flat fee or how

819
00:47:49.902 --> 00:47:53.201
there's nothing inherently wrong or exploitative about that. There's

820
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:56.241
definitely something wrong with getting pistol whipped over anything

821
00:47:56.241 --> 00:48:00.399
so like. You know, if my restaurant manager took

822
00:48:00.399 --> 00:48:04.110
me out back and beat me for any reason,

823
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.520
they should be arrested for that's a crime, but

824
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.159
it's not because they're a restaurant manager, it's because

825
00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:14.520
they hit me. So we should be able to

826
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.199
hold people accountable, but we can't do that if

827
00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:22.320
we conflate. Their job with violence because that allows

828
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.489
us to ignore the violence. So coercion is a

829
00:48:27.489 --> 00:48:31.090
crime. Exploitation should be a crime. It isn't, but

830
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.070
it should be, you know, lying to people or

831
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:41.520
tricking them. You know that that's a crime. DRUGGING

832
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.689
people is a crime. Kidnapping people is a crime.

833
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:51.209
When buying, selling, and facilitating adult consensual sex workers

834
00:48:51.209 --> 00:48:54.949
is not a crime, you can hold people accountable

835
00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:58.270
for the crimes that they commit. Does it make

836
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.689
sense? Yeah,

837
00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.790
mhm, yes, no, it makes perfect sense. What do

838
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:05.989
you think are perhaps some of the uh resources

839
00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:09.330
that should be available and of course again, uh

840
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.909
we can't make this into something that is exclusive

841
00:49:12.909 --> 00:49:15.629
to sex work. It should be also occur in

842
00:49:15.629 --> 00:49:17.669
other kinds of occupations, but what do you think

843
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:20.719
are the resources that should. BE available to sex

844
00:49:20.719 --> 00:49:24.959
workers who do not really want to be sex

845
00:49:24.959 --> 00:49:27.320
workers and would like to have the opportunity to

846
00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.649
live that occupation.

847
00:49:29.959 --> 00:49:31.959
Sure, I mean, I think the same thing that

848
00:49:31.959 --> 00:49:35.179
should be available to people that clean houses or

849
00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:37.840
work in mines that also want to, want to

850
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.600
get out, so. Oh, I think that we should

851
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.590
have universal health care, housing, and childcare. I think

852
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.459
that we should create a floor right beneath which,

853
00:49:47.479 --> 00:49:50.570
uh, nobody falls so that nobody is forced into,

854
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.879
um, into labor that is like absolutely soul sucking

855
00:49:53.879 --> 00:49:56.820
for them. Um, I think that. Yeah, and that's

856
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.989
why like universal healthcare and universal childcare and like

857
00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:05.419
housing is an anti-trafficking policy, right? Because it, it

858
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:08.659
increases the negotiating power of workers, right? It reduces

859
00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:12.379
our desperation and desperate people do desperate things, um.

860
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.939
I think that, uh, you know, being able to

861
00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:20.219
meet and connect with other people that do this

862
00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:23.139
work and have left, um, it's so important for

863
00:50:23.139 --> 00:50:25.100
sex workers to be able to share information with

864
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.610
each other, right? This is how we share, uh,

865
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.320
bad, bad date lists. This is how we share

866
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.860
tips and tricks to keep each other safe, but

867
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.159
it's also how we share information about, um, employers

868
00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:42.919
that. That are friendly to hiring sex workers, um,

869
00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:46.699
how we share, like, you know, connections for, um,

870
00:50:46.729 --> 00:50:50.129
other opportunities or like how to pivot, uh, you

871
00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:52.209
know, the skills that you developed as a, as

872
00:50:52.209 --> 00:50:57.330
an OnlyFans model into, you know, a vanilla branding

873
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:01.229
and marketing job. Like there, there are those opportunities,

874
00:51:01.239 --> 00:51:03.209
but only if sex workers are able to like

875
00:51:03.209 --> 00:51:06.050
openly communicate with each other.

876
00:51:07.709 --> 00:51:10.229
So, and again, uh, this will be my last

877
00:51:10.229 --> 00:51:12.989
question, but again, as we've already talked about before,

878
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.709
this is not exclusive to sex work. There are

879
00:51:15.709 --> 00:51:18.270
other kinds of trafficking out there in many other

880
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:23.310
areas, but are there any other specific measures that

881
00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:26.189
should be in place to try to fight back

882
00:51:26.189 --> 00:51:27.590
against sex trafficking?

883
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:36.030
I think I long for a future. Where survivors

884
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:40.600
of all kinds, but specifically survivors and victims of

885
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.879
sexual violence, can and do report crimes committed against

886
00:51:45.879 --> 00:51:48.719
them because they're believed and supported. And I think

887
00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:50.719
that that should be true for people that are

888
00:51:50.719 --> 00:51:55.510
reporting sex crimes, whether they were paid or not.

889
00:51:55.639 --> 00:51:58.760
Like, I don't think it matters if money was

890
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.040
exchanged. I think that we have a lot of

891
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:06.399
work to do as a society to help support.

892
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:11.870
OF sexual violence, and that is where our focus

893
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.979
ought to be, making it easier and more comfortable

894
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:20.510
for victims to come forward and helping to shape

895
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:24.790
what justice and support looks like for them.

896
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.280
Yeah, and that would be for both men and

897
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.830
women, right? And also because I, I think it's

898
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:34.959
also very important to uh keep in mind that

899
00:52:34.959 --> 00:52:38.030
when we talk about sex workers, we are, uh,

900
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.280
usually focusing on women, but there's there's also male

901
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:42.919
sex workers.

902
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.459
People of all genders have always done this work

903
00:52:45.719 --> 00:52:50.840
and also the conversation around it has become very

904
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.679
gendered, but yeah, you're absolutely right.

905
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.669
Mhm. OK, so Caitlin, I'm seeing that we're running

906
00:52:56.669 --> 00:52:59.229
out of time here. So where can people find

907
00:52:59.229 --> 00:53:00.290
you on the internet?

908
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.189
So, uh, you can follow Old Pros, um, online

909
00:53:04.189 --> 00:53:07.629
at Oros, uh, online. Um, WE send out a

910
00:53:07.629 --> 00:53:10.310
weekly newsletter. It's a roundup of sex worker rights

911
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.949
related news. I also host the oldest profession podcast

912
00:53:13.949 --> 00:53:16.510
where every episode I do a deep dive into

913
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.100
a different sex worker from history. And I am

914
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.739
currently touring my show, also called The Oldest Profession,

915
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.379
where I cover 10,000 years of history from a

916
00:53:26.379 --> 00:53:28.580
sex worker's perspective, and you can find all of

917
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.639
my upcoming dates at the oldestprofession.org.

918
00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:35.389
You should also write a book about it, by

919
00:53:35.389 --> 00:53:37.729
the way. Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

920
00:53:38.129 --> 00:53:40.270
OK, so look, thank you so much. It's been

921
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:41.189
lovely to talk to you,

922
00:53:41.709 --> 00:53:43.709
