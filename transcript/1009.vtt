00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.480
the Center. I'm your host, as always Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.510
And today I'm joined by Doctor Yaroslava Valent Tova.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.090
She's a professor, doctor at the Department of Experimental

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.029
Psychology in the Institute of Psychology at the University

6
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.299
of Sao Paulo. She has research experience in evolutionary

7
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:23.389
psychology and through apology and human ethology. And today

8
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.989
we're talking about sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity,

9
00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:34.069
facial, sexually dimorphic traits, and the announcement of physical

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.459
attractiveness all from an evolutionary perspective. So, Doctor Valent

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.520
Tova, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

12
00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.950
everyone.

13
00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.200
It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

14
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:48.380
So let's start then with the sexual orientation. And

15
00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:50.830
I know that uh I mean, some of the

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.779
questions associated with this from an evolutionary perspective are

17
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.259
a bit tricky to approach and we're going to

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.490
get into that. But just generally speaking, uh what

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.160
different kinds of sexual orientations do you distinguish between

20
00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:08.360
from an evolutionary perspective?

21
00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:15.790
Yeah. So sexual orientation looks very simple, right? It's,

22
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.610
it's something very simple. Everybody kind of knows and

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.180
feels what's uh their sexual orientation, but it's not

24
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.510
that easy as, as you said. So we will

25
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.760
get into that. But yeah, so there are several

26
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:31.699
types of sexual orientation. And if we, if we

27
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.919
define sexual orientation as an attraction, sexual or romantic

28
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.639
attraction to individuals of the same uh sex or

29
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.389
the other sex or both sexes, then we would

30
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.790
probably distinguish the basic types, right? Like people who

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.050
are same sex oriented, other sex oriented or, or

32
00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:55.599
both sex oriented. And from the evolutionary perspective, it

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.000
actually makes sense because uh when we observe, for

34
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.269
example, an animal and such as uh a Capucci

35
00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.699
monkey, for example, that are very common over here

36
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.630
in Brazil, we have them on the campus over

37
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.580
here, so we can observe their sexual behavior. And

38
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.639
uh we can see if actually female is mating

39
00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.460
with a female or female, is mating with a

40
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.460
male or uh she's mating with both uh at

41
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.809
some time of, of her life, for example. So

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.979
we might categorize them, right? As animals who are,

43
00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.679
who, who prefer uh same sex sexuality or, or

44
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.119
other sex sexuality or they prefer both sexes or

45
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.559
they don't distinguish, actually, they don't have really a

46
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.559
clear preference. So in human animals, it's actually quite

47
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.559
uh quite similar. So we can distinguish them uh

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.979
if people prefer mating with individuals of the same

49
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.500
sex or, or the other sex, usually we describe

50
00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.550
them as homosexual or heterosexual. We can also uh

51
00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.779
from the evolutionary perspective, we actually do this uh

52
00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.300
distinction because we want to see if uh individuals

53
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:12.100
mate with reproductively uh adequate individuals, which means if

54
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.570
they can reproduce or cannot reproduce. Right. So, of

55
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.660
course, if there are two sexes, it is possible

56
00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.240
to uh reproduce to have offspring. Not always, of

57
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.339
course. Right? Most of sexual activities, even heterosexual activities,

58
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.589
they are non reproductive, which is actually very important.

59
00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.610
But uh basic, the basic distinct uh distinction is

60
00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.949
probably this one, but of course, there are many

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.990
others, right? How can we, for example, distinguish bisexual

62
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.929
individuals? So these individuals are people who have the

63
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.350
same degree of attraction uh toward both sexes or

64
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.639
who are these individuals? Because a person can have

65
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:58.369
uh quite uh predominant attraction to women, for example,

66
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.029
but a little bit of attraction to men. So,

67
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:06.949
is this person right? Predominantly uh Gyno Philly, which

68
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.289
means preferring women as sexual partners or uh is

69
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.649
it a bisexual individual who actually has different degrees

70
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.940
of attraction to both sexes? And of course, there

71
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.899
is uh there are people who uh focus more

72
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.519
on gender identity than, than sex, biological sex. So

73
00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.470
people can be actually attracted to individuals who identify

74
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.010
as men, women or any other gender identity like

75
00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:40.440
gender fluid people or non, non binary individuals or

76
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.359
uh or others. So, uh there are many possible

77
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.730
distinctions and of course, it also depends what we

78
00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:50.720
are asking actually, right, what we are measuring in

79
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.660
sexual orientation because so far it looks quite easy.

80
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.640
Oh, I'm heterosexual. I'm bisexual, but actually maybe I'm

81
00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.160
a little bit of both and how can I

82
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.100
say that? So usually we actually uh we use

83
00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:06.250
a scale, right? We don't OK. OK. In some

84
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.910
research, we use actually, how do you identify ourselves?

85
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.470
So we are asking actually about their um identity

86
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.000
of sexual orientation. So people can use their known

87
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.609
labels in the given culture or uh given period

88
00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.350
of time. So nowadays, for example, in western societies,

89
00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:28.440
people may say that they are heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual

90
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.929
pansexual, right? Who have all these like attractions to

91
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.940
anything possible or or possible gender constellations or they

92
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.809
can be asexuals, for example, right? Which also is

93
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.299
probably a sexual orientation, although it's on zero levels

94
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.130
of sexual attraction, which means that asexuals wouldn't feel

95
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.790
any sexual attraction to anyone. And this is also

96
00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:57.630
very interesting from the evolutionary point of view because

97
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.579
these individuals probably won't uh reproduce at all. And

98
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:08.559
um yeah, so mostly we ask about sexual orientation

99
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.609
on a scale, right? So imagine a scale from

100
00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:17.799
zero which is exclusively totally heterosexual to uh to

101
00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.859
six, which would be completely totally exclusively homosexual. But

102
00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:27.029
there are some degrees between these two extreme points

103
00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:28.390
and it's by the,

104
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.769
by the way, sorry to interrupt you, would this

105
00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:32.510
be the Kinsey scale?

106
00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:35.839
Yeah, this would be actually the Kinsey scale that

107
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.720
we use already from the forties, right? So it's

108
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.570
been some time by now. Of course, there are

109
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:45.070
many variations of this scale. So we can ask

110
00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:48.019
about how is your uh orientation? So you can

111
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:52.119
say that you are either exclusively homosexual or heterosexual.

112
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.119
But in many cases, we don't even use these

113
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.450
labels because people actually do not want to label

114
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.459
themselves. So we ask on a scale on a

115
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.100
seven point scale, what is your attraction toward women?

116
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.709
None at all or extreme, for example. So we

117
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.230
can adjust these scales and we can ask the

118
00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.299
same person about their attraction to men and women

119
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.309
separately. So we can see actually what is the

120
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.190
degree of both attractions, which, which is very interesting

121
00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:25.429
and it seems that these uh scales actually they

122
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.809
make sense for people. And also also for scientists

123
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.000
because for example, if you are a zero, which

124
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.690
means like completely exclusively heterosexual, you might have different

125
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.829
kinds of uh behaviors or uh psychological traits, then

126
00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:47.404
person who labels themselves as as one, for example,

127
00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:51.045
who would be predominantly heterosexual but has a little

128
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:55.345
bit of homosexual tendencies or feelings. So these people

129
00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:59.084
may have different sexual strategies and different sexual behaviors

130
00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:03.345
and even they might be actually more different than

131
00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:06.579
the rest of the scale. So it is actually

132
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:10.829
important to see small, more sensitive differences between these

133
00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.510
people. And of course, I told you that uh

134
00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:16.519
we can adjust these scales. It depends on, on

135
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.910
the aim of the research, right? What we are

136
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.920
actually asking about sometimes we can ask about behavior

137
00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:26.119
of the person. So sexual orientation of course, has

138
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.190
lots of dimensions, right? And it depends on, on

139
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.510
the end aim of specific research, what we are

140
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.719
asking about. So for example, if I want to

141
00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:38.369
know only about uh the person's sexual behavior so

142
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.340
far, I would ask what kind of partners sexual

143
00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:45.640
partners they had so far, right? So males, females,

144
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.619
both or other genders, for example, but of course,

145
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.989
uh this doesn't tell me much about their desires

146
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.669
and tendencies and preferences because our behavior can be

147
00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:02.469
different from our preferences. We can do sexual behavior

148
00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:05.820
for many reasons that are not really our preferences.

149
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.010
I can prefer uh females as a sexual partners.

150
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.419
But for many reasons, for example, religious regions or

151
00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:16.219
reasons I can do or for money, for example,

152
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:19.789
I can do sex only uh with males, right?

153
00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:23.559
So actually our preferences and and sexual behavior is

154
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.080
quite different. And so, and this complicates also the

155
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.179
definition of sexual orientation. So, what are we actually,

156
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.299
how are we oriented to other people? Are we

157
00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:40.890
oriented uh behaviorally or preferentially? Is it our desire?

158
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.349
What are we fantasizing about in our sexual fantasies?

159
00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:46.609
What are our desires and what is in the

160
00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:50.690
end our behavior? Right. So these are different. Also,

161
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.530
one more type would be probably asking about preferences

162
00:09:55.539 --> 00:10:01.190
for short short term sexual encounters and long term

163
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.409
romantic attractions. And many bisexual people, for example, they

164
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:11.590
are bisexual in a short term way. So they

165
00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:16.270
can imagine or they have short term sexual relationships

166
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.599
with people of both sexes or different genders, but

167
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:23.640
they actually form long term relationships with only one

168
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.450
of those categories of people. So romantic attraction is

169
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.489
also a little bit different than sexual attraction, right?

170
00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:36.619
And yeah, and so from from the evolutionary perspective,

171
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.979
I don't know, I I think I said, oh,

172
00:10:37.989 --> 00:10:41.030
there is also demisexuality, right? Of course, that there

173
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:44.679
are so many labels in so many categories. So

174
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.580
we can actually choose right, demisexuality of people who

175
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.619
actually need uh romantic bonding before they are able

176
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.539
to have sexual encounters, which is also interesting. And

177
00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:02.549
um and talking speaking about measures, actually, I was

178
00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:06.780
talking about self reports, right? Usually we use self

179
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.419
reports, of course, it's easier we can ask people

180
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.150
and we can ask people online, for example, in

181
00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:19.789
an anonymous questionnaire, it's fast and um we can

182
00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:23.679
collect lots of data in different countries, different cultures.

183
00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:27.109
But there are other measure measures such as physiological

184
00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:32.789
measures, for example. Uh SO for example, people can

185
00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:37.799
use measures such as eye tracking, right to see

186
00:11:37.809 --> 00:11:42.010
where our eyes actually are looking at. And we

187
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.340
can present different kinds of stimuli like uh naked

188
00:11:45.349 --> 00:11:49.640
men or naked women or or other gender identities.

189
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.950
And we can see the possible differences between self

190
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.900
report and where the eyes are actually looking, right?

191
00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:59.900
Because sometimes we think something we we we self

192
00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:03.690
report one thing but our body uh plays a

193
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.890
different game. So we can see that people uh

194
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.799
that people can be actually looking a little bit

195
00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:13.340
differently. For example, heterosexual men, women or women who

196
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.200
identify as heterosexual, they have this tendency to look

197
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.820
at both uh men and women uh or male

198
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.969
and female stimuli at the same time on the

199
00:12:23.979 --> 00:12:27.565
same level, basically. So their eyes, they more, more

200
00:12:27.575 --> 00:12:33.544
bisexual than their minds. And so it would be

201
00:12:33.554 --> 00:12:36.284
the same, for example, with uh with genital arousal,

202
00:12:36.294 --> 00:12:40.205
there are uh interesting studies on genital arousal also

203
00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:43.815
showing different kinds of stimuli to people and measuring

204
00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:48.455
their uh their genital arousal. So uh there are

205
00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:52.989
quite interesting patterns in men who are more aligned

206
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.869
with their self reports, their penises are more aligned

207
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.830
with their self report. So they actually they are

208
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.780
aroused by what they really think they are aroused

209
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.400
while women, women have more bisexual pattern again. So

210
00:13:07.409 --> 00:13:10.130
this is also interesting and these are different dimensions

211
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.609
of of sexual orientation. None of them is more

212
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.580
important than the other, right? Behavior is very important.

213
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.409
Feelings are important. Romantic attraction is important, sexual arousal

214
00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:25.239
as well or other physiological measures. So, ideally, we

215
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.200
should be measuring all of those but sometimes this

216
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.979
is impossible, right? Also in in the research of

217
00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:34.159
uh of other animal species, we can't really ask

218
00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:37.219
them, right? How do you feel? What is your

219
00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:41.210
sexual attraction? We can observe more their their behavior

220
00:13:41.469 --> 00:13:45.099
or do some experiments to see their, their preferences

221
00:13:45.109 --> 00:13:48.750
if they are, uh if they have the possibility

222
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.969
to mate with both sexes, for example, we can

223
00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:55.109
see uh what they would prefer, but this is

224
00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:58.229
more about behavior, right? We don't really know their,

225
00:13:58.239 --> 00:14:01.590
their preferences or, or other attractions,

226
00:14:02.229 --> 00:14:07.549
right. So, of course, there's all that complexity surrounding

227
00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:11.770
sexual orientation and even more specifically in humans because

228
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.340
I guess that we could also talk here about

229
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.260
a, as you mentioned, there are some uh cultural

230
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.849
context, cultural inputs and all of that and perhaps

231
00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:25.739
context as well. But uh I mean, from if

232
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:32.880
we try to tackle something like homosexuality from exclusively

233
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.400
an evolutionary perspective, uh what are perhaps some of

234
00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:41.390
the hypothesis out there to explain it? Because I

235
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.369
guess that uh if we do it exclusively from

236
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.179
an evolutionary perspective, the biggest conundrum here has to

237
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.635
do with how we would ex explain that a

238
00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:57.315
trait like that, that would uh lead or we

239
00:14:57.325 --> 00:15:00.674
should or we would expect it to lead to

240
00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:07.075
uh zero fitness uh would have evolved, right?

241
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.940
Yeah, it's a puzzle, right? But actually, I have

242
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.619
actually always been puzzled why people are so obsessed

243
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.429
uh especially within evolutionary sciences with homosexuality because really

244
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.669
most sexual behavior doesn't lead to reproduction. Thank God

245
00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:36.510
or, or evolution or whatever. That's a and not

246
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.780
only in humans, right? Of course, in nonhuman species

247
00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:42.380
as well, we have just published a paper about

248
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.159
uh same sex sexuality in capuchin monkeys. And actually,

249
00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:50.849
we are showing that uh that in many species,

250
00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:55.284
including humans, sexuality is mostly non reproductive. That doesn't,

251
00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:59.195
this doesn't mean that reproduction is not uh beyond

252
00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:02.655
all the sexual behavior, right? Of course, the the

253
00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:06.695
ultimate distal uh explanation of sexual behavior is a

254
00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:11.744
reproduction definitely. But reproduction also uh sexual behavior, it

255
00:16:11.755 --> 00:16:16.474
also has other functions, not only reproduction, right? So

256
00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:22.669
actually, one of the uh plausible evolutionary social e

257
00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:28.580
evolutionary explanations about homosexuality is this actually same sex

258
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:34.419
behavior can increase bonding and cooper operation among among

259
00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:38.809
individuals. Uh It has actually the same functions as

260
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.500
a heterosexual sex has of course, sometimes heterosexual sex

261
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:48.559
leads to reproduction. But so only sometimes and mostly

262
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.659
it has other functions such as pair bonding and

263
00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:56.109
uh lowering aggression uh between the individuals, increasing cooper

264
00:16:56.119 --> 00:17:01.380
operation and uh and um relationship quality, which can

265
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.839
be important for a couple, a specific couple, but

266
00:17:04.848 --> 00:17:09.579
also for uh intra group dynamics, right? So actually,

267
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.680
if people are able to uh to have intimate

268
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:17.020
bonds with other people, they probably stick more together,

269
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.579
right? And this is actually very important uh for

270
00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.098
social living animal such as uh such as humans

271
00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:26.930
and uh and many other uh primates who live

272
00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:31.160
together and need to defend themselves uh from other

273
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.270
animals or or other individuals of the same species.

274
00:17:34.329 --> 00:17:37.939
So actually, um this is part of the explanation,

275
00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:43.310
of course, this explanation um focuses more on sexual

276
00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:48.189
behavior, not really preferences or attractions. Right. But if

277
00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:50.170
uh if a person is able to bond or

278
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.729
have sexual relationships uh with individuals, ideally of both

279
00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:58.530
sexes, then it may bring uh bring lots of

280
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.699
evolutionary advantages in terms of survival of the individual,

281
00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:07.579
but also of the group and possibly also reproduction

282
00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:10.609
because it can increase. Well, first of all, if

283
00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:13.680
it increases survival, then there is more chances to

284
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.219
have reproduced somewhere in uh in the future, potentially.

285
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.599
And also it can bring other advantages such as

286
00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:24.959
status, for example, right, we don't do sex only

287
00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:29.949
for pleasure, but also for status, for resources, for

288
00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:34.099
uh gaining lots of advantages, social advantages. So same

289
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:38.560
sex, sexuality is exactly the same, right? Bringing advantages

290
00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:42.140
to the individual. But of course, there are other

291
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.020
uh other possibilities such as skin selection, for example,

292
00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:52.050
uh that's among the oldest uh uh hypothesis about

293
00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.920
evolutionary, possible evolutionary origins of homosexual behavior or homosexual

294
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:02.089
orientation showing really that thinking that well, this is

295
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.640
a puzzle, homosexual individuals obviously do not reproduce because

296
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.040
they only have sex with uh uh with people

297
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.579
of the same sex. So how come that they

298
00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:14.750
exist everywhere in all populations that we know in

299
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.170
all human cultures that we know about in probably

300
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.650
all uh other nonhuman animal species that uh that

301
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.739
we have documents about. And kin selection might be

302
00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:31.060
one of the answers, which means that um individuals

303
00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:34.619
actually share their genes or their genetic components with

304
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.089
their uh with their relatives, right, such as with

305
00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:41.930
uh brothers and sisters and parents. Of course. So

306
00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:47.089
if an individual doesn't uh reproduce, reproduce themselves, they

307
00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:53.780
can actually help uh significantly to their close relatives,

308
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.040
close kin for them to reproduce. And so, in

309
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.959
this way, actually, non directly, an individual can pass

310
00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:05.439
their genetic uh components to the uh to the

311
00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:10.199
other generation. So it wouldn't be uh an exclusive

312
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:15.280
reproduction, which means exclusive biological reproduction of the individual.

313
00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:20.060
But they would actually um increase this reproductive success

314
00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:23.819
of their close relatives. And through this uh through

315
00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:26.520
this indirect means, they would actually pass their genes.

316
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:30.219
This is uh of course interesting. And yeah, it's

317
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.119
uh it's based on, on, on, on a much

318
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.540
broader uh theory about altruism, right? Why we actually

319
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.229
help others, right? From the evolutionary point of view,

320
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.579
there are so many puzzles, right? People are in

321
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.560
other animals, they behave in ways that they shouldn't

322
00:20:46.569 --> 00:20:50.140
be behaving actually if um if the mathematics would

323
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.650
be so simple, right, survive or produce. And that's

324
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.150
it. But it's not that simple. Of course, in

325
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.170
general nature is not that simple. Only humans think

326
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.380
that we should simplify everything and categorize everything in

327
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.439
small labels, but that doesn't really work in nature.

328
00:21:06.689 --> 00:21:10.390
So, altruism is also strange, why should we actually

329
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.530
um help other individuals and have costs uh ourselves,

330
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.719
right. So, so that, that, that's a puzzle, right?

331
00:21:19.729 --> 00:21:22.949
Of course. And actually kin selection might be again,

332
00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:26.260
the same solution, right? We are mostly helping our

333
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.780
kin, who with whom we share our gene. So

334
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.780
helping others uh who are uh who are our

335
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.890
family. We can actually increase our uh reproductive success.

336
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.079
And homosexual individuals actually can do the same. Of

337
00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:44.130
course, there is not much uh support for this

338
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.579
uh for this hypothesis, especially in western countries. But

339
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:54.250
uh when um uh uh when the researchers went

340
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.810
to traditional societies with bigger families and not many

341
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:03.119
Western influences such as Samoa Island, then they found

342
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.930
actually that um androphy males, which means the males

343
00:22:07.939 --> 00:22:13.189
who prefer men as sexual partners, they actually have

344
00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:16.810
these tendencies to help their close relatives. And it's

345
00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:21.060
very and more than other men, more than heterosexual

346
00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:24.079
men. So and it was actually even a surprise

347
00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:27.719
in, in this research and they found the same

348
00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:32.339
tendencies in Mexico and in other other countries, where

349
00:22:32.349 --> 00:22:36.640
is a specific kind of same sex, sexual orientation,

350
00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.880
which I haven't mentioned before, which is more transgender,

351
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.319
sexual or homosexual orientation, which means that in these

352
00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:49.000
societies and here in Brazil as well, um There

353
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:54.180
are biological males who actually do not identify as

354
00:22:54.189 --> 00:22:57.119
men and they are not treated by the society

355
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.790
as men. They are also not treated as women,

356
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.550
they don't identify as women, but they identify as

357
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.180
a third gender. So in Samoa, for example, they

358
00:23:08.189 --> 00:23:12.910
are called fain. And in uh Me Mexico, there

359
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.415
are mu and here in Brazil we have Traves

360
00:23:16.694 --> 00:23:20.385
cheese. And there are actually many, many examples from

361
00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:24.435
many other like completely distinct societies showing that these

362
00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:27.635
uh these individuals who are biologically male, but they

363
00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:31.224
have a third gender identity. They have probably some

364
00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:36.680
feminine characteristics. Um AND they prefer men as sexual

365
00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:41.000
partners, not not other third gender individuals, but men,

366
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.329
they prefer men. Sometimes they even compete with women

367
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:51.089
actually for, for, for male sexual partners. So these

368
00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:54.109
individuals, they probably have a specific role in, in

369
00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:57.349
the society and they also help their close kin

370
00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:02.670
individuals to uh to reproduce. So, this specific um

371
00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:09.150
male homosexuality may be actually transferred by uh indirect

372
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.630
reproduction or kin selection um theory or mechanisms. Of

373
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.609
course, they are different, right? They are a little

374
00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:19.910
bit different, not everyone, not all uh homosexual men

375
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.119
are third gender, right? Even in in western societies,

376
00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:27.339
there are many uh homosexual men who are quite

377
00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:30.180
feminine, but there are also many homosexual men who

378
00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:34.719
are very masculine, right? So, actually this hypothesis, this

379
00:24:34.729 --> 00:24:39.319
skin selection hypothesis focuses more on the most feminine

380
00:24:39.329 --> 00:24:42.359
homosexual men, but it doesn't really apply for the

381
00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:47.660
masculine type, right. So some of these evolutionary theories,

382
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.750
they actually explain uh at least partly the existence

383
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.180
of some types of uh of sexual uh or

384
00:24:55.189 --> 00:24:59.239
homosexual orientation. And of course, there are many right?

385
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.000
And so there's a connection, at least to some

386
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:10.209
extent between sexual orientation and gender expression, or at

387
00:25:10.219 --> 00:25:12.609
least in some particular cases.

388
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.079
Mhm. Definitely, definitely. Yeah, we can see that there

389
00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:20.640
are really uh different types of uh of homosexuals,

390
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.790
not only men but women also. And yeah, so

391
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.640
there is, first of all, there is this cross

392
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.560
cultural evidence, right? We have lots of research from

393
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:35.030
different uh kinds of cultures showing this third gender

394
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.209
uh phenotype or a third gender category, which is

395
00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:43.369
very interesting. Mostly it applies to biological males uh

396
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.349
who are third gender. But sometimes there are also

397
00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:51.530
females who can be third gender in, in uh

398
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.609
in India. For example, there is the whole case

399
00:25:54.619 --> 00:26:00.680
of hijra who are uh mostly biological males and

400
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:04.819
they identify as, as hias and they are different

401
00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:07.619
from men and women of the rest of the

402
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.790
society. Sometimes they are homosexual, sometimes they are asexuals.

403
00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:16.619
It can be actually also AAA category for many

404
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.229
uh sexualities or, or gender identities. And then we

405
00:26:21.239 --> 00:26:25.939
have lots of uh interesting evidence from Western societies.

406
00:26:25.949 --> 00:26:27.599
When you go to a gay bar, you can

407
00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:30.780
see clearly that there are some very feminine men

408
00:26:30.949 --> 00:26:33.689
in, in the women ones, there are some very

409
00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:38.339
feminine lesbian women who are usually called f but

410
00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:41.739
there are also very masculine women who are uh

411
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:47.500
who are mostly called uh as B and uh

412
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.030
in men. Actually, it's also, and of course, as

413
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.859
I said, right, nature is more um diverse than,

414
00:26:53.869 --> 00:26:57.479
than our human thinking. So actually, it's not only

415
00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:00.500
that there are very feminine and very masculine, lesbian

416
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.089
women. Of course, there is the whole continuum and

417
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:07.119
a whole spectrum of masculinity and femininity, femininity. And

418
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.130
you can find uh many types of, of women,

419
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.760
but sometimes it's, it's really, it strikes the eyes

420
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.560
that there are some who are like highly feminine,

421
00:27:16.569 --> 00:27:20.060
even more feminine that you would find normally on,

422
00:27:20.069 --> 00:27:22.050
on a walking on a street and some of

423
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.500
them are really very masculine. You would even say

424
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.939
that they, they might be men and in uh

425
00:27:27.949 --> 00:27:30.420
in gay bars for men, it's, it's the same,

426
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.020
right? There are some who are very uh very

427
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.219
feminine, they look younger and thinner and, and, and

428
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.640
um they behave in a more uh feminine manner

429
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.319
while others uh and, and these usually are called

430
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:51.770
as twins while others called as bears, they can

431
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.339
be more uh maybe looking like you like they

432
00:27:55.349 --> 00:28:01.069
have beard than they have facial hair and they

433
00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.119
are bigger. Actually, I don't know if you are

434
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.369
bigger or not. I can only see your face

435
00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:09.410
but they, they prefer drinking beer and not cocktails.

436
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.479
And I don't know, they, they have different kind

437
00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:15.089
of uh personality and behavior than the feminine gay

438
00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:19.099
guys. So you can clearly see that there are

439
00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:24.140
differences, there is a fantastic diversity, right? So sometimes

440
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.810
people think, oh, all these gay men, they are

441
00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:31.290
so feminine and, and uh exaggerating the feminine role,

442
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.339
but it's not true. Not all of them, right?

443
00:28:33.349 --> 00:28:36.489
Some of them, they probably are quite feminine but

444
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.150
the others are not. So it's actually quite interesting

445
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.859
to see. Uh FIRST the data, right? Of course,

446
00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:45.189
we first need to see the evidence, what's actually

447
00:28:45.199 --> 00:28:49.280
what is this phenomenon about? And then uh we

448
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.469
can think about possible evolutionary theories because obviously some

449
00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:58.280
of them don't apply to all these possible subtypes

450
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.500
of uh of homosexual men and women. There is

451
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:05.780
even some evidence uh recent evidence from, from other

452
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.339
research groups showing that there might be different uh

453
00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:15.500
developmental pathways to different types of homosexual orientation. So

454
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:20.739
uh there are different uh biomarkers actually distinguishing these

455
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:27.040
different subtypes of homosexual, specifically men. And again, uh

456
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.780
they are either more feminine or more masculine. So

457
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.589
we should probably be thinking when thinking from the

458
00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:37.969
evolutionary perspective, we should be thinking about more uh

459
00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:43.469
homosexual subtypes uh than only 11 very broad category,

460
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:45.900
right? And that, that actually brings us back to,

461
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.780
to all these definitions and measurements because we saw

462
00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:51.810
already since the beginning that sexual orientation is not

463
00:29:51.819 --> 00:29:55.060
that that easy to grasp and to categorize.

464
00:29:55.609 --> 00:29:57.630
Uh And I mean, when it comes to non

465
00:29:57.699 --> 00:30:02.939
heterosexual men, uh the as I said earlier, there's

466
00:30:02.949 --> 00:30:06.790
also there, there people have also studied about certain

467
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.069
in certain contexts, even men who tend to identify

468
00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:19.060
as exclusively as heterosexual might have non heterosexual sex

469
00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:21.579
with other men. Like for example, I mean, this

470
00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:25.010
first example is a bit extreme but in prisons

471
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.104
that happens and in certain, uh, context, like, for

472
00:30:29.114 --> 00:30:32.885
example, remote areas where men might have very little

473
00:30:32.895 --> 00:30:36.484
access to women or might go for long periods

474
00:30:36.494 --> 00:30:41.594
of time without really, uh, getting in touch or

475
00:30:41.604 --> 00:30:44.795
in contact with women. They spend lots of time

476
00:30:44.805 --> 00:30:48.204
with other men due to particular economic activities that

477
00:30:48.214 --> 00:30:50.444
they have. Uh, THAT happens.

478
00:30:50.594 --> 00:30:55.234
Right. Yeah, definitely, definitely. Sex drive is actually quite

479
00:30:55.244 --> 00:31:00.959
high. Right. It's a, it's a necessity and, uh,

480
00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:03.880
and people who don't really have access to uh

481
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.150
to their preferred partners, they can have sex with

482
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.369
their nonpreferred partners that that actually happens in other

483
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.540
uh animal species as well. But actually, it's very

484
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.880
interesting. There are studies who show uh that show

485
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.979
that even in societies where men have actually access

486
00:31:21.989 --> 00:31:26.165
to their preferred female partners, they also have sex

487
00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:29.645
with men. I mean, many of them and this

488
00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:32.795
number, this, this percentage is even higher than uh

489
00:31:32.805 --> 00:31:37.694
it was thought uh before. So, for example, there

490
00:31:37.704 --> 00:31:40.724
was one interesting study in New York showing that

491
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:45.055
basically 10% of men who identify as heterosexual, they

492
00:31:45.064 --> 00:31:48.869
identify, they tell you I am heterosexual. But when

493
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.219
you ask them, so, and have you ever had

494
00:31:51.229 --> 00:31:54.040
sex with other men? Oh, yeah. Well, I had

495
00:31:54.180 --> 00:32:00.880
so 10% of these uh heterosexual identified men actually

496
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.589
said that they had some sexual encounter with uh

497
00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:08.069
with men. And of, of, of course, New York

498
00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:10.780
is quite sexualized city, right? So it may be

499
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.819
a little bit different or the frequency might be

500
00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:17.670
different in uh in other regions. But it is

501
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.319
very interesting. There are other studies from uh from

502
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:23.390
other countries showing actually the same pattern that individuals

503
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.010
who claim, who label themselves as heterosexual. Maybe because

504
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.959
it's the norm in the population or the religion

505
00:32:31.969 --> 00:32:37.400
says, so they actually have feelings and uh attractions

506
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.630
toward people of the other o of, of the

507
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.750
same sex. So when you ask um about attractions,

508
00:32:44.969 --> 00:32:47.989
so, OK, you say that you are heterosexual. But

509
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.189
now imagine uh a man who would be very

510
00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:58.219
physically attractive and um uh and would have prestige

511
00:32:58.229 --> 00:33:02.270
and uh you would value uh this, this man

512
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.290
uh imagine that this man would initiate an intimate

513
00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:09.589
uh activity with you. Nobody would know about it.

514
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.479
What would be the probability that you would respond

515
00:33:14.489 --> 00:33:19.890
positively to this uh intimate or erotic uh activity?

516
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.300
And look, now we have different kind of numbers.

517
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.699
Now we get even to 30% of heterosexual men

518
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.199
who actually agree to have at least some prob

519
00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:37.790
nonzero probability of engaging of same sex or at

520
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.969
least intimate activity with other men. And when we

521
00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:44.790
ask women, we come up to 60 or 70%

522
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.410
of women who say, yeah, well, that might be

523
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.709
interesting. So, are we actually talking about a puzzle

524
00:33:52.719 --> 00:33:55.239
of sexual orientation or are we talking about a

525
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.329
majority of population? Right? Sometimes it looks like, oh,

526
00:33:59.369 --> 00:34:02.770
we are talking about minorities and, and homosexual people

527
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.729
don't reproduce. And OK, this might be really an

528
00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:10.530
extreme of the whole continuum of sexual orientation. So

529
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.438
people who would really never have sex with individuals

530
00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.649
of the other sex and who would really never

531
00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:20.739
reproduce. But actually most people, if they have the

532
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.679
opportunity and if the society is open, uh then

533
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:30.340
they would actually uh experiment sexuality with both sexes.

534
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.938
And so this probably seems to be the most

535
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.820
adaptive, right to be a little bit less uh

536
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.978
exclusive uh in their sex in, in sexuality. Of

537
00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.050
course, it would be probably the sexual orientation conti

538
00:34:43.228 --> 00:34:46.739
continuum is a little bit skewed for, for heterosexuality.

539
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.649
But still, if we look on all the frequencies

540
00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.250
of possible bisexuality, if we sum up actually all

541
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.989
bisexuality, tendencies and desires and attractions and behaviors, we

542
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.669
would probably come to the majority of the population.

543
00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:04.500
So for me, there is no puzzle, no evolutionary

544
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:10.739
puzzle at all in non heterosexual orientations. And um

545
00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:14.199
and also there are actually interesting studies showing that

546
00:35:14.439 --> 00:35:18.379
um women who who identify as heterosexual and they

547
00:35:18.389 --> 00:35:23.750
never had um sexual encounter with other women. Uh

548
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.530
THEY have, they reproduce plus minus 60% of women

549
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.719
have biological Children. When uh when we look how

550
00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:37.149
many Children have women who identify as heterosexual, but

551
00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:40.949
they had sexual encounters with other women. We still

552
00:35:40.959 --> 00:35:46.050
are around 60% of reproduction. Uh When we look

553
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.669
at bisexually identified women doesn't change at all. Still

554
00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:56.020
bisexual women reproduce at the same rate as heterosexual

555
00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:00.530
women and lesbian women, there drops a little bit,

556
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.360
but we get to some 30 or 40% of

557
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.860
lesbian, of homosexual identified women who actually have biological

558
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.159
Children. So this claim that, that, that homosexual people

559
00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:17.389
don't reproduce is also not completely correct in men.

560
00:36:17.669 --> 00:36:20.449
Uh There it is a little bit different. Their,

561
00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:24.850
uh their uh reproductive sexes really drops with, with

562
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.340
homosexual orientation. But again, bisexual men actually, or bisexuality

563
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.310
in men doesn't seem to have much effect on

564
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.199
their reproductive success. Uh It doesn't really increase or

565
00:36:36.209 --> 00:36:41.120
decrease their reproductive success compared to heterosexual men. And

566
00:36:41.129 --> 00:36:47.399
in homosexual men, uh reproductive success decreases uh up

567
00:36:47.409 --> 00:36:53.360
to 13 or 15%. So uh plus minus 13%

568
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:58.060
of gay men actually have biological Children, right? So

569
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.479
actually, it, it, of, of course, it's not like

570
00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:03.479
60% of the, of the rest of the population,

571
00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:08.129
but it's also not zero. OK. So this is

572
00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:10.489
also important, right? As, as I said, first, we

573
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.729
need to look at the data, right? We can't

574
00:37:12.739 --> 00:37:18.399
really claim that homosexuals don't reproduce because sometimes they

575
00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:22.040
do. But of course, uh if we look on

576
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:27.719
this specific subtype, um this transgender or third gender

577
00:37:27.729 --> 00:37:31.679
homosexual subtype that we were discussing in different countries

578
00:37:31.689 --> 00:37:35.520
such as Fain or Hira in, in India, they

579
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.280
really usually don't reproduce. It is very interesting that

580
00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:43.360
I haven't found uh data on their reproduction rate

581
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.879
or actually, when I found it was really zero.

582
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.689
So there might be really different types, uh, of

583
00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:54.260
homosexuals, right? Ones who really don't reproduce and they

584
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.179
are more transgender, right? They probably have lower, uh,

585
00:37:59.189 --> 00:38:04.000
hormone levels, uh, during prenatal development and, uh, they

586
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:08.919
actually, uh, can reproduce in this indirect, um, can

587
00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:13.739
help, um, way or mechanism. And then there are,

588
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.949
there is actually who are more masculine and who

589
00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:20.729
can, or, or feminine in, um, in women who

590
00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:23.629
can actually have sex with uh indi sometimes at

591
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:26.040
least uh with individuals of the other sex and

592
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:30.370
they actually can reproduce under some certain uh conditions,

593
00:38:30.469 --> 00:38:34.719
right? So actually a little bit of heterosexuality, heterosexuality

594
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:38.540
among uh homosexual individuals can be adaptive. And then

595
00:38:38.645 --> 00:38:41.715
little bit of homosexuality among heterosexuals can also be

596
00:38:41.725 --> 00:38:47.024
adaptive. Again, we are in this beautiful bisexual continuum

597
00:38:47.034 --> 00:38:50.264
and we are describing majority of the population. So

598
00:38:50.274 --> 00:38:54.935
forget about all these exclusive uh heterosexual and homosexual

599
00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:58.250
people. It's a little bit I I was always

600
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.879
thinking about this like evolutionary puzzle because always, when

601
00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:06.370
you try to describe an extreme of a continuum,

602
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.620
it seems to be non adaptive, right? That there

603
00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:12.010
is no way how to explain some kind of

604
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:16.010
extreme behavior from the evolutionary point of view such

605
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.969
as uh extreme autism, for example, right, this extreme

606
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:27.875
cases, uh they mostly bring disadvantages to survival and

607
00:39:28.215 --> 00:39:32.314
uh social life of uh and and reproduction, of

608
00:39:32.324 --> 00:39:35.225
course, sexual life of of the individuals. But actually

609
00:39:35.235 --> 00:39:38.504
the whole spectrum of these traits such as sexual

610
00:39:38.514 --> 00:39:43.195
orientation or uh or autism spectrum can actually bring

611
00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:47.729
many uh many advantages, right? So we shouldn't probably

612
00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:51.000
focus on extreme points, points when we are applying

613
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.239
our revolutionary thinking, we should see the whole phenomenon

614
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.379
and it's much more non heterosexuality or sexual orientation

615
00:39:57.389 --> 00:40:00.320
in general. It's not only exclusive homosexuality.

616
00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:03.530
And I mean, I guess that the one of

617
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.129
the main reasons are probably the main reason why

618
00:40:06.139 --> 00:40:09.580
we also have this sort of very common idea

619
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:16.679
that uh exclusive heterosexuality is basically the overwhelming majority

620
00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:20.600
of people out there, like 90 something percent is

621
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.520
also because we have very strong social taboos against

622
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.850
homosexuality, at least in most societies. Right. And so

623
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:34.560
it is also usual, extremely costly for people even

624
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.770
to express socially and even many times in anonymous

625
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:43.679
self reports, uh that they have, uh, they are

626
00:40:43.689 --> 00:40:48.479
nonexclusive in their sexual orientation. Right? And that the

627
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:52.520
reps sometimes at least feel attracted to people of

628
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.560
the same sex.

629
00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:57.239
Exactly. Exactly. Of course, that's why I said, uh,

630
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.159
if the so society is open, right? And people

631
00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:03.449
actually have all the opportunities and possibilities, then they

632
00:41:03.459 --> 00:41:08.189
would probably behave differently than in restricted society. Of

633
00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:11.229
course, if you look at Iran, for example, or

634
00:41:11.239 --> 00:41:16.590
many African countries, we would see really um harsh

635
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.719
life for uh homosexual individuals, right? In some countries,

636
00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:25.560
actually, it's uh illegal, there can be even a

637
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.760
death penalty actually for same sex behavior. Right. So

638
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.620
of course, this is really costly. Nobody wants to

639
00:41:32.629 --> 00:41:35.909
go to prison or uh to have other social

640
00:41:35.919 --> 00:41:39.989
costs or even uh even die uh because of

641
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.729
their sexual orientation, right? Or nobody, most people probably

642
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.840
uh do not want that. So actually, in many

643
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:52.649
cases, there is this discrepancy between uh behavior and

644
00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:57.239
identity and, and uh sexual attractions, people can actually

645
00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.669
feel attraction and desire but they suppress it, right?

646
00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:04.620
They suppress it and they identify as heterosexual and

647
00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:07.520
they can, they can marry uh with other sex

648
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.510
person and they can have family and Children to

649
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.560
blend uh to blend in, right? In, in, in

650
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.330
the social, in the local social rules. Of course,

651
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.330
there is, there is lots of studies actually about

652
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.060
it and in more liberal societies, uh people have

653
00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:30.050
higher tendency actually to uh identify bisexually or experiment

654
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.239
sexually. Uh AND see actually that their sexual life

655
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.689
doesn't need to be completely restricted on one specific

656
00:42:37.699 --> 00:42:41.770
partner or one specific sexual position as it was

657
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:48.020
for centuries actually in, in uh Christianity books. And

658
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.000
right now it's, I mean, now, now it seems

659
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.429
funny nowadays for us, for example, living in Portugal

660
00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.459
in Brazil and, and other countries, it, it seems

661
00:42:57.469 --> 00:43:03.840
like unbelievable. But uh there were like textbooks, detailed

662
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:08.439
textbooks showing what exactly people should do sexually and

663
00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:11.709
shouldn't do sexually. And from the Christianity point of

664
00:43:11.719 --> 00:43:15.209
view, actually, the best would be to have no

665
00:43:15.219 --> 00:43:18.520
sexuality at all. Right. So, and when there is

666
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.530
the the need then, OK, then you should have

667
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:26.810
the sexuality only for reproduction purposes and only with

668
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.629
uh a stable partner and in some specific uh

669
00:43:30.639 --> 00:43:36.489
sexual positions. So uh and and some countries are

670
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.449
still actually following this kind of rules, very specific

671
00:43:40.459 --> 00:43:44.110
rules and people are basically prohibited to express their

672
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.350
sexuality and sexual orientation. Of course, there is probably

673
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:54.129
fear of um uh of sexually transmitted diseases, for

674
00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:58.679
example, right, same sex, sexuality is more risky in

675
00:43:58.689 --> 00:44:03.520
terms of of sexuality, of um sexually transmitted diseases.

676
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.840
So there can be this kind of fear. Although

677
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.919
nowadays, we already have lots of prevention and and

678
00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:13.760
also antibiotics, right, in case of syphilis or other

679
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:18.139
uh other treatment, uh treatments of of diseases that

680
00:44:18.149 --> 00:44:22.280
were untreatable in the past. So actually it it

681
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.239
makes sense when there was a boom in Europe,

682
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.600
for example, in middle ages, Europe, when there was

683
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.709
a boom of syphilis, of course, people were scared,

684
00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:33.409
right? And syphilis looks terrible when it gets to

685
00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:37.020
the final stages. So they thought that people were

686
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:41.840
basically possessed by demons and uh and of course,

687
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.179
the cause was sexuality, right? So they should avoid

688
00:44:45.189 --> 00:44:49.120
sexuality at all costs. So it wasn't like completely

689
00:44:49.129 --> 00:44:52.810
um a crazy idea, right? Of course, that these

690
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.280
social ideas, they are adapted to the local environments,

691
00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:01.250
for example, um uh epidemics of uh of uh

692
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.560
sexually transmitted diseases. Nowadays, it doesn't look really necessary,

693
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.709
right? In most societies that have access to, to

694
00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:13.159
medical treatments and people are actually more free to

695
00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:14.709
express their sexuality.

696
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.729
So let me ask you now about socio sexuality

697
00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:24.800
specifically, I mean, we have these rates, some people

698
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.310
score lower in it. Some people score higher. The

699
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.360
people who score higher are basically the ones who

700
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.260
uh tend to prefer a higher number of sexual

701
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:39.199
partners and and committed sex. And they don't really

702
00:45:39.209 --> 00:45:43.510
care much about being romantically involved with someone to

703
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.600
have sex with them and people who score lower,

704
00:45:46.669 --> 00:45:49.870
it's basically the opposite. So uh tell us a

705
00:45:49.879 --> 00:45:53.669
little bit about that and how does it relate

706
00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:56.669
or if it relates in any way to gender

707
00:45:56.679 --> 00:46:00.860
expression as well, like femininity and masculinity.

708
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:06.159
Yeah. Well, sociosexual, it is also quite an interesting

709
00:46:06.169 --> 00:46:10.729
concept used a lot in, in evolutionary psychology research

710
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.850
because it's a proxy of um of measuring an

711
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.659
individual sexual strategy. It basically shows if the person

712
00:46:19.669 --> 00:46:23.530
has the tendency as you said to hook up,

713
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.379
right, to have casual sex with a diversity of

714
00:46:26.389 --> 00:46:32.050
partners without emotional commitment or uh if the person

715
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.810
is more restricted in, in their sexuality. So, uh

716
00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:42.139
the person prefers actually having more commitment before uh

717
00:46:42.149 --> 00:46:47.959
before starting uh sexual encounters, of course, again, right?

718
00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:52.179
These are two extremes, right? Mostly most sexuality or

719
00:46:52.189 --> 00:46:56.750
most strategies are not really like complete uh anarchy,

720
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.310
sexual anarchy, like having sex with anyone at any

721
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.489
time and any place. Uh And mostly people are

722
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:11.850
also not completely exclusively monogamous, only thinking about one

723
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.389
specific partner and being attracted to one partner during

724
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:19.590
the whole life. So most people actually fall somewhere

725
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.370
in between and uh they follow different kinds of

726
00:47:23.379 --> 00:47:27.159
strategies. Um We actually even show that uh this

727
00:47:27.169 --> 00:47:29.810
short or long term strategy, they can sometimes go

728
00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.729
together in, in one paper, for example, we showed

729
00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:37.729
we were measuring mating sexes and parenting success, which

730
00:47:37.739 --> 00:47:40.800
basically follow the the rule of the socio sexuality,

731
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.209
right? If you have higher parenting success, then uh

732
00:47:44.419 --> 00:47:47.610
you would have a tendency to secure one specific

733
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.290
partner uh to protect and care of uh of

734
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.219
the offspring. Uh WHILE if you have mating success

735
00:47:55.229 --> 00:47:58.340
or if you have a mating effort, then you

736
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.719
would be going after lots of uh different sexual

737
00:48:00.729 --> 00:48:03.860
partners and sometimes they don't go really together. Right?

738
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.080
Of course, if you have lots of sexual partners,

739
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:09.560
then uh it's difficult to invest, for example, in

740
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.439
family while uh if you have kids, then it's

741
00:48:13.449 --> 00:48:18.199
almost impossible to, to run after different sexual partners.

742
00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:21.500
But some people are actually able to combine these

743
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:25.574
two ST stress and uh sometimes they go together,

744
00:48:25.584 --> 00:48:29.235
people can have actually both parental effort and mating

745
00:48:29.245 --> 00:48:33.395
effort quite high. So it's right, for example, in

746
00:48:33.645 --> 00:48:38.834
uh uh open relationships or consensually non monogamous relationships,

747
00:48:38.844 --> 00:48:41.064
people can actually have a family and they can

748
00:48:41.074 --> 00:48:44.905
have long term committed relationships, but they can also

749
00:48:44.915 --> 00:48:48.750
at the same time uh have a variety of

750
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.489
sexual partners, right? Such as such as in open

751
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.570
relationships or, or polyamory or uh or swinging or,

752
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.370
or other uh other possibilities. So this is interesting

753
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.679
and yes, and you asked about the gender expression

754
00:49:03.689 --> 00:49:08.550
or masculinity femininity. We did one smaller study actually

755
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.280
about socio sexuality. And we thought that people who

756
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:17.719
would be more masculine in general, men, women uh

757
00:49:17.729 --> 00:49:23.149
of uh of different sexual orientation, simply people who

758
00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:26.360
would be more masculine, which means uh they probably

759
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:30.459
had more testosterone or androgen action during prenatal and

760
00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:36.060
postnatal um environment or development. They might actually behave

761
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:40.260
more uh unrestricted in their socio sexuality. So they

762
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:44.469
might tend to have more casual sex. But actually,

763
00:49:44.479 --> 00:49:47.360
we didn't find support for, for this uh for

764
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:49.969
this hypothesis, we actually, we found support only in

765
00:49:49.979 --> 00:49:53.659
women. So women who were more masculine, they really

766
00:49:53.669 --> 00:49:57.419
had higher socio sexuality. They had a tendency to

767
00:49:57.429 --> 00:50:00.959
have more sexual partners, they had higher socio sexual

768
00:50:00.969 --> 00:50:07.260
desire and also more liberal sociosexual attitudes. But in

769
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.669
men, it was actually the opposite. I mean, the,

770
00:50:09.679 --> 00:50:13.000
the, the association wasn't very strong, but we found

771
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.370
actually that men who were more feminine, they had

772
00:50:17.379 --> 00:50:21.100
uh higher socio sexuality. But actually, this can be

773
00:50:21.199 --> 00:50:25.500
uh because of this association between sexual orientation and

774
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.560
gender, nonconformity. Of course, I I told you that

775
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.929
there are different types of, of homosexual men, some

776
00:50:30.939 --> 00:50:33.699
of them are masculine, but on average, they are

777
00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:37.689
actually more feminine and it can be it is

778
00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:40.620
possible that it's not really the femininity per se,

779
00:50:40.629 --> 00:50:45.050
which makes them more unrestricted sexually, but it's more

780
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.060
their sexual orientation. Because when, when I looked at

781
00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:51.540
different data from more than 15,000 individuals in, in

782
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:57.600
different different studies um from, from different populations, actually,

783
00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.360
the pattern was quite clear that in men, uh

784
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:06.479
socio sexuality increases linearly with their non heterosexuality. So

785
00:51:06.489 --> 00:51:09.429
the more he is non heterosexual, the more he's

786
00:51:09.439 --> 00:51:13.639
getting to homosexual end of the continuum, the more

787
00:51:13.649 --> 00:51:18.330
he's uh socio, sexually unrestricted, he has a tendency

788
00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:23.149
to have more sexual partners, which can be again

789
00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.610
explained by the availability, right? If your uh preferred

790
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.330
partners are also men who are unrestricted, then it's

791
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.770
easier actually to have lots of uh lots of

792
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.020
sexual partners. I'm not saying that all homosexual men

793
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:42.139
are completely sexual anarchists. OK. They are not, there

794
00:51:42.149 --> 00:51:45.399
are many who are demisexual and who, who are

795
00:51:45.409 --> 00:51:50.300
monogamous sexually. But the, the, the correlation, the evidence

796
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:53.270
was actually quite clear in women, this didn't happen.

797
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.820
And what we found actually was a different uh

798
00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.370
different graphic. Actually, it was uh a little bit,

799
00:52:00.379 --> 00:52:06.080
a little bit like uh inverse U which means

800
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.959
that um if you look at the continuum between

801
00:52:10.969 --> 00:52:16.750
exclusively homosexual and exclusively heterosexual women, they had actually

802
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:22.270
the lowest uh sociosexual scores, but bisexual women, they

803
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.800
were the highest. So actually, it seems that uh

804
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:30.959
socio sexuality in women correlates with their higher masculinity

805
00:52:30.969 --> 00:52:34.239
scores, but also with their bisexuality. So the more

806
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:39.139
she's bisexual, the more uh partners uh she wants

807
00:52:39.229 --> 00:52:41.949
to get, of course, the problem with the socio

808
00:52:41.989 --> 00:52:46.320
sexuality measure is that it asks about partners in

809
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:49.979
general. How many partners, uh how many different partners

810
00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:52.689
have you had during the last year? Or uh

811
00:52:52.699 --> 00:52:56.580
when you look uh when you, when you meet

812
00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:01.699
um a new person, uh what's the frequency you

813
00:53:01.709 --> 00:53:04.229
uh you think about having sex with this person

814
00:53:04.239 --> 00:53:06.899
you have just met or do you think that

815
00:53:06.909 --> 00:53:10.340
sex uh without love is? Ok. But it doesn't

816
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:13.820
really uh ask about the sex of the other

817
00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.260
person. Right. So actually, we don't know in bisexual

818
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:21.260
people, if this higher socio sexuality in women specifically,

819
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.459
it's because they are more unrestricted, unrestricted with men

820
00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:28.879
or women. So that's still a question maybe with

821
00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:32.000
both, right? Of course, because they have the opportunity.

822
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.550
Right? Yeah, that was crazy. I,

823
00:53:36.149 --> 00:53:39.729
I, I mean, it would also seem intuitive that

824
00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:46.449
people who are bisexual would also feel attracted to

825
00:53:46.459 --> 00:53:49.709
a higher number of people because since they are

826
00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:52.719
attracted to people from both genders, I mean, there's

827
00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.919
more people out there to be attracted to than

828
00:53:55.929 --> 00:53:58.750
if you're just attracted to the opposite sex.

829
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:03.370
Right. Exactly. Exactly. And there is the advantage, look

830
00:54:03.379 --> 00:54:06.899
at it is the sexual and evolutionary advantage. You

831
00:54:06.909 --> 00:54:09.500
can basically have sex with anyone. Right. Of course,

832
00:54:09.574 --> 00:54:12.165
I'm not, again, I'm not saying that bisexual people

833
00:54:12.175 --> 00:54:16.064
are like completely uh unrestricted and uh, and they

834
00:54:16.074 --> 00:54:20.955
have, um, they are nymphomaniacs basically, but they have

835
00:54:20.965 --> 00:54:25.514
higher opportunities. Right. Of course. And maybe nowadays actually,

836
00:54:25.614 --> 00:54:28.445
uh, it seems that the mating market is bigger.

837
00:54:28.455 --> 00:54:32.094
Right. Because of all these tinder and, and other,

838
00:54:32.104 --> 00:54:36.719
uh, other apps, sexual basically apps. But actually it's

839
00:54:36.729 --> 00:54:39.149
not that easy. It seems that actually people are

840
00:54:39.159 --> 00:54:42.120
using these apps. Exactly, because they are unable to

841
00:54:42.129 --> 00:54:45.899
get sexual partners. Right. It's not that easy actually

842
00:54:45.909 --> 00:54:50.080
to, to find sexual ava available sexual partners to

843
00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:53.100
flirt with them and to, to initiate the first

844
00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:54.919
contact, it's not that easy. Of course, it's the,

845
00:54:54.929 --> 00:54:58.040
it's the whole process involved in it. And for

846
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.100
some people, this can be actually much more difficult

847
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.889
than for other people. There are even some studies

848
00:55:03.899 --> 00:55:06.649
actually showing that Tinder is used more by more

849
00:55:06.659 --> 00:55:10.719
timid people, right? People who are uh actually a

850
00:55:10.729 --> 00:55:15.659
little bit more shy. They um they, I do

851
00:55:15.669 --> 00:55:19.620
not know how to, how to initiate a conversation

852
00:55:19.629 --> 00:55:24.830
with an unknown, attractive uh person. So it's not

853
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.139
that easy and uh socios and imagine a person

854
00:55:28.149 --> 00:55:33.080
with high socio sexuality, high desire for a variety

855
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:38.189
of sexual partners being shy on Tinder, looking at

856
00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:43.104
all these possible uh potential partners. But basically, I

857
00:55:43.114 --> 00:55:46.175
don't want to do the first contact, especially in

858
00:55:46.185 --> 00:55:50.235
person. Right. So, yes, there are many problems that

859
00:55:50.284 --> 00:55:52.774
and mismatches, right? Of course, when we are talking

860
00:55:52.784 --> 00:55:56.620
from the evolutionary perspective, we haven't really evolved with

861
00:55:56.629 --> 00:55:59.790
Tinder and with online dating. I'm not saying that

862
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.360
it's completely incorrect, but it's obviously different than uh

863
00:56:04.439 --> 00:56:09.000
what humans evolved. So we need to also think

864
00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.889
about mismatches and it seems that people actually spend

865
00:56:11.899 --> 00:56:15.229
lots of time on dating apps and they are

866
00:56:15.239 --> 00:56:18.175
trying to find parts partners. But there is a

867
00:56:18.185 --> 00:56:23.745
large proportion of um involuntarily single uh individuals who

868
00:56:23.754 --> 00:56:26.084
are actually unable to find and who are not

869
00:56:26.094 --> 00:56:29.725
happy alone. Right. They won't actually sexual partners or

870
00:56:29.735 --> 00:56:33.034
even romantic long term partners, but they are unable

871
00:56:33.044 --> 00:56:36.274
simply to find ones in one of the cross

872
00:56:36.284 --> 00:56:40.840
cultural studies that we did. Um WE also found

873
00:56:40.889 --> 00:56:43.639
in uh it was, I think in eight or

874
00:56:43.649 --> 00:56:45.629
nine different countries. I don't know, most of my

875
00:56:45.639 --> 00:56:47.639
research is a cross cultural and I don't remember

876
00:56:47.649 --> 00:56:52.350
anymore in how many countries each study. But it

877
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.679
was a nice study study showing actually that uh

878
00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:00.409
more than half of our sample in all studied

879
00:57:00.419 --> 00:57:07.310
countries was actually single and a great percentage of

880
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:11.479
these single uh people like 15 or 20% of

881
00:57:11.489 --> 00:57:15.479
these single people, they were actually involuntarily single. So

882
00:57:15.489 --> 00:57:19.139
these are people who actually suffer being single, right?

883
00:57:19.149 --> 00:57:21.409
Of course, I'm not saying that that being coupled

884
00:57:21.419 --> 00:57:23.389
is the best thing ever. Of course, there are

885
00:57:23.399 --> 00:57:28.209
people suffering in long term relationships as well, obviously,

886
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.020
but there are also people who are suffering being

887
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.459
single. Some of them uh they don't, right. Some

888
00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:35.629
of them, they are single because they want to

889
00:57:35.639 --> 00:57:38.290
be single, they do not want to commit to

890
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.489
a single partner or have a family and they,

891
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.919
they want to have career and, and they want

892
00:57:43.929 --> 00:57:47.189
to travel and be free and whatever. So they

893
00:57:47.199 --> 00:57:50.469
are happy actually to be single. But a great

894
00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:55.709
percentage of people actually have active problems attracting individuals

895
00:57:55.719 --> 00:58:00.229
exercising their socio sexuality, their sexual desires and their

896
00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:04.090
also their romantic desires. And in the end, they,

897
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.550
they are actually staying for a long time, involuntarily

898
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.830
single and not only men, women as well.

899
00:58:11.389 --> 00:58:14.659
So let me ask you now about a particular

900
00:58:14.669 --> 00:58:17.409
trait that men and women or, or, I mean,

901
00:58:17.419 --> 00:58:21.870
particular traits associated with the face specifically that men

902
00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:25.479
and women might find attractive in the opposite sex

903
00:58:25.489 --> 00:58:28.709
in this case. So in what ways are human

904
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:32.290
faces sexually dimorphic?

905
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:39.639
Hey man, what is there is actually there is

906
00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:44.939
the uh morphological uh sexual dimorphism. Uh When you

907
00:58:44.949 --> 00:58:50.139
take um the skulls of uh females and males,

908
00:58:50.149 --> 00:58:53.300
uh you can actually see average differences in their

909
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.260
uh cheek bones, for example, that are usually bigger

910
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:59.320
in, in women than in men. Uh THESE uh

911
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.659
brow ridges which are bigger in men than in

912
00:59:02.669 --> 00:59:06.419
women. Men usually have bigger chins uh than women.

913
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:09.340
Uh There is this uh the ratio of um

914
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:14.080
length um and uh wideness of the face, which

915
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:18.070
is also different men usually have wider faces while

916
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.699
women have longer faces, right? Uh In the ratio

917
00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:24.469
of o of the wideness and So there are

918
00:59:24.479 --> 00:59:26.979
many differences, of course, facial hair, for example, looking

919
00:59:26.989 --> 00:59:29.750
at you, you have, you have a beard and

920
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.020
most women actually do not have beard. And, um,

921
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.860
actually some populations in Japan, actually not even men

922
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:40.699
have beards, right. This is interesting, some population are

923
00:59:40.709 --> 00:59:45.560
completely beardless, uh, even in men. But anyway, so

924
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:49.020
there are some populations that are more sexually dimorphic,

925
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:53.040
uh, than other populations. And we didn't really expect

926
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:56.139
this, uh this result, we were collecting also uh

927
00:59:56.149 --> 01:00:01.040
data from different countries. And again, I don't remember

928
01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.159
again to all of the countries. But we had,

929
01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:06.090
uh we had two or three African countries. We

930
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.659
have uh Middle East countries, we had India, uh

931
01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:15.350
Vietnam, Czech Republic, Brazil and probably others. And we

932
01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:21.850
basically found that uh we found these average morphological

933
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.530
differences between men and women in all these populations.

934
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.820
But there was a variation and we actually found

935
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:32.350
that the European and South American populations are the

936
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:38.770
most sexually dimorphic uh populations uh while African populations

937
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.550
were the least sexually dimorphic. So this is very

938
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.810
interesting, right? Of course, that uh that preferences for

939
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.189
sexual dimorphic traits has been studied for decades by

940
01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:52.570
now. So everybody knows already for lots of, from

941
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:57.860
lots of studies from different populations that individuals prefer

942
01:00:57.909 --> 01:01:03.429
feminine, uh morphological features in female faces, which is

943
01:01:03.439 --> 01:01:07.399
also what we replicated in all the studied countries.

944
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:11.790
But there has always been a problem with male

945
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.030
masculinity because women actually do not always prefer masculine

946
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.820
men, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, sometimes they

947
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:23.899
have no preference at all. And in this new

948
01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:28.189
study, we also didn't find any specific preference for

949
01:01:28.199 --> 01:01:32.129
uh male masculinity. And this is interesting when we

950
01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:35.489
look at this uh this variation in uh in

951
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.879
morphology around the globe. Right? Of course, unfortunately, most

952
01:01:39.889 --> 01:01:44.129
of the studies are restricted to one specific population

953
01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:47.500
and we are basically only starting uh cross cultural

954
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:51.639
research for me as an anthropologist originally. Uh THIS

955
01:01:51.649 --> 01:01:54.489
is very interesting right to see this variation among

956
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.139
different populations. And I, I wouldn't say that it's

957
01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:03.050
cultural um uh variation. It's really very, it's much

958
01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.870
broader variation. It's really between populations. And we don't

959
01:02:07.879 --> 01:02:11.229
know which factors actually contribute to this variation. It

960
01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:15.209
can be ecological factors, right? Of course, we don't

961
01:02:15.219 --> 01:02:20.409
know how uh um how these factors uh like

962
01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:23.600
uh humidity or temperature. For example, where people are

963
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:29.310
developing their uh their sexually secondary uh characteristics can

964
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.600
influence uh this development. We have no idea. We

965
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.600
are just starting actually to see this, this variation.

966
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:38.389
And I think that we are actually basically in

967
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.969
almost in the end of this opportunity to, to

968
01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:46.530
study different di diversity in different populations because soon

969
01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:50.620
people will, will mix so much, right? And we

970
01:02:50.629 --> 01:02:53.909
are already migrating so much. Look at me, right?

971
01:02:53.919 --> 01:02:55.669
I, I came from the Czech Republic and I'm

972
01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:58.989
here in Brazil. I think that uh I, I

973
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.850
even saw one study actually showing uh a small

974
01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:07.139
forecast, right? Thinking about future how future humans will

975
01:03:07.149 --> 01:03:09.239
look like. And it seems that they will look

976
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:13.429
like normal Brazilians, they will be simply mixed of

977
01:03:13.439 --> 01:03:16.750
all possible populations. So we need to use this

978
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.290
opportunity and, and try to study different populations right

979
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.719
now, right, when they are still a little bit

980
01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:25.439
different, at least some of them. So we found

981
01:03:25.449 --> 01:03:30.169
this, this surprising effect of population on uh sexual

982
01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:34.649
dimorphism in, in facial morphology. And of course, I

983
01:03:34.659 --> 01:03:36.379
want to see more studies. I, I don't know

984
01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:37.929
why this happens. Uh

985
01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:41.060
BUT I mean, just to get this clear and

986
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:44.020
I'm not sure if by now, you're already able

987
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.560
to answer this question specifically. But if we look

988
01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:52.939
into a population where there's less sexual dimorphism on

989
01:03:52.949 --> 01:03:56.750
the level of the face, is it that women

990
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.879
uh from that population uh express less interest in

991
01:04:02.889 --> 01:04:06.840
men who have more masculinize face? I mean, they

992
01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:09.560
don't care about that as much or

993
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.389
might be, but we didn't find actually this effect.

994
01:04:13.629 --> 01:04:17.250
We didn't find that uh in that study, we

995
01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:22.860
asked, we measured actually the uh the facial morphology,

996
01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:26.649
right? And sexual dimorphism. And we found this variation

997
01:04:26.659 --> 01:04:30.260
in different countries, but we didn't find actually variation

998
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.669
in preferences for masculinity, not even for femininity. Actually,

999
01:04:33.679 --> 01:04:38.169
all in all countries, people preferred feminine female faces.

1000
01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:40.879
And in all countries, we didn't actually find any

1001
01:04:40.889 --> 01:04:45.810
effect of, of male morphological masculinity on uh attractiveness

1002
01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.959
ratings, right. So this was actually interesting. But what

1003
01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:52.040
we found and the and the strongest effect actually

1004
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:56.399
was Aborigines of uh or prototypical of the faces,

1005
01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:59.620
right. So the more average the face within the

1006
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:03.600
given population, the more attractive it is rated by

1007
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:06.719
the local people. So this is, this is interesting.

1008
01:05:06.729 --> 01:05:09.340
This can also actually explain why there are still

1009
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.560
some population differences because in the end, we actually

1010
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:15.459
like people we know, right, we are familiar with,

1011
01:05:15.469 --> 01:05:18.389
we grow up with and we don't really like

1012
01:05:18.399 --> 01:05:22.879
that much. Uh PEOPLE who look very different, of

1013
01:05:22.889 --> 01:05:25.989
course, there is the exotic effect, right? Sometimes people

1014
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.010
simply like uh individuals who are very different but

1015
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.060
in its majority, uh what actually works is the

1016
01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:36.449
effect of homo gine, right? That we actually like

1017
01:05:36.459 --> 01:05:39.580
people who like uh who look like us, right?

1018
01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:42.370
And not only look but who behave like us,

1019
01:05:42.379 --> 01:05:44.479
who have the same religion, who have the same

1020
01:05:44.489 --> 01:05:47.639
education, who have the same beliefs and the same

1021
01:05:47.649 --> 01:05:49.719
age actually mostly,

1022
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.949
I mean, probably should also study this, but I

1023
01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:55.850
would be willing to bet that people who score

1024
01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:00.889
higher on social sex, socio sexuality would also be

1025
01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:05.139
the ones that prefer exotic faces because they are

1026
01:06:05.149 --> 01:06:10.389
different. I don't know that that's just something that

1027
01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:12.800
I'm putting out there. I have no idea at

1028
01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:15.189
all if this would be true or not. But

1029
01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:16.229
anyway,

1030
01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:20.070
but it's quite plausible actually. I think so, I

1031
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.780
do not really have any data about this and

1032
01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.540
I do not know any research that would be

1033
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.760
asking about it, but it's quite plausible. I think.

1034
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.350
I agree totally with you.

1035
01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:33.719
So, let's talk about one last topic. Then you've

1036
01:06:33.729 --> 01:06:37.260
also done work on the evolutionary psychology of self

1037
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:42.129
presentation modification. What is this about? I mean, when

1038
01:06:42.139 --> 01:06:47.389
people basically self pres or mod modify their, their

1039
01:06:47.399 --> 01:06:51.709
self presentation, what are they usually doing? I mean,

1040
01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:54.770
are there sex differences here in our men and

1041
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.550
women do that? And what are the goals that

1042
01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.649
people have with it?

1043
01:07:01.199 --> 01:07:03.510
That's a good question. How many hours or days

1044
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.669
we have to discuss this topic?

1045
01:07:07.139 --> 01:07:09.090
50 more minutes, I

1046
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:15.350
guess. Ok. Ok. No, it's, it's really this, uh,

1047
01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.580
appear modifications. They are a fascinating topic. It's unbelievable

1048
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:23.830
that people are actually modifying their appearance all the

1049
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.300
time you asked. Well, well, all the time, basically

1050
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.790
we have done one study or participated in, in

1051
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.870
one cross cultural study with more than 100,000 individuals

1052
01:07:36.879 --> 01:07:41.790
from more than 90 countries recently. And, uh, we

1053
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.250
asked about um, what, what uh kinds of uh

1054
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.919
body modifications or appearance modifications people normally do and

1055
01:07:51.929 --> 01:07:55.639
how much time they spend with these modifications. And

1056
01:07:55.649 --> 01:07:59.739
it seems that in all these countries, people modify

1057
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:03.040
their, their appearance, actively modify their appearance and they

1058
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:06.560
spend at least on average 10 minutes per day,

1059
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.739
uh modifying their appearance. But of course, that en

1060
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:14.280
globes, lots of, uh, lots of activities. So for

1061
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:18.040
example, taking a shower, using perfume, I I mean,

1062
01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.779
I even used perfume for this interview. Also nobody

1063
01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:28.538
can, nobody can. So now my perfume, but we

1064
01:08:28.548 --> 01:08:30.249
somehow do these things, right? And

1065
01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:34.127
maybe somewhere in the future with for the technology

1066
01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:35.587
or something

1067
01:08:35.599 --> 01:08:37.758
like this would be great. That would be really

1068
01:08:37.769 --> 01:08:40.249
great. That's why we do lots of research on,

1069
01:08:40.258 --> 01:08:43.877
on um facial and visual attractiveness and also vocal

1070
01:08:43.889 --> 01:08:46.578
attractiveness because it's easy, we can do it online,

1071
01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:51.198
we can collect uh rating. So for Chinese people

1072
01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:54.238
here in Brazil, for example, and it's easy but

1073
01:08:54.249 --> 01:08:58.849
smell is impossible. I can't really bring uh smell

1074
01:08:58.858 --> 01:09:01.769
of Chinese people if there is some uh over

1075
01:09:01.778 --> 01:09:04.318
here to Brazil and test if there is something

1076
01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:07.019
that we can smell out of these people. Unfortunately,

1077
01:09:07.028 --> 01:09:09.809
we still don't have this technology. But yeah, but

1078
01:09:09.818 --> 01:09:14.917
changing our smell and appearance and, and clothes actually

1079
01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:17.828
and the hair and everything. That's something that we

1080
01:09:17.837 --> 01:09:21.758
do and it seems that most people actually do

1081
01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:25.167
and, and people who don't, they actually have some

1082
01:09:25.179 --> 01:09:29.298
self grooming uh problem, right? That it's, that's uh

1083
01:09:29.568 --> 01:09:34.618
it accompanies some psychological issue or psychiatric issue. So

1084
01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:39.720
uh so grooming and uh self care uh is

1085
01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:43.049
something that humans do as well as other animals.

1086
01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.890
Again, it's nothing completely new. It's not an invention

1087
01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:52.189
uh of Western modern society that people uh wash

1088
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.959
their hair or, or, or paint uh their, their

1089
01:09:55.970 --> 01:10:00.089
bodies in different ways. No painting, actually, body painting.

1090
01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:02.995
They are uh they have been documented in so

1091
01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:08.544
many cultures. And also historically, actually also some archaeological

1092
01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:12.274
findings actually show that people were using ochre already

1093
01:10:12.285 --> 01:10:16.274
100,000 years ago in many places of uh of

1094
01:10:16.285 --> 01:10:20.875
the world. So it's something uh that people do.

1095
01:10:21.395 --> 01:10:24.674
Of course, when we look at cats, for example,

1096
01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:27.814
or other animals, they also uh do the self

1097
01:10:27.825 --> 01:10:30.750
grooming all the time, right? Some, some of these

1098
01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.310
species, even all the time, there are even some

1099
01:10:33.319 --> 01:10:37.379
species that, that actually such as one vulture uh

1100
01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:42.779
which is a big bird species. And in the

1101
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:46.140
zoo, the male actually doesn't do this, uh doesn't

1102
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:49.120
do this behavior in the zoo. He has a

1103
01:10:49.129 --> 01:10:53.700
nice white uh plumage in front of the body.

1104
01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.540
But when he's in the wild, he actually finds

1105
01:10:57.549 --> 01:11:03.089
some, some coils or some uh some uh yeah,

1106
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:06.359
well, it's, it's coils that look more orange or

1107
01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:09.680
red uh because they have an iron in it

1108
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.919
and they actually the male can spend hours uh

1109
01:11:16.049 --> 01:11:21.080
putting this this soil into his white white plumage.

1110
01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:25.240
So actually he looks afterwards really reddish or, or

1111
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:29.370
or orange, right? So this is very interesting behavior

1112
01:11:29.379 --> 01:11:32.040
and it seems that it can actually attract uh

1113
01:11:32.049 --> 01:11:36.709
attract sexual partners or it can increase uh status

1114
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.189
for example, and, and attract attention in general. So

1115
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.870
it seems that people actually do exactly the same,

1116
01:11:43.879 --> 01:11:46.430
right? Sometimes we are changing our appearance to look

1117
01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:50.149
better, right? Not always, but sometimes we do to

1118
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.149
look better and to attract potential potential partners to

1119
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.089
increase actually our uh desirability as a as a

1120
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:02.319
partner. Uh But of course, not always, right, we

1121
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:05.529
can use uh these differences or these modifications of

1122
01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.430
our appearance to again, to blend in, for example,

1123
01:12:09.439 --> 01:12:14.810
in our society. So for example, um uh it

1124
01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:18.529
would be strange to, to walk on a on

1125
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:22.649
a beach, for example, in a uh in long

1126
01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.959
trousers and long sleeves, right where everybody is using

1127
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.529
a bathing suit, for example. So in specific places,

1128
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.464
people actually change their, their behavior and their outfit

1129
01:12:34.535 --> 01:12:37.325
according to the local uh according to the local

1130
01:12:37.334 --> 01:12:39.805
norms, it would be strange to go uh for

1131
01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:43.544
example, to Eastern Turkey and, and again using uh

1132
01:12:43.555 --> 01:12:47.004
a sh uh um sleeveless T shirt, for example,

1133
01:12:47.015 --> 01:12:49.444
because that's not really allowed by, by the local

1134
01:12:49.455 --> 01:12:54.654
society. Uh So uh there are definitely differences between

1135
01:12:54.665 --> 01:12:59.564
different populations. What is universal is probably this tendency

1136
01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:03.020
to modify an appearance. But of course, there are

1137
01:13:03.029 --> 01:13:07.350
local tactics, right? In, in the Western society, what

1138
01:13:07.359 --> 01:13:10.500
is more uh what is more attractive is, is

1139
01:13:10.509 --> 01:13:13.939
white teeth, for example, right? There is lots of

1140
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:18.299
uh dental creams to to to do the whitening

1141
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:21.759
and and lots of procedures and so white teeth

1142
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:25.790
actually looks attractive and it's and healthy, right? But

1143
01:13:25.799 --> 01:13:30.430
actually, if you go to Eastern um Asia, to

1144
01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:33.919
Japan and other other countries and you know what

1145
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.049
you're going to say

1146
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:40.069
this. So you can see that, that actually the,

1147
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.200
the, the, the pattern was exactly the opposite. They

1148
01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:47.810
were using also some uh specific um uh procedures

1149
01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:51.330
to make their teeth healthy. But actually these procedures

1150
01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:54.649
made the teeth black completely black. So,

1151
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.009
and they like for, they prefer a crook, crooked

1152
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.089
teeth. Right.

1153
01:14:00.339 --> 01:14:03.379
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And this is so different, right?

1154
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:05.439
This is so strange for us, It can look

1155
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:09.919
even scary, actually, only unattractive but even scary. So

1156
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:14.419
look at it, right? How, how uh fantastic uh

1157
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:17.919
uh diversity we have in all these um all

1158
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:22.770
these body or appearance modifications. So someone can say,

1159
01:14:22.779 --> 01:14:25.229
oh, this is cultural, this de depends on the

1160
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.020
local culture and it definitely depends, right? And local

1161
01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:33.200
ecologies, for example, because somewhere I can't really find

1162
01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:41.339
um parrot plumage uh to decorate my uh my

1163
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.169
clothes, for example, which would be typical for the

1164
01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.950
Amazonian indigenous people over here, right? So in Europe,

1165
01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:51.379
for example, there are not many parrots. So that

1166
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:56.600
wouldn't work, right? So uh people usually use something

1167
01:14:56.609 --> 01:15:00.104
that is that is scarce, that is rare, right?

1168
01:15:00.115 --> 01:15:03.084
That is uh not easy to find. So for

1169
01:15:03.095 --> 01:15:06.044
example, that's why actually people use gold and and

1170
01:15:06.055 --> 01:15:09.685
and this kind of precious metals or diamonds or,

1171
01:15:09.694 --> 01:15:15.254
or precious stones to show their status, right? Because

1172
01:15:15.265 --> 01:15:21.080
that's precious, it's rare, right? Um So actually changing

1173
01:15:21.089 --> 01:15:25.950
appearance can also um communicate status of the person,

1174
01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:29.640
right? And it can change actually status. But it's

1175
01:15:29.649 --> 01:15:31.729
not easy, it's not easy to, to, to buy

1176
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.799
a diamond. Right. I can't buy a diamond probably.

1177
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:39.580
Right. So, the only person who really has lots

1178
01:15:39.589 --> 01:15:41.560
of money can buy a diamond. It's a small

1179
01:15:41.569 --> 01:15:44.720
thing. It's a very small uh, stone, but it

1180
01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:47.689
can make all the change in the status of

1181
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:52.259
the person because with this signal, actually, uh they

1182
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:55.640
are signaling, look, I can afford it, right? I'm

1183
01:15:55.649 --> 01:15:59.450
able to buy and somewhere it can be parrot

1184
01:15:59.459 --> 01:16:02.770
plumage, right? But it's also not easy to find

1185
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:05.720
a parrot in a, in an Amazon forest and

1186
01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:08.279
go after it and catch it and uh and

1187
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:12.169
spend lots of time and energy actually catching a

1188
01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.779
parrot, right? And the person who actually does this

1189
01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:18.990
does this can show look ii I know how

1190
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.759
to do that. I can afford it, right? So

1191
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:26.220
actually, uh this person is again increasing status and

1192
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:32.439
attractiveness with status, right? So um appearance modification can

1193
01:16:32.609 --> 01:16:36.939
attract potential partners, it can increase or change uh

1194
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:40.620
perception of status of the person. It can also

1195
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:43.930
be rebels, right? Because of course, if I have

1196
01:16:43.939 --> 01:16:48.439
a better diamond than, than a Riel, then I'm

1197
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:52.149
better than uh than, than the other ones, right?

1198
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:55.029
And of course, uh when we look at uh

1199
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.990
for example, social markers, right? Sometimes we use uh

1200
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.069
appearance modification as a social marker. So for example,

1201
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.149
here in Brazil, people are crazy about football for

1202
01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.569
some reason. And as far as I know, it's

1203
01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.149
more or less the same here in Portugal. So

1204
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.370
we're not that, that different in that regard, at

1205
01:17:18.779 --> 01:17:18.890
least.

1206
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:23.649
Ok. And so, uh, so it makes all the

1207
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:27.180
difference if you are wearing a dress, uh, of

1208
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:31.020
a fan of one specific football team. Right? So

1209
01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:34.250
you show actually to whom you belong to and

1210
01:17:34.259 --> 01:17:37.229
also you show to whom you don't belong to.

1211
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:41.700
Right. So these are very important information, right? So

1212
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:45.439
sometimes it's good to, if your team loses, it's

1213
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:48.720
good to stay home locked and not showing your

1214
01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:52.060
dress and all because you might actually get some

1215
01:17:52.069 --> 01:17:55.279
negative reactions on the street. But that can actually

1216
01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:58.060
happen, happen in the whole society or a tribe,

1217
01:17:58.069 --> 01:18:01.450
for example. So people who are changing their appearance,

1218
01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:03.870
they can show look, I belong to this specific

1219
01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:06.540
tribe to this society and I don't belong to

1220
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:09.290
the other one which is very important. If you

1221
01:18:09.359 --> 01:18:12.109
um if you meet someone in a forest, for

1222
01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.910
example, then you would know quickly if it's an

1223
01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:17.419
enemy or a friend, right?

1224
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:20.240
I guess that a very good example of that

1225
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:24.370
would be tattoos, right? Tribal tattoos also because it's

1226
01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:27.560
a very big commitment to do a tattoo because

1227
01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:31.990
particularly in traditional societies, you can't really ever remove

1228
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.270
them.

1229
01:18:33.279 --> 01:18:36.120
That is true. That is true. Exactly. And it's

1230
01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:39.540
also not that easy, right? Of course, uh Nowadays

1231
01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:43.390
we do tattoos in tattoo, saloon, saloons where they

1232
01:18:43.399 --> 01:18:47.509
have all the medical and hygiene equipment but actually

1233
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.660
doing a tattoo in Sub Saharan Africa with some

1234
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:55.089
kind of needles from bones or something that is

1235
01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:00.145
not really hygiene. I can actually uh be a

1236
01:19:00.154 --> 01:19:05.225
handicap uh demonstration. Look, I have survived this terrible

1237
01:19:05.234 --> 01:19:08.595
procedure that made me sick for a long time,

1238
01:19:08.604 --> 01:19:12.095
but actually I survived it, right? My my immunity

1239
01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:15.595
is actually very good. So it can also actually

1240
01:19:15.604 --> 01:19:18.774
show the health status of the person, right? Not

1241
01:19:18.785 --> 01:19:23.180
only uh belonging to one specific tribe or society,

1242
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:26.600
but also actually uh also health of the of

1243
01:19:26.609 --> 01:19:28.209
the person and there

1244
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:32.100
when it comes to social identity, another example would

1245
01:19:32.109 --> 01:19:34.129
be body paintings,

1246
01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:39.140
right? Definitely, definitely, of course, body paintings are really

1247
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:42.850
archaic and very old and used probably in all

1248
01:19:42.859 --> 01:19:45.669
possible societies. Of course, you ask if there are

1249
01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.839
some gender differences. Nowadays, we see for example, that

1250
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:53.589
women usually care more about their appearance. Nowadays, in

1251
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.470
in modern western societies, they change more their appearance.

1252
01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:03.419
They also do do more um uh aesthetic treatments

1253
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:08.419
that might be more uh like um uh surgeries,

1254
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.120
for example, or, or this kind of more invasive

1255
01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.109
uh uh invasive treatments. Men are also increasing actually,

1256
01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.520
in these kind of behaviors, they are also heterosexual

1257
01:20:19.529 --> 01:20:24.580
and homosexual men. They are also um opting more

1258
01:20:24.589 --> 01:20:28.049
frequently actually for changing their appearance in more invasive

1259
01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.990
ways. But actually most people, they use less invasive

1260
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.529
and more accessible uh ways of of appearance. Change

1261
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.330
such as makeup and, or, or hairstyle, which is

1262
01:20:40.339 --> 01:20:43.490
actually easy and it's reversible, right? You can actually

1263
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.759
always change it. It's not like the tattoo, right?

1264
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:48.430
Which is uh more difficult to change or, or

1265
01:20:48.439 --> 01:20:53.810
impossible in some, in some societies. So, uh so

1266
01:20:53.819 --> 01:20:56.250
most people actually opt to do this kind of

1267
01:20:56.259 --> 01:21:02.359
uh changes. Um It's a question actually, if uh

1268
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:07.109
in the past, in some uh in some specific

1269
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:14.750
societies, men were actually more uh uh uh they

1270
01:21:14.759 --> 01:21:17.720
had a higher tendency actually to change their appearance

1271
01:21:17.729 --> 01:21:21.200
than, than women. It can actually happen. We don't

1272
01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:24.899
really know exactly. But it's possible because it also

1273
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:28.549
depends the, the, the the body modifications or appearance

1274
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.830
modifications, they also depend on the local values, right?

1275
01:21:32.839 --> 01:21:37.049
So uh if this given society achieve values, uh

1276
01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:41.819
physical appearance or some specific physical appearance, then people

1277
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.740
will have this tendency to change their appearance according

1278
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:48.000
to them uh to the values of the local

1279
01:21:48.009 --> 01:21:52.359
uh society. But if the uh if the more

1280
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:57.270
vize uh characteristic is, for example, social status or

1281
01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:01.509
wealth, then appearance doesn't matter that much, right? So

1282
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.899
a person doesn't need to change that much uh

1283
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:08.319
appearance. But it would uh the person would choose

1284
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:12.930
or, or um allocate energy into uh into status

1285
01:22:12.939 --> 01:22:15.890
or any other uh any other characteristic that is

1286
01:22:15.899 --> 01:22:19.359
actually valued by the, by the local society. But

1287
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:22.319
it was actually quite interesting because uh we found

1288
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:24.759
in one experiment that we did with makeup in

1289
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:30.879
women that, uh, women actually change their feelings about

1290
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:35.200
their themselves. They rate themselves differently differently when they

1291
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:39.100
are wearing no makeup versus when they are wearing

1292
01:22:39.109 --> 01:22:42.370
makeup. And we even tricked them. Actually, we did

1293
01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:46.640
a placebo in one experiment and after removing all

1294
01:22:46.649 --> 01:22:50.850
the makeup, they potentially had, we took pictures and

1295
01:22:50.859 --> 01:22:54.160
we, we, uh, filmed them and we asked them,

1296
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.640
how do you feel? How healthy you feel? How

1297
01:22:56.649 --> 01:22:59.430
do you look? Right? How would you describe yourself?

1298
01:22:59.439 --> 01:23:04.799
Right yourself right. Now, how healthy, how attractive, how

1299
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:08.870
uh what would be your age? Right? We were

1300
01:23:08.879 --> 01:23:15.330
even asking about their uh perceptual age and then

1301
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:21.680
our makeup artist, uh she pretended uh creating uh

1302
01:23:21.689 --> 01:23:24.979
or developing makeup. So actually she was only using

1303
01:23:25.129 --> 01:23:29.120
um some creams that don't have any, any color

1304
01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:32.479
and, and uh brushes that didn't have anything on

1305
01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:35.439
it. And so she was just actually pretending she

1306
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:38.609
was putting something on the faces of the women

1307
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:40.959
and then they looked into the mirror and they

1308
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:44.049
were like, oh, such a nice light makeup and

1309
01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:50.810
now I feel much better. They totally uh thought

1310
01:23:50.819 --> 01:23:54.819
actually they accepted that they were treated that they

1311
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:57.290
changed that their appearance changed. Look at it, how,

1312
01:23:57.299 --> 01:24:01.759
how our expectation is strong, right? We already think

1313
01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:05.049
we expect that our appearance would be better uh

1314
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:09.000
after uh after having makeup. And so even not

1315
01:24:09.009 --> 01:24:12.270
having any, we actually believe that we have and

1316
01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:16.979
that we improve. So their, um, self ratings actually

1317
01:24:17.169 --> 01:24:20.240
changed already in this stage when they didn't have

1318
01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:23.140
any makeup at all, but they believed they had.

1319
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.430
So they actually thought that they were already more

1320
01:24:25.439 --> 01:24:29.220
attractive and, uh, they had higher self self esteem

1321
01:24:29.589 --> 01:24:32.160
and they felt simply better. Of course, then it

1322
01:24:32.169 --> 01:24:36.040
changed again when the makeup artist, uh, used a

1323
01:24:36.049 --> 01:24:41.290
real makeup. So they felt still better afterwards. Right.

1324
01:24:41.379 --> 01:24:44.959
But still, uh, this self esteem and self feeling

1325
01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:48.729
actually is quite important, right? Obviously, people don't even

1326
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.890
need to use makeup to improve their own feeling,

1327
01:24:52.899 --> 01:24:55.160
right? But this is actually important when we think

1328
01:24:55.169 --> 01:24:59.370
from them perspective of attracting potential partners and and

1329
01:24:59.379 --> 01:25:04.799
desirability as a potential partner, actually improving uh proper

1330
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:08.660
self esteem and and self ratings can help actually

1331
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:13.129
much more than uh than any other behavior, right?

1332
01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.004
Because when the person actually has higher self esteem

1333
01:25:16.015 --> 01:25:20.365
and higher confidence than uh the first uh initial

1334
01:25:20.375 --> 01:25:24.814
contact with potential partners may actually start better, right?

1335
01:25:24.825 --> 01:25:28.194
Than when a person is too shy or, or

1336
01:25:28.205 --> 01:25:31.504
doesn't have the self self esteem or is underestimating

1337
01:25:31.515 --> 01:25:32.625
actually themselves,

1338
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:36.410
right? So let me ask you one last question.

1339
01:25:36.419 --> 01:25:41.089
Then when it comes to specifically people enhancing their

1340
01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:47.459
physical attractiveness, are there specific factors perhaps specific contexts

1341
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:52.529
where people uh feel more or less the need

1342
01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:53.410
to do that?

1343
01:25:55.279 --> 01:25:59.149
Yeah, that's a very good question actually. And intuitively,

1344
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.910
it looks like that, right? We should be actually

1345
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:09.100
changing our uh behavior according to the situation. And

1346
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:11.370
in many cases, we are, we are, for example,

1347
01:26:11.379 --> 01:26:14.689
modifying our voice, right? When we are talking with

1348
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:18.040
a child, uh we talk in a, in a

1349
01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:21.509
specific voice pitch, uh which is different than when

1350
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.060
we talk to, to our boss, for example. So

1351
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:29.759
we are changing our behaviors and intuitively, we also

1352
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:33.049
thought and we hypothesized that actually people would uh

1353
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.629
change their appearance or modify the, their appearance more

1354
01:26:37.819 --> 01:26:40.930
when they uh would meet, for example, their new

1355
01:26:40.939 --> 01:26:45.020
potential partner or if they were going to a

1356
01:26:45.029 --> 01:26:49.089
first date rather than going out with uh with

1357
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.129
friends of the same sex or doing exercises, right?

1358
01:26:54.399 --> 01:26:58.370
But actually, we haven't found any, any difference. We

1359
01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:03.169
haven't found any, any, any difference that people would

1360
01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.330
do according to, to a different situation. Actually, what

1361
01:27:07.339 --> 01:27:10.850
we found. And of course, this was uh specifically

1362
01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:14.169
uh makeup usage in women, right? Of course, we

1363
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.359
can do other kinds of modifications, which is possible,

1364
01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:21.020
but at least makeup in women actually didn't change

1365
01:27:21.029 --> 01:27:23.950
in different kinds of situations that we offer to

1366
01:27:23.959 --> 01:27:27.479
our respondents. And what we found was that women

1367
01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:33.640
either use more makeup or moderate makeup or none

1368
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:39.470
basically in all these situations. So, yeah, so that

1369
01:27:39.479 --> 01:27:43.600
probably explains why when I was going to, to

1370
01:27:43.609 --> 01:27:47.750
have a very small surgery and I went with

1371
01:27:47.759 --> 01:27:50.520
makeup and my husband was asking me, why are

1372
01:27:50.529 --> 01:27:53.330
you going to the hospital with makeup? And I

1373
01:27:53.339 --> 01:27:55.979
was like, oh, of course, I'm using makeup. Right.

1374
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:59.470
Are you crazy. How would I survive without makeup?

1375
01:27:59.479 --> 01:28:04.620
So, I think that actually, uh, appearance modification more

1376
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:08.720
associated with, uh, with personality. Right. It's a whole

1377
01:28:08.729 --> 01:28:13.240
package actually of personality and of, um, more stable

1378
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:16.640
tendencies that people have. Right. So it's not possible

1379
01:28:16.649 --> 01:28:18.459
to change it. Like now, I don't need it,

1380
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:20.770
so I won't do it. It's like changing sexual

1381
01:28:20.779 --> 01:28:24.620
orientation right now. You should be homosexual, for example,

1382
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:26.859
but it's impossible to change like that.

1383
01:28:27.419 --> 01:28:32.080
But what about specific contexts that might elicit higher

1384
01:28:32.089 --> 01:28:36.879
levels of intro sexual competition? Like for example, when

1385
01:28:37.009 --> 01:28:41.439
economic conditions are worse and people have to compete

1386
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:44.740
more for potential partners.

1387
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:48.359
There was some evidence from a few studies actually

1388
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:52.770
showing that uh when the economics was actually going

1389
01:28:52.779 --> 01:28:57.709
bad, going really broken uh individuals and specifically women,

1390
01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:02.060
they actually started to spend more on makeup and,

1391
01:29:02.069 --> 01:29:06.810
and lipstick and, and other other appearance modifications, which

1392
01:29:06.819 --> 01:29:10.350
is counterintuitive, right? Because we should be spending less,

1393
01:29:10.359 --> 01:29:12.850
we should have money, we should be spending less,

1394
01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:15.700
right? But actually, it's exactly in this kind of

1395
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:20.790
environment that people can increase their in intersexual competition

1396
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.669
and fight more for uh valuable uh long term

1397
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.620
partners, right? Who may actually invest especially um in

1398
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:34.290
circumstances of low uh economic development, right? So it

1399
01:29:34.299 --> 01:29:37.640
is actually possible that it works in one other

1400
01:29:37.649 --> 01:29:41.390
study. We also asked women uh about their makeup

1401
01:29:41.399 --> 01:29:45.890
frequency usage and we asked about their uh self

1402
01:29:45.899 --> 01:29:48.640
uh self rated mate value, right? How they feel

1403
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:53.000
themselves, how desirable they are as partners and about

1404
01:29:53.009 --> 01:29:56.040
intersexual competition. So we asked them about how you

1405
01:29:56.049 --> 01:30:02.234
feel when other uh woman is nearby. And um

1406
01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:05.754
and we actually found that women who use more

1407
01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:10.995
makeup, they have higher in intersexual competition scores. So

1408
01:30:11.004 --> 01:30:13.314
it seems and they also have higher mate value.

1409
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:17.729
So it, right, so it was correlated with both

1410
01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:20.029
of these strategies. So they actually think that they

1411
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.500
are more valuable but they also want to be

1412
01:30:22.509 --> 01:30:23.169
durable.

1413
01:30:24.729 --> 01:30:27.390
I I mean, this is very interesting just the

1414
01:30:27.399 --> 01:30:31.600
other day, I was watching a documentary from Brazil.

1415
01:30:31.609 --> 01:30:34.310
I think it was in the favela in Rio

1416
01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:37.319
de Janeiro. And uh they were showing they were

1417
01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:40.390
talking with a few poor people there and one

1418
01:30:40.399 --> 01:30:44.779
of them was a woman who basically did the

1419
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:48.379
nails and makeup for other women and she was

1420
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:51.700
very poor, but she just went out on the

1421
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:55.049
street doing those kinds of services for other women.

1422
01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.319
And at a certain point and this is the

1423
01:30:57.330 --> 01:31:00.930
most interesting part. She said that she didn't think

1424
01:31:00.939 --> 01:31:03.919
she would ever run out of costumers even though

1425
01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:06.410
everyone there was poor. So

1426
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:07.490
that's just

1427
01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.549
that's anecdotal evidence, that's anecdotal evidence. But it's a

1428
01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.290
very interesting thing. So

1429
01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.129
yeah, this is very interesting. But when you think

1430
01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.629
about it, makeup and nails and these things, they

1431
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.390
are relatively cheap, right? So actually even poor people

1432
01:31:23.399 --> 01:31:26.919
can afford them. But they, they make a big

1433
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:31.589
difference, right? They are accessible but they really make

1434
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.569
a huge difference and there are lots of actually

1435
01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:38.319
studies and even experiments or uh people simply taking

1436
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:41.859
pictures before and after using makeup and sometimes you

1437
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:45.299
wouldn't recognize the person at all. It really makes

1438
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:49.149
a huge difference. So, yeah, so this is interesting,

1439
01:31:49.319 --> 01:31:52.299
but of course, so this actually doesn't show the

1440
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:55.366
status, right? You don't know if the person actually

1441
01:31:55.375 --> 01:32:01.436
used a very expensive lipstick like for $200 or

1442
01:32:01.445 --> 01:32:04.145
a very cheap one for like $1 or something

1443
01:32:04.155 --> 01:32:07.576
because the effect is basically the same, right? There

1444
01:32:07.585 --> 01:32:10.025
is not, not a big difference. So this is

1445
01:32:10.036 --> 01:32:14.625
not really a status uh exhibition, right? But it's

1446
01:32:14.636 --> 01:32:16.855
but but what it does is really the change

1447
01:32:16.866 --> 01:32:20.655
in the appearance and this can be completely decisive

1448
01:32:20.666 --> 01:32:23.602
actually, especially in the lives of poor people. Imagine

1449
01:32:23.611 --> 01:32:26.381
that the poor girl from a favela uh here

1450
01:32:26.392 --> 01:32:31.321
in Brazil actually changes her appearance and or modifies,

1451
01:32:31.332 --> 01:32:34.102
right? It's not a change of appearance. She modifies,

1452
01:32:34.111 --> 01:32:38.171
she adjusts an appearance. So she's even more beautiful,

1453
01:32:38.182 --> 01:32:40.452
for example, than she was and she can afford

1454
01:32:40.461 --> 01:32:45.441
to attract and richer person, for example. So she

1455
01:32:45.452 --> 01:32:48.859
can actually get out of the favela, she can

1456
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:52.870
change her life completely by using a little bit

1457
01:32:52.879 --> 01:32:56.839
of lipstick or or or other, right? So this

1458
01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:59.140
is actually from the evolutionary point of view, it's

1459
01:32:59.149 --> 01:33:03.120
not only vulture and bees who are using perfumes

1460
01:33:03.129 --> 01:33:07.009
from different from different flowers, but also humans who

1461
01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.209
are really modifying their appearance and it can change

1462
01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:14.459
completely their life outcome, right? The reproductive outcome and,

1463
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:16.930
and social in general. So, yeah,

1464
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:20.919
so let's wrap up the interview here. But we

1465
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:23.799
definitely have to have more talks on the show

1466
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:27.060
because there's many more things here that uh I

1467
01:33:27.069 --> 01:33:29.370
really wanted to ask you. But due to the

1468
01:33:29.379 --> 01:33:32.330
time limit, I mean, I had to restrain myself

1469
01:33:32.339 --> 01:33:35.919
here. But uh if people are interested, where can

1470
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:38.410
they find you and your work on the internet?

1471
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:43.200
Yeah, they can find me. Now, my students actually,

1472
01:33:43.209 --> 01:33:46.009
they came with a fantastic idea that we should

1473
01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:50.819
have an Instagram and Facebook and websites. So I

1474
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:53.810
told them to do it and they really did.

1475
01:33:53.979 --> 01:33:57.370
So now you can see uh now you can

1476
01:33:57.379 --> 01:34:02.339
find actually behavior evolution and sexuality lab uh on

1477
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:06.410
Facebook and on Instagram. And there is also a

1478
01:34:06.419 --> 01:34:10.169
preliminary version of our website and of course, uh

1479
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:15.259
my or our uh publications are all on, on

1480
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:19.439
Research Gate and Google scholar and there is lots

1481
01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:22.959
of it. So you can find us finally. And

1482
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:26.299
if you want to collaborate, we are here, the

1483
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:30.279
land is full, people are interested and doing research

1484
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:31.770
in Brazil is fantastic.

1485
01:34:32.589 --> 01:34:35.979
Great. So look, thank you so much again for

1486
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:38.879
taking the time to do this and I really

1487
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:41.589
loved our conversation. So thank you so much. Thank

1488
01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.729
