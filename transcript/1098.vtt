00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.210
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.689
today I'm joined by Doctor Karen Stolzno. She's a

4
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.890
researcher at Griffith University and the host of Monster

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.569
Talk, an award-winning science-based podcast. And today, we're talking

6
00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:21.379
about her latest book, B, uh, The Journey of

7
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.370
the World. So Karen, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.209
a pleasure to

9
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:27.280
everyone. Thank you so much. It's good to be

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.600
here.

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.319
So, since we're going to talk about the history,

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.310
the sort of journey of the word bitch, as

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.799
you suggest in the title of your book, where

14
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.599
does it come from? I mean, what are its

15
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.020
origins? Uh,

16
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.360
WELL, it's really complicated. I think a lot of

17
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.560
people would think, oh, the word has just been

18
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.830
around for 50 years, 100 years that it's got

19
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.200
a short history, but it has a very long

20
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.509
history. It's been around for over 1000 years, and

21
00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:01.569
it goes back to Old English, the version that,

22
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.839
uh, that we're familiar with today, spelling was a

23
00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:08.470
little bit different, pronunciation was a bit different, but

24
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.239
the, the word and its original meaning, being a

25
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.559
female dog, goes back at least 1000 years. So

26
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.133
that's, we've traced. The history of the word, looking

27
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.843
at old documents. So this goes back to, uh,

28
00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:27.252
medical documents where there were, uh, people who were

29
00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:30.212
referring to bitches in the sense of a female

30
00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:34.803
dog and using their milk or, uh, using their

31
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:40.733
urine to treat various disorders like warts and babies'

32
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.292
teething. So, uh, that, those are the earliest references

33
00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:47.106
that we have. So we can Probably say that

34
00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.426
if those are the earliest references that we have

35
00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:53.725
in writing, it probably goes back even further. And

36
00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:56.746
English is a Germanic language and it seems like

37
00:01:56.746 --> 00:02:00.335
there might be versions of the word too, uh,

38
00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:03.585
in, in other languages that we might have, uh,

39
00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:06.706
that might be cognates or would be cognates to

40
00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:09.785
the, the word bitch, meaning that they're related to

41
00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:12.225
by that word. So it's a, a very old

42
00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:13.395
word surprisingly.

43
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.389
But then the earliest meaning we know of it

44
00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.649
is of female dog. Is that

45
00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.789
it? Yes, so that's the, uh, I guess that

46
00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.429
the literal meaning, that was the, the earliest and

47
00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.630
first meaning is a female dog. So all the

48
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.449
other myriad meanings that we have today have really

49
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.750
spawned from that.

50
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.139
Mhm. And do you, do we know in any

51
00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.380
way if the pronunciation of bit changed over time?

52
00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.490
And I mean, when we're looking through it across

53
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.279
uh written documents, is it possible for us to

54
00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.330
retrieve in any way how the word was pronounced?

55
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.770
Well, it, it is difficult to know for sure

56
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.410
because we don't have. The internet like we have

57
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.720
today, we don't have recordings of people using the

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.960
word. All that we have are these written examples.

59
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.009
So, uh, but a lot of work has been

60
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.529
done into phonology and into phonetics of how people

61
00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.050
would have pronounced middle English and how they would

62
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.419
have pronounced Old English. So really the best. Guess

63
00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.539
is that it would have been pronounced as it

64
00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.839
would have been spelled originally as B I C

65
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.820
C E and it would have been pronounced something

66
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.360
along the lines of bitche. But I mean it

67
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720
doesn't end there, there are just lots of different

68
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.720
spellings, uh, too many to list here, but different

69
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.119
ones for different variations of English too. So in

70
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.559
Scottish English, there were different spellings and slightly different

71
00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:55.050
pronunciations and uh over time, the word evolved like

72
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.800
language does. So it was probably, uh, I can't

73
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.589
remember exactly. Uh, BUT it would have been around

74
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.759
the, probably Middle English that the word started to

75
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.199
change its, uh, orthography, which is its spelling, to

76
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.529
look more familiar to the way that we spell

77
00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.880
it today. But of course, even nowadays, uh, you

78
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.678
could say that the, the spelling of the word

79
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.880
is standardized, but not really. We have Bish and

80
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.709
we have all different kinds of biznatch, different, uh,

81
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.429
variations of the word today, slang variants of the

82
00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:30.459
word. And A lot of those are spelled a

83
00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.779
little bit differently, and, uh, those can represent different

84
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.190
dialects, different social dialects or regional dialects. So the

85
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.029
word is continuing to evolve, and I think that's

86
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.290
the key for why the word's still around today.

87
00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.029
It's changed shape and conformed so that it's become

88
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.880
modernized and it's still a very useful word.

89
00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.459
Mhm. Yeah, and we're also going to talk about

90
00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.859
some of the ways that the meanings of the

91
00:04:56.859 --> 00:05:00.450
word have changed over time. But, I mean, apart

92
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.609
from the fact that at least originally and even

93
00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.570
nowadays, I imagine that some people still use the

94
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.920
word that way. But apart from originally the meaning

95
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.970
being female dog, in what ways does bitch relate

96
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.290
to dog? And tell us about using bitch and

97
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.170
dog as insults.

98
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.989
Yeah. Oh, I mean, there's a lot to unpack

99
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:30.709
there because animal insults are, uh, animal metaphors used

100
00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.700
as insults are among the earliest insults that we

101
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.459
have examples of. So we can go back to

102
00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:39.829
ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and dog was being

103
00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:41.989
used as an insult then. And it was being

104
00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:44.829
used not only for women, but it was being

105
00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:48.394
used for Men as well. And over time, it's

106
00:05:48.394 --> 00:05:51.595
had slightly different meanings. Usually for a woman, if

107
00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.755
we go back that far, it might refer to

108
00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:58.515
a woman who was uh disloyal. So we have

109
00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:03.795
those kinds of metaphorical associations with dogs as being

110
00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:05.714
loyal, but a woman who was a dog was

111
00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:09.739
disloyal, and it might have A reference to a

112
00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:14.170
man's poor character, rather than necessarily being related to,

113
00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:17.429
uh, the other aspects of a dog. So, the,

114
00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:20.269
the different use of dog was really, I guess,

115
00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.660
changed in some ways, but stayed the same too.

116
00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.130
But it is totally one of the, the earliest

117
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.010
insults that, uh, we can find. And Bitch is

118
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.720
I guess a more specific version of that, referring

119
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.440
to specifically a uh a female dog and as

120
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.649
you said, the word isn't, I think that when

121
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.690
people think about the word today, they don't immediately

122
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.649
think of a dog, a female dog, unless it's

123
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.440
within that context. If you're, you've taken your dog,

124
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.089
your female dog, to the vet and you hear

125
00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.089
that term, I think even people would wince at

126
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:55.959
that, and there are a lot of uses on,

127
00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.489
uh, television where that's used for kind of comedic

128
00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:04.309
effect, that double entend that bitch can mean a

129
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.386
female dog. Also be an insult for a woman

130
00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:10.377
or for a man. So, uh, you have these

131
00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:12.467
kind of competing uses, and I think that, uh,

132
00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.457
when we, we hear a use, we need to

133
00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:17.736
figure out the context. Is this an insult? Uh,

134
00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:19.856
WHAT exactly does this mean? Is this referring to

135
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:23.256
a dog? But it's a very specialized term in

136
00:07:23.256 --> 00:07:26.326
its, uh, literal sense, but in its metaphorical sense,

137
00:07:26.536 --> 00:07:29.747
it can really mean so many different things. But,

138
00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:32.584
uh, yeah, dog. IS still around as an insult.

139
00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.674
Bitch is still around as an insult, and I

140
00:07:35.674 --> 00:07:37.984
think will continue to be so. But a lot

141
00:07:37.984 --> 00:07:41.223
of other insults have, uh, come about over the

142
00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:43.973
centuries, and many of them have just died out.

143
00:07:44.144 --> 00:07:46.854
And that that's what tends to happen with slang.

144
00:07:47.023 --> 00:07:50.623
Slang can be very ephemeral. It's not always long-lasting.

145
00:07:50.864 --> 00:07:52.593
A lot of words don't make it to the

146
00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:55.014
dictionary. They might be around for a short period

147
00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:57.670
of time. And then they disappear. But I think

148
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.580
nowadays with the advent of the internet and globalization,

149
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.430
a lot of these words we can trace and

150
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.110
they might stick around a lot longer, they might

151
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.031
diffuse, that is to spread more across certain generations

152
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:14.911
and groups of society. So that's what keeps these

153
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:19.210
words alive. But yeah, certainly these are old words

154
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.311
and they're gonna stick around.

155
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.899
Uh, ORIGINALLY did bitch also mean slut.

156
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.179
Ah, well, that's interesting, uh, it's an interesting question

157
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.799
because an earlier use of the word bitch was

158
00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.729
to refer to a whore, so a woman who

159
00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:44.989
was a prostitute, uh, and Slut. So bitch was

160
00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:47.390
used in the way that we use slut today.

161
00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:50.260
So this is going back hundreds of years ago,

162
00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:53.390
and, uh, bitch would have been used to, to

163
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.390
mean a woman who was promiscuous. So we tend

164
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.059
to think of the word slut as, oh, well,

165
00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:02.030
it would be contemporaneous with the, the word bitch,

166
00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:05.109
which it was for maybe about 500 years or

167
00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:07.549
a little bit longer. But slut had a very

168
00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:11.030
different meaning going back in time. So, going back

169
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.424
hundreds of years. We find examples of it in

170
00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:18.385
various books. Samuel Peep's diary, he talks about a

171
00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:21.265
very pleasing slut that that he and his wife

172
00:09:21.265 --> 00:09:23.905
have, but he's talking about a servant girl. So

173
00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:28.294
he's not talking about, uh, a, a promiscuous woman,

174
00:09:28.585 --> 00:09:31.974
uh, that they've held hostage there, uh, using for

175
00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:35.565
sexual purposes. He's talking about a servant girl. Then

176
00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:38.585
later, a lot of what we see this with

177
00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:42.260
a lot of other words too. I like nave

178
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.049
for a young boy, those words often referred to

179
00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:50.450
the, Lower socioeconomic groups of people, so people who

180
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.049
worked in houses, in big households, and, and did

181
00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:57.409
the lowly chores around the house. And so a

182
00:09:57.409 --> 00:10:01.090
lot of those terms became derogatory, so that's pegeration,

183
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.919
I think we'll probably get into that soon too,

184
00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:06.510
but where words become bad over time. And that's

185
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.690
really what happened to the word slut. So originally

186
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.049
it just meant a servant girl, a wench, then

187
00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:16.849
it came to mean a woman who was Slovenly

188
00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:20.030
in her dress. So we see other references of,

189
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.289
uh, men being referred to as sluts. And it

190
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.320
was really just someone who was sloppy. And, uh,

191
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.169
the, the funny thing is that slut didn't really

192
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.130
change in meaning to the, the use that we

193
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.450
currently have today, the most, uh, kind of salient

194
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.169
use today of a promiscuous woman. My father, who

195
00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:40.250
passed a number of years ago, when I was

196
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.609
young, he would refer to a woman, uh, as

197
00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.489
a slut if she was dressed in a sloppy

198
00:10:45.489 --> 00:10:48.033
manner. And I said, Dad, you can't say that

199
00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:50.002
anymore. We don't, that's not what the word means

200
00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:53.492
anymore. But really going back to, uh, the 60s

201
00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:56.893
is around the time where it's attracted the, the

202
00:10:56.893 --> 00:10:59.372
current meaning that it has of, of being a

203
00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:02.013
promiscuous woman or a woman who's accused of being

204
00:11:02.013 --> 00:11:05.773
promiscuous. It's certainly used in regards to men as

205
00:11:05.773 --> 00:11:07.765
well, but for men, it's It's typically more of

206
00:11:07.765 --> 00:11:09.726
a compliment to call a man a slut than

207
00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:13.526
a woman, because it's implying that you're, you sleep

208
00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:16.556
around, uh, or that it's suspected that you do,

209
00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.765
you're a wanton woman, lascivious. It's got a lot

210
00:11:19.765 --> 00:11:23.286
of negative connotations today. But, uh, going back hundreds

211
00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:26.526
of years ago, it was just a very everyday

212
00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:29.486
term for, for a woman who worked in a

213
00:11:29.486 --> 00:11:30.366
certain industry.

214
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.270
Mhm. Right. So when did bitch develop the meaning

215
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.169
of unpleasant woman?

216
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.409
Well, that's very interesting because there are lots of

217
00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:48.219
different theories. Some people think it's maybe around 1400,

218
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.799
so closer to Middle English, that the word became

219
00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.640
an insult for women. But we do have evidence

220
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.570
going back to, uh, written documents, where it appears

221
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.539
that bitch was being used. As an insult for

222
00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:06.400
women, more in that sense of a slut, modern

223
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.820
day slut or a modern day whore, uh, going

224
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.690
back probably as early as those earliest references to

225
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.479
female dogs. So, we could say, maybe, definitely by

226
00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:22.059
the 1400s that, uh, bitch was being used in

227
00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:24.799
that way as an insult for women. Uh, BUT

228
00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:28.200
possibly hundreds of years earlier. So again, all we

229
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.159
can go by are those, uh, the records that

230
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:34.520
we have, the existing artifacts that show us the

231
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.479
progression of the meaning of the word, but it

232
00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:39.520
does seem like as long as the word has

233
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.359
been around, it's been, it's had that literal meaning

234
00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:45.719
for a female dog, but also that metaphorical or

235
00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:48.919
figurative meaning for uh as an insult for a

236
00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.200
woman. And for a man too, it seems like

237
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.080
that could go back as early as that uh

238
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.650
the the reference to women. Mhm.

239
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.640
So by studying and understanding how over time a

240
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.130
word like be, uh, changed meaning, acquired new meanings,

241
00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:12.169
and kept some of its meanings. I mean, by

242
00:13:12.169 --> 00:13:15.489
studying this sort of history, what can we learn

243
00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:20.643
about these kinds of phenomenon? Linguistic phenomena related to

244
00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:23.632
how the meaning of words change over time. Do

245
00:13:23.632 --> 00:13:27.252
you think that bitch is a particularly good illustrative

246
00:13:27.252 --> 00:13:29.043
example of those kinds of phenomena?

247
00:13:29.632 --> 00:13:32.302
Oh, I think it really is an excellent example

248
00:13:32.302 --> 00:13:36.703
of what linguists would call semantic change. So that

249
00:13:36.703 --> 00:13:39.606
is talking about meaning in. Words and how that

250
00:13:39.606 --> 00:13:42.226
changes over time. So, lots of different things can

251
00:13:42.226 --> 00:13:45.926
happen to words. We're talking about slang being ephemeral

252
00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:49.036
a little while ago, and so some words can

253
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:52.125
come into our language and then just disappear. They

254
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.726
might go unrecorded. It might be a small amount

255
00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:56.926
of people who use them and then they die

256
00:13:56.926 --> 00:14:00.606
out. And then other words can stick around for

257
00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.926
a very long period of time, like, bitch. Sometimes

258
00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:09.369
they can retain their Existing or original meaning, but

259
00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:11.609
lots of things can can really happen and it's

260
00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:15.969
unpredictable. Language is like a runaway train in many

261
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:17.690
ways. We just can't be sure what's going to

262
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.650
happen with particular words, but they can acquire negative

263
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.479
connotations, and that was the term I used earlier,

264
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:29.330
peeration. So that means when a word, it might

265
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.820
have a neutral meaning, so in this case, a

266
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.359
female dog. For bitch. And then over time, it

267
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:40.080
attracts these negative connotations and a negative meaning. Words

268
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.520
can also, uh, undergo a process called amelioration, which

269
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.200
is where they improve in meaning. And that is

270
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.229
less common. We don't see that happening as much,

271
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.479
but the interesting thing is with bitch, that it

272
00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:56.320
has undergone all of these processes. So not only

273
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.250
has the word stuck around, it's evolved. In meaning,

274
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.859
it has developed negative connotations and become an insult

275
00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:07.489
for women and for men, and it's also acquired

276
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:11.500
positive connotations. So it can be used in positive

277
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.500
ways today amongst friends and used in a, as

278
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.039
a compliment to women or to men. Depending on

279
00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.140
the the group that it's used in. So it's

280
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.549
just a really interesting example. And uh the fact

281
00:15:26.549 --> 00:15:31.020
that the original meaning has stayed around concurrently is

282
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.539
interesting too. So we have all of these competing

283
00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:36.539
meanings that can get very confusing as to what

284
00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:37.890
bitch means.

285
00:15:39.219 --> 00:15:43.659
Right. But I mean, you mentioned pegerration, amelioration. Do

286
00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:47.309
we have a good understanding of how words go

287
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:51.669
through these processes and how they acquire or change

288
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:55.950
meanings over time? I mean, do we understand or

289
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.750
have a good understanding of the factors that play

290
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.909
a role, a role here?

291
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.969
Well, I think it really is gonna depend on

292
00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:05.820
the words. So for I talk about bitch, the

293
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.739
journey of a word, uh, another iteration of the

294
00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:10.760
name is the story of a word, and I

295
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.049
think that each word really has its own story,

296
00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:17.719
has its own journey, and again, Some words can

297
00:16:17.719 --> 00:16:21.719
die out, some words can uh can continue to

298
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:25.359
stick around and original meanings might coexist with, with

299
00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:28.190
different meanings. So words are a lot like humans

300
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.520
in the way that they evolve, and a lot

301
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.440
of people going back to, to um uh Darwin

302
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.200
have written about the evolution of language being comparable

303
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.200
to the evolution of humans and other creatures. And

304
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.200
uh so um with regards to um What you're

305
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.179
talking about with pegeration uh and with amelioration. It's

306
00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.719
just going to depend on, I think the, the

307
00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:55.880
society and the culture of the time. So I

308
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.239
think that words really do, especially nouns, not so

309
00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:04.358
much grammar, but, uh, you know, content words, nouns

310
00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:08.199
are going to, to reflect our attitudes and our

311
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:11.400
values and our beliefs of the day. So I

312
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.760
think that that's what's Really happened with bitch. Uh,

313
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.209
WE had that original meaning, and then we have

314
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.699
a meaning that really reflects morals and values about

315
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:24.780
women and the, the behavior of women, and morals

316
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.098
and values and attitudes towards men and the way

317
00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:32.459
that men behave. So it's, uh, your words are

318
00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:34.609
really going to be, I guess, a kind of

319
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:39.239
time machine that's Tell us about, uh, give us

320
00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:42.979
a snapshot or a window into a particular time

321
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.160
and tell us, well, how did people think? How

322
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.280
did they, they see other people, how did they

323
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.359
see themselves, uh, what factors were at play, but

324
00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:55.359
yeah, it's really a, a sociocultural phenomenon, um, but

325
00:17:55.359 --> 00:17:57.949
it's still something that's unpredictable.

326
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.160
So, in the book, you also talk about the

327
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.839
feminist bitch. So what does it mean and does

328
00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:08.900
it have a positive connotation there?

329
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.199
So, it absolutely does, and again within its own

330
00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:16.930
context. So this is going back to the 1960s

331
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.439
and the 1970s when we have various waves of

332
00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:24.810
feminism in history. And so we're talking about maybe

333
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.760
the second wave of feminism where uh women started

334
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:32.189
looking at language and asking a lot of questions

335
00:18:32.189 --> 00:18:38.180
about uh sexism that was in language. And so

336
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.790
the the issue of bitch came up, uh, and

337
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.719
there's a, a, an activist, feminist activist called Jorene

338
00:18:45.719 --> 00:18:50.050
who penned a manifesto called the bitch manifesto. And

339
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.810
that is, uh, basically a, a very long and

340
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.729
very interesting look at the word bitch and the

341
00:18:56.729 --> 00:18:58.959
way that it's been used and how it's been

342
00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:04.010
leveraged negatively towards women. But, uh, in, in Doreen's

343
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.459
opinion, and this, this was kind of a, I

344
00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:09.530
guess a um a badge of honor really for

345
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.569
the term bitch and it and showed the evolution

346
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.369
of the word, but she said, well, this word

347
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:19.119
really means a powerful woman, this is an empowering.

348
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.099
Word. This is a word that uh reflects a

349
00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:26.099
woman who is, is powerful and she's strong and

350
00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:31.310
she's ambitious, and uh she's competitive, and she really

351
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.699
made some interesting observations too that when a lot

352
00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:36.699
of these descriptors are used in with regards to

353
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:39.915
men, that they're compliments. Uh, BUT if they're used

354
00:19:39.915 --> 00:19:44.015
towards women, then she's seen as being unfeminine. She's

355
00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:48.954
seen instead of being docile and quiet and keeping

356
00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:53.055
her place in society, that she's being outspoken. And

357
00:19:53.055 --> 00:19:54.954
you know, we see that a lot today in

358
00:19:54.954 --> 00:19:57.275
the way that the word is used in politics

359
00:19:57.275 --> 00:20:02.035
too. It's used against women in politics, and uh

360
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.000
so it's really a matter of women being Uh,

361
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.930
criticized for behaving in the ways that that men

362
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.489
do, but that was really a turning point for

363
00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:13.369
the word bitch, and, uh, since that time we've

364
00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:16.540
had a lot of women in positions of power,

365
00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:24.219
so lawyers and politicians and uh musicians, Writers, feminists,

366
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.579
activists of all kinds, coming out and saying, Well,

367
00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:30.689
I am a bitch. I identify as being a

368
00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:34.310
bitch. So it's become this self-identifying label, uh, for

369
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.989
a woman who, who sees herself and is seen

370
00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:40.829
as being strong and powerful. So it's an empowering

371
00:20:40.829 --> 00:20:43.479
term. That was, that was the turning point. We,

372
00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:46.619
we do have some examples too, of, uh, Ernest

373
00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:49.380
Hemingway, who used the term in a more positive

374
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.859
way too. He would use the word bitch to

375
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:54.859
refer to women who, uh, were powerful and strong

376
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:58.390
and sexy and had grits. So he was using

377
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.890
it in a complementary way, but still being used

378
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.819
by a man, uh, in that context, it can

379
00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:09.449
be dehumanizing. But that was Really where the at

380
00:21:09.449 --> 00:21:12.000
a point where the word was shifting in meaning,

381
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.680
and it is just again spawned so many different

382
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.880
uh more positive uses of the word since that

383
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.189
time.

384
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.199
But this is very interesting because isn't it the

385
00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:25.750
case that the word bitch tended to be used,

386
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.719
uh tended to be used and perhaps it's still

387
00:21:28.719 --> 00:21:31.359
used, I'm not sure, as a, also as a

388
00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.959
pejorative against feminists.

389
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.520
Yes. So that's a good point as well. Uh,

390
00:21:37.689 --> 00:21:39.880
WE, we don't have too much evidence of that,

391
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.930
but if we go back to the first wave

392
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.420
of feminism, we find some examples of women who

393
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.689
were advocates, who were early feminists, they wouldn't have

394
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:53.130
described themselves that way. That's a more recent term.

395
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:57.030
Uh, WOMANIST is another term as well. And, uh,

396
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.359
those were really used as insults around the same

397
00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:03.520
time. So when we had, uh, the, the fight

398
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.359
for women's right to vote, we have some examples

399
00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:10.839
of women being labeled as as bitches. But really

400
00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:14.160
they were seen, I think, as being, again, unfeminine.

401
00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:17.469
They were being, they were seen as masculine because

402
00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.319
they were doing the kinds of things that men

403
00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:24.160
would do, protesting. Uh, AND fighting for their rights.

404
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:27.349
And, uh, so they were really looked down upon

405
00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:31.630
and, and, uh, endured a lot of criticism and

406
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.989
being put into jail and having eggs thrown at

407
00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:37.150
them and rotten fish and all kinds of terrible

408
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.300
things with, and they were just fighting for equality.

409
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.859
But, yeah, we, we do have some examples there

410
00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:46.589
and, and I think that that's um They're the

411
00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:49.790
early days of this word really reaching a turning

412
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.180
point of becoming uh I have being identified with

413
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:54.949
feminists.

414
00:22:55.959 --> 00:23:00.400
Mhm. So the word also ties in a way

415
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.479
to the history and issues surrounding feminism.

416
00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:09.140
Right. Absolutely, yeah, I think that, uh, again, to

417
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.560
look at a word like uh feminist, uh or

418
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.400
a word like womanist, those were being seen as

419
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.699
negative in the early days, uh, and they, there,

420
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.829
there are still negative associations with those words today.

421
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.650
Uh, BUT I think that um bitch was, was

422
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.209
within that same repertoire and vocabulary of words that

423
00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:32.869
were um held against women who fought for equality

424
00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.260
and rights, equal rights.

425
00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:40.699
And the word feminist itself uh sometimes is also

426
00:23:40.699 --> 00:23:42.770
used as a pejorative.

427
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.979
Absolutely, yeah, I think a lot of uh people

428
00:23:45.979 --> 00:23:47.969
have criticized the use of the word today and,

429
00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:51.369
and women that we would see as being feminists

430
00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.300
would reject the word and say, well, I'm not

431
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.420
a feminist, so we, we see that going back

432
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.310
to, I think, uh, Virginia Woolf. Uh, AND, uh,

433
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.000
the more recent uh feminists like I think Gloria

434
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.250
Steinem, Jermaine Greer, so others rejected the word. Uh,

435
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.640
Simone de Beauvier as well, rejected the word originally

436
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.599
and said, Well, I, I'm not a feminist, because

437
00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:17.079
the word had such negative connotations. And then it

438
00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:21.680
was around the 1970s that the word started acquiring

439
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.560
more of a sense of empowerment and women who

440
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.130
were Advocating for themselves and fighting for their own

441
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.089
rights, but again, even to this day, I think

442
00:24:31.089 --> 00:24:33.089
Beyonce at one point said, oh I'm not a

443
00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:36.400
feminist, That's a bad word. We need a new

444
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.069
word, bootylicious, I think is what she came up

445
00:24:39.069 --> 00:24:42.719
with. But, uh, yeah, there's still a lot of

446
00:24:42.719 --> 00:24:45.930
negativity around the word, and I think, uh, it's

447
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.910
a turnoff for, for some people, but really, feminism

448
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:56.829
is about elevating women and, uh, bringing equality into

449
00:24:56.829 --> 00:25:01.430
society for all people. Uh, AND so it's ultimately

450
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.229
a good thing, but just the way that it's

451
00:25:03.229 --> 00:25:06.510
wielded as an insult or wielded to, to mean

452
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.859
a woman who's difficult, a woman who is, uh,

453
00:25:10.349 --> 00:25:12.790
behaves like a man, all, all of these negative

454
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:17.949
associations, uh, are really coexisting with the positive senses

455
00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:20.770
of the word. And that's another process we could

456
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.140
talk about too, which is, um, the euphemism treadmill,

457
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.640
which is where we have Uh, words in the

458
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.239
language that have become insults, have negative connotations, they

459
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:36.079
might be stigmatized in some way, and so new

460
00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:39.680
words are then introduced to replace those words, but

461
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.079
then the same thing happens to them too. So

462
00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:45.479
we see that a lot with uh terms regarding

463
00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:50.589
disease or disability that uh words will be changed

464
00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:54.040
and new words introduced uh to, to hopefully bring

465
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.290
in more positive connotations, but then They, they go

466
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.010
undergo that process of pegeration again and uh and

467
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.369
it just keeps happening and it's a kind of

468
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:06.479
vicious cycle, I guess, of language.

469
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:09.699
Mhm, uh, I, I mean by that, do you

470
00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:14.060
mean words that we use to refer to diseases?

471
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.410
To, yeah, some diseases uh that are stigmatized, uh,

472
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.890
so certainly when it comes to words, um, within

473
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.849
the lexicon of mental illness, I think a good

474
00:26:25.849 --> 00:26:29.150
example too is a word like toilet. Nowadays people

475
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.109
will refer to uh restroom or bathroom, and those

476
00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:36.310
are really euphemisms, uh, and we've got earlier terms

477
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.280
for toilet like a, you know, a water closet

478
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.709
or a privy, a latrine, so all of these

479
00:26:42.709 --> 00:26:45.589
different words for something that's embarrassing, you know, it's

480
00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:48.020
associated with human waste and so people don't want

481
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.189
to talk about these topics. So they come up

482
00:26:51.189 --> 00:26:55.060
with euphemistic terms to refer to the toilet and

483
00:26:55.109 --> 00:26:57.780
And then that keeps getting replaced because no one

484
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.099
wants to use the word, and it's embarrassing to

485
00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:02.949
refer to in society. And so that's really why

486
00:27:02.949 --> 00:27:06.880
we have the words, uh, restroom today, or powder

487
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.619
room for ladies, uh, all those other kinds of

488
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:14.260
terms that, um, things that, that we find repulsive

489
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.140
or disgusting or embarrassing, humiliating, uh, that we just

490
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.140
don't want to talk about. And so we come

491
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.609
up with euphemisms, and then They acquire the same

492
00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.020
negative connotations and get replaced, so it keeps going

493
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.609
and going.

494
00:27:29.579 --> 00:27:33.520
But because of all this negativity that still surrounds

495
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.109
the word bitch, uh, I mean, the common ways

496
00:27:37.109 --> 00:27:41.160
that people typically use the word in society in

497
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.959
general, do you think that even with some of

498
00:27:44.959 --> 00:27:48.880
the more positive connotations that feminists were able to

499
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.655
attribute to it, uh, at The end of the

500
00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:54.614
day, uh, they were, do you think they were

501
00:27:54.614 --> 00:27:57.944
able to uh to reclaim the world or

502
00:27:57.944 --> 00:28:00.614
not? Yeah, and then that's something I go into

503
00:28:00.614 --> 00:28:02.844
a lot, uh, in the book because it's really

504
00:28:02.844 --> 00:28:07.505
an open-ended question, uh, with an open-ended outcome. I

505
00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:10.805
think to some extent the word has been reclaimed

506
00:28:11.094 --> 00:28:17.010
and uh Has been appropriated and developed positive connotations

507
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.890
in, and I think it's something that we need

508
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.239
to again analyze context. How is it being used?

509
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.329
Who is it being used by, how is the

510
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:28.689
word being received? So I think you've got all

511
00:28:28.689 --> 00:28:33.849
different kinds of uh uh variations and combinations that

512
00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:36.209
you can find within that. So if it's a

513
00:28:36.209 --> 00:28:39.574
woman who is using it about herself and It's

514
00:28:39.574 --> 00:28:43.175
a positive context, then she's reclaiming the word. But

515
00:28:43.175 --> 00:28:47.535
if it's being used against her, especially by a

516
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:50.135
man, it's being used as an insult, as a

517
00:28:50.135 --> 00:28:53.385
negative term, then it's not reclaimed in that instance.

518
00:28:53.494 --> 00:28:57.005
So, uh, it's, you're going to continue to have

519
00:28:57.005 --> 00:29:00.525
that, uh, fine balance, and, uh, I think it's

520
00:29:00.974 --> 00:29:04.814
never going to be reclaimed completely. Uh, AND you

521
00:29:04.814 --> 00:29:10.729
have Parallels with other words like gay and queer,

522
00:29:10.839 --> 00:29:13.050
and the N word as well. So you can

523
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:17.609
say that those terms are used within the, the

524
00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:19.709
groups that they refer to and they can have

525
00:29:19.709 --> 00:29:23.010
positive connotations. So they're basically saying if I use

526
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.359
this word, uh, I'm saying something positive about myself

527
00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:30.369
as a self-identifying label and something positive about my

528
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:32.930
community and people around me, but it can certainly

529
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.040
be used, all of those words. CAN be used

530
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.790
as insults outside of the group, so by outsiders.

531
00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:41.839
And so that's very much the case with bitch

532
00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:46.510
as well. It's used within the gay community, often,

533
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.520
and it can be used as a compliment, but

534
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.040
it can be used as, as an insult, and

535
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.989
same thing for women. It can be used as

536
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.199
a self-identifying label or it can be used as

537
00:29:57.199 --> 00:29:59.229
a term of abuse. So you just have all

538
00:29:59.229 --> 00:30:03.010
of these. It's like a juggling act really, uh,

539
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.010
and the shifting meanings and uh but they're they're

540
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.449
all coexisting. So, I just don't think the word

541
00:30:10.449 --> 00:30:13.969
will ever entirely be reclaimed, same with those other

542
00:30:13.969 --> 00:30:14.329
words.

543
00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:18.599
Right. Do some uses of the word bitch uh

544
00:30:18.729 --> 00:30:24.250
uh manifest common sexist ideas in society, and if

545
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.599
so, what would these ideas be?

546
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.449
Ah, well, yeah, I think that that's probably one

547
00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:35.119
of the most salient uses of the word today,

548
00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:37.890
that it's seen as an insult, and that would

549
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.599
be the main complaint, even though some feminists have

550
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.800
attempted to reclaim the word. There are other feminists

551
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.454
and uh people in maybe gender studies. Uh, WHO,

552
00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:52.314
who would never want to use the term and

553
00:30:52.314 --> 00:30:55.275
think that it's invariably an insult and that it

554
00:30:55.275 --> 00:30:58.964
cannot be reclaimed, uh, that it ultimately comes back

555
00:30:58.964 --> 00:31:03.755
to negative attitudes towards women in society, uh, and

556
00:31:03.755 --> 00:31:06.875
so it, it really does encompass a lot of

557
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:12.170
negative attitudes towards women, uh, that, that women. Are,

558
00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:15.859
uh, somehow the second sex or, or, or lesser,

559
00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:19.130
there really is no direct equivalent term for men,

560
00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:22.359
even though bitches used, uh, with regards to men

561
00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:26.689
in many instances, there's no exact, Equivalent term for,

562
00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:30.170
or insult term for, for men. But we see

563
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.290
in general that there are thousands of insults that

564
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.369
have been recorded for women and many fewer for

565
00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:40.489
men, and often they're just not as offensive. So

566
00:31:40.489 --> 00:31:44.089
terms like bitch, going back a couple 100 years

567
00:31:44.089 --> 00:31:47.170
ago, there was a lexicographer called Francis Gross, who

568
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.290
wrote a classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue, and

569
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.819
he wrote about how bitch was, The worst appellation,

570
00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:57.459
the worst insult that you could possibly call a

571
00:31:57.459 --> 00:32:00.780
woman. It was even, uh, more provocative and insulting

572
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.780
than whore. So, I don't know if we'd look

573
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.020
at bitch that way today. Maybe the, the C

574
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.699
word, I don't know if I can say that

575
00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:12.569
on this show, but, uh, the words related to

576
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.420
females or words related to women or women's body

577
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.959
parts tend to be the most offensive terms. Uh,

578
00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:23.459
WOMEN have really Uh, attracted a lot of negative

579
00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:26.660
terms and it's just a reflection of how women

580
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.650
are viewed in society that they to this day,

581
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.040
despite leaps and bounds with equality, there's still inequality,

582
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.439
women are still the second sex. Mhm.

583
00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:40.579
So you refer to the C word there, is

584
00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:46.329
there any relationship between bitch and the sea world

585
00:32:46.329 --> 00:32:47.079
or not?

586
00:32:48.489 --> 00:32:53.099
Ah, well, I think that they're often used. Together,

587
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.089
and I think that there are some parallels with

588
00:32:57.089 --> 00:32:59.939
the, the histories of the words. Uh, THE C

589
00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:03.579
word was originally used as a literal term as

590
00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:07.060
well, to for a body part. It was even

591
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.209
used, uh, going back hundreds of years ago, uh,

592
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:15.189
in street names when In the United Kingdom in

593
00:33:15.189 --> 00:33:18.180
England you had street names which were named for

594
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.939
the professions of the street, so Barbour Street or

595
00:33:21.939 --> 00:33:26.170
uh whatever the name of the uh the different

596
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.430
trades and industries that were done on that street.

597
00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:35.400
WERE references to that profession. And so there was

598
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.689
a Uh, a street that was named after prostitutes,

599
00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:41.890
and it had the C word within that name.

600
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:45.500
So that's going back maybe to the 1300s, I

601
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.500
think. So, uh, it wasn't always an insult, but

602
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.619
it, it has been for a very long time

603
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:54.979
used to refer to the, the woman's body part

604
00:33:54.979 --> 00:33:57.260
or the female body part. And, uh, but it

605
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.219
was in an anatomical sense in, uh, medical dictionaries

606
00:34:01.219 --> 00:34:06.569
and, and medical books, and it just More recently

607
00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:10.418
became an insult term. So, uh, it's, it was

608
00:34:10.418 --> 00:34:13.520
an insult term for women and, and only recently

609
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.379
an insult term for men. But that has a

610
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:19.379
very interesting history too, where in some countries, so

611
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:22.379
I'm from Australia originally, and it's, it can be

612
00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:25.938
used for friends, much in the same way that

613
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:28.300
bitch can be used to show that you are

614
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.260
familiar with someone, you're close to them. Uh, AND

615
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.060
you can use these words about them and they're

616
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.458
not going to think think anything negative about you

617
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:39.570
for doing that. Uh, IN Scottish English, it's similar,

618
00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.290
but in here in America, it is a, uh,

619
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.360
probably one of those final frontier insults that it's

620
00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.860
very negative, very bad associations, uh, and, and probably

621
00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.770
the way that Francis Gross. Described bitch, going back

622
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.489
hundreds of years ago, the C word is probably

623
00:34:57.489 --> 00:34:59.370
replaced that I think in that regard and would

624
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.780
be, it's, you don't see it much in or

625
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.879
hear it much in on the radio or on

626
00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:07.959
television, so it's uh highly offensive to this day.

627
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.639
Right. In one of my previous questions, you alluded

628
00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:16.120
to the fact that bitch can also be used

629
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.520
to refer to men. Uh, HOW can it be

630
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.649
used to insult men?

631
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.379
So, uh, yeah, as I stated earlier, I think

632
00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:28.260
that we have some evidence that bitch has been

633
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.340
used as an insult for men for as long

634
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.500
or almost as long as it's been used as

635
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.469
an insult for women. But it's used a little

636
00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:38.300
bit differently. So when it's used in regards to

637
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.739
men, it's likening them to women, and things that

638
00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:46.169
might be perceived as negative about women. So, uh,

639
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.840
often it's Used to mean that a man is

640
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.560
not being a, uh, doing a terribly good job

641
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.159
of being a man. He's not being strong, he's

642
00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:58.760
not being masculine. So whereas we have that kind

643
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.239
of dichotomy that a woman who is a bitch

644
00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:06.750
is, is outspoken and she's ambitious and she's controlling,

645
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.949
and she's loud and powerful. Uh, BUT men who

646
00:36:10.949 --> 00:36:14.139
are like this are seen as being weak, and,

647
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:18.469
uh, it's, and really, uh, an emasculating insult for

648
00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:21.469
men, the way that it's used. And, uh, so

649
00:36:21.469 --> 00:36:24.600
it's, it's really saying that a man is like

650
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.979
a woman in ways that are negative. He's weak

651
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:34.439
and he's wishy-washy. Uh, HE'S perhaps gay, uh, he's

652
00:36:34.439 --> 00:36:37.800
effeminate. So that the earlier examples we have of

653
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.260
bitch being used toward men is with regards to,

654
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.719
uh, usually their gender presentation. Um, AND we've got

655
00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:50.800
an older term for, uh, men who might have

656
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.320
dressed as women, uh, calling them mollies. So Giving

657
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.760
them a female name and often they would use

658
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.199
the term bitch among their community to refer to

659
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.479
effeminate men.

660
00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:06.080
Mhm. Yeah, in the book at a certain point,

661
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.600
you mentioned phrases directed at men to exhort them

662
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.729
not to behave like women. One of them includes

663
00:37:13.729 --> 00:37:16.739
the word bitch. I mean, you mentioned phrases like,

664
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.475
you're such a pussy, don't be a girl. Don't

665
00:37:19.475 --> 00:37:22.034
be a little bitch. You don't have any balls,

666
00:37:22.195 --> 00:37:25.074
grow a pair, and things like that. So, I,

667
00:37:25.195 --> 00:37:29.104
I mean, the, uh, what do these phrases really

668
00:37:29.594 --> 00:37:32.504
suggest? What do they, what are they referring to?

669
00:37:32.554 --> 00:37:34.834
What are they trying to tell men?

670
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.330
Yeah. Well, I think, you know, it's, it's very,

671
00:37:38.449 --> 00:37:41.419
very unfair, but it is the way that a

672
00:37:41.419 --> 00:37:45.250
lot of parents raise their, their boys to become

673
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.060
men who are strong, that they don't cry, that

674
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.479
they don't show any uh feminine aspects. So that's

675
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:55.909
why we really have all of those terms as

676
00:37:56.159 --> 00:37:58.939
social conditioning, to say, don't be like this, don't

677
00:37:58.939 --> 00:38:01.639
run like a girl, don't cry like a girl.

678
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.149
Don't play with, uh, dolls if you're a boy,

679
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.909
don't like pink things if you're a boy. So,

680
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.699
and these, uh, some of these things too. Have

681
00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:16.260
changed over time. Um, HISTORICALLY, pink hasn't always been

682
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.459
associated with girls, so it's really just a social

683
00:38:19.459 --> 00:38:25.040
construct, these kinds of behaviors. And, uh, yeah, they're,

684
00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:28.800
they're really unfortunate phrases. I, I have a son,

685
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.760
a young son, and so I'm very careful to

686
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.629
Not use these phrases with him, to not condition

687
00:38:36.629 --> 00:38:39.669
him with these phrases, and uh you know, I

688
00:38:39.669 --> 00:38:41.790
encourage him to cry if he feels like it

689
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.699
and to express himself and, Uh, to not withhold

690
00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:47.949
his feelings and his emotions. I think that it's

691
00:38:47.949 --> 00:38:51.429
very unhealthy, and I think that we, we should

692
00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:56.270
not stereotype boys or girls, that there's no particular

693
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.709
way that girls should behave or particular way that

694
00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:02.189
boys should behave, but it is just an unhealthy

695
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:07.350
hypermasculinity, really, to say that boys can't cry, uh,

696
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.300
boys can't. Boys have to run fast and boys

697
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.060
have to, uh, you know, play hard and tackle

698
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.179
and be aggressive and violent. So they're, they're really

699
00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:22.719
just social constructs, uh, and it's just, just very

700
00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:26.820
unfair to impose those roles on boys, but I

701
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.419
think that there is a strong connection between those

702
00:39:30.419 --> 00:39:32.860
kinds of phrases and a word like bitch that

703
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.439
really does try to condition. Gender roles in society

704
00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:40.050
and tell us how boys should behave and how

705
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.219
girls should behave, and it's, it's just BS.

706
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.889
So in that sense, the word bitch and other

707
00:39:47.889 --> 00:39:50.370
words, of course, but we're focusing here on this

708
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.800
word, uh, connects to ideas people have about gender

709
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.360
and gender roles,

710
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.824
correct? Yes, absolutely. I think that really tied in

711
00:40:00.824 --> 00:40:03.544
so that again, the earliest uses of bitch going

712
00:40:03.544 --> 00:40:06.814
back to a female dog has that strong association

713
00:40:06.814 --> 00:40:13.824
with females and with a female gender presentation, and

714
00:40:13.824 --> 00:40:16.669
so I think that The way that it's used

715
00:40:16.669 --> 00:40:21.020
is really enforcing or reinforcing these roles in society,

716
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.979
that women should behave a certain way, and if

717
00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:28.659
they don't, they're bitches, and men should behave a

718
00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:31.810
certain way, and if they don't, they're bitches too.

719
00:40:32.399 --> 00:40:37.260
Um BUT with the Different connotations for for different

720
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.379
uh gender.

721
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.239
How about the expression, son of a bitch, where

722
00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:45.310
does it come from?

723
00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:50.459
Oh, that has been around for probably as long

724
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.229
as the word bitch and has been used as

725
00:40:54.229 --> 00:40:57.149
an insult, so we have examples of that that

726
00:40:57.149 --> 00:41:00.540
go back uh to some very early writings too.

727
00:41:01.229 --> 00:41:05.229
Probably the spelling that we would most recognize uh

728
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:08.600
would be that as used by, by Shakespeare. Uh,

729
00:41:08.729 --> 00:41:11.000
SO it's really been around for a very long

730
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.129
time too. So, again, it does go back to

731
00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:17.479
insulting a woman. You're saying that a man is

732
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.850
being judged by the actions of his mother, and

733
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.209
again, there are lots of ways that you can

734
00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:24.419
look at this, but A bitch is a bad

735
00:41:24.419 --> 00:41:26.340
woman, and a son of a bitch is a

736
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.540
bad man, who's basically related to a bitch. His

737
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.770
mother is a bitch. It's insulting his precious mother.

738
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.790
We have, um, son of a whore, a whore's

739
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.929
son as well. Different variations, uh, even going back

740
00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:43.419
to, uh, uh, Arthur and Merlin. So very old

741
00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:47.810
examples of this, but it's really been Embraced by

742
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.169
American English. It was very popular in British English

743
00:41:52.169 --> 00:41:54.969
for hundreds of years too, and it was then

744
00:41:54.969 --> 00:41:59.320
used in literature for American English and just became

745
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.959
a very uh um heavily associated with American English

746
00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:06.840
and it's uh just used very widely. Not as

747
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.290
much today. You've got a lot of uh uh

748
00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:14.280
euphemistic versions of Son of a bitch as well.

749
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:18.780
And uh that are used in television and comedy

750
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.909
and things like that, but uh certainly it's uh,

751
00:42:22.629 --> 00:42:25.889
Its history is as long as that of bitch.

752
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.439
Mhm.

753
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.020
And what are the most current meanings of bitch?

754
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.600
I mean, what are the ways that people use

755
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.360
the word do they, what do they mean by

756
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.479
it exactly, most commonly.

757
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.300
Oh I think all of the, the older uses

758
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.620
of the term are still around, but we have,

759
00:42:49.699 --> 00:42:53.320
uh, I guess more modern versions. The different spellings

760
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.889
I was talking about earlier, so Bish and biznat

761
00:42:56.889 --> 00:43:00.719
and the just different slang variants of the word

762
00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:05.399
bitch. And, uh, also positive terms that I think

763
00:43:05.399 --> 00:43:10.429
are born of the more feminist empowering, self-identifying label

764
00:43:10.429 --> 00:43:13.280
of bitch too, where women might refer to themselves

765
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.909
as being, you know, bad bitches. And so bad,

766
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.229
we have that, uh, uh, amelioration. Again, where you've

767
00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:25.469
got words like bad and wicked and bitch as

768
00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:29.379
well that have these negative connotations that over time

769
00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:33.310
have developed positive connotations too. So, uh, yeah, I

770
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:39.570
think that feasibly any Version of, uh, the, the

771
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.159
meaning of bitch can be used. You've got to

772
00:43:42.159 --> 00:43:44.330
look at the context to figure out exactly what's

773
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.770
being said, but it's uh very common now on

774
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:51.760
television, common on, uh, radio, common on the internet.

775
00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:55.610
It's a very popular word, an everyday word, and

776
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.320
it, uh, uh, just has so many different variations,

777
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.929
and people can spell it whatever way that they

778
00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:05.719
want, and people will understand what they mean, and,

779
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:12.229
uh, it's Yeah, just concurrently an insult, but also

780
00:44:12.229 --> 00:44:16.620
a positive term, but with just different spellings, pronunciations,

781
00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:21.189
different use within different communities and groups. It's really

782
00:44:21.189 --> 00:44:22.790
quite a powerful word.

783
00:44:24.199 --> 00:44:27.169
So one last question then, how do you look

784
00:44:27.169 --> 00:44:31.340
at the word bitch generally speaking? I mean, because

785
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.379
we went through all of these kinds of meanings

786
00:44:34.379 --> 00:44:38.340
that it has in different contexts and situations where

787
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.300
it has gone through pegeration and others where it

788
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.979
has gone through amelioration and things like that. Do

789
00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:48.139
you think of it as mostly a positive or

790
00:44:48.139 --> 00:44:49.570
a negative word?

791
00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.360
Well, That's really hard to say because it's just

792
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.199
going to depend on the individual and their experiences

793
00:44:58.199 --> 00:45:00.709
with that word. I think most, if not all,

794
00:45:00.899 --> 00:45:03.429
women have been called a bitch at some point,

795
00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:06.080
and, uh, a lot of men have been called

796
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.879
a bitch or they've been called a son of

797
00:45:07.879 --> 00:45:10.959
a bitch. So it's going to depend on that

798
00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:15.479
individual interpretation of how someone perceives that word and

799
00:45:16.399 --> 00:45:20.120
How that's being used against them, uh, and, and

800
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.360
just their associations with the word, whether they've been

801
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.580
negative or positive. But I think in an overarching

802
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.639
sense, the most salient use is that it's an

803
00:45:30.639 --> 00:45:33.239
insult. So we can say, well, it still means

804
00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:37.409
a female dog 1000 years later, and that's true.

805
00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.830
At the same time, it can be used as

806
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.479
a self-identifying label, so it can be used as

807
00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:46.719
an empowering term. Uh, AND again, that's all down

808
00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:49.639
to context. But I think that, uh, at the

809
00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:53.320
end of the day, it's most seen as an

810
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.350
insult, as a term of abuse, particularly for women,

811
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.120
and that it shows negative attitudes, uh, towards women,

812
00:46:02.479 --> 00:46:06.639
and that, um, you know, it's, it's offensive, uh,

813
00:46:06.679 --> 00:46:09.840
in many contexts. So I, I really think that's

814
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.250
the The, the most salient use of the word

815
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.169
today, but, uh, you have all of these concurrent

816
00:46:17.169 --> 00:46:21.770
and conflicting uses and meanings, and, uh, I think

817
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.649
that the word's just going to continue to somersault

818
00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:28.169
and, and do all of these different, uh, changes

819
00:46:28.169 --> 00:46:32.479
and stick around and, uh, uh, I think evolve

820
00:46:32.729 --> 00:46:34.139
so that it can stay alive.

821
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.360
Yeah, and it will also change meaning for something

822
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.100
else somewhere in the future as well, right? Yeah,

823
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.699
yeah, it's really difficult to know exactly what a

824
00:46:43.699 --> 00:46:45.300
word is going to do, but I think just

825
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.939
based on the previous behavior of the word that

826
00:46:47.939 --> 00:46:50.929
it's, it's going to continue to evolve and change.

827
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:55.840
Yeah, great. So the book is again bit the

828
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.090
