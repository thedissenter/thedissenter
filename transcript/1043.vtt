00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.750
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.500
joined by Doctor Rudolfurzu. He's associate dean at theor

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.619
School of Sustainability, being professor in environmental science, professor

5
00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.250
of Earth System Science, and senior fellow at the

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.290
Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. His

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.129
scientific work examines the study of species interactions in

8
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:30.329
tropical ecosystems from California, Latin America, and other tropical

9
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.009
areas of the world. And today we're going to

10
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.360
talk a little bit about species interactions, hybrid networks,

11
00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:43.409
human activity, biodiversity conservation, the 6th uh mass extinction,

12
00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.369
deformation, and other related topics. So, Doctor Diz, welcome

13
00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.060
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.880
It's a pleasure to be with you, Ricard. That

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.759
sounds like a lot of topics that we want

16
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.819
to examine today, but then we have to do

17
00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.110
as much as we can.

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.840
Yeah, let's try to cover at least a few

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.230
of them. So, let's start with species interactions then.

20
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
Uh, COULD you start by explaining what species interactions

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.830
are and why is it important to study them?

22
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.660
Yeah, we tend to think that um The ecology,

23
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.949
the scientific discipline that addresses the interactions between organisms

24
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.750
and their environment, we traditionally have thought that those

25
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.910
interactions between organisms and the environment were interactions that

26
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.709
had to do with the physical environment. So, let's

27
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.419
imagine a plant, a plant has to interact with

28
00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.870
the climate, the soil. THOSE physical aspects of the

29
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.190
environment. But the reality is that plants and animals

30
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.750
have to interact with other elements of the environment,

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.569
the biological elements of the environment. So, for example,

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.800
a plant has to interact with animals that might

33
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.169
want to eat the plant, herbivores, or animals that

34
00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.319
might want to take the pollen and do the

35
00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.500
the fertilization of the flowers and therefore, the reproduction

36
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.120
of the plants. Plants can be interact with fungi

37
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.089
that would be pathogenic or could be uh assistance

38
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.904
in terms of capturing. Nutrients in the roots. And

39
00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:16.024
so really what we um want to emphasize with

40
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.505
this topic is that the fact that plants and

41
00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.505
animals and microorganisms, not only do they have to

42
00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:25.225
interact with the physical aspects of the environment, the

43
00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:27.975
climate, the soil, temperature, and so on, but also

44
00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:30.865
with other factors of the environment. And the significance

45
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.699
of that Ricardo, is that um You know, when

46
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.429
plants or or animals adapt to a given condition

47
00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.220
of the environment, it is possible that the animals

48
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.210
or the interacting organisms with them react to that

49
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.809
and create a challenge for the plant. Let's imagine

50
00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.380
this situation. A plant that lives in a place

51
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.740
where the winter comes at a given time of

52
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.679
the year, the plant can develop the adaptations to

53
00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.500
deal with the winter, right? Low temperature the plant

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.580
will either drop the leaves or do something. Once

55
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.710
they do that solution, that's it. Now, let's suppose

56
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.850
a plant is being attacked by an animal. The

57
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.970
plants respond by producing some mechanism of defense, let's

58
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.729
say a chemical compound. But that's not the definitive

59
00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.369
answer because the animal can evolve the capacity to

60
00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.649
deal with that toxin. And now the animal is

61
00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.250
on top again of the plant, and then the

62
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.240
plant has to come back again with another interaction.

63
00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.289
And so, in the case of interactions with the

64
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.250
physical environment, usually the solutions of the plants or

65
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.229
animals or organisms are um Definite. But in the

66
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.710
case of biological interactions, they tend to be escalating

67
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.619
a a thing that we call co-evolution. And really,

68
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.759
what has happened with the evolution of life on

69
00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.009
the planet is very much the result of those

70
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.500
complex interactions between organisms, speech interactions, and co-evolution. That's

71
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.350
the significance of this definition of species interactions.

72
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.000
And so do these species interactions have any influence

73
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.839
on how we understand how evolution plays out? Or

74
00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:12.119
do they have any specific implications for evolutionary biology?

75
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.670
Absolutely, absolutely. Um, IN the history of the development

76
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.048
of evolution, we have two prominent figures. One of

77
00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:24.829
them was Russell Wallace, the man who was, um,

78
00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.880
traveling first in, in South America and then in

79
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.440
Southeast Asia. And then he came up with the

80
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.040
idea of uh um uh natural selection, and then

81
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.510
Darwin panicked because he had not published his ideas.

82
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.149
Um, AND so, Wallace had this very much, um,

83
00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.769
the opinion very much on the physical factors of

84
00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:46.500
the environment, and Darwin was of the opinion of

85
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.000
physical, uh, factors of the environment, but also biological

86
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.970
aspects of the environment. And so Darwin, for example,

87
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.440
um, wanted to examine competition and the survival of

88
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.679
the fittest, he called it, you know, in an,

89
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.079
in an environment, plants and animals compete against each

90
00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.839
other or plants and animals when they feed each

91
00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.290
other. And that created uh many fundamental ideas that

92
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.609
he developed in terms of the principles of natural

93
00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:15.209
selection. Let's imagine the situation to understand um evolution

94
00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:19.399
and adaptation via these processes. Mhm. Imagine that we

95
00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.570
have a, a population of plants, uh, uh, and

96
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.130
those plants are the subject of uh food for

97
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.739
some animals, say, say an insect. If for some

98
00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.230
reason, some of the plants within the population have

99
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.869
characteristics that prevent them from being eaten compared to

100
00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.440
other plants, that is to say the first principle

101
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.339
of natural selection, which is variation within the population,

102
00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.630
then the insects will eat the plants that do

103
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.750
not have those characteristics. The plants that have those

104
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.510
defensive characteristics will leave more descendants, the second principle

105
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.589
of natural selection. And third, if those characteristics are

106
00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.799
uh genetically determined, then the plant will have an

107
00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:03.109
adaptation as a response, and an adaptive response to

108
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:06.029
the selective pressure accepted by the animal. So we

109
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.140
can see that these biotic interactions actually reflect splendidly,

110
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.709
the mechanisms of natural selection, leading to adaptations and

111
00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:17.140
eventually to evolutionary processes. So that's the significance of,

112
00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.549
of those interactions.

113
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.380
And are species interactions influenced in any way by

114
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.579
ecology? And if so,

115
00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:30.019
how? Yes, actually, uh, we could say, Ricardo that

116
00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:34.700
um ecology is natural selection in action. So the

117
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.579
fact that plants and animals and microbes have to

118
00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:40.660
be uh dealing with the challenges of the environment

119
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.100
and the variation in environmental characteristics, and that is

120
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.424
to say the hetero. Unity of the environment in

121
00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:50.934
space or time, uh, then that drives pretty much

122
00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:56.024
uh the responses of plants for the challenges and

123
00:06:56.024 --> 00:07:00.864
therefore, the evolutionary process. Now, another significance of that

124
00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:04.410
from the human perspective. IS that we tend to

125
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.540
think of these uh interactions as things that happen

126
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.809
in nature and may, may not have direct significance

127
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:13.980
to us, but the reality is that they are

128
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.459
extremely relevant to us. To give an example, again,

129
00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:20.859
coming back to the situation of plants using defensive

130
00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:24.779
mechanisms. To protect themselves at the taco. Well, plants

131
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:31.059
have evolved alkaloids, um, um, cyanogenic glycosides, uh, phenolic

132
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:34.100
compounds, many things that we now, we, I mean,

133
00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:37.579
our ancestors and now today, we have discovered the

134
00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:40.299
medicinal products that we can use for our own

135
00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:44.329
benefit. So really, for example, penicillin is a result

136
00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:47.239
of an interaction between a fungus. And it's, and

137
00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:50.549
it's uh host, and then some people, some, uh,

138
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.239
in this case, some indigenous peoples from Central Mexico

139
00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:56.799
discovered that that fungus actually could be used to

140
00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:59.589
address problems of infections on the, of the skin.

141
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.239
So that medicine actually came from that interaction. Many

142
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:08.600
plants use um a saletylic acid, uh which is

143
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.029
basically aspirin. Uh, AND now, we know that uh

144
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:15.959
elicin is a, is a product that has been

145
00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:19.519
derived from the pressure of animals eating these plants

146
00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:22.799
in the genus Salix. And then we understood that

147
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:25.760
those are the medicine that we use for painkillers,

148
00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:28.839
for example, and the same thing with many alkaloids,

149
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.989
caffeine, morphine, and so on and so forth. Many

150
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:35.119
of them used for medicinal purposes, and many, many

151
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.590
examples of that. And then, In terms of what

152
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.950
you were asking, sort of the, uh, the directions

153
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.109
of the evolutionary process, there are some beautiful examples.

154
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.309
Let's take the case of the very, very well-known

155
00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:50.320
situation of the monarch butterfly. This is a beautiful

156
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.909
butterfly that everybody knows, or most people know. This

157
00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:56.669
is a fantastic migratory species that moves between North

158
00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:02.070
America and Central Mexico. Anyway, that fantastic uh butterfly

159
00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:06.299
has caterpillars, and the caterpillars are specialized in eating

160
00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:10.099
this particular group of plants called milkweeds. Well, it

161
00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:15.619
turns out that these milkweeds produce um cardioid glucosides,

162
00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:19.710
a compound, some chemical compounds that attack the muscle

163
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.260
of the heart of animals. So it turns out

164
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.450
that the caterpillars can actually eat those uh milk

165
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.239
uh uh milkweed plants, despite the fact that those

166
00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:33.760
milk wheat plants have this very nasty compound. And

167
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.630
so the caterpillars actually, when they eat the plants,

168
00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:39.880
they have the capacity to uh to diminish the

169
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.469
effect, eliminate the effect of the, of the toxin.

170
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.239
But then they pass the toxin from the caterpillars

171
00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:48.460
to the adult butterfly. And then the adult butterfly

172
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.460
has these cartonelloids and it's defended against its predators,

173
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.510
the birds. And then the birds and uh learn

174
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.830
to see, to detect the um um the butterflies,

175
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.909
the monarch butterflies, because of the coloration. In other

176
00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:04.510
words, will try and avoid eating those plants. But

177
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.820
then all the butterflies will imitate the color of

178
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.869
the, of the monarchs to make sure that they

179
00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:11.059
also defend themselves, even though they do not produce

180
00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:13.369
the defensive chemistry. And so you can see this

181
00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:18.679
fantastic network of interactions derived. By the complex ecological

182
00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:22.919
relationships within an organisms cascading down to multiplicity of

183
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:26.789
phenomena that occur as a consequence of these simple,

184
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.679
apparently simple interactions.

185
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.520
And what are hybrid networks then?

186
00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:37.250
Uh, Netballs, um, imagine this situation when you are

187
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.080
in a, in a community, in an, an ecosystem,

188
00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.570
you will have a list of plant species, for

189
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.849
example, and a list of insects that are the

190
00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:48.330
pollinators of the plant species, correct? You want to

191
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.400
know which plant species is connected to which pollinator.

192
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.049
You also want to know this pollinator to how

193
00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.239
many plants this is the pollinator of. And so

194
00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:00.409
you have this network of species of plants and

195
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:04.200
species of animals connected in this interactive network. But

196
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.820
it turns out that the, the plants are also

197
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.619
eaten by animals, the herbivores. And so you want

198
00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:12.090
to see what is the herbivore that eat these

199
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.229
plants and which are the insects that pollinate these

200
00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:19.190
plants. So you have Hybrid interaction of interactions, really.

201
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.960
We could say that this is an interaction of

202
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.440
interactions, uh, uh, create this uh hybrid networks. When

203
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.830
you have multiple levels of interaction, that becomes a,

204
00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:33.789
a sort of a, a multi-scale, multi trophic level

205
00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:36.080
hybrid interactions networks.

206
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.900
And so to get a little bit into how

207
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.539
human activity might impact these aspects of the ecosys

208
00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:49.500
the ecosystem, can these hybrid networks be disrupted by

209
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.979
human activity? And if so, in what ways?

210
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.619
In, in, in, yes, the answer is yes, and,

211
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.179
and, in multiple ways. First of all, um, regards

212
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:02.520
the mechanisms. The typical mechanisms in which uh human

213
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.469
activities impact the function, the biodiversity and the functioning

214
00:12:06.469 --> 00:12:10.159
and processes of the biodiversity are typically in this

215
00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:15.119
order. Um, FIRST of all, we have, um, land

216
00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:18.039
use change, that is to say, the transformation of

217
00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:21.650
the natural habitats. Everybody has seen images of, say,

218
00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:25.049
for example, in a tropical ecosystem with the, with

219
00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:28.770
the forest coverage uh taken with a satellite image

220
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.690
at a given time. And then you come back

221
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.530
at another time and you see how that forest

222
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.179
has been disrupted, reduced by deforestation. So that is

223
00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:40.409
land use uh change. Uh, ECOSYSTEMS and, and biodiversity

224
00:12:40.409 --> 00:12:44.130
are also impacted by overexploitation. Say, for example, the

225
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.710
overhunting of uh elephants in Africa, so overexploitation. And

226
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.700
then we have the situation of non-native invasive species.

227
00:12:53.989 --> 00:12:58.030
When we humans transform or transport, sorry, animals or

228
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.989
plants from one location to another location, usually those

229
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.989
have negative impacts on the, on the natural local

230
00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:07.030
communities. Third, and then we have that many of

231
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:12.190
those exotic non-native species are also uh disease agents.

232
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.320
So, for example, you know, um, uh, an, an

233
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.070
animal can come with a pathogen that will infect

234
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.080
the other animals of the place where it went.

235
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.799
And then finally, last but not least, we have

236
00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:27.359
climate change as well. Climate change disrupts, uh, biodiversity

237
00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:30.280
and disrupts all of these interactions. The complexity and

238
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.859
significance of all of this, Ricardo, is that none

239
00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:36.789
of these factors operate in isolation. So, for example,

240
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:40.830
they are interacting in complex ways. To simplify an

241
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.859
example. If you go to the Amazon, And there

242
00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:47.619
is a process of land use change, the deforestation,

243
00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:51.070
the reduction of the habitat. Well, that destruction and

244
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.059
fragmentation of the habitat facilitates for poachers and hunters

245
00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:57.940
to have access to places that in the past,

246
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.140
they would not be, have access to because the

247
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.770
forest was so extensive, right? So now you have

248
00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:05.299
an effect of the reduction of the habitat which

249
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.619
threatens the populations because the small habitat will not

250
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:11.140
be sufficient to maintain a viable population. So that's

251
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.280
one factor. And then, but that, that facilitates the

252
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.320
hunting. The hunting per se affects the population. So

253
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.679
we have this compound effect between those two things

254
00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.280
in a synergy. Now, bring on to that the

255
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.719
effect of climate change, the effect of invasive species.

256
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.400
So then we have all of these very complex

257
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.320
way of disrupting the abundance, diversity, and the ecological

258
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.159
interactions of organisms. And this is an important lesson,

259
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.700
Ricardo, because now we understand at Certainly in my

260
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:46.140
laboratory, we're interested particularly in understanding human impact in

261
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.549
terms of species, in terms of populations, but also

262
00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:54.500
we're particularly interested in understanding the influences, negative influences

263
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.260
of human activities on the ecological interactions of organisms.

264
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.849
So, so kind of the, the mission of our

265
00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:07.299
laboratory is to do conservation of ecosystem processes and

266
00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:09.260
ecosystem species interaction.

267
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.219
And so one of the ways by which our

268
00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:19.150
human activity can change hybrid hybrid networks is through

269
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.460
agricultural intensification.

270
00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:25.409
Agricultural intensification is one of the most uh critical

271
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:29.729
drivers of, um, of disruption of biodiversity, species interactions

272
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:33.200
and species networks. We do know, Ricardo, that, uh,

273
00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:36.409
most of the transformation of land, what is called

274
00:15:36.409 --> 00:15:39.880
the land use, land use change is driven by

275
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:47.070
agricultural intensification, particularly the industrialized agricultural uh identification. Take

276
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.580
the case of uh the Midwest in the US,

277
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.869
extensive areas of states such as Kansas and Illinois,

278
00:15:54.429 --> 00:16:00.150
massively transformed in agricultural monocultures for maize, or corn,

279
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.030
or for other, other crops. Take the case of

280
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:07.539
Southeast Asia, uh, the massive transformation of the rainforest

281
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:11.520
for the plantations to produce oil, the African, uh,

282
00:16:11.549 --> 00:16:15.469
palm oil. And so, you can see that um

283
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.130
this uh intrification of agriculture, particularly when it's focusing

284
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:26.219
on monocultural uh agriculture, creates massive, massive disruptions on

285
00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:30.020
the land, the land use change, therefore affecting the

286
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.340
abundance, the diversity, and the interactions of the species

287
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.900
within all of those communities. And our lab, our

288
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.500
laboratory has the mission of understanding these beautiful ecological

289
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.820
interactions like what I described in the case of

290
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.900
the monarch butterfly, but how are those interactions going

291
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.169
to be playing out now that we're doing these

292
00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:53.580
tremendous impacts on nature via land exchange such as

293
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.179
agricultural intensification or overexploitation, or the combination of all

294
00:16:58.179 --> 00:16:59.140
of these factors.

295
00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:03.669
And so, could you just explain a little bit

296
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:09.229
more why biodiversity conservation is so important because particularly

297
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:13.108
when it comes to, for example, agricultural activity and

298
00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:15.910
climate change, we hear all the time on the

299
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.760
news that Biodiversity is important. We should care a

300
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.250
lot about biodiversity, but, uh, perhaps people do not

301
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:29.319
understand exactly why. So what role does biodiversity play,

302
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.959
for example, in ecosystems and evolution?

303
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.209
Fantastic. Yes. So, biodiversity is the fundamental element of

304
00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:44.209
the constitution of species in a network of interactions

305
00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:47.849
in any natural ecosystem. We can talk about biodiversity

306
00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:52.290
as the configuration and integration of, of three elements,

307
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.170
3 levels of integration. Number 1 is the genetic

308
00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:00.369
diversity within populations. Uh, THINK of a case of

309
00:18:00.369 --> 00:18:02.130
any species of plant or animal in a given

310
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.050
ecosystem, you will see that there is variation within

311
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.280
that, uh, population. Take the case of the human

312
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.469
population. We are a species that has genetic diversity.

313
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.010
Take the case of blood types. We have uh

314
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:19.050
blood type A, type B, type O. So there's

315
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.369
always genetic diversity within the population. So that's the

316
00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:24.890
first level. The second level is the species diversity.

317
00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:28.790
In an ecosystem, you have species, multiple species, right?

318
00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:32.030
So species diversity. And the third level is the

319
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.270
diversity of ecosystems. So if you look at the

320
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.949
landscape, you could have riparian forest, you could have

321
00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:41.180
savannah, you could have uh middle elevation forest and,

322
00:18:41.229 --> 00:18:43.069
and, in the top of the mountains and other

323
00:18:43.069 --> 00:18:45.709
kind of ecosystems. So we have 3 levels of

324
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:51.535
biodiversity integration, genetic, Species and ecosystem diversity. Well, all

325
00:18:51.535 --> 00:18:54.494
of those are from the fundamental blocks for the

326
00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:58.814
processes that maintain the functioning of ecosystems. Um, AND

327
00:18:58.814 --> 00:19:02.645
so, any disruption in these levels is critical. Now,

328
00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:07.295
the biodiversity is essential to us because many of

329
00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:11.415
the processes that we depend upon are driven by

330
00:19:11.415 --> 00:19:14.314
the configuration of the biodiversity and the interaction they're

331
00:19:14.314 --> 00:19:20.140
in. Take the case, for example, of um Uh,

332
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.790
clean water, right? A forest in a given ecosystem

333
00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:28.300
will, um, capture the humidity, uh, will filter the

334
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.449
water, and then people in the lowland will have

335
00:19:30.699 --> 00:19:36.050
water and quality and quantity. Um, BIODIVERSITY produces, um,

336
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:42.030
tangible products that we use directly, food, medicines, um,

337
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.319
fruit. Models to produce new kinds of medicine. So,

338
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.619
uh there's a, an aspect of what's called um

339
00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:53.900
biochemical prospecting. So some scientists go around the planet

340
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.250
looking at plants, at, at the diversity of plants

341
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.949
to see what other compounds are not known yet

342
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:03.810
that could be used for medicinal purposes. We also

343
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.199
depend on biodiversity for the regulation of processes. Think

344
00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:11.069
of the bats, those nocturnal mammals that fly at

345
00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:15.410
night and eat hundreds or thousands of insects that

346
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.010
might eat our crops, and therefore they regulate that

347
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.930
service for the, uh, for the production of food.

348
00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:24.739
Take the case of many animals that will eat

349
00:20:24.739 --> 00:20:27.180
the seeds, the fruit of a plant, and in

350
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.449
so doing, we'll disperse the seed to another location

351
00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:33.670
and maintain the populations of plants. Um, THE pollinators

352
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.270
for the cultivation of many crops are essential because

353
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.430
without bees and other pollinators, the production of fruit

354
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.069
would be very limited. And we also have a

355
00:20:43.069 --> 00:20:47.229
fundamental process. The primary productivity is called the fact

356
00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:50.310
that many organisms in biodiversity, in the biodiversity of

357
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.650
the planet, Uh, can capture the energy of the

358
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.079
sun through the photosynthesis process and use the water

359
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.729
and produce, you know, the bodies, and then the

360
00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:02.449
bodies of the organisms that we eat, the plants

361
00:21:02.449 --> 00:21:04.400
that we eat or the animals that we eat,

362
00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:06.930
animals eat the plants that we eat those animals.

363
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.810
So the food chain, the base of the food

364
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.530
chain depends on biodiversity. And then Ricardo aspect that

365
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.150
people um uh rarely takes into consideration, but I

366
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.459
think it's really relevant. Also, the value of inspiration

367
00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.869
and education and motivation. I mean, who would not

368
00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:28.109
be um uh emotionally impacted by looking or by,

369
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.060
by being in a natural piece of, of, uh,

370
00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:33.989
of an ecosystem, in a piece of nature. And

371
00:21:33.989 --> 00:21:36.349
um so all of these things that we call

372
00:21:36.349 --> 00:21:40.439
now ecosystem services are very much essential for the

373
00:21:40.439 --> 00:21:44.750
sustenance of our lives as, as a population. Ultimately,

374
00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:48.380
Ricardo, we can think about it, we eat biodiversity.

375
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.099
So really, it is crucial that we appreciate the

376
00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:55.869
significance of biodiversity and perhaps critically now, what is

377
00:21:55.869 --> 00:21:59.750
happening to biodiversity given the human enterprise.

378
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.550
And so, what would you say are perhaps some

379
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.260
of the main ways by which climate change might

380
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.869
impact the dynamics of animal populations?

381
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.219
In multiple ways. For example, in places that used

382
00:22:16.219 --> 00:22:21.969
to have a given climatic condition, say, temperature, uh,

383
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.420
in a given time of the year, and the

384
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.739
animals are adapted to those climatic conditions, if the

385
00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:33.010
temperature changes and those animals can no longer be

386
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.989
uh Able to maintain the populations on that new

387
00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:40.079
climatic envelope, those animals, if they were the pollinators

388
00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:43.589
of a plant, that will have the local impact

389
00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:46.880
on another element of the, of the system, uh,

390
00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:48.839
in this case, the, the, the plant that they

391
00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:52.439
were the pollinators of. Um, CLIMATE change because of

392
00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:55.900
the rapidity with which it is occurring. It is

393
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.020
quite possible that many species will not be able

394
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.500
to track those climatic uh changes given the speed

395
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.339
with which these are occurring. For example, along the

396
00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:09.140
mountain, the temperature is increasing, particularly in the lowlands,

397
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.579
and so animals or plants have to migrate higher

398
00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:14.140
up in the mountains to maintain or to find,

399
00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.003
to track their adaptive. Uh, CLIMATIC envelopes and therefore

400
00:23:19.003 --> 00:23:21.633
they will have to move. But if they encounter

401
00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:24.243
that the areas where they could move, having already

402
00:23:24.243 --> 00:23:27.843
deforested or converted into massive agricultural, they will not

403
00:23:27.843 --> 00:23:30.142
be able to move. So you see the combination

404
00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:33.343
of factors. And again, climate change being a driver

405
00:23:33.343 --> 00:23:38.206
that will change or challenge the species to Move

406
00:23:38.206 --> 00:23:41.406
to different climatic envelopes that they might or might

407
00:23:41.406 --> 00:23:44.365
not be adapted. But it's not only that, because

408
00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:46.595
when a plant or an animal moves to another

409
00:23:46.595 --> 00:23:49.725
climatic condition, as I said at the beginning, as

410
00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:51.806
we discussed at the beginning, it's not the plant

411
00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:53.916
that lives in a vacuum. The plants will need

412
00:23:53.916 --> 00:23:55.725
to have its pollinators and the pollnets. We need

413
00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:58.395
to be able to also track that climatic change.

414
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.599
And so people can understand the complexity of climate

415
00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:06.109
change as a driver of changes in biodiversity, not

416
00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:08.560
only in the species in particular, but on the

417
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.400
network of species that interact with the, with the,

418
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.880
with the components of their uh ecosystem.

419
00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:16.910
So I would like to ask you now about

420
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.430
what some people have been calling the 6th mass

421
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.670
extinction. But just before we talk about these mass

422
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:28.709
extinctions specifically, what, what is a mass extinction? I

423
00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:33.310
mean, what is an event that uh evolutionary biologists

424
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.670
classify as a mass extinction?

425
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.729
Yes, very good point, uh, Ricardo. So, uh, a

426
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:45.849
mass extinction is a process of, um, catastrophic, multi-species,

427
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:52.250
multigenera, multilineages, uh, lost, demise of, uh, of organisms.

428
00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:56.290
Um, NORMALLY, we do have a process of extinction.

429
00:24:56.839 --> 00:24:59.400
Uh, IT would be surprising to our, uh, people

430
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.319
who are listening to us in this conversation. It

431
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:05.079
would be surprising to them to know that many,

432
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:07.359
most of the species that, that have appeared on

433
00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:10.199
the planet have gone extinct. So the fate of

434
00:25:10.199 --> 00:25:13.099
the species is to extinct eventually at some point,

435
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.430
but that process usually takes a very long time.

436
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.839
But that is a normal rate of extinction. And

437
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:22.560
so we know that there's always extinction processes, but

438
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.040
they go at a very low level. Mhm. Oh,

439
00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:28.800
opposite to that, there is a situation in which

440
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.839
a given cataclysmic phenomenon occurs and eliminates that normal

441
00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:36.599
rate of extinction, which tends to be very slow,

442
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.569
very low, then becomes a massive, almost instantaneous geologically

443
00:25:41.569 --> 00:25:45.160
speaking, cataclysmic phenomenon. The case that it is going

444
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.219
to be very easy for our, our audience to

445
00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:51.319
understand is going to be the extinction that occurred

446
00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:55.599
65 million years ago. When this meteorite crashed on

447
00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:59.609
the Yucatan Peninsula in the town of Chikhulu, that

448
00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:03.920
massive um crash impact of this, um, of this

449
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.689
meteorite with, with Earth. TRIGGERED a num a number

450
00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:12.729
of uh physical impacts that led to the extinction,

451
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:18.180
massive extinction of many organisms, particularly, although not exclusively,

452
00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:21.030
the extinction of the dominant animals of the planet

453
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.459
at the time, the dinosaurs. Uh, BUT many of

454
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:26.939
the groups of organisms actually went extinct at the

455
00:26:26.939 --> 00:26:30.560
same time. So when you have this, um, emergent

456
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.060
phenomena that imply a massive reduction of the standing

457
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.260
biodiversity, implying not a species, not only a set

458
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.939
of species, genera, but many lineages at the same

459
00:26:43.939 --> 00:26:47.739
time, that is a massive extinction. Now, in the

460
00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:49.959
history of plan of the life, of life on

461
00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:55.699
the planet, We have observed 5 major episodes of

462
00:26:55.699 --> 00:27:00.699
massive extinction. They have occurred um 5 times in

463
00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:04.770
the last 550 million years ago. Uh, THAT tells

464
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.239
us, Ricardo, that this phenomenon is a relatively rare

465
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.369
occurrence in life on the planet. As I said,

466
00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:16.089
5 in 5 and 50 million years ago, on

467
00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:20.569
average, every 110 million years ago occurs a massive

468
00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:26.300
extinction by some um uh extrinsic phenomenon. A massive,

469
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.020
uh, volcanic, uh, uh, multiple volcanic eruption, contamination of

470
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.000
the atmosphere, and so on, or the crash of

471
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.790
a meteorite, those kinds of things. Typically, in those

472
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.219
cases, uh, a high proportion of the biodiversity disappears.

473
00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:45.469
In the extinction of the Permian, it is estimated

474
00:27:45.469 --> 00:27:49.849
that about 90% of all the living species of

475
00:27:49.849 --> 00:27:52.630
the planet went extinct. In the case of the

476
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.640
last extinction, 65 million years ago, massive extinction of

477
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.310
dinosaurs and many other organisms, including plants and animals.

478
00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:05.540
Interestingly though, when those massive extinction processes occur, They

479
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.420
open up the space for other species to emerge

480
00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:11.489
as a consequence of that extinction. But at any

481
00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:14.949
rate, there are the normal background extinctions which occur

482
00:28:14.949 --> 00:28:17.739
at a very low level, and then on top

483
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:21.900
of that, the rare massive extinction phenomenon. As we

484
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.140
said, there have been 5 in the past, and

485
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.619
now we have fears, we have concerns that the

486
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:33.089
human enterprise is moving a process that will create

487
00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:37.300
a 6th mass extinction process unless we take action

488
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.540
immediately. We are already in a process. We have

489
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:45.260
already triggered a massive extinction process. But in this

490
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.469
case, it's driven by one species, our species. But

491
00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:50.910
at the same time, we have the capacity to

492
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.790
understand what are the consequences of our um of

493
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.829
our enterprise. So we should be able to at

494
00:28:56.829 --> 00:29:01.260
least ameliorate the rate of extinction and hopefully prevent

495
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.724
the demise of our companions out. Unique companions on

496
00:29:04.724 --> 00:29:07.005
the entire universe. As far as we know, there

497
00:29:07.005 --> 00:29:09.344
are no other living organisms that could be our

498
00:29:09.344 --> 00:29:13.724
companions anywhere on the universe. So, really, this is

499
00:29:13.724 --> 00:29:17.244
a, a very macroscopic, this is a cosmic phenomenon

500
00:29:17.244 --> 00:29:21.974
that we're facing. Now, critical uh things to discuss

501
00:29:21.974 --> 00:29:25.854
and, and convey to our uh audience Ric regardless

502
00:29:25.854 --> 00:29:29.839
the fact that um Uh, it might be difficult

503
00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.959
for people to see that a massive phenomenon of

504
00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:35.119
extinction is occurring because it's a process relatively that

505
00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:38.849
occurs relatively slow, but the, uh, the central point

506
00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:42.040
of the extinction today is the extinction of the

507
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.750
populations. Let me see if I can explain this.

508
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.469
Imagine that in Latin America we have the species

509
00:29:49.469 --> 00:29:53.709
of a cat, the jaguar. This jaguar used to

510
00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:57.410
be present from southern US all the way down

511
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.540
to northern Argentina, right? The speech of Jaguar is

512
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.699
not extinct yet, but in many locations, it is

513
00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:08.239
gigantic distribution from, from south of the US to

514
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.390
to uh northern Argentina. There were many populations of

515
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.709
the same species. Well, it turns out that with

516
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:17.869
land use change, massive agricultural, urbanization, and so on,

517
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.660
many populations of the jaguar have already gone extinct,

518
00:30:21.709 --> 00:30:26.030
even though the species is still present somewhere. And

519
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.349
so what we have really is a process of

520
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:32.949
population extinction. When the species at a local level

521
00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:35.310
begin to be declining in their abundance because of

522
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.459
what we do, and eventually disappear from that location,

523
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.310
that is the extinction of that population. When that

524
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.430
process of extinction of population occurs throughout the range

525
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.109
of distribution of the species, then we have the

526
00:30:47.109 --> 00:30:49.630
extinction of the species in the entire face of

527
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.229
the planet. We don't see the um massive extinction

528
00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:55.949
of species at the moment, as clearly as we

529
00:30:55.949 --> 00:31:00.699
see the massive extinction of populations. Um, Two points

530
00:31:00.699 --> 00:31:04.339
to, to clarify here. Um, THE, really the, the

531
00:31:04.339 --> 00:31:07.300
central point, the critical point of extinction now is

532
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.819
the extinction of populations, and we don't tend to

533
00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:11.739
notice because we tend to hear that, you know,

534
00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:15.380
there's still elephants somewhere in Africa, although many populations

535
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.390
have gone extinct. So really, the critical issue is

536
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:21.949
extinction of populations. Now, the mass extinctions, uh, I'm

537
00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:24.819
sorry, the entire extinction of a species from the

538
00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:28.819
face of the earth, uh, we have calculated that

539
00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:32.349
over the last Um, say, say from year 1500

540
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:37.390
to now, there have been about 370 recorded complete

541
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.469
extinctions of species of vertebrates. And so we tend

542
00:31:40.469 --> 00:31:43.069
to think, well, 370 is not such a big

543
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:46.109
number, but it's not such a big number if

544
00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:49.099
we don't look it in the context. We know

545
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.390
that um that extinction that occurring in these, in

546
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.630
these just few years would, should have taken thousands

547
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.880
of years for that to occur naturally. Were it

548
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.719
not because we're present in doing very uh impactful

549
00:32:02.719 --> 00:32:07.439
activities over the course of, of our civilization. So

550
00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:09.880
basically, what I'm trying to say is that uh

551
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.839
the, the, the extinction of species, we have estimated

552
00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:17.709
to be about 100 to 1000 times more intense

553
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:21.869
than the normal rates of extinction. We're moving towards

554
00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:24.750
a massive process of extinction and the mechanism by

555
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.670
which that is occurring is first by the extinction

556
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.579
of the population. If we continue at the same

557
00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:33.900
rate of extinction of populations, we will definitely trigger

558
00:32:34.229 --> 00:32:38.750
a massive 6 extinction episodes, mass extinction episode of

559
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.229
the plant.

560
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.829
And I think that there are several different important

561
00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:48.020
messages to drive home here because it is very

562
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.310
easy that we see people sort of dismissing this

563
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.510
kind of phenomenon. I mean, basically not giving as

564
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.949
much importance as it has to the extinction of

565
00:33:00.949 --> 00:33:05.400
several. Different species or sometimes even being an outright

566
00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:08.359
uh science denier in the, in this particular case,

567
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.079
I guess that uh many times the climate change

568
00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:14.319
denier and saying that climate change, for example, is

569
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:17.599
not at all driven by human activity or human

570
00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:22.579
made. But in this particular case of species extinctions

571
00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:26.849
and Some other, of course, uh, environmental phenomena that

572
00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:29.609
we see as the result of climate change. There

573
00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:34.160
are clear signs and there, there are also consensual

574
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.060
among evolutionary biologists, climate scientists, and other people that

575
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:44.130
this is actually the result mainly of human activity.

576
00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.920
Right. Yeah, there is no question about that. Starting

577
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.800
with the climate change, um, we do know, I

578
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.880
mean, we can do a very simple experiment. Do,

579
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.219
um, uh, if we construct a greenhouse in, in

580
00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:02.189
the, in the yard of our home with glass,

581
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.640
right? We do know that we can maintain inside

582
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.199
the greenhouse, we can maintain plants that from, from

583
00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.179
a tropical area. Even though you live in a,

584
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.340
in a cold area, in a, a cold climatic

585
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.580
condition, if you build a, a greenhouse, you will

586
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.860
be able to maintain plants there. Why? Because the

587
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.978
radiation that is coming from the sun penetrates through

588
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:26.770
the glass of the, of the greenhouse, will warm

589
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.379
the, the, the space within the greenhouse, and then

590
00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:33.699
the radiation that should, should go back. TO the

591
00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:36.649
atmosphere is trapped then in the, in the glass.

592
00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:41.469
Well, the glass in the planet is the greenhouse

593
00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:47.159
gasses that we are producing massively, carbon, but also

594
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.949
other critical gasses. Methane, for example, methane is a

595
00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:55.438
very uh intense greenhouse gas. And so, we can

596
00:34:55.438 --> 00:35:00.510
demonstrate precisely that um This phenomenon occurs. We can

597
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.949
do experiments and anyone who has listened to us

598
00:35:02.949 --> 00:35:06.149
can do the experiment and prove unequivocally that this

599
00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:10.629
phenomenon occurs. Second, we have unequivocal evidence that the

600
00:35:10.629 --> 00:35:13.860
concentration of uh, of greenhouse gasses on the atmosphere

601
00:35:14.229 --> 00:35:17.989
is, has been accumulating dramatically over the last few

602
00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:21.469
decades, uh, perhaps a couple of centuries. We have

603
00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:24.110
made the measurements. There's no question the data can

604
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.429
be actually seen by anybody who wants to see

605
00:35:26.429 --> 00:35:30.100
the data. It started with the Mount Aloa uh

606
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.409
station measuring the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere.

607
00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:36.169
And now we know it would take courses of

608
00:35:36.169 --> 00:35:42.000
ice, frozen. Uh, ICE and frozen substrate from the

609
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.600
North Pole or the South poles, and we can

610
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.040
actually measure the amount of carbon in those cores

611
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.959
going back hundreds and thousands of years and compare

612
00:35:49.959 --> 00:35:52.959
what we have today, we can see clearly that

613
00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:56.649
uh since we appeared, particularly since the industrial revolution,

614
00:35:56.959 --> 00:35:59.879
we have increased dramatically the concentration of greenhouse gasses.

615
00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:03.320
We increased, no question, we increased the, the abundance

616
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.120
of greenhouse gasses and then we know from the

617
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.560
experiments and from the observation that these greenhouse gasses

618
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.830
create this increasing temperature. Amazingly enough, Ricardo. We do

619
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:18.100
know that naturally, after the last glaciation, the planet

620
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.870
had a temperature that remains stable and created the

621
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.199
conditions for civilization to occur. But then naturally, the

622
00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:28.949
planet underwent a process of going down in temperature.

623
00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:31.790
There, there was a cooling process of, of, uh,

624
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.879
of the planet. Probably that had to do with

625
00:36:33.879 --> 00:36:37.320
the inclination of the uh Earth's axis. So naturally,

626
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.780
the planet was going, was becoming cooler, but then

627
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.520
we appeared, and then what that tendency that, that

628
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.989
the planet had, we changed the trajectory in the,

629
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.139
in the other way dramatically. So, if anybody who's

630
00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:53.699
listening to us has an alternative explanation for the

631
00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:56.989
climate change driven by humanity, that person should nominate

632
00:36:56.989 --> 00:36:59.500
himself or herself to the Nobel Prize because that

633
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.949
would be an incredible thing to, to, to accept.

634
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.580
We have every single piece of evidence uh showing

635
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.510
that that is the case. In the case of

636
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.229
uh the loss of biological diversity, the areas that

637
00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:16.379
we, we know that the areas have had limited

638
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:20.030
human of, uh, uh, I'm sorry, limited impact of

639
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.110
humans. For example, the most remote locations in the

640
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.949
Amazon, the most remote location in the Arctic or

641
00:37:25.949 --> 00:37:29.010
the Antarctic, even though those are showing evidence of

642
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.110
human activity, but they tend to have a configuration

643
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.750
of biodiversity that we don't have in the areas

644
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.080
where humanity is developing. Uh, URBAN areas, uh, intensive

645
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.719
agriculture, uh, those kinds of things. So, we have

646
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:47.000
very clear evidence. We have natural protected areas, areas

647
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.949
that we, humanity, have set aside. To, uh, uh,

648
00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:54.679
safeguard biodiversity in those areas. Well, if you compare

649
00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:58.149
those areas that we, uh, we are protecting actively

650
00:37:58.399 --> 00:38:01.429
compared to adjacent areas which we are not protecting,

651
00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.080
and you measure the biodiversity in those areas, there's

652
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.239
no question in equivocally that our human enterprise is

653
00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:10.790
creating those changes. So, we really need to uh

654
00:38:10.959 --> 00:38:14.379
um I mean, listen to this conversation and also,

655
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.429
if we are not being able to convince the

656
00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:18.870
people who are listening to us, they can go

657
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.909
back to the literature, they can go back to

658
00:38:20.909 --> 00:38:24.709
the clear tangible evidence that all of these activities

659
00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:28.080
are driven by, by what we do today.

660
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.149
So now for the last part of our conversation

661
00:38:32.149 --> 00:38:33.780
today, I would like to ask you a little

662
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:39.020
bit more about potential consequences that these extinction crisis,

663
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.939
if it goes on, of course, uh could have

664
00:38:41.939 --> 00:38:46.969
for us humans. So, how can it actually impact

665
00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:48.179
uh humans?

666
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.719
Yes, um, we do know, Ricardo, we've been take

667
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.129
a historical lesson from, from the history of the,

668
00:38:56.139 --> 00:38:59.300
of the life of the planet. It is interesting

669
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.219
to share this with the with your audience. The

670
00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:05.610
5 mass extinctions that have occurred in the past,

671
00:39:05.979 --> 00:39:10.899
um we know that they obliterated biodiversity. But as

672
00:39:10.899 --> 00:39:13.179
we have seen, as we can see in the

673
00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:17.669
planet, life has been able to come back. No

674
00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:20.350
question about that. Take the case again of the

675
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.629
extinction of the dinosaurs. Only, only 65 million years

676
00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:28.149
ago. And now, Ricardo, as far as we can

677
00:39:28.149 --> 00:39:30.929
tell, now at this moment, where in this last

678
00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:35.189
millennia, we have the maximum biological richness that the

679
00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:38.169
planet has had in its 4 billion years of

680
00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:42.050
evolution. So you can see that after a massive

681
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.439
extinction, life came back and in fact, it became

682
00:39:45.439 --> 00:39:52.209
explosive diversification. Problem is, 22 elements here. One, the

683
00:39:52.209 --> 00:39:55.110
process of recovery of biodiversity to the level that

684
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.469
we had before the extinction, the mass extinction process

685
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.729
takes millions of years. Probably in the case of

686
00:40:01.729 --> 00:40:05.570
vertebrates, the recovery of the same level of regions

687
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.860
that we had before is about 10 million years.

688
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:14.219
So, for the humanity, for us as species, having

689
00:40:14.469 --> 00:40:17.929
the idea that, OK, we can be relaxed because

690
00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:20.389
the the biodiversity will come back to its previous

691
00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:23.909
level is not consolidation because it will take 100

692
00:40:23.909 --> 00:40:26.149
million years. And I don't think you and I

693
00:40:26.149 --> 00:40:28.189
are planning to live 10 million years to see

694
00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:32.040
the recovery of biodiversity. That is unthinkable for us.

695
00:40:32.419 --> 00:40:35.459
But second of all, what comes back after the

696
00:40:35.459 --> 00:40:38.649
mass extinction process is very different to what you

697
00:40:38.649 --> 00:40:42.209
had before. Again, the case of dinosaurs at that

698
00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:45.250
time, the dominant animals of the planet were the

699
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.209
reptiles. Now, the dominant animals on the planet are

700
00:40:48.209 --> 00:40:52.719
birds and mammals. So very different configuration of biodiversity

701
00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:55.570
and many years for it to recover. So that

702
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.929
is no consolation for humanity. And another thing is

703
00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:04.540
that um you know, to be perfectly um bold

704
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.919
with the audience who are listening to us. We

705
00:41:06.919 --> 00:41:10.959
might be able to survive multiple years, multiple decades,

706
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.000
probably multiple centuries with drastic changes on the climatic

707
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.679
conditions. And there's gonna be a tremendous impact on

708
00:41:17.679 --> 00:41:21.070
society on those. Um, BUT probably that is not

709
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.350
going to be, uh, a massive elimination of the

710
00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:29.510
human species. But if we eliminate biodiversity, probably we

711
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.389
will not be able to survive just a few

712
00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:35.229
decades. We eat biodiversity, we eat the results of

713
00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:39.350
biodiversity. So hopefully, conveying these ideas to the people

714
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:43.500
who are listening to us will appreciate. Uh, AND

715
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.090
I'm really, uh, thankful that you do these kinds

716
00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:50.699
of, um, of, um, dissemination issues of science, Ricardo,

717
00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:55.060
because people can appreciate the significance of this phenomenon,

718
00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.729
the loss of biodiversity, because, as I say and

719
00:41:58.729 --> 00:42:03.439
I insist, the planet will come back, the the

720
00:42:03.449 --> 00:42:07.280
natural elements of the planet. In different modalities and,

721
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.679
and after many millions of years, will come back.

722
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.649
But what is really the existential threat on the

723
00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:16.250
planet is the survival of the species that goes

724
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.729
by the name of Homo sapiens. It sounds bold

725
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:24.330
and, and um perhaps like a ghastly um conclusion,

726
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:27.909
but I think it is a responsibility to tell

727
00:42:27.909 --> 00:42:30.909
things as they are. But at the same time,

728
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.639
I want to make sure that we conclude by

729
00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:35.820
saying that there is much to be done and

730
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.870
much that we can do to prevent this, this

731
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:43.360
massive extinction. First of all, Having an educated and

732
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.040
well, um, a society that is well-informed society, by

733
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.560
mechanisms such as the one you do this dissemination

734
00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:55.320
episodes of podcasts is very important because we need

735
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.239
to understand this phenomenon not only within the scientific

736
00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:02.570
community, but the public in general. Once we have

737
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.729
uh this um appreciation, what all of these uh

738
00:43:05.729 --> 00:43:08.760
become part of the imagination of society at large,

739
00:43:09.129 --> 00:43:12.540
they will be able to demand when you have

740
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.370
elections in a given country or in a given

741
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.899
town. That the, uh uh that the candidates will

742
00:43:18.899 --> 00:43:21.489
present an agenda as to how they will address

743
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.979
climate change, biodiversity change, land use change, and so

744
00:43:24.979 --> 00:43:28.250
on. So we need to have this bottom-up, uh,

745
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:33.040
pressure or impulse from us by being prepared. We

746
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.560
need to protect what we have of natural reserves

747
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.120
at the moment. Only 17%, about 17% of nature

748
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.120
has been set aside for conservation. We need to

749
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.520
make sure that those areas are definitely well maintained

750
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.820
and safeguarded by diversity because they will be the

751
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.489
source of repopulation. About the invest in other areas

752
00:43:54.489 --> 00:43:59.560
if we become more, um more um wise, wiser

753
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.629
and protect other areas as well. In addition to

754
00:44:02.629 --> 00:44:05.850
that, Ricardo, many of the areas where we have

755
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.409
the last remaining of the rest of the planet

756
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:12.399
belong to indigenous and native populations. So we need

757
00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:15.919
to understand that. And appreciate the significance of those

758
00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:19.570
populations in safeguarding bioverity for us at the moment.

759
00:44:19.889 --> 00:44:22.810
We need to find mechanisms of compensating, making sure

760
00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.489
that they will not be forced to have a

761
00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:29.080
life that uh forced them to continue impacting nature.

762
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.560
We need to compensate. There's a thing called um

763
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:36.639
payment for environmental services. In many countries in Latin

764
00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:38.909
America and other parts of the world, there are

765
00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:42.959
institutions who are uh financially supporting local communities if

766
00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:47.030
they commit to maintain their natural ecosystem because they

767
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.840
are the sort of the, the stakeholders of this

768
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.649
biodiversity, the main stakeholders of this biodiversity. We need

769
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:58.010
to, uh, uh, think about our habits of feeding

770
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.189
habits as a, as a human species. The excessive

771
00:45:02.189 --> 00:45:06.090
consumption of meat brings about much deforestation, brings about

772
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:10.135
much carbon emissions, it brings about health. Problems. I

773
00:45:10.135 --> 00:45:11.935
don't mean to say that tomorrow we should be

774
00:45:11.935 --> 00:45:15.415
vegetarian, everybody, but we should be able to gradually

775
00:45:15.415 --> 00:45:18.014
balance our diet in such a way that we

776
00:45:18.014 --> 00:45:21.044
reduce all of those multiple drivers of, of, um,

777
00:45:21.165 --> 00:45:24.814
of, uh, of change, negative change in our natural

778
00:45:24.814 --> 00:45:27.709
resources. And of course, Ricardo, I think we need

779
00:45:27.709 --> 00:45:31.429
to appreciate the beauty and, and um inspiration that

780
00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.949
we have from nature and biodiversity because that is

781
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:38.070
also, you know, enrichment of our spirit and also

782
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.870
a moral um ethical uh appreciation of uh what

783
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.060
we have today is a result of an incredible

784
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.870
process of trial and error that took 4 billion

785
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.070
years for us to have the richness that we

786
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.570
have on the planet today. I think it's a

787
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:58.179
cosmic responsibility to enjoy, appreciate, and in so doing,

788
00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:02.179
hopefully safeguarding, safeguarding our own species.

789
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:07.090
So I think that's a great note to end

790
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:10.409
on, Doctor Dzu. And just before we go, would

791
00:46:10.409 --> 00:46:12.810
you like to tell people where they can find

792
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.000
you and your work on the internet?

793
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.570
Yes, um, so I would be delighted to, um

794
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.449
