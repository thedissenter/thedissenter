00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.019
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.170
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.130
today I'm joined by your return guest, Doctor Peter

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.289
Evanson. He's professor of philosophy and the host of

5
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.329
the weekly podcast, History of Philosophy Without any Gaps.

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.450
I will be leaving a link to our first.

7
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.450
Interview which was about the pre-Socratic philosophers in the

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.969
description down below. And today we're talking about his

9
00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:31.719
book Heirs of Avicenna Philosophy in the Islamic East

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.169
12th, 13th Century. So, Dr. Adamson, welcome back to

11
00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.919
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:40.970
Thank you so much. Great to be back.

13
00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.790
So since we're going to talk here about the

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.279
hairs of Avicenna and philosophy in the what they

15
00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.240
call the Islamic East in the 12th and 13th

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.680
centuries, let me start by asking you first about

17
00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.599
Avin himself. So who was Evin?

18
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:05.040
Right, OK, so Avicenna, who I these days actually

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.379
prefer to call Esina, so. When we first started

20
00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:11.819
doing this project, that my colleagues and I who

21
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.019
put the books together, um, I was still kind

22
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.169
of in the habit of using the English name,

23
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:20.339
which is based on the Latin name Avicenna, but

24
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.180
nowadays I sort of gravitated towards calling him Ensina,

25
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.860
which is his real name, but whatever you call

26
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.459
him, he lived in Central Asia, so he's from

27
00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.459
right on the border of modern day Afghanistan and

28
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.930
Uzbekistan. And he lived from the 10th into the

29
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.410
11th century, so he died in 1037 CE. And

30
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.980
he's the most important philosopher of the Islamic world.

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.760
uh, HE It's it's hard to kind of capture

32
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.519
his achievement in just a few sentences, but I'll

33
00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.080
try. So one way to think about what happened

34
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.260
is that In around the 8th, 9th, early 10th

35
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.540
century, there was an effort to translate a massive

36
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.860
amount of Greek science and philosophy into Arabic. So

37
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.500
by the middle of the 10th century, you have

38
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.258
philosophers like, for example, Al Farabi, who's quite well

39
00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:13.059
known, working in Iraq and Syria, who was able

40
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.100
to read, for example, pretty much all the same

41
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.330
Aristotle that we can read, but in Arabic translation,

42
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.779
and was also aware of other Greek sources like

43
00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.479
Neoplatonism and so on. Um, EVEN knew something about

44
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.419
Plato, although his access to Plato would have been

45
00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.679
a lot less good than his access to Aristotle.

46
00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.559
And Faravi is typical of what happens in the

47
00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.800
first couple of centuries after that translation movement, which

48
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.639
is that philosophers who are writing in Arabic, and

49
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.679
by the way, they might be Christians as well

50
00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.960
as Muslims, so Faravi was a Muslim, but a

51
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.600
lot of these people are Christians who are doing

52
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.570
this in Arabic. They um are commenting on Aristotle,

53
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.699
they're writing treatises of their own independent treatises where

54
00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.410
they reflect on the Greek heritage, maybe combine it

55
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.330
with ideas from Islam or Christianity, or even Judaism,

56
00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.850
um, and so you have this kind of multi-religious

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.820
effort to come to grips with and build upon

58
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.559
Greek philosophical heritage. Then I Messina comes along. And

59
00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.399
he does the same thing, in effect, except that

60
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:25.919
he does it much more innovatively, boldly, provocatively, and

61
00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.410
also this kind of a long story, but he

62
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.110
weaves in a lot of ideas and problems from

63
00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.160
the Islamic theological tradition. We might come back to

64
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.509
that later. So the result is that instead of

65
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.399
getting someone who's just kind of explaining Aristotle to

66
00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.240
you or using Aristotle's ideas but kind of building

67
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.779
on them in a incremental way. He blows Greek

68
00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.250
philosophy out of the water by and they sort

69
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.509
of puts it back the pieces back together into

70
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.309
a new system with his own terminology, his own

71
00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.190
set of philosophical problems, his own, uh, even way

72
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.559
of arranging the, the curriculum of philosophical and scientific

73
00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:09.309
studies, and he effectively replaces Aristotle as the philosopher

74
00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:15.440
to whom everyone wants to respond. Um, NOW, The,

75
00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.170
I mean this would get it more into the

76
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.890
actual book that we produced, but one thing that's

77
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.399
worth knowing is that out in the Islamic West,

78
00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:28.839
so in Spain. You have figures like especially Avaroy

79
00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:33.890
or Iru, who are still commenting on Aristotle. But

80
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.690
that's kind of an, I mean that's actually very

81
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.250
important historically because his commentaries on Aristotle were translated

82
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.809
translated into Latin and used a lot in Latin

83
00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.010
scholasticism, but in the area that we're focusing on

84
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.130
the Islamic East, which is the main heartlands of

85
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.450
the Islamic world, it's really Messa who's of interest

86
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.200
to everybody.

87
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.209
Right. And uh, I mean, of course, it would

88
00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:01.410
be, I guess, hard for you to probably even

89
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.760
summarize it, but what were Evin's main contributions to

90
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.829
philosophy? I mean just in general terms.

91
00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:13.970
Right, OK. Well, so you're right, it's difficult, uh,

92
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.410
in part because he innovates in pretty much every

93
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.649
area that he discusses. Probably the only areas where

94
00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:25.920
he's not really, um, Moving the conversation ahead massively

95
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.279
would be ethics and political philosophy, even now he

96
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.760
has interesting things to say, but he has interesting

97
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.320
things to say in the way that some of

98
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.799
his other contemporaries do, I would say. In, but

99
00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:39.519
on every other area of philosophy, he's massively new,

100
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.559
um, even if he is always thinking about Aristotle

101
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.369
and Greek philosophy as well, as well as Islamic

102
00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:49.839
Islamic theology or Kala. So his, he's always thinking

103
00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.480
about these sources, but his new system is really

104
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.750
something new, um. Maybe the three things that would

105
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.089
be worth highlighting. First of all, logic. So in

106
00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.720
logic, he has a new way of thinking about

107
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.369
how logic fits together, which um incorporates and significantly

108
00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:15.519
expands the Aristotelian logic. So later works on logic

109
00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:16.950
and as we might get on to talking about

110
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.000
they're really interested in logic in the period we're

111
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.839
looking at. They write textbooks on logic that are

112
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.230
clearly based on Avicenna's logic and not Aristotle's logic,

113
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.040
OK? And the of course this is logic so

114
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.559
the details are rather technical. I mean I can

115
00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.440
go into them if you want, but they're not

116
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.119
easy to understand and explain, um, but that's 11

117
00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:41.000
thing. Another thing is is theory of the soul.

118
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.970
So something that's very famous is that he has

119
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.690
this thought experiment, the flying man thought experiment. The

120
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.690
basic idea is, um, you're supposed to imagine that

121
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.190
God creates a human being floating in midair. And

122
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.510
this human being has no way of using their

123
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.600
senses at all, so he's blindfolded and there's no

124
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:05.670
noise, there's no smell or there's nothing he can

125
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.230
taste, right? And he's not touching anything because he's

126
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.000
floating in midair. Right. Mhm. So, uh, the point

127
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.679
of this just is that this is a person

128
00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:20.260
who has no sensory input at all. Like a

129
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.540
sort of like a sensory deprivation tank, but even

130
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.380
more extreme, um, in, in part because he's never

131
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.339
had any sensory experiences before either, so he doesn't

132
00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.019
have any memory of ever having touched anything or

133
00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.670
smelled anything or seen anything. And so you might

134
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.829
think, well, a person like that would just kind

135
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:41.190
of be vacant or blank in their mind because

136
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.589
they haven't had any input, right? But if Messina

137
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.869
says no, this person would be aware of his

138
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:49.309
own existence, so he'd be sort of able to

139
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:51.380
think, oh, here I am, or something like that,

140
00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:54.869
right? He'd be aware of his own thoughts maybe.

141
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:59.739
And he says that. This shows that the soul

142
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:04.019
is separate from the body, because he's unaware of

143
00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:06.140
his body, but he's aware of his self, that

144
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.700
so that means his body and his self are

145
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.130
not identical. OK, that's the flying man thought experiment.

146
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.209
So that's a very famous thing that he does,

147
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.089
and it makes self-awareness a really crucial part of

148
00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:19.820
later reflections on the nature of the soul and

149
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.700
the self. Um, THERE'S more to his theory of

150
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.100
soul than that, of course, but that's one of

151
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.399
the main things that he does there. And then

152
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.729
Even more radical and new and interesting is what

153
00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:37.140
he does in metaphysics. And so, uh, again, this

154
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.820
is quite a long story, but effective what it

155
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.058
kind of boils down to is that he puts

156
00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:45.940
the concept of existence at the center of his

157
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.349
metaphysics. So instead of thinking about God as the

158
00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:53.950
cause of the motion of the universe, as Aristotle

159
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.789
had done, he thinks of God as the the

160
00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:59.849
source of existence for everything. And he makes this

161
00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:02.849
pivotal contrast between essence and existence, which we'll probably

162
00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:05.450
get on to talking about more. The basic idea

163
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.650
here is just that what something is, won't tell

164
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.849
you whether it exists. So like a triangle, what

165
00:09:11.849 --> 00:09:13.250
it is, will tell you that it has 3

166
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.289
sides and that its internal angles are equal to

167
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:19.609
180 degrees, but there's nothing about triangle that guarantees

168
00:09:19.609 --> 00:09:23.429
that it exists, right? So existence turns out to

169
00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:26.109
be this kind of extrinsic feature of things that

170
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:29.619
comes to them from the outside. And God gives

171
00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:31.900
it to them, and he, he thinks through that

172
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.539
in lots of different ways and that gives him

173
00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:37.460
a um a kind of way into metaphysics, that's

174
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.299
very different from Aristotle's metaphysics.

175
00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:45.150
So with philosophy in the Islamic East and of

176
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.469
course we're going to get later on into some

177
00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:51.659
more of the main topics that were explored by

178
00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:55.989
Evin and his hairs in the Islamic East. But

179
00:09:55.989 --> 00:09:59.650
uh would philosophy in the Islamic East compare in

180
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.510
any way to the scholastic tradition that we have

181
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.780
in Europe?

182
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:07.770
Very much so, yeah, in fact, something that um

183
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.570
I often say about this material that we've assembled

184
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.650
for the heirs of Avicenna books is that it's

185
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.289
like Latin scholasticism in many ways, except that it's

186
00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:22.229
earlier, right, because Latin scholasticism kind of gets going

187
00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:25.409
in the 13th century and keeps going actually all

188
00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:27.380
the way up into the 17th century or even

189
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.289
longer, whereas this kind of post Avicennon highly detailed.

190
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.169
Engagements with seen as ideas, lots of distinctions, lots

191
00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:40.890
of technical vocabulary, lots of arguments, so even things

192
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.690
like there will be a question and then 7

193
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.570
different arguments on one side of the question, and

194
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.690
12 arguments on the other side, just like in

195
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.760
a scholastic Latin treatise that would have been written

196
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.239
in the University of Paris in the 13th century,

197
00:10:53.489 --> 00:10:55.090
you find all that in the 12th century in

198
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.489
Arabic. So, uh, and some of the things we'll

199
00:10:59.489 --> 00:11:04.210
probably get on to discussing also have thematic parallels

200
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.400
in Latin scholastic philosophy. So these are very parallel

201
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.340
traditions. Um, THE reason for the parallels are complex,

202
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.309
so it has something to do with the fact

203
00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:22.429
that in both contexts you have educational institutions that

204
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.979
Give rise to that kind of writing, so you

205
00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:27.700
have like masters sitting with students, taking them through

206
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.780
a difficult text, making lots of distinctions, you know,

207
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.309
getting them to master the vocabulary and the concepts.

208
00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:36.979
So that's one reason why there's so much um

209
00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:40.260
parallel, so many parallels, but another reason is that

210
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.250
in both contexts and seen as the source, right?

211
00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:46.219
So the Latin scholastics are reading Avicenna and my

212
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:48.929
guys are reading Eina and they're the same guy,

213
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:50.979
right? Yeah, so that's another reason why you have

214
00:11:50.979 --> 00:11:51.950
so many parallels.

215
00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:57.140
So to just provide a little bit more of

216
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.340
historical and intellectual context here in the, in the

217
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.289
book you mentioned that uh quote, in the middle

218
00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:08.780
of the 11th century, the two predominant philosophical traditions

219
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.090
in the Islamic world were Falsaha and Kalam. You,

220
00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:17.690
you've already mentioned Kalam earlier a little bit, but

221
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.250
what were these traditions about and why do they

222
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.979
matter to then contextualize the influence of Avis and

223
00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:29.630
uh and how his philosophy relates to these traditions?

224
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.929
Right, OK. So Falsa, so F A L S

225
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:36.530
A F A, if you were writing it out

226
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.729
in English letters. Um, Fasofa is just an Arabic

227
00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:43.330
version of the Greek word philosophia, right? So it's

228
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.520
the word philosophy, our word philosophy, but in Arabic,

229
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.049
and it was used to refer to Both philosophy

230
00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:53.409
and what we would call science, so it could

231
00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:56.570
include things like astronomy or physics, right? Um, SO

232
00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.690
it's, it's that. But it very clearly indicates something

233
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.530
that comes from the Greeks, and you that's important

234
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.130
that the word is a Greek word, right? So

235
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.760
this would be like I said before Al Farabi

236
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.169
or earlier than healindi, or that there are some

237
00:13:12.169 --> 00:13:15.330
other philosophers too which maybe would be confusing to

238
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.859
name them all, but there's a whole bunch of

239
00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:19.890
philosophers who are doing this Greek inspired kind of

240
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.010
philosophy and itsina is one of them. So, something

241
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.750
that we see happening is that because he replaces

242
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.780
Aristotle as the main philosopher. In the later tradition,

243
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.090
they start using the word fasafa to refer to

244
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.419
sina. Right, so they know that Aristotle is also

245
00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:39.700
kind of behind it, right? And they will talk

246
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.580
about Aristotle too occasionally, but if you don't, if

247
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.140
you see a reference to Phiafa or the philosophers.

248
00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:50.690
Without further context in the later period in the

249
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.530
post Iveson period, it's always a reference either to

250
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.770
Evanina or to Mina and people who agree with

251
00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:01.809
him, OK. So that's philosopher Kalam. It's a bit

252
00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:05.489
more complicated. Sokalla is a word that we use

253
00:14:05.489 --> 00:14:10.000
and was already used then for a theological tradition

254
00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:12.710
that begins around the same time as the translation

255
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.609
movement actually, so it gets going in the 8th

256
00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:19.989
9th century. And this is a tradition of people

257
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.039
using rational arguments to defend certain readings of the

258
00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:28.640
Quran and Islamic theology generally, so they will argue

259
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.250
about things like the status of divine attributes, whether

260
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.599
or not humans have free will, um, what are

261
00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:39.669
the conditions of moral responsibility. Um, WHAT are bodies

262
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:42.070
made of? Are they made of atoms? They usually

263
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.619
say yes. So one difference, like a real sign

264
00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:47.390
of the difference between Fasaha and Kalam, is that

265
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.479
the Mutta Kalimun, the theo so people who do

266
00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:53.830
kalam are called Mutta Kalimun, right? That's that's means

267
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.390
theologians, and they are they very strongly tend to

268
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.349
endorse atomism, so they think that created things are

269
00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:09.229
these indivisible. Substances to which God associates various properties

270
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.479
like motion or rest, for example. Um, SO they

271
00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.409
think that and the philosophers, the people who are

272
00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.840
inspired by Greek philosophy like Aristotle, they deny that

273
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.969
and they reject atomism, which is true of Essa

274
00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:26.489
as well. Um, SO what, so I mean traditionally

275
00:15:26.489 --> 00:15:28.770
people have thought, well, there's theology and they're very

276
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.130
worried about the Koran and whatever, and there's the

277
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.489
philosophers who are reading Aristotle, but nowadays I think

278
00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:37.570
the field, people in the field mostly agree that

279
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.369
a better way to think about it is that

280
00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:42.440
you have these two traditions going along. In both

281
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.989
of them are philosophical discussions and positions being defended.

282
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.159
It's just that they're primarily responding on the one

283
00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.479
hand to the Islamic revelation and they have their

284
00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:55.700
hand to the Greek tradition, right? And then they,

285
00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:58.919
they could see that the doctrines and arguments were

286
00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:01.520
clashing and so one of the things that Messina

287
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.359
was trying to do was sort out the differences

288
00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:04.559
between Kalam and Fasipfa.

289
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.760
Mhm. Right, and in the book, you also talk

290
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.179
a little bit about the formative period characterized by

291
00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:17.539
a contest, a contest between Avin and Kalam. I

292
00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:21.580
mean, what is this formative period about and how

293
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.890
did it play out?

294
00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:26.059
Yeah, so, uh, I mean, I, I maybe I've

295
00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:28.299
used the word form, the words formative period in

296
00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:31.130
different ways in different contexts. So sometimes I use

297
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.700
that phrase to just mean the time up to

298
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.340
Avisana orsina, but here, I mean, we could also

299
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.880
think about The kind of formative period of post-Avisanian

300
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.760
philosophy, so what happens right after him, and here

301
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.330
the main figure is probably El Khazzali. Who died

302
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.919
in 1111. So again in Messina died 1037, so

303
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:55.130
less than a century later, and Vasali is a

304
00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.690
major theologian who writes a lot, and one of

305
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.890
his most famous works is called The Incoherence of

306
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.270
the Philosophers, the Hafual philosoper. And that's a really

307
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.108
good example of something I just mentioned, which is

308
00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:13.300
that the word philosophy or philosophers now means Essina

309
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.670
and Avicenan philosophy. It doesn't mean Aristotle, so when

310
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.868
he's attacking Essina, he's attacking, sorry, when he's attacking

311
00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:23.858
the philosophers, he's attacking Essina, not Aristotle anymore. Uh,

312
00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:28.318
SO what he does is to go through a

313
00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:32.078
bunch of points in Messina's philosophy that he thinks

314
00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:36.519
are wrong, be badly argued for by Messina, and

315
00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:40.198
C, have a problematic relationship to Islam. So for

316
00:17:40.198 --> 00:17:44.428
example, notoriously, Messina thinks that the universe is eternal.

317
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:48.229
So it it is generated by God. God makes

318
00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:51.229
it exist, as I said before, but eternally, so

319
00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:54.109
there's no first moment in time for the universe,

320
00:17:54.469 --> 00:17:57.949
whereas traditionally in Kalam, people had said that the

321
00:17:57.949 --> 00:18:01.479
world does begin in time, and Ghazali very strong

322
00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:06.040
strongly defends that position. Um, THAT'S one example. He

323
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.060
also complains, for example, that have been seen a

324
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.479
can't account for miracles. Um, HE challenges him on

325
00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:15.670
other points about how God relates to the universe

326
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.069
and so on. Um, SO sometimes people think of

327
00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:22.930
Khazali as the sort of anti-hilosopher. But actually he's

328
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.869
more like a philosophically minded theologian who's attacking certain

329
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.250
ideas of Esina. So actually there's other ideas of

330
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.239
Esina that he quite likes, for example, Amessina's logic,

331
00:18:34.449 --> 00:18:36.930
he thinks is sort of fine and and in

332
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.530
fact he's quite satirical and dismissive about people who

333
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.790
don't think logic is worthwhile, so he didn't see,

334
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.449
you know, these people are idiots that they don't

335
00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:48.089
even do logic, right? So he's not by any

336
00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:50.650
means a kind of across the board anti philosopher.

337
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.050
But he's a critical. Respondent to Messina, and there's

338
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.930
some other less famous people who do the same

339
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:02.859
thing, like Asha Hostani and uh Sharif Adina Masodi,

340
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.290
who also write kind of critical responses tossina around

341
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.170
the same time. So there's a whole kind of

342
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.369
wave of initial responses to Messina, where they are

343
00:19:12.369 --> 00:19:15.489
criticizing him, but by the same token, there are

344
00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:19.219
also people starting with Issina's own students. For example,

345
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.520
one of his main students is named Bachmanyar. And

346
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.839
they write defenses of and kind of summaries of

347
00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:31.310
Esso's philosophy. Sometimes these are important because they present

348
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.040
Esso's philosophy so nice and clearly and in fairly

349
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.280
short space that people just respond to the students

350
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.680
instead of reading a Messina. Right, but it's certainly

351
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.810
like Avison in philosophy, what they're doing, so you

352
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.270
can see that already even in the first generation

353
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.930
or two after Esina, the battle lines are already

354
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.479
being drawn. There's kind of promossina and anti-sina voices,

355
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.839
and what's going to happen as we go forward

356
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.859
is that people will increasingly Sort of step back

357
00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:02.540
from this debate, so they think, OK, there's the

358
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.939
Kalam tradition, which is at first been very critical

359
00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:09.719
of Messina. There's this what we're now calling Fasaho,

360
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.979
which is just Avicen in philosophy, which is inspired

361
00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.469
by Aristotle but is kind of different and reworked,

362
00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:18.520
and they are passing judgment on that in some

363
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.520
way, and then that would be sort of the

364
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.479
next phase of development.

365
00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:27.390
So how did you go about writing this book?

366
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:32.069
Because taking into account the huge corpus of works

367
00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:35.020
from this period of time, which I wasn't really

368
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.390
aware at all before listening to your podcast and

369
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.219
reading your book, what methodology did you use?

370
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.339
So that's the first one. So there's gonna be

371
00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:52.459
and that it's that big, right? So this is

372
00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:55.969
800 something pages I guess. No, sorry, 700 pages,

373
00:20:56.219 --> 00:20:58.300
but the second one, so this is uh this

374
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.920
is volume one, and it's on metaphysics and theology.

375
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.979
The second volume is on logic and epistemology, and

376
00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:07.660
it's even longer. And the third one I hope

377
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.939
will be done in the next in within a

378
00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:11.979
year or so and go to Preston, and that's

379
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:15.469
on physics and psychology. So how did we do

380
00:21:15.469 --> 00:21:17.069
this because as you can see it was a

381
00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:21.349
lot of work. So, um, I mean, part of

382
00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:23.270
the answer is we got a lot of funding

383
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.459
from the German Research Council, the DFK, so Deutschevoch

384
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:31.819
Meschaft, um, who supported the project by a lot

385
00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:36.270
and allowed or enabled me to hire several postdoctoral

386
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.430
fellows, and for this first book, the postdoc relevant

387
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.069
person was Fedor Bennovich. And for the second book,

388
00:21:45.079 --> 00:21:49.589
it's him plus someone else named Dustin Klinger, and

389
00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:51.780
then for the 3rd book, we have several people,

390
00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:54.609
so we have Michael Noble, uh, we have Sarah

391
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:57.109
Vergy, and Andreas Lamar. So these were all these

392
00:21:57.109 --> 00:22:00.930
postdocs who were working together with me. And their

393
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:06.040
job was to go through this mountain of texts

394
00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:10.930
and find passages worth translating. So I mean, you

395
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.010
might think, OK, well we just translated everything and

396
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.930
that's why it's so long, but actually so to

397
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.650
give you some sense of like how much material

398
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.060
we're talking about, this is an extremely selective. So

399
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.739
extremely selective selected selection can I say that ass

400
00:22:26.739 --> 00:22:31.819
selected choice of just individual passages from the works

401
00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:35.380
of a couple of dozen philosophers, some of whom

402
00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:40.180
each wrote numerous works. So, um, for example, one

403
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.140
of the main philosophers who we quote from a

404
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.859
lot who I, I guess we'll probably get on

405
00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:48.140
to talking about Fahaddin Arazi. Fahaddin wrote like a

406
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.930
shelf or two worth of stuff about philosophy. So

407
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.969
if you translated everything that he wrote, it would

408
00:22:53.969 --> 00:22:57.130
be many, it would be thousands of pages, thousands

409
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.489
of thousands of pages just for him, maybe not

410
00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:01.650
thousands and thousands, but if you translated all his

411
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.810
philosophical works, I'm confident that it would be a

412
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.369
couple of 1000 pages at least just for one

413
00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:12.400
guy, right? So obviously we couldn't translate everything. So

414
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.239
instead, what we did was we, we kind of

415
00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:17.239
sat down and came up with a list of

416
00:23:17.239 --> 00:23:19.560
what we thought would be the most interesting topics.

417
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.229
And each chapter in the book is has the

418
00:23:23.229 --> 00:23:27.069
name of a philosophical topic like for example, proofs

419
00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:31.989
for God's existence, right? And then the and so

420
00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:35.390
in this case Fedor, the postdoctoral researcher who by

421
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.030
the way is now a lecturer at the University

422
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:42.280
of Edinburgh. Um, HE went through hundreds and hundreds

423
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.390
of pages of material on proofs of God's existence,

424
00:23:45.719 --> 00:23:48.520
just kind of skimming them, really, because it's a

425
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.510
lot of the material they're responding to each other,

426
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.839
they're quoting each other so often you would read

427
00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.199
a page and you think, OK, I know what

428
00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.959
this is, so I can go on, right? And

429
00:23:56.959 --> 00:24:00.520
what he did was to find um the most

430
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.239
sort of interesting philosophically interesting and original moves being

431
00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:08.119
made within this debate. He did a draft translation

432
00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:10.760
of the passages that he wanted to include, and

433
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.199
then I went through and um sort of adjusted

434
00:24:14.199 --> 00:24:18.000
the translations, and then my other job was to

435
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.280
write an introduction for each chapter, and then he

436
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.000
adjusted my introduction, so we kind of worked on

437
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.800
each other's parts. Um, SOMETIMES we decided to take

438
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.280
passages out or put new passages in, but that's

439
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.839
basically what we did. So this, and this took

440
00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:35.000
like, um, I mean the whole project took 6

441
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.189
years. So we have 6 years of research fellows

442
00:24:38.189 --> 00:24:41.270
sitting in the office next to me, plowing through

443
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:48.189
all this Arabic um uh textual evidence. Sometimes, by

444
00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:51.079
the way, we didn't have additions for the text,

445
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:55.810
so they only had scans of manuscripts, um. Sometimes

446
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.640
the works we were looking at are in Persian,

447
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.650
but mostly it's Arabic. For one author whose name

448
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.050
is Ba Hebraeus, we even have text in Syriac.

449
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.680
Which is another Semitic language, um. Which actually I

450
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.680
can't read, but my post so a couple of

451
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.199
my postdocs could read it. So, um, right, so

452
00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:17.280
we, so after selecting all that, translating it, then

453
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.040
I wrote the introductions and that's really what the

454
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.199
book is. Something else we did by the way,

455
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.209
is that um I was able also with support

456
00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:28.160
from the DFGO was able to fund people who

457
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.339
were typing up the original texts. So there's a

458
00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:36.579
website, um, if, if you just look for heirs

459
00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:40.819
of Avicenna, I think it's heirs of Avicenna.net. Um,

460
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.260
YOU have all of the original texts in Arabic

461
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.579
and Persian available as a free PDF. Oh, and

462
00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:50.099
by the way, the books are free too cause

463
00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:51.739
they're open access. So if you just go to

464
00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:53.699
the bro website, you can download them for free.

465
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.969
So everything is free. Mhm.

466
00:25:57.239 --> 00:25:59.699
Right. I mean, and how much of the original

467
00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:02.199
material has been preserved,

468
00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:06.180
preserved. Yeah. So you don't mean included in our

469
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.089
books actually no,

470
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.660
but actually preserved, yes.

471
00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:13.369
Well, that's hard to say because I mean way

472
00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:16.609
too much is the answer, I guess. I mean,

473
00:26:16.719 --> 00:26:20.459
much much more than anyone could read, but I,

474
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.089
I think that um all of the major figures

475
00:26:24.089 --> 00:26:29.439
wrote lost works, I would say. But for many

476
00:26:29.439 --> 00:26:31.439
of these figures we have a lot of their

477
00:26:31.439 --> 00:26:34.319
writings, and I mean one thing is we're now

478
00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:37.439
getting to the 12th, 13th century, right? So we

479
00:26:37.439 --> 00:26:40.239
actually have manuscripts that are that old. So it's

480
00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:43.160
not like working on, so for example aindi, a

481
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.520
philosopher I wrote my one of my first books

482
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.040
about, he's 9th century, and his works are mostly

483
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.630
preserved only in a single manuscript, so we almost,

484
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.439
we almost didn't have aindi at all, right? Um,

485
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.060
AND there are other philosophers around that period where

486
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.979
we know actually in his case, we know that

487
00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:03.410
he wrote many, many works that are not preserved,

488
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.939
whereas for someone like Fah Eddin, there are certainly

489
00:27:06.939 --> 00:27:10.459
lost works, but we have massive amounts of text

490
00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:13.180
for him. So I mean I don't, I, I

491
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.619
can't give you a statistic about how much is

492
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:17.989
lost because I don't think we we don't know

493
00:27:17.989 --> 00:27:20.020
how long the works that aren't preserved are and

494
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.020
so on, but I mean as I say, we're

495
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.550
talking about. Shelves and shelves worth of um of

496
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.290
texts. Again, some of it's been edited in modern

497
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.959
printed editions and a lot of it hasn't.

498
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.119
Mhm. So, since, uh, in this conversation, we're going

499
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:41.199
to focus mostly on the first volume, the one

500
00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:44.680
on metaphysics. I would like to ask you, how

501
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.680
did EIN, uh, approach metaphysics? I mean, what counted

502
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.760
as a subject matter of metaphysics and what did

503
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.650
not count as such for EIS,

504
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.319
right, that's actually the topic of the first chapter

505
00:27:58.319 --> 00:28:02.630
in the book, right? So. Um, RIGHT, so that's

506
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.829
actually turns out to be a surprisingly difficult or

507
00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:07.989
or contested issue, cause you might think, oh well,

508
00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:11.150
metaphysics is just about whatever exists, right? That's what

509
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.520
we think it is. But it's more complicated than

510
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.199
that, cause you actually sort of have two choices.

511
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:24.020
Um, AND they stem from rival interpretations of Aristotle's

512
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.910
metaphysics. So one idea is that Aristotle's metaphysics is

513
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.640
just about being. So whatever is, right, and the

514
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.359
different ways of being, that would be the topic

515
00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:41.650
of metaphysics. The other possibility is that Metaphysics is

516
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.449
in some sense a science which leads us to

517
00:28:44.449 --> 00:28:48.250
God. And you might think that because the 12th

518
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.280
book of the metaphysics in Aristotle is about God,

519
00:28:51.569 --> 00:28:53.609
and the last two books seem to be kind

520
00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:56.209
of on different issues. They seem like not part

521
00:28:56.209 --> 00:28:58.689
of the main project of the work. And so

522
00:28:58.689 --> 00:29:01.489
a lot of people throughout history, Thomas Aquinas, for

523
00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:05.010
example, have thought that the project of metaphysics as

524
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.010
a science and the metaphysics by Aristotle is to

525
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.729
begin with beings and substances around us in the

526
00:29:12.729 --> 00:29:15.369
world. And kind of work our way up to

527
00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:20.430
an understanding of God, OK. So, uh, and for

528
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.670
example Iro thinks something like this as well, so

529
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.209
avaro is the Spanish commentator I mentioned before, I,

530
00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:28.670
it's again that's complicated. I wrote a paper about

531
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.030
it a few years ago, but we don't need

532
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.430
to go into that. So in Messina, um, apparently

533
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.030
at first thought that the metaphysics and the the

534
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.030
work by Aristotle and the science of metaphysics should

535
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.949
be about God. And then he wrote, uh, he,

536
00:29:44.979 --> 00:29:47.219
or rather he read a very short little treatise

537
00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:51.339
by Al Farabi about the metaphysics by Aristotle, which

538
00:29:51.339 --> 00:29:55.540
said basically, don't be confused. God comes up, but

539
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.869
it's really about being. It's a study of being,

540
00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:02.300
and that's what uh what in Messina thinks as

541
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.660
well. So he thinks that it's a study, he

542
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.979
wouldn't say being, he would say existence, so the

543
00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:10.609
Arabic word here is whud. And it's the study,

544
00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:12.099
so for him it's going to be the study

545
00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:15.619
of the existence as such or or of existence

546
00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:18.339
as such, and God comes into it because God

547
00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:21.020
is the cause of existence for everything else, and

548
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.099
is himself necessarily existent, so he doesn't have a

549
00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:26.930
cause, he he must exist by his very nature.

550
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.310
Um, THIS is interesting because then you could think

551
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.189
about, OK, well, does that mean that like what's

552
00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:40.099
the relationship between theology and metaphysics? So in Aristotle

553
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:42.790
theology would be this treatment of God inside the

554
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.109
metaphysics, right? So you could think of theology as

555
00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:48.349
kind of part of metaphysics, maybe it's the part

556
00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:51.530
of metaphysics that studies God. Or you could think

557
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:55.089
of theology as some kind of parallel discipline, which

558
00:30:55.089 --> 00:30:58.290
is devoted entirely to God and maybe even incorporate

559
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.810
some kind of information from revealed texts, right? So

560
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.410
the people who are doing Kalam, so what we

561
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.209
translate as theology, they have to think about the

562
00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:12.050
relationship between what they're doing and metaphysics, and for

563
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.790
the most part they actually decide that what they

564
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:17.380
are doing is in fact metaphysics. And includes the

565
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.979
study of God in very much the same way

566
00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:20.709
as it seen as metaphysics does.

567
00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:24.599
Uh, BY the way, when it comes to the

568
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:28.170
philosophers from the Islamic East of this time period,

569
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.930
the 12th, 10th, 13th centuries, were all of them

570
00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:38.280
religious or started from religious assumptions or not?

571
00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:42.130
Yes, so they're not all Muslims, but they are

572
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.250
all Jews, Muslims or Christians. So that figure I

573
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.369
mentioned a few minutes ago by Hebraeus, who wrote

574
00:31:47.369 --> 00:31:50.530
in Syriac, he's Christian. So he's the main Christian

575
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.560
that we're dealing with. One of the main philosophers,

576
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.930
um, from the 12th century, who we quote from

577
00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.250
a lot, is named Abu Abu Barakat al-Baghdadi. So

578
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.209
that means he's from Baghdad, right? So that's why

579
00:32:02.209 --> 00:32:05.569
he's called al-Baghdadi. Um, AND Abu Barakat was a

580
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:09.329
Jewish Muslim convert, so he was Jewish and then

581
00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:11.400
converted to Islam towards the end of his life.

582
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.530
Um, BUT I guess apart from, oh, and then

583
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.449
there's also a later philosopher that we who we

584
00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:21.560
use a lot in Kauna, who was also Jewish.

585
00:32:22.349 --> 00:32:25.630
Um, BUT for the most part we're dealing with

586
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.520
Muslims. And of course there's no atheists, right, cause

587
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.979
there's no atheists anywhere. I mean, atheism is not

588
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:37.800
a thing until like 17th century France. So,

589
00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.640
yeah. And I, I mean, this is a very

590
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.699
broad question. You can tackle it whichever way you

591
00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:48.699
prefer, but what would you say are the issues

592
00:32:48.699 --> 00:32:54.819
that best characterize the metaphysical philosophy of the Islamicist

593
00:32:54.819 --> 00:32:58.060
in the 12th and 14th centuries? I mean, there

594
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.853
are many. Uh, TOPICS that you explore in the

595
00:33:01.853 --> 00:33:04.853
book, like, for example, when you already mentioned the

596
00:33:04.853 --> 00:33:09.333
distinction between essence and existence, but there's also the

597
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:13.292
non-existent, existent things and whether they are real or

598
00:33:13.292 --> 00:33:16.853
not, the problem of universals or the features that

599
00:33:16.853 --> 00:33:20.066
are or could be shared in. Common by many

600
00:33:20.066 --> 00:33:25.225
things that platonic forms, individuation, free will and determinism.

601
00:33:25.265 --> 00:33:29.946
I mean, which, which are perhaps the main topics

602
00:33:29.946 --> 00:33:35.946
or what characterizes mostly the philosophy, the metaphysical philosophy

603
00:33:35.946 --> 00:33:38.456
of this time period in the Islamic.

604
00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:42.056
I mean, I think, so maybe there, there's actually,

605
00:33:42.385 --> 00:33:45.345
I would almost say that you can sort the

606
00:33:45.676 --> 00:33:48.979
topics of the chapters into two categories. So some

607
00:33:48.979 --> 00:33:54.510
of them are really about. Preoccupations of Muslim theologians,

608
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.150
which they used and seen as philosophy to address.

609
00:33:57.199 --> 00:33:59.880
So there you've got things like free will or

610
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.479
proofs of God's existence, right? So Avianna has a

611
00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:05.239
proof of God's existence and they are very impressed

612
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:07.469
by it. They critique it, but they're using it,

613
00:34:07.569 --> 00:34:09.540
right, and then they come up with other proofs.

614
00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:13.000
So that's kind of um things that are appealing

615
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.918
to them because they are Mutta Kalemun because they

616
00:34:15.918 --> 00:34:19.739
are theologians, most of them. Um, AND then there's

617
00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.060
this other kind of issue, which is just a

618
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.699
kind of issue of pure metaphysics, and the same

619
00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.580
people are interested in that as well, right? So

620
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.168
everyone's sort of doing some philosophy and some metaphysics,

621
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.978
or sorry, some everyone's doing some metaphysics and some

622
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:35.699
theology that we cover in this book, but some

623
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:39.020
of them are thinking of themselves more as theologians,

624
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.179
some of them are thinking of themselves as defenders

625
00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.679
of Edensina, and some of them are thinking of

626
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:47.050
themselves as just kind of Independent thinkers who can

627
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.688
decide what they should say. So Abu Bakat would

628
00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:53.649
be an example of that. Um, BUT since you

629
00:34:53.649 --> 00:34:56.639
asked like what are the core areas of metaphysics,

630
00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.489
I think the really key thing is this issue

631
00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:02.889
about essence and existence. So again, the issue is

632
00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:05.100
something like this, let's take me, so I'm a

633
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.050
human. So a lot is implied by my being

634
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.129
a human, right? So I have to be an

635
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:13.570
animal because humans are a kind of animal. I

636
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.649
must be rational in the sense of being capable

637
00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:17.919
of reasoning, cause that's true of humans as such.

638
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.919
I have to be alive. Um, I have to

639
00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:25.060
have a body. Right, uh, maybe even something like

640
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.739
I can't be as tall as a skyscraper, might

641
00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:29.260
be something that is true of me just in

642
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.090
virtue of being a human. OK, so lots of

643
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.649
things are true of me just in virtue of

644
00:35:34.649 --> 00:35:37.689
being a human, but not my existence. So my

645
00:35:37.689 --> 00:35:41.780
existence seems to be something else. Right, and because

646
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.620
it's not explained by my being a human, in

647
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.300
Messino would say it has to have some other

648
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.620
explanation and the explanation would be my cause. So

649
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.979
whatever caused me to exist is what gave my

650
00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:57.860
humanity this further feature which is existence, right? Now

651
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.340
if you think about it in that way, then

652
00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.060
you're you're kind of imagining, well, I've kind of

653
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.540
got this essence floating around, and then a cause

654
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.179
sort of grabs it and sticks existence onto it.

655
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.389
Which is a very weird way to think about

656
00:36:11.389 --> 00:36:14.550
it, right? Like what would, what would this essence

657
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:20.860
be humanity? If it doesn't exist even, right? And

658
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:23.350
that connects to a couple of issues we talk

659
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:26.510
about in the um book. One is the status

660
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.870
of the non-existent object, which had already been a

661
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.750
big debate in Kala before Messina came along. This

662
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.590
is one of the best illustrations of the fact

663
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.669
that they were really philosophers, as well as theologians.

664
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.830
They have this huge debate even before Messena about

665
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.629
the status of non-existent objects, and some of them

666
00:36:42.629 --> 00:36:44.709
say, well, they're kind of real, they just don't

667
00:36:44.709 --> 00:36:48.610
exist. Others say no, they're only like possibilities contained

668
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.840
within God's power. And different views about this, right?

669
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.040
Um, AND what effectively happens is that the post

670
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.469
Avicennon debate leads to two different positions. One is

671
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.040
a kind of realist position according to which in

672
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.479
me there's sort of two aspects, namely my essence

673
00:37:09.479 --> 00:37:12.479
and my existence, and they've somehow been fused together,

674
00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:16.120
right? So that would sort of like be the

675
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.719
people who thought that essences are real, whether or

676
00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:21.939
not they exist, right? So you could say, well,

677
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.219
humanity was already real before I existed, and then

678
00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:27.290
in it then it came to exist as well.

679
00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:29.620
And so now in me an existing human, I

680
00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.100
have my humanity and my existence as sort of

681
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.419
two principles that have been connected together by a

682
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:39.260
cause. And other people said, no, that's ridiculous. Um,

683
00:37:39.439 --> 00:37:43.020
SO they think that this distinction between Existence and

684
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.159
existence, sorry, essence and existence is just mental or

685
00:37:46.159 --> 00:37:48.840
conceptual. So they would say, well, we in our

686
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.649
minds can distinguish between my humanity and my existence,

687
00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:55.969
but out in the world there's just me, right?

688
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.010
And I'm a human, right, but humans aren't made

689
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.290
of two different things, essence and existence. And they

690
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.169
have arguments back and forth. So for example, the

691
00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:09.250
people who think that the distinction is conceptual will

692
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.889
first of all say that it doesn't make any

693
00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:12.530
sense to think of an essence that has no

694
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:17.399
existence. Cause it would be nothing, right? So nonexistent

695
00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:21.379
is nothing. Um, BUT another argument they give is

696
00:38:21.379 --> 00:38:25.570
that If existence were added to essence, then the

697
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:31.500
existence itself would also need to exist. Right? So

698
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.100
there's the essence, the existence of the essence, but

699
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.379
what about if the existence is something real, then

700
00:38:37.379 --> 00:38:40.120
it also exists. So there's the existence of the

701
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.780
existence and that further existence also exists. So it

702
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.110
has another existence and so you get a regress,

703
00:38:47.219 --> 00:38:49.820
right? Like the existence of the existence of the

704
00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.540
existence of my existence, right? And that's absurd, I

705
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.280
thought. Um, SO lots of technical arguments like this,

706
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.239
but that's one of the main arguments that they

707
00:38:58.239 --> 00:39:01.689
have over and you know, in some ways they

708
00:39:01.689 --> 00:39:04.399
are here arguing over the best way to interpret

709
00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:07.760
Isina, like what did, what did he mean when

710
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.290
he contrasted essence to existence. Sometimes they think they

711
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.090
know whatssina thought, and then they disagree with him

712
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.080
or they agree with him, but actually it's not

713
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.370
that clear even what Evanina thought about this question.

714
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:20.989
So there's a kind of exegetical issue as well

715
00:39:20.989 --> 00:39:22.229
as a philosophical issue.

716
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:27.360
Right, and what were some of the most disputed

717
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.909
questions in regards to God?

718
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.449
Right, OK, so one issue follows on immediately from

719
00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:38.290
what I just said, which is um the status

720
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:43.909
of God's existence. So some people and Fahaddin Arazi

721
00:39:43.909 --> 00:39:46.389
would be an unusual example of this. So this

722
00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:49.070
is an unpopular opinion, but it's an important opinion

723
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.590
because it's his opinion and he's maybe the most

724
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.350
important figure of the 12th century. So he thinks

725
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.729
that existence is the same. Regardless of what exists.

726
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.449
So my existence is just like God's existence. It's

727
00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:04.729
just that the thing that exists is better in

728
00:40:04.729 --> 00:40:08.429
his case, right? And the difference between God and

729
00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:12.350
me is that God's essence implies his existence, whereas

730
00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.989
mine does not. So I need a cause to

731
00:40:14.989 --> 00:40:19.760
exist, he doesn't, right? Right. But the existence as

732
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.320
such is just the same thing, right? It's the

733
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.919
same phenomenon. It's just maybe just say well for

734
00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:28.510
him existence is just like being in the world.

735
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.689
That's what existence is. Other people say no, um,

736
00:40:34.139 --> 00:40:40.340
because, uh, God relates so intimately to his existence

737
00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:43.010
that his existence has to be divine in some

738
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.699
way, right? One way of thinking about this might

739
00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:49.820
be that God's essence just is to exist, and

740
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.949
that's why he's a necessary existence. But if his

741
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:56.399
existence just is the same as him, right, or

742
00:40:56.399 --> 00:40:58.600
the same as his essence, then obviously it's not

743
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.000
something that I could have, right, cause then my

744
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.330
existence would be God. It's obviously not true, right?

745
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.139
So, so there's a debate between people who think

746
00:41:07.139 --> 00:41:10.000
that existence means the same thing for God and

747
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.820
creatures and people that's basically Faradin who thinks that.

748
00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:15.540
And then there's other people who deny that and

749
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.500
say, no, no, no, God has a special kind

750
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.379
of exalted kind of existence. This is interesting, by

751
00:41:20.379 --> 00:41:22.219
the way, because it's a good example of something

752
00:41:22.219 --> 00:41:24.899
I mentioned earlier, namely that we get the same

753
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:28.370
debates playing out in Latin medieval philosophy. So in

754
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.320
late 13th century philosophy, so a whole century later.

755
00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:34.500
This whole debate is recapitulated by Aquinas and some

756
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.280
other scholastics. So we have Dun SCOTUS, uh, occupying

757
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.639
the same position that Fahreddine was occupying, and we

758
00:41:42.639 --> 00:41:44.919
have Aquinas and Henry of Ghent and some other

759
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:48.239
people defending their rival position that existence means something

760
00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:51.100
different in the two cases. So that's one big

761
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.719
debate. Another big debate is whether he creates the

762
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:56.439
world necessarily or not, as we talked about before,

763
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.290
so that runs on from Casale. And a third

764
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.350
big debate is whether, well, not whether you can

765
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.129
prove that he exists, whether you can prove that

766
00:42:04.129 --> 00:42:06.770
God exists, they all think you can. The question

767
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.320
is more how best to prove that God exists.

768
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.850
So for example, some of, and some of them

769
00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.489
think those two issues go together, because some of

770
00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:18.050
them think that the right way to prove God's

771
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.409
existence is to show that the universe cannot have

772
00:42:20.409 --> 00:42:23.530
existed for an eternal period of time, right? So

773
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.360
it came into existence with some in some moments

774
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:30.179
in the past, like, you know. Exactly 7 million

775
00:42:30.179 --> 00:42:33.310
years ago or something, and if that's true, then

776
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.979
it must have a the world must have a

777
00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:37.679
cause, cause it began to exist that needs an

778
00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:41.580
explanation, and that cause would be God, right? Whereas

779
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.419
inina and people who agree with him, think that

780
00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:47.219
the universe is eternal, so they need some other

781
00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:49.899
way of proving that God exists and insina has

782
00:42:49.899 --> 00:42:52.179
a proof of God's existence which they discuss in

783
00:42:52.179 --> 00:42:53.090
depth as well.

784
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.750
So at a certain point in the book, you

785
00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:01.469
use the term para philosopher and ask whether the

786
00:43:01.469 --> 00:43:05.379
philosophers from the Islamic in this time period were

787
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:10.629
philosophers or para philosophers. So what does that term

788
00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:13.590
mean and how do you answer that question?

789
00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:15.310
Yeah, yeah, I think we talked about this in

790
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.590
the introduction. So this is a term that was

791
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.379
proposed by Dmitrytas, who's one of the greatest living

792
00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:23.209
scholars of Islamic philosophy. Um, AND he's done a

793
00:43:23.209 --> 00:43:25.169
lot of work on it and seen himself among

794
00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:32.199
other topics. So, um, Professor Gas thinks that This

795
00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:37.090
whole tradition that we're looking at. I Perhaps very

796
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.449
complicated and intellectually sophisticated and I guess he would

797
00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:43.090
probably even say it's very interesting, but he doesn't

798
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.560
really think that it's philosophy in the proper sense.

799
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.659
And the reason is that so many of them

800
00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:53.500
are doing philosophy. In the context of some kind

801
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.879
of theological project. So as I said, um, they

802
00:43:57.879 --> 00:44:01.409
are often people who would self-identify as Muta Kalimun.

803
00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:05.949
Or even if they wouldn't, they are borrowing so

804
00:44:05.949 --> 00:44:08.149
much from Kala that they are clearly like within

805
00:44:08.149 --> 00:44:12.629
that tradition, OK? And they're obviously very convinced Muslims,

806
00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:17.060
as we already said, right? And so what what

807
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.510
Guptas would say is, well, that's not really a

808
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.909
philosophy because philosophy would be something more like a

809
00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:26.989
disinterested search for truth, right? So I, I guess

810
00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:29.070
he would say that philosophers kind of start with

811
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.360
a blank piece of paper. And if, I mean,

812
00:44:32.489 --> 00:44:34.929
probably they they could never just literally not have

813
00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:37.129
any beliefs or commitments, but they would set them

814
00:44:37.129 --> 00:44:40.280
all aside and just follow reason wherever it leads.

815
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.209
So for example, they would only believe in God

816
00:44:42.209 --> 00:44:46.239
if you could prove God's existence, right? Mhm. So

817
00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:48.479
what he would say is that these guys are

818
00:44:48.479 --> 00:44:51.719
all what he calls para philosophers. In other words,

819
00:44:51.879 --> 00:44:53.959
they're kind of pretending to do philosophy, but they're

820
00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:56.959
not really doing philosophy because they're not really engaged

821
00:44:56.959 --> 00:45:02.449
in a dispassionate. Objective search for truth, which is

822
00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:05.959
what he thinks philosophy should be. OK, so that's

823
00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:10.000
his idea. Um, I mean, so something that we

824
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.429
say in the introduction is, well, OK, but We're

825
00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:19.800
about to give you like 700 pages of extremely

826
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:25.610
detailed, intricate philosophical argumentation, and I, I mean, I

827
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.139
think sometimes I think that he that uh Professor

828
00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:30.929
Guptas and we are sort of talking about different

829
00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:33.649
things, because I think what he's talking about is

830
00:45:33.649 --> 00:45:37.250
something more like what was motivating them or what

831
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.280
did they think they were doing, right? So of

832
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.669
course they didn't think they were doing faafa, right,

833
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.780
cause they, they used the word faafa to mean

834
00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.239
avian in philosophy. So I mean some of them

835
00:45:47.239 --> 00:45:49.399
are defending him, but most of them are criticizing

836
00:45:49.399 --> 00:45:52.719
him or using him to build systems of their

837
00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:57.000
own. Um, SO I guess he would, he's really

838
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.699
interested in maybe what you would could call philosophy

839
00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:05.689
as like a cultural project. And that's not their

840
00:46:05.689 --> 00:46:07.689
project, he would say. He would say their project

841
00:46:07.689 --> 00:46:12.280
is a theological religious project. I mean, so, so

842
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.840
a good way of bringing out the difference between

843
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.090
my way of thinking about this and his way

844
00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.659
of thinking about it is that in the introduction.

845
00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:24.500
We say, well, by his reasoning, Thomas Aquinas wasn't

846
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.300
a philosopher either, nor were any of the famous

847
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:33.300
Latin scholastic philosophers, and that seems silly, and his

848
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300
response that he actually has a forthcoming paper in

849
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.899
which he says, exactly, that's true, they weren't philosophers

850
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.629
either. And I guess I kind of feel once

851
00:46:40.629 --> 00:46:42.709
you've argued yourself into the position of saying that

852
00:46:42.709 --> 00:46:46.010
Thomas Aquinas wasn't a philosopher. I, I sort of

853
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.520
feel like the the the argument is over actually.

854
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:49.689
I mean that just seems to me it's like

855
00:46:49.689 --> 00:46:52.090
a nonstarter or something to say. So if you,

856
00:46:52.129 --> 00:46:55.050
if you find yourself saying that, then you have

857
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.570
to work your way back and figure out where

858
00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.610
the mistake was. I think you just sort of

859
00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.120
can't say that that's ridiculous. But uh, you know,

860
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.050
I can see what he means. So I think

861
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.129
what he was, what he wants is philosophers who

862
00:47:06.129 --> 00:47:10.610
are so unencumbered by religious concerns that there almost

863
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.649
haven't ever been any. So for example, I don't

864
00:47:12.649 --> 00:47:14.409
think that by his standards, I don't think Descartes

865
00:47:14.409 --> 00:47:17.860
was a philosopher. And if you think Descartes's not

866
00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.979
a philosopher, you're really in trouble, I would say,

867
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.500
but I haven't asked him about that. I don't

868
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.620
know what he would say about Descartes.

869
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.469
Right, so, I mean, among all of the philosophers

870
00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:32.149
that you cover in the book in the Islamic

871
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:35.340
East, what would this and in this particular time

872
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:39.669
period, what would you say were the most prominent

873
00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:40.429
ones?

874
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.060
Yeah, OK. So there's a lot of philosophers who

875
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.870
we cover. So most of the chapters quote from

876
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.840
at least 15 people, and I think that we

877
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.870
have across the whole book we quote from several

878
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:54.459
dozen people. So it's quite a large cast of

879
00:47:54.459 --> 00:47:57.939
characters and in fact, one of the problems or

880
00:47:57.939 --> 00:47:59.939
one of the worries we had is that it

881
00:47:59.939 --> 00:48:01.629
might be kind of hard to follow what's going

882
00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:03.540
on. So, and in fact we say this in

883
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.179
the introduction like these books are not the books

884
00:48:06.179 --> 00:48:07.820
that's going to tell you who these guys were

885
00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.790
and what their projects were and and Dimitri Guptas

886
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.419
is right that that's not what we're doing. We're

887
00:48:13.419 --> 00:48:16.620
not trying to present. The intellectual project of individual

888
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.550
people and what was motivating them or something. We're

889
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.750
following philosophical debates through. So I mean maybe you

890
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.469
could say that we're approaching it in a very

891
00:48:24.469 --> 00:48:29.300
philosophical way and not a historical way, right? Um,

892
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.669
SO I think insofar as he, you know, that's

893
00:48:31.669 --> 00:48:33.949
what he wants, that would indeed be a different

894
00:48:33.949 --> 00:48:37.350
kind of study, uh, a book like, um, a

895
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.760
recent book by Frank Griffel. The formation of postclassical

896
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.879
philosophy, I think it's called. That's what he's doing.

897
00:48:42.959 --> 00:48:46.800
So he's trying to reconstruct Fahreddin's project and um

898
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.840
like the difference between his different works and so

899
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840
on. And there's other people who have done that

900
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.959
kind of work like Ayman Shehadeh, who's also worked

901
00:48:52.959 --> 00:48:57.879
on Fahd Narazi, or Han Ana, for example. But

902
00:48:57.879 --> 00:49:01.429
actually in some ways our our feeling was, well,

903
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.110
there's a lot of people thinking about that, like

904
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.959
how the works are constructed, why were they written,

905
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.000
when and where were they written? We wanted to

906
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.399
focus just on the kind of philosophical meat all

907
00:49:11.399 --> 00:49:15.159
the arguments. So, um, like I said, there's a

908
00:49:15.159 --> 00:49:18.669
lot of them and uh the people that we

909
00:49:18.919 --> 00:49:21.159
sort of highlight as being the most important in

910
00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:24.760
the 12th century are 3 guys, and I've already

911
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.060
mentioned two of them already. So Fahdina Razi. Who

912
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.939
I think is the the kind of hero of

913
00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:34.219
the whole project. So he's quoted in every single

914
00:49:34.219 --> 00:49:37.020
chapter, usually we quote from him more than anyone

915
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.139
else, and he's quoted not just in the metaphysics

916
00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:43.659
volume, but in the logic and epistemology volume. He's

917
00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:47.139
again quoted in every chapter prominently, and he'll be

918
00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:49.780
prominent in every chapter in the physics and psychology

919
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.709
volume. So he's just, he's sort of like in

920
00:49:51.709 --> 00:49:55.739
Messina, massively interesting all the time. So he's just

921
00:49:55.739 --> 00:50:00.260
a brilliant, brilliant philosopher, um. OK, so there's him.

922
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.820
Um, AND he's, by the way, kind of hard

923
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.300
to classify, so people often think of him as

924
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.459
a kind of theologian. He was, he also wrote

925
00:50:08.459 --> 00:50:11.139
a very important and very huge commentary on the

926
00:50:11.139 --> 00:50:15.560
Quran. Which suggest that he was a theologian, but

927
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.840
he actually refers to Kalam sometimes as if it

928
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.070
was some other thing that he's not part of.

929
00:50:22.969 --> 00:50:26.439
Right, so he sometimes he'll say like there's my,

930
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:29.090
my group, the people I follow who are a

931
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.610
certain group within Kalam, but he'll also say, well,

932
00:50:31.699 --> 00:50:34.409
the Mute Kalimun say X, Y and Z, and

933
00:50:34.409 --> 00:50:39.169
they're wrong, right? So his relationship both to Essina

934
00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:42.090
and to Kalam is very independent minded. He's actually

935
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.530
a lot like Einna himself in the sense that

936
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.500
he's maybe trying to replace Eina the way that

937
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:52.129
Eminna replaced Aristotle. But he's not the only person

938
00:50:52.129 --> 00:50:54.840
doing that. So a little bit earlier there's this

939
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:58.760
guy Abu Barakat al-Baghdadi I mentioned, Jewish Muslim convert,

940
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.649
like I said, um, whereas Fahaddin wrote books and

941
00:51:02.649 --> 00:51:05.169
books and books, a huge amount of output from

942
00:51:05.169 --> 00:51:08.090
Fahreddin. Abu Barakat really only has has this one

943
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:12.320
book, although it's quite fat. It's like that wide

944
00:51:12.649 --> 00:51:17.649
in uh the Arabic edition, and it's called Kitababar,

945
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.580
which means the book of the carefully considered. Which

946
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.780
kind of tells you what he's doing, very similar

947
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.889
to what I just said about Fahaddin. He's Judging

948
00:51:27.979 --> 00:51:31.219
which positions in the intellectual landscape are convincing and

949
00:51:31.219 --> 00:51:34.629
which are not. That he's also very influential, he's

950
00:51:34.629 --> 00:51:38.909
influential on Faredin among other people. His writing is

951
00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:43.550
very difficult and and conceptually and linguistically difficult. Um,

952
00:51:43.669 --> 00:51:47.750
ONE thing I sort of, uh, just anecdotally, when

953
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.270
I was going through the translations that my uh

954
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.939
colleagues had provided. I would always struggle to go

955
00:51:54.939 --> 00:51:58.699
through Abu Barakat's like very difficult texts, and then

956
00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:00.139
I would get to Fakhruddin and it would just

957
00:52:00.139 --> 00:52:04.540
fly through. Fahreddin writes super super clear, beautiful, nice

958
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.449
clear Arabic, sort of like Aquinas in Latin actually,

959
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.699
um, I and sometimes I think the one reason

960
00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:12.580
everyone wants to work on Fakhreddin now in my

961
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.139
field, and one reason people work on Aquinas so

962
00:52:15.139 --> 00:52:18.639
much in Latin medieval philosophy is that they just

963
00:52:18.639 --> 00:52:23.889
write very clear. And very like nicely demarcated arguments

964
00:52:23.889 --> 00:52:26.600
and everything. OK. The third guy then would be

965
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.320
Suravay, also a very difficult author, very hard to

966
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.479
work through, and he's in some ways the most

967
00:52:33.479 --> 00:52:38.919
complicated, um, because people have a very different idea

968
00:52:38.919 --> 00:52:41.000
about him than what we found when we actually

969
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.399
read all of his books. So Um, this is

970
00:52:45.399 --> 00:52:47.800
kind of a long story, but I'll try to

971
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.399
make it short, so. In later Iranian philosophy, and

972
00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:55.239
especially in the work of 1/17 century philosopher from

973
00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:59.899
Iran named Mullah Sarah. Savvay, this 12th century philosopher,

974
00:52:59.939 --> 00:53:02.620
is kind of held up as a really significant

975
00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.540
figure who initiates a whole new kind of philosophy,

976
00:53:06.899 --> 00:53:10.580
which is called illuminationism, so it's called Iraki philosophy.

977
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.989
And it's thought to be kind of a a

978
00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:20.469
new departure from previous philosophy that incorporates ideas of

979
00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:24.810
from mysticism and maybe even older traditions like Persian

980
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:28.709
philosophy and Persian religious ideas, and this would be

981
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:31.750
this new illuminationist philosophy which considers God to be

982
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:36.550
a light who illuminates the world and our souls

983
00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.830
are lights which descend from him and so on

984
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:42.760
and so forth, right? So, um, that's mostly based

985
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.639
on one of just one of his works, maybe

986
00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:47.360
his most important work, which is called the Philosophy

987
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.959
of Illumination, Hikmat Aliak. So, OK, very interesting work,

988
00:53:54.129 --> 00:53:56.370
but we, we did find when we read a

989
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.729
lot of his other works that they're very much

990
00:53:58.729 --> 00:54:00.570
like other things that were being written at the

991
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:05.110
time, like by Fahaddin. And in that context, we,

992
00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:07.290
so we're not saying that he's not innovative or

993
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.310
interesting, we do think he's very interesting and innovative,

994
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.350
but we kind of came away from it thinking

995
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.949
that he's a lot like Abu Barakat and Fahdin.

996
00:54:14.159 --> 00:54:17.520
In other words, he's a very careful reader of

997
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.000
Insina, who is criticizing a lot of the philosophical

998
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.120
moves made in Insinna and wants to kind of

999
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:28.020
create his own philosophical system. And then in Hikmara,

1000
00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:31.639
he comes up with this illuminationist terminology to kind

1001
00:54:31.639 --> 00:54:34.949
of describe what he's doing. But fundamentally he he

1002
00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:37.310
fits pretty well into the 12th century scene, I

1003
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:41.169
think. So that's the 12th century, and then 13th

1004
00:54:41.169 --> 00:54:44.010
century just briefly, I think two of the main

1005
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.250
guys would be um first of all, Nasir Eddin

1006
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:51.840
Atuzi. Tuzi is someone who um survived the Mongol

1007
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.739
invasions and actually wound up working for the Mongols

1008
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.270
and running an astronomical observatory in a place called

1009
00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.649
Maaga in modern day Iran. And he had a

1010
00:55:01.649 --> 00:55:04.570
whole circle of philosophers around him and scientists, so

1011
00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.250
he was an astronomer and um kind of all

1012
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:11.639
around intellectual, and he was a defender of Ensina.

1013
00:55:11.929 --> 00:55:15.060
So what you often have is Fahaddin will attack

1014
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:19.090
Essina and Tuzi will defend him. So in fact

1015
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.169
they both wrote commentaries on the same work by

1016
00:55:21.169 --> 00:55:24.169
Essina, and Faddin's commentary is just a list of

1017
00:55:24.169 --> 00:55:28.169
criticisms, and Tuzi is a point by point refutation

1018
00:55:28.169 --> 00:55:30.090
of the criticisms, that's what he's doing in his

1019
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:34.010
commentary. Someone else who's maybe worth mentioning from the

1020
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:39.800
13th century is uh named Huaji. And he's not

1021
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.250
so important in this volume, but he's the main

1022
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.169
figure in the logic volume, or at least in

1023
00:55:44.169 --> 00:55:46.530
the logic parts of the next volume, because he's

1024
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.459
the most innovative logician of the whole period, actually,

1025
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.330
um, so he's really important for the history of

1026
00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:54.479
logic, but not so important for the history of

1027
00:55:54.479 --> 00:55:55.209
metaphysics.

1028
00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:00.120
OK, so, I mean, I have one or two

1029
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.879
more broad questions to ask you before we wrap

1030
00:56:03.879 --> 00:56:07.479
up our conversation. So, is there, we are talking

1031
00:56:07.479 --> 00:56:11.310
here about the hairs of Evin. Is there also

1032
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:16.550
a legacy to this Philosophers from the Islamic East

1033
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.939
and from the 12th and 14th centuries. I mean,

1034
00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:23.310
if not on the global level, let's say like

1035
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:27.830
many of the Western philosophers have nowadays, at least

1036
00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:30.260
in the Islamic world, or not.

1037
00:56:30.669 --> 00:56:34.429
Yeah, so actually one interesting question that that we

1038
00:56:34.429 --> 00:56:37.629
haven't really addressed yet is Hang on a second,

1039
00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:40.199
if there's thousands and thousands of pages of extremely

1040
00:56:40.199 --> 00:56:43.159
technical advanced philosophy in the 12th and 13th century,

1041
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.090
why didn't people already kind of know about this,

1042
00:56:46.479 --> 00:56:50.479
right? And the answer is that they did. Especially

1043
00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:52.389
in the Islamic world, like scholars have been working

1044
00:56:52.389 --> 00:56:55.280
on this for decades, right? But it hadn't really

1045
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.280
been integrated into uh history of philosophy in Western

1046
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.360
languages until recently, so we weren't the first people

1047
00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.399
to do this. I mean, we were inspired by

1048
00:57:04.399 --> 00:57:06.070
the work of some of the people I mentioned

1049
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.679
before likeuttas and Eichna and Shihade and Griffel, um.

1050
00:57:11.159 --> 00:57:14.620
But we, the reason we did this is we

1051
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.620
just thought it was too hard for people to

1052
00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:21.179
access because masses and masses of text, no translations,

1053
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:22.580
a lot of it's, as I said, not even

1054
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.689
edited, so very, very hard to get at, um,

1055
00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:28.379
and that's why we not only translated the material

1056
00:57:28.379 --> 00:57:31.540
but also typed up the Arabic and Persian to

1057
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.239
give people access to that. I think also even

1058
00:57:35.239 --> 00:57:37.520
people in the Islamic world or like native Arabic

1059
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.399
speakers, they might not need our translations, but it

1060
00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:42.209
would be very useful for them to have the

1061
00:57:43.449 --> 00:57:48.169
the texts that we translated, right? Because it's very

1062
00:57:48.169 --> 00:57:50.320
hard to assemble all that material and find it.

1063
00:57:50.449 --> 00:57:53.320
OK. So the reason why this stuff hadn't been

1064
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:58.929
considered very much in mainstream history of philosophy in

1065
00:57:58.929 --> 00:58:02.040
European languages is that it had no impact on

1066
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.080
the Latin medieval tradition or the Renaissance, right? So

1067
00:58:06.449 --> 00:58:10.899
the Latin, there's there's an Arabic. Um, THERE'S a

1068
00:58:10.899 --> 00:58:15.090
translation movement of philosophical texts from Arabic into Latin,

1069
00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:17.500
and it happens around the end of the 12th

1070
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.780
century, but in the west, so in like Sicily

1071
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.780
and Spain, so they don't have these texts, they're

1072
00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.540
either too late or too far east at that

1073
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:32.409
time. So someone like Fahdina Razi or Suravadi, despite

1074
00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:36.550
being very, very interesting, is not known to a

1075
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.310
figure like Aquinas, but Aquinas does have vas and

1076
00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:46.219
Avicenna. Because they're included in the translation movement. So

1077
00:58:46.669 --> 00:58:48.500
you, you kind of have a, a kind of

1078
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.659
um a point at which the two traditions have

1079
00:58:53.659 --> 00:58:56.419
something in common, and that would be really up

1080
00:58:56.419 --> 00:58:58.510
to the time of Essa and then they branch

1081
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:04.110
apart. But the philosophers we're talking about here were

1082
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:06.780
very well known in the Islamic world. So if

1083
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.110
we go up to like, let's say the 16th,

1084
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.620
17th century, so once you get into the time

1085
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.989
of the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire, the Mughal

1086
00:59:14.989 --> 00:59:19.080
Empire done in India, their works are known. Um,

1087
00:59:19.169 --> 00:59:22.290
Hunaji, or there's another logician named Najm Ad Deen

1088
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:25.959
Akaibi who's who wrote a really influential logical textbook,

1089
00:59:26.409 --> 00:59:28.649
and his logic was still, so he's 13th century,

1090
00:59:28.729 --> 00:59:32.570
right? His logical textbook was still being used to

1091
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:35.800
teach logic in Cairo in the early 20th century.

1092
00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:41.820
So only 100 years ago, and the logical tradition

1093
00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.820
that like ultimately goes back to Messina through people

1094
00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.969
like Huji was still being practiced in, for example,

1095
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.830
India at the turn of the 20th century. So

1096
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.979
actually it is a global phenomenon. It's just that

1097
00:59:54.979 --> 00:59:57.100
it's a different part of the globe. It's the

1098
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.459
part that goes from basically uh West Africa and

1099
01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:03.939
North Africa, all the way over to Central Asia.

1100
01:00:04.439 --> 01:00:08.679
Right, that's what the influence of this um material

1101
01:00:08.679 --> 01:00:10.790
that we've been looking at. And if you said

1102
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.469
Fahredina Razi to any Muslim intellectual of the 18th

1103
01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:20.199
century, so that's 500 years after Rai, right, um,

1104
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.159
they would know who that was and they would

1105
01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:24.280
even probably have read him. I guess.

1106
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.840
Yeah. So one last question then, by studying the

1107
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.030
philosophy created by these Islamic thinkers and other thinkers

1108
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:41.040
outside of the outside of Europe, actually, as you

1109
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.145
do, for example, your podcast history of philosophy without

1110
01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:48.405
any gaps. How do you look at the Eurocentric

1111
01:00:48.405 --> 01:00:52.895
approach that dominates or tends to tends to dominate

1112
01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:56.304
philosophy worldwide? I mean, do you think it is

1113
01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:58.294
an impoverished approach?

1114
01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:03.879
I mean, yes, although I, I mean, I, I

1115
01:01:03.879 --> 01:01:06.159
think the, so in a sense you might say,

1116
01:01:06.239 --> 01:01:10.800
well, there's just obviously ridiculous to restrict the study

1117
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.040
of philosophy to European philosophy, right? CAUSE there's all

1118
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.169
this other philosophies of why would you do that?

1119
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.840
And it's not just Islamic philosophy, right? So you've

1120
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.879
got Chinese philosophy, you've got Indian philosophy, you've got

1121
01:01:20.879 --> 01:01:24.929
African philosophy, you've got Latin American philosophy, earlier than

1122
01:01:24.929 --> 01:01:28.600
that you've got Mesoamerican cultures which had philosophical material

1123
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:32.370
um that are available. Um, YOU could even think

1124
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:37.000
about, you know, indigenous philosophical ideas, Native Americans, indigenous

1125
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.290
Australians, prehistoric Africa, um, that we can access through

1126
01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:44.350
ethnography and archaeology and so on. So we've covered

1127
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:46.169
a lot of that, especially in the Africana series,

1128
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.780
we covered that. And I mean, to some extent,

1129
01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.810
I think the answer to the question is just,

1130
01:01:51.939 --> 01:01:53.929
well, if it's there, then why wouldn't you study

1131
01:01:53.929 --> 01:01:55.540
it, just it's just all part of the history

1132
01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.939
of philosophy. Maybe there is some kind of feeling

1133
01:01:58.939 --> 01:02:04.270
that The philosophy from these other cultures, OK, maybe

1134
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:08.290
it's philosophy, but maybe it's not as advanced or

1135
01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.649
interesting or something like that, as the philosophy from

1136
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.419
that we have from like Leibniz and Descartes and

1137
01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:17.979
Kants. Right, or even Plato and Aristotle. So I

1138
01:02:17.979 --> 01:02:20.580
think maybe a lot of people who want to

1139
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.020
cling to this Eurocentric approach, they might not, now

1140
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.620
it's getting hard to say this out loud, right?

1141
01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:29.659
But they might still think in the back of

1142
01:02:29.659 --> 01:02:32.139
their mind or maybe even not consciously, they might

1143
01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.010
be thinking, OK, yes, I know that there was

1144
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:37.860
Confucius and inin or whatever, but they're really good

1145
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.459
philosophy has always been European, right? So one of

1146
01:02:41.459 --> 01:02:43.300
the things that you can do with a project

1147
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.300
like this is just show that's not true. So

1148
01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:49.379
we are presenting philosophy here that's every bit as

1149
01:02:49.739 --> 01:02:54.739
advanced technical, sophisticated as, for example, Latin medieval philosophy,

1150
01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:58.270
right? And it's engaging with a traditional philosophy that

1151
01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.750
goes back through and seen it to Aristotle, so

1152
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.469
it's part of the, it's even part of the

1153
01:03:02.469 --> 01:03:04.909
same story, right? It's just a part that kind

1154
01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:09.030
of diverged, right? And I think that's actually an

1155
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:12.159
interesting thing to consider. So you also have extremely

1156
01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:17.469
sophisticated technical philosophy in classical India, for example. So

1157
01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:21.739
the Neaa logical school in India. IS doing things

1158
01:03:21.739 --> 01:03:23.540
that you could compare with what these guys are

1159
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:28.020
doing in logic, right, sophisticated, technical, etc. um, BUT

1160
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.260
it has nothing to do with Greek logic, right?

1161
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.500
It's a completely independent phenomenon. And that's interesting too.

1162
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:38.179
So the Islamic philosophy in general and this tradition

1163
01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:41.260
within it is in particular, these are interesting to

1164
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.379
think about because they are kind of part of

1165
01:03:44.379 --> 01:03:48.389
global philosophy, but they're not unconnected to European philosophy

1166
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.290
because they both stem from the original Greek tradition,

1167
01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:55.780
albeit via Messina, and they also to some extent

1168
01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.639
feed back into. European philosophy, not these guys, but

1169
01:03:59.639 --> 01:04:01.520
someone like I seen it was being read all

1170
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.800
the time in the uh schools and universities of

1171
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.469
13th and 14th century Europe.

1172
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.629
Right. So, I mean, just before we go again,

1173
01:04:11.669 --> 01:04:14.959
the book is Hairs of Avicen Philosophy in the

1174
01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:19.479
Islamic 12 13th centuries. I'm leaving a link to

1175
01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:22.989
it in the description of the interview, but when

1176
01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:28.120
should people expect to uh have access to the

1177
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.919
third volume on psychology and physics?

1178
01:04:32.139 --> 01:04:34.600
So the first, I think it looks like they're

1179
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.300
gonna come out every 2 years, so. This metaphysics

1180
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.449
one came out I guess in 2023. Logic and

1181
01:04:41.449 --> 01:04:44.659
epistemology came out in 2025 now, just now, and

1182
01:04:44.659 --> 01:04:46.179
so I, I think we're aiming for the next

1183
01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:51.739
one to come out in 2027. Let's hope it's

1184
01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:54.260
gonna be really long, so wish me luck.

1185
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:59.780
Yeah, of course. Uh, SO apart from that and

1186
01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.870
your podcast which I've already mentioned in the introduction,

1187
01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.820
where else can people find you and your work

1188
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.050
on the internet?

1189
01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:12.949
Oh, OK, well, um. So I work at Munich,

1190
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:15.750
the LMU in Munich. So if you go to

1191
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.639
my uh my the page of my chair, my

1192
01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:21.070
philosophy chair, you can see what we're up to

1193
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.070
here. We have other research projects at the moment,

1194
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.540
so now we're working on another group of philosophers

1195
01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:28.689
who worked earlier in the Islamic world, so actually

1196
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:31.949
a bunch of Christian philosophers who were working on

1197
01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:34.909
Aristotle in Baghdad in the 10th century. So that's

1198
01:05:34.909 --> 01:05:38.010
the next big project we're doing here. Um, BUT

1199
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:39.969
I think, uh, the main way to keep up

1200
01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.530
with what I'm doing is to just go to

1201
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:49.889
my podcast website, which is www.hilosophy. WWW.HISTORYOPHILOSOPHY.NET, because I

1202
01:05:49.889 --> 01:05:51.530
also have a blog there where I talk about

1203
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.169
what I'm up to.

1204
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.449
Great. So, Doctor Adamson, thank you so much for

1205
01:05:57.449 --> 01:05:59.209
