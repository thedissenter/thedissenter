00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.049
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.989
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.670
today I'm joined by Doctor Gregory Raelle. He's Professor

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.329
Emeritus in the Department of Earth Sciences at the

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.229
University of Oregon. His research has examined the fossil

6
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.030
record of soils uh through major events in earth

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.610
history. And he is the author of books like

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.739
Soils of the Past, an introduction to paleopathology. Yes,

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.610
there it is. And also Soil growing Tall. The

10
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.709
epic Saga of Life from Earth. So Doctor Rattle,

11
00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.840
like, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure

12
00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:39.459
to everyone.

13
00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.020
Well, thank you for considering me.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.099
So I would like to start with, I guess

15
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.619
a very basic question also to introduce my audience

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.380
to this topic because to be honest, it's the

17
00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.299
first time I have an interview for the show

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.919
on paleopathology. So, what is paleopathology?

19
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.150
Well, that's what I love about it. It isn't

20
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.099
widely known and um, it's been a field that

21
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080
I've kind of been able to invent. I mean,

22
00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:08.169
there were a few other people going actually way

23
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.730
back into the 17th century who tweaked to the

24
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.330
idea of a buried soil. But Papi is just

25
00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:18.129
really the study of fossil soils, ancient soils that

26
00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:21.019
gives us clues about ancient environments. Now, what some

27
00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.540
people get confused about is, um, well, it has

28
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.430
nothing to do with um mummy's feet. So it's

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.519
not from the, the Greek pace petter for pedestrian

30
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.470
and it has nothing to do with Ancient Sumerian

31
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.110
child psychology either. It's not from the Greek Pace

32
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.500
pise for, from which we get pediatrician. It's from

33
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.040
the Greek word pedon, which means which means soil.

34
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
And the lovely thing about it is that soils

35
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.730
have a fossil record. You can compare ancient soils

36
00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.809
with modern soils and they can tell us a

37
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.819
lot about how the world has changed through deep

38
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.430
time.

39
00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:59.059
Yeah. You know, it's very interesting because I am

40
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.419
Portuguese and for a Portuguese person and I guess

41
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.819
people from other languages it makes more sense than

42
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.960
for English people that this would be somewhat related

43
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.559
to soil because in Tougue, the word for food

44
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.039
is pay. So it's closer to plog or the,

45
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.889
the initial part of the word pathology. So, yeah,

46
00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.949
for us, for us it makes more uh immediate

47
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.690
sense.

48
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.589
Well, yes, it does differ in different languages. All

49
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.039
right. And then there are all sorts of um

50
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.259
problems in, in translating from different languages. Now, um

51
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.429
English seems to rule, I was just in France.

52
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.130
Um, AND um two decades ago, they, they just

53
00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.259
don't speak English. But now even there English seems

54
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.979
to have taken over as a language of science.

55
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.410
Yeah. Correct. So, to get back on track. Uh

56
00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.479
So could you tell us a little bit about

57
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.020
how you analyze fossil soils? Because I guess that

58
00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.919
when, when people think about fossils, we tend to

59
00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.610
think mostly about, I don't know, the remains of

60
00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.279
animals and stuff like that, but the re uh,

61
00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.779
but soil remnants or soil fossils, it's a little

62
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.070
bit uh weirder, I guess.

63
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.070
IT, it is quite a, quite a, quite a

64
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.619
bit weirder. And so my whole career has been

65
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.490
annoying my colleagues uh because uh Palao sos turn

66
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710
out to be what other people have just regarded

67
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
as ordinary sedimentary beds or altered surfaces to lava

68
00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.679
flows or things like that. So people have noticed

69
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.509
them because they really stick out uh from the

70
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.229
other surrounding rocks. Um The, the big problem for

71
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.000
most people is actually recognizing whether you've got a

72
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.020
soil or not. And that's a large part of

73
00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.850
many of the papers that I write. Why do

74
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.550
I think it's a, it's a paleo oil. Well,

75
00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.570
there's, there's three main things. Um The, the most

76
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.929
important of them is um root traces is something

77
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.309
if you, if there's root fossil, root traces and

78
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.820
they come down from a surface, well, that's a

79
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.660
paleo. So by definition, because something wants to grew

80
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.520
in it, um There's also this rather subtle concept

81
00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.139
that many geologists have not been trained in and

82
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.649
that is the concept of soil structure. So modern

83
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.070
soils have a whole pattern of cracking that we

84
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.660
call pads and they're separated by modified surfaces, we

85
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.890
call Kans and they can be blocky or crumb

86
00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:32.250
or um granular um geologists aren't trained to look

87
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.950
for that. And in fact, they're trained to overlook

88
00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.299
it. Uh THAT'S a kind of a modification. And

89
00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.950
finally, there's the soil horizons um instead of being

90
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:43.040
deposited one layer on top of another as is

91
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.720
normal in sedimentary sequences, soils actually develop from the

92
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.769
surface downwards. So there's an a horizon which is

93
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.045
a mix of organic and mineral, then there's a

94
00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:54.915
modified bee horizon which may be rich in clay

95
00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:58.184
or in, in carbonate or something else. Um And

96
00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.864
these are diffuse horizons that are developing downwards as

97
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:07.024
cells develop sediments deposited. It's um it's a, it's

98
00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.785
a mindset that men have been trained, not only

99
00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:14.190
to not recognize but to even overlook because many

100
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.339
geologists pride themselves in getting beyond the surface, you

101
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.549
know, looking at, at the ancient rock, but these

102
00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.549
things aren't preserved in, even in drill causes and

103
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.019
in and in quarries and in ordinary road cuts.

104
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.790
So it's, it's, it's, it's slightly a question of

105
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.420
me saying, oh, that's a paleo song and people

106
00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:34.559
who studied the rocks before who didn't uh recognize

107
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.459
them getting kind of annoyed. Uh So in some

108
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.779
case, it's very annoying but uh that's it. Yeah,

109
00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:48.190
I, I understand it. So, but tell us a

110
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.079
little bit about what factors play a role in

111
00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.899
soil formation.

112
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.299
Well, this, this goes way back to the Koch

113
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.000
in 1883 and Hans Yani, one of my personal

114
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.390
heroes that there are basically five factors and we

115
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.679
have an acronym clocked and those are um climate,

116
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.850
um organisms, topographic relief um parent material, which is

117
00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:13.579
what you start with to make a soil and

118
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.480
time. And we've known for a long time studying

119
00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:18.799
modern soils, we can make kind of an experimental

120
00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.070
design of space for time um or uh an

121
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.410
experimental design of um uh changing features for the

122
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.720
soil climate by keeping other things constant. We these

123
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.119
things that control the formation of modern soils which

124
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.790
people tease apart with studies of modern souls can

125
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.760
be applied to reconstruct uh the same sorts of

126
00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:42.880
features in the fossil record. Um And it's been

127
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:49.929
really quite lovely to see that we have as

128
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.630
Paedos done a lot of work like this to

129
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.269
make these transfer functions, for example, to try and

130
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.410
find a mathematical relationship between the Menon precipitation and

131
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.500
the depth of the calc horizon in souls which

132
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.649
we can use for ancient uh soils. Uh We're

133
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.410
getting to the basis of soil science and this

134
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.850
is something that the the fossil people plyo seem

135
00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:13.420
to be more interested in than, than, than modern

136
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:16.260
soil scientists who are more interested in um growing

137
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:20.109
more corn or um figuring out how to do

138
00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.589
soils agriculturally. Uh And it's been a whole new

139
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.079
horizon for us. Uh It's been rather wonderful to

140
00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:31.420
see people joining in with ever more sophisticated ways

141
00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:34.510
of figuring out how to infer, for example, paleo

142
00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:36.350
climate from an ancient soil.

143
00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:40.390
And so one of the factors that you mentioned

144
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.059
there is organisms. So what do, what do we

145
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.670
know about how life co evolved with earth?

146
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.170
Um We know quite a bit as it turns

147
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.720
out and this has been the really fascinating part

148
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.440
of it to me is that on earth, uh

149
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.119
souls have developed with the development of plant life

150
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.670
in particular, uh starting out with uh simple things

151
00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:10.910
like lichens, which are a consortium of fungus plus

152
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.290
uh an alga that live mostly on land. Uh

153
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.109
And the, the first evolution of lichens, for example,

154
00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.850
was really a signal event in the evolution of

155
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.100
palaces because it increased the degree of weathering uh

156
00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:28.390
by an order of magnitude. Um Then um we

157
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.989
see big changes in soils with the advent of

158
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.919
early nonvascular land plants and a huge change with

159
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.010
the evolution of trees because suddenly weathering and uh

160
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.780
facilitated by roots went much, much deeper. And then

161
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.940
finally, the evolution of of grasslands, each of these

162
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.840
things created a great carbon sink and have turned

163
00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:51.979
out to regulate planetary temperatures by control of the

164
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.150
carbon cycle uh through time.

165
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.380
By the way, just to make it more clear,

166
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.260
I guess since we're talking about also to some

167
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.989
extent, the evolution of life here when we talk

168
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.630
about soils and paleo soils. Um Are we here

169
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.849
just referring to uh terrestrial soils or is it

170
00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:21.369
that for example, the bottom of the ocean, we

171
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.150
could also call it the soil?

172
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.119
Oh, no, I, I would not call the bottom

173
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.030
of the ocean soil. I I sort of draw

174
00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.109
the line there. Um There have been some of

175
00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:34.049
European soil scientists in particular who figure that the,

176
00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:37.059
the modification of a lake bottom is the soil.

177
00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:39.099
I I do not, I draw the line there.

178
00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:40.500
No, I I think it has to be sub

179
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:47.590
aal modification by definition. Uh REALLY, and that view

180
00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:52.369
has been really reinforced when you consider detailed studies

181
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.770
of paleo. Also, we we do it by looking

182
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.820
at modifications in, in mineral content and in chemical

183
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.309
content down from the ancient surface. Um WE can

184
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.340
see that on land, we get a depletion of

185
00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:09.830
calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium uh from the surface

186
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.919
down on, on the in the bottom of the

187
00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:14.000
ocean. It's just the reverse. We see an enrichment

188
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.940
of those things because uh the the so-called submarine

189
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.929
weathering, which I think is better called hemolysis is

190
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.299
a more technical term, is kind of the opposite

191
00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:27.690
of sulf formation and it's the sulf formation, that's

192
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.650
of more interest because after all, we live on

193
00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.460
land. Um AND we want to see how that's

194
00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:36.929
changed through time. Uh AND how the evolution of

195
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.429
plants can, can, can save us. Um One of

196
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.500
the wonderful things about my work recently uh is

197
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.260
that there is a growing movement of carbon farming

198
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.299
and many modern farmers have looked at the fossil

199
00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:55.729
record, for example of the evolution of grasslands, which

200
00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:59.260
are the the basis for agricultural systems. And uh

201
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.539
using these carbon farming techniques to build soil carbon.

202
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.030
It's the only bright light really that I know

203
00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:09.679
of uh in the uh idea of the greenhouse

204
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.549
effect this outdated destroyers because it's a cheap um

205
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:17.140
way of putting carbon back in the ground where

206
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.929
it belongs.

207
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.140
Mhm And when it comes to having a better

208
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.559
understanding of and studying questions related to, for example,

209
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.429
the co evolution of life and her, as we

210
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.789
mentioned earlier and also, I mean, not only related

211
00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.590
to that but even having a better understanding of

212
00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:44.090
how soils evolve and change over time. Do you

213
00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:48.619
think that we can use barren planets as new

214
00:11:48.729 --> 00:11:49.390
hypothesis?

215
00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:52.359
Oh yeah. No, I love that. Um Yeah. In,

216
00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:54.070
in my first CS of the past, I I

217
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.710
had a chapter on extraterrestrial soils. Uh I always

218
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:03.440
introduce it in lectures as soils in space which

219
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.880
is kind of like a take off on the

220
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.559
Muppets, you know, um I think that's super important.

221
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.309
Um ALTHOUGH some of my colleagues recommended I take

222
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.640
it out because they thought it was too theoretical.

223
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.080
But um there are and they, and they went

224
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.179
on a definition of soil as um something that

225
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.340
supports plant life, which is not the case, of

226
00:12:25.349 --> 00:12:29.859
course, on any planetary bodies. Uh However, um, since

227
00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:31.820
there are footprints on the moon and robots on

228
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.020
Mars, um, they do support life in a literal

229
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.539
sense now and that exploitation will increase uh in

230
00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:42.710
the, in the future. Yes, it's a very important

231
00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:47.270
null hypothesis. The striking thing that we've learned with

232
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.479
really ancient soils going back to 3.7 billion years.

233
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.099
The oldest one I've been able to uh study

234
00:12:53.109 --> 00:12:55.820
in, in, in Greenland is they're very similar to

235
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.619
soils on mars of the same age of about

236
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.630
3.7 billion years old. So it's a super important

237
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.390
um null hypothesis. The Martian soils are very similar

238
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.390
to those on earth. They're clay and they have

239
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.169
salts in them. Um The lunar soils totally mind

240
00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.609
blowing that it's just a kind of a, a

241
00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:21.179
gardening by micro meteorite impact, basically, which is the

242
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.140
concept that um is so different from anything we

243
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.619
could conceive on one of the, the sulfur information

244
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.450
on Venus. This temperature is so hot that it's

245
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.890
pretty much like taking rocks and putting them in

246
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.690
a pot of kiln. It's a, it's a and

247
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.710
it happens quickly. So, um yes, these alternatives are,

248
00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:43.020
are really important, I think and will become more

249
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.609
and more important as we explore the solar system

250
00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:50.559
more and more. Um NOW that I'm retired and

251
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.080
I, I don't have access to all the lab

252
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.390
facilities that that I used to. My, my plan

253
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.619
is to do more and more on Martian Paleo.

254
00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:59.869
Sos because the lovely thing about NASA uh is

255
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.390
that all the data is proprietary. Uh You get

256
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.799
all of it basically, it's public domain. You don't

257
00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:09.739
have, nobody is keeping it from anybody. And I

258
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.460
was on the red team for the current um

259
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:17.729
mission to Jezero Crater and, and we insisted even

260
00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:19.679
though it about tripled the budget that we have

261
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.830
to have sample return. And when that happens about

262
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.229
2030 or so, it's gonna be really amazing. The

263
00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:29.900
organic molecules we'll be able to take from these

264
00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:33.979
actual samples from Mars and which we know exactly

265
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:36.780
where they're from. Um That's gonna turn out to

266
00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:41.130
be, I think super important for figuring out while

267
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.190
soils flourished on earth and died on Mars. It's

268
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.109
really interesting, you know, nothing is forever.

269
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.080
But for example, when it comes to studying, um

270
00:14:55.109 --> 00:14:58.169
I don't know biomarkers, for example, that we might

271
00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:03.210
find i in the soils of uh Mars, uh

272
00:15:03.219 --> 00:15:09.210
isn't there at least some risk of uh contamination.

273
00:15:09.219 --> 00:15:12.890
Of course, nobody yet, no human yet has stepped

274
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.539
foot on Mars itself, but still through the uh

275
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.179
technologies they send out there. Is there that risk

276
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.770
or not?

277
00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:28.640
Yes. Um Well, that's the problem. Uh And this

278
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.729
is why uh people took so long to figure

279
00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:38.549
out the biomarkers in the opportunity to rover samples.

280
00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:42.950
Um BECAUSE there was always AAA real possibility that

281
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.309
they were looking of contamination from pump lubricants or

282
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.059
something like that. On the opportunity. Uh Rover, it

283
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.799
took actually two years at least to figure out

284
00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:57.929
with successive analysis, whether it was indigenous to Mars

285
00:15:57.969 --> 00:16:00.989
or whether it was a part of the um

286
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.739
uh a, a part of the actual Martian organic

287
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.739
matter content. The hope is that we know what

288
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.710
the, the the problem with those robots of course,

289
00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:14.729
is they can only analyze fairly simple things like

290
00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:19.159
pas poly psycho aromatic compounds and other relatively simple

291
00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:21.469
things. The hope is with saddle return and why

292
00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:24.130
we insisted on it uh is that we'll be

293
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.210
able to identify uh more complicated amino acids. Uh

294
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:32.940
And uh DNA RN A uh more complicated polymers,

295
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.210
um It's gonna be very hard to argue that

296
00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:40.590
they're due to contamination, but we do have mechanisms

297
00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:44.619
to look at how indigenous it is with different

298
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.859
autoclave uh sterilization techniques uh on the samples that

299
00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:51.210
uh we can get. Uh AND this was tried,

300
00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.130
of course with Martian meteorites as well. Uh So

301
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.530
it's, it's pretty clear that certain compounds are indigenous

302
00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:01.190
to those Martian meteorites. Uh We hope to do

303
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.960
the same on uh Washington samples when they come

304
00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:07.150
back. Um I am am not the person to

305
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.939
do that. Um I'm not really an organic chemist,

306
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:12.589
but we have some crackerjack people who know how

307
00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:13.910
to do all of this sort of thing. And

308
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.788
I think it's gonna be very eliminating. Mhm. Maybe

309
00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:19.458
it'll show there'll be nothing, you know, may, may,

310
00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:22.729
maybe it'll turn out Mars is actually sterile as

311
00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:25.858
it appears. Um, OR maybe it'll show that for

312
00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:28.808
certain ages we have a strong signal and for

313
00:17:28.818 --> 00:17:32.058
other ages and, and we're now getting Palys ranging

314
00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:35.369
in age from about 3.7 to about 2.7 billion

315
00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:39.109
years. Maybe we'll document the dying out of life

316
00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:39.739
on Mars,

317
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.150
by the way, how far back uh in earth's

318
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.880
history? Can we go and analyze the paleo souls?

319
00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.199
I mean, what are the oldest paleo souls analyzed

320
00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:55.719
to it?

321
00:17:56.589 --> 00:17:58.959
Oh, the oldest complete profiles that I've been able

322
00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:03.819
to analyze uh 3.7 billion years old there from,

323
00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:07.780
from Greenland. Um I think it, I think eventually

324
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.319
we'll find some back to four or so. But

325
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.640
um the lovely thing about considering extraterrestrial materials is

326
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.989
that uh I regard carbonaceous chondrites, a particular kind

327
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.430
of meteorite which is rich in organic matter and

328
00:18:21.439 --> 00:18:24.930
in clay as the primeval paleo sos of the

329
00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:27.900
galaxy. Now they're just bits of soils because they,

330
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.130
they're meteorites, they came down from this. But the

331
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.890
model that is generally accepted is that they formed

332
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.520
on the surface of planets very early on in

333
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.660
the formation of the solar system. And we have

334
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.969
radiometric gauges that limit their age between 200 million

335
00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:46.560
years of the very beginning of the formation of

336
00:18:46.569 --> 00:18:51.000
the solar system about 4.5 to 4.6 billion years,

337
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.829
uh old um different kinds of carbonaceous chondrites, you

338
00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.130
can interpret as different kinds of soil horizon and,

339
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.369
and you can reconstruct what the soil formation was

340
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.510
like. So um there is a possibility of taking

341
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.599
the record back to 4.6 billion years at the

342
00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:11.430
beginning of our, of our solar system to try

343
00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:14.349
and understand what things were like in the beginning.

344
00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:17.560
So there, there's another reason why we should start

345
00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:20.170
getting interested in solar in space because it gives

346
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.069
us a perspective.

347
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.390
Mhm So when it comes to studying the evolution

348
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.530
of life on earth, uh if we want to

349
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.420
do it through or at least add that uh

350
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.839
source of evidence, let's say to the picture uh

351
00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:42.920
if we want to add soils uh or sources

352
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.989
coming from soils, what are some of the biomarkers

353
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.959
or biosignatures of life that we can find uh

354
00:19:50.969 --> 00:19:52.130
geologically?

355
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.680
Oh, all sorts of things. Um There's a whole

356
00:19:55.689 --> 00:20:00.280
bunch of sophisticated organic compounds and um we're hoping

357
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.239
to find that they have a chirality that the

358
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.209
left and right handed molecules are 11 of, one

359
00:20:07.219 --> 00:20:10.079
is preferred over the other as opposed to inorganic

360
00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:13.479
um organic matter, which has um equal numbers of

361
00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:17.359
left and right-handed uh molecules. But from my point

362
00:20:17.369 --> 00:20:19.959
of view, I'm more interested in the big picture

363
00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:23.449
of soil profile evolution and the big picture of

364
00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:27.040
the degree of weathering of souls um weathering of

365
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.189
souls, the weathering reaction, which is basically carbonic acid

366
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.239
destroying feld bars to make clay. That is one

367
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.390
of the biggest carbon sinks. And so in, in,

368
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.390
in the long term, I've been interested to see

369
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.790
how major events in the evolution of life have

370
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.989
moderated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They've actually pulled

371
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.560
it out and they've saved us from another rather

372
00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.619
tragic feature of our solar system. And that is

373
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.819
the increased brightness of the sun. The sun has

374
00:20:57.829 --> 00:21:00.859
actually become brighter by about 30% over the last

375
00:21:00.869 --> 00:21:05.000
4.6 billion years. Uh BECAUSE of stellar evolution and

376
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.500
eventually it'll, it'll, it'll get so bright and so

377
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.560
close, it'll fry life on earth as, as as

378
00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:13.619
we know it. But uh the evolution of first

379
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.930
these lichens, these consortia of algae and, and, and

380
00:21:16.939 --> 00:21:20.550
fungi um that increased carbon consumption by about an

381
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.390
order of magnitude. Uh AND then the evolution of

382
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.880
more sophisticated lichens in the EDI Aron did the

383
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.099
same. Uh THEN the evolution of early nonvascular land

384
00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:31.430
plants did the same in another order of magnitude.

385
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.239
Uh And then the evolution of forest did the

386
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.400
same in another order of magnitude. The evolution of

387
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.270
grasslands uh was a carbon sink. Another order of

388
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.359
mag by about five orders of magnitude, we've pulled

389
00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:47.239
carbon dioxide down to rather low levels over the

390
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.400
history of the earth. And this is kind of

391
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.869
salutary when you think about it. Um And this

392
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.859
is why the farmers love what I'm doing because

393
00:21:55.069 --> 00:21:58.640
about 25% of the world's land area is farmed

394
00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:02.209
and farmers are basically keepers of the thermostat. Uh

395
00:22:02.219 --> 00:22:05.750
They can use techniques which build soil carbon by

396
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.780
keeping ground cover, by conto carping, by rotational grazing.

397
00:22:09.869 --> 00:22:13.640
Uh These various techniques of carbon farming are becoming

398
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.560
more and more popular and uh could save us

399
00:22:16.569 --> 00:22:19.400
from a future greenhouse crisis.

400
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.239
So when it comes to the evolution of life

401
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.810
on earth, of course, the the plant kingdom is

402
00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:33.900
very much intimately tied to the soil. Uh What

403
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.689
are some of the most significant moments in plant

404
00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:41.369
evolution that we can study through paleo?

405
00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:44.569
Yeah, they uh so the the major events and

406
00:22:44.579 --> 00:22:47.660
the evolution of life and, and so particularly plant

407
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.500
life. Uh THE ice ages, it's been kind of

408
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.780
interesting that earth has flirted with ice ages including

409
00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.849
some really serious ones. Um One of the first

410
00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:01.640
ice ages was uh around about 2.4 billion years

411
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:06.170
ago. And that was caused by the chilling effect

412
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.349
of carbon sequestration, increased weathering and also carbon that

413
00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:14.020
went into the first primitive kinds of lichens, which

414
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.130
are um what we call endocytic lichens like a

415
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.969
thing called geo ciron. Uh Then again, another ice

416
00:23:20.979 --> 00:23:23.199
age, the one that's called snowball earth was another

417
00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:25.660
kind of a lichen more like modern lichens in

418
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:31.209
being ecto symbiotic. It um created snowball earth when

419
00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:33.699
the earth was really as cold as it ever

420
00:23:33.709 --> 00:23:36.489
got, but not quite, I've still been able to

421
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.560
find some paleo sos with cracks and sand wedges

422
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:44.469
and stone stripes like you'd find in the dry

423
00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:47.819
valleys of Antarctica and tropical regions. Um So that

424
00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:50.000
was, had a bit a chilling effect. Another ice

425
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.290
age was uh in the late old division about

426
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.170
440 million years ago, that was associated with the

427
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.969
evolution of nonvascular land plants. And then the big

428
00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:02.140
ice age of the carboniferous and permian uh was

429
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.910
caused by the evolution of trees. Uh And my

430
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.719
case which has been taken to heart by farmers

431
00:24:08.729 --> 00:24:10.969
especially is that the reason why we had an

432
00:24:10.979 --> 00:24:12.760
ice age in the last 2 million years is

433
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.430
because of the rise of grassland ecosystems of grasses

434
00:24:17.439 --> 00:24:20.959
and grazers acting in concert to put the carbon

435
00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:21.750
underground.

436
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.989
Mhm So we've been talking a lot about the

437
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.619
life and the co evolution of life and soils

438
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.040
on earth. Uh I would like to ask you

439
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:38.989
now are paleo soils. Uh SOMETHING that we can

440
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.810
also use to study climate change over the course

441
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:45.349
of earth's history.

442
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.390
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, we can get uh all

443
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.000
the climate factors from different features of cells. Um

444
00:24:52.489 --> 00:24:54.459
uh Precipitation, for example, we can get that from

445
00:24:54.469 --> 00:24:56.430
the depth to carbonate in soils. We can get

446
00:24:56.439 --> 00:24:59.890
it from chemical changes in soils, um seasonality, we

447
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.300
can get from the spread of carbonate nodules in

448
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:06.099
soils. Um We can also calculate from soil is

449
00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:09.459
stabilized topic data. The amount of carbon dioxide in

450
00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:12.550
the atmosphere which is very, very interesting. And uh

451
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.989
for my next trick I'm planning on using the

452
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.640
um carbon isotopic measurements of paleo sos to get

453
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:27.079
a global mean paleo temperature going back 3.7 billion

454
00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:30.819
years. That's because we know that carbon dioxide is

455
00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:33.000
mixed in the air on a scale of decades.

456
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.109
Basically, um the uh the problem with using paleo

457
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.540
for palely, of course, it's a local paleo climate.

458
00:25:38.569 --> 00:25:39.979
So it's the amount of rain in a particular

459
00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:42.479
spot and that can vary a lot. But if

460
00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:45.880
we have the carbon dioxide content of any paleo,

461
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.770
so on earth, we know that that reflects the

462
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.459
carbon dioxide content of the whole planet. And we

463
00:25:51.469 --> 00:25:54.489
have a fixed relationship between carbon dioxide of the

464
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.339
whole planet and the um temperature of the whole

465
00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:02.030
planet. So this is gonna give us an interesting

466
00:26:02.219 --> 00:26:06.069
baseline on um evolution through time and we're very

467
00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:08.089
concerned about that. Of course, I I mean, I

468
00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:11.989
just read yesterday that the ocean temperature in Florida

469
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.890
hit 100 and one °F um which is um

470
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.520
unprecedented, unprecedented and it's gonna get harder and harder

471
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.880
understanding these things in deep time is gonna be

472
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.550
an important baseline.

473
00:26:27.099 --> 00:26:31.300
So since you're mentioning that the study of uh

474
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:37.619
ancient climate change through Paleo, sos can also inform

475
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.680
us uh about what we are experiencing now.

476
00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:50.780
Yes, exactly, exactly. Um The interesting thing about many

477
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.500
of the big mass extinctions, for example, is that

478
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.790
they occurred at a time of dramatic increase in

479
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.869
carbon dioxide. Now, it's fashionable to say that in

480
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.469
deep time, we don't have good records of the

481
00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:08.439
time of these massive carbon dioxide increases. But uh

482
00:27:08.449 --> 00:27:11.630
that's just not true. Uh We can see from

483
00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:15.469
paleo sos and from records in valve shells, that

484
00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:18.339
means in shells that were deposited in lakes on

485
00:27:18.349 --> 00:27:21.949
an annual basis that some of the big increases

486
00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:26.449
in coming outside, like the permian Triassic transition. Well

487
00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:30.750
within decades, like the current anthropogenic increase in carbon

488
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.709
dioxide. And interestingly what happened in those examples is

489
00:27:36.719 --> 00:27:43.640
that really strongly carbon consuming ecosystems spread like tropical

490
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.900
soil spread from the equator closer to the poles,

491
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.109
uh even into fairly high latitudes and uh grasslands

492
00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:54.300
spread into deserts. Uh These were able to pull

493
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.979
down carbon dioxide over time scales of about a

494
00:27:57.989 --> 00:28:01.140
million years or or or less. So the time

495
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.920
scales are actually comparable and we're starting to get

496
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.250
the means now uh particularly with uh supercomputers of

497
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.069
uh modeling that carbon sequestration and considering how we

498
00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:16.180
can emulate that for future.

499
00:28:16.989 --> 00:28:21.650
Mhm So I asked you about climate change. What

500
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:27.209
about paleo environments? Can we get a better picture

501
00:28:27.219 --> 00:28:30.770
of what particular environments on earth might have looked

502
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.339
like in the past by studying Paleo Sos?

503
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.410
Oh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They um the interesting thing

504
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.849
about sequences of uh of paleo cells is that

505
00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:45.420
we often get a very similar pattern from one

506
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.369
set of rocks to another. It it usually in

507
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.660
a, in a, a sequence deposit by rivers. For

508
00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.209
example, there are usually weakly developed soils that are

509
00:28:54.219 --> 00:28:57.719
associated with Palia channels which represent the ancient streams.

510
00:28:57.729 --> 00:29:00.609
And then there's some moderately developed paly sos that

511
00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:02.920
represent levies. And then there's some well-developed ones that

512
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.000
represent floodplains. And then there are some super well-developed

513
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.180
ones that represent uplands where there's been very little

514
00:29:09.189 --> 00:29:14.020
deposition to interrupt soil formation. Uh Those patterns have

515
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.719
changed through time. Uh And the the the behavior

516
00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:20.270
of rivers have changed through time. So we went

517
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.329
from braided streams with multiple river courses to streams

518
00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:27.530
that had a more meandering uh pattern. Um We

519
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.329
can get a very nice idea of changes of,

520
00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:35.719
of environment. My most recent paper on snowball earth,

521
00:29:35.729 --> 00:29:38.189
this this time 700 million years ago, when some

522
00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:41.140
people think the whole earth was basically covered in,

523
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.530
in ice have demonstrated that there were at least

524
00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.920
a few patches that were not covered in ice.

525
00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.160
There were some patches even near the equator that

526
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.430
were like the dry valleys of Antarctica. Uh And

527
00:29:53.439 --> 00:29:55.719
um I've flown over the dry valleys of Antarctica

528
00:29:55.729 --> 00:30:00.119
during my studies of um perme paleo salts there.

529
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.410
Uh It's quite remarkable the similarity in these landscapes

530
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.380
you can see from a helicopter and also from

531
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.319
from the field that there are these frost cracking

532
00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:14.380
patterns and these stone straps and other features. Um

533
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.890
And here they are 700 million years old in,

534
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.219
in snowball and this turns out to be important

535
00:30:21.229 --> 00:30:23.709
because many people have wondered if the whole earth

536
00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:26.140
was covered in ice. How did life survive that?

537
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.550
Well, on land, on the, in the sea? Pretty

538
00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.390
hopeless. You know. Um, PHOTOSYNTHESIS would shut down. Everything

539
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.699
was crunched away. Uh, BUT on land, no problem.

540
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.790
Mhm. Uh, BY the way, here, when it comes

541
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.270
to, uh, getting a better picture of, uh, a

542
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.689
particular paleo environment, we're not just talking about uh

543
00:30:50.699 --> 00:30:56.000
let's say, topography, geography, but also about vegetation, right?

544
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.780
We can also learn more about that.

545
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.510
Yes, of course. Yes. Yes. Yes, we can see,

546
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.819
we see patterns in the vegetation um from the

547
00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:07.150
weakly developed soils. They commonly actually preserve fossil leaves

548
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.380
and other things and they form a sort of

549
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.109
early successional kind of vegetation through to the full

550
00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:15.250
successional forest that's on, that's on the floodplain. And

551
00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:22.079
we can find really nice examples of modern environments

552
00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:24.280
that are similar to those in the past. Modern,

553
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.250
what I like to call Souls Skypes that are

554
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.329
similar to those in, in the past. Yeah, for

555
00:31:31.339 --> 00:31:35.359
me, it's kind of mind expanding to take a

556
00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:38.510
view of the earth from a sort of a

557
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.410
worm's eye view from, from soils. Uh It was

558
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.650
kind of amazing to me when I discovered soil.

559
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.890
I started out as a paleo botanist. So, vegetation

560
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.530
and the different kinds of plants in the past

561
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.819
are still of great interest to me, but I

562
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:57.180
soon discovered that not only can you travel with

563
00:31:57.189 --> 00:32:00.359
an eye to botany and, and learn about ecology

564
00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:04.410
and ecological succession and ecological designation. You can also

565
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.890
travel with an eye for soil, for, for soil

566
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.819
fertility, for the different soil types in a particular

567
00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:14.010
um region. Uh This is a view that soil

568
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:19.160
scientists have cultivated for many years, but I think

569
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.050
pale really brings it into focus. Why you would

570
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.040
want to think about things in that way? Mhm

571
00:32:25.449 --> 00:32:28.969
So let me just ask you about one last

572
00:32:28.979 --> 00:32:31.849
topic and I guess that the audience will be

573
00:32:31.859 --> 00:32:35.339
very interested in hearing about this. So you've also

574
00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:39.229
done work on the effects of soil on the

575
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:41.979
taste of wine. So could you

576
00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:45.699
Absolutely. No, no, no. I think I think the

577
00:32:45.709 --> 00:32:48.660
best way of explaining this is with the song

578
00:32:49.689 --> 00:32:54.369
Will Amet Valley Wine from Pinot Noir. I derive

579
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.939
some taste below when Ph of the wine is

580
00:32:57.949 --> 00:33:02.410
high. So Ph was low, the less acidic wine

581
00:33:02.449 --> 00:33:06.750
will spoil given time but fruit forward is so

582
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.910
sublime. In contrast, are the grapes well fed with

583
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.069
acid when the vines are stressed, they seem to

584
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:20.689
be impressed to do their very best to foster

585
00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:24.619
every mammal's need to scatter seed.

586
00:33:26.209 --> 00:33:28.290
Oh my God. I have, I have to tell

587
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.640
you that this is the first on the

588
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.829
shows. I actually wrote the lyrics to that. Driving

589
00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:37.760
through Casablanca in search of Rick's Spa. But the

590
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.969
what I started this idea of looking at um,

591
00:33:42.209 --> 00:33:45.150
wine terroir, uh with my wife and, and we

592
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.500
did what, everybody, where we went, where everyone went,

593
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.550
went for and took a wine tour of the

594
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.609
Will Valley, which is our local, um, viticultural area.

595
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.550
And, uh, here I am, you know, sort of

596
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.589
balding, white haired and, um, with a notebook. Um,

597
00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.849
YEAH, I have these, these fill notebooks, you know,

598
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.319
uh taking notes while I'm drinking wine and of

599
00:34:04.329 --> 00:34:07.079
course, the venters thought, oh, this is someone, you

600
00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:09.649
know, um we'll give him more and we, and

601
00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.129
we ended up getting such a hangover. I decided

602
00:34:12.379 --> 00:34:13.879
that was not the way to do it. But

603
00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.590
what so, but what I discovered when I inquired

604
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.270
of the ventner was that these days they all

605
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.360
have a wine sheet. So for every wine that

606
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.659
they produce, they, they give you where it came

607
00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:27.610
from, uh they tell you whether it's blended, I

608
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.208
threw all those out. Um But in many cases,

609
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.770
they give you the grape and they give you

610
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.500
an exact location and we can correlate that with

611
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.830
the uh individual soil type. And what I found

612
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.389
was that there was an inverse relationship between soil

613
00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:48.050
ph uh and uh one ph um which is

614
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.228
a very important part of the taste of wine.

615
00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.629
Uh If, if it's really acidic, it, it, it,

616
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.320
it has an astringency um if it's uh less

617
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.560
acidic and, and we're talking about a range from

618
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.659
3 to 4 or so which is all on

619
00:35:00.669 --> 00:35:03.520
the acid side. Uh Then, then, then you can

620
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.280
have more of a bouquet. You can have more

621
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.629
of a fruity flavor, but it doesn't last as

622
00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:11.489
long because it doesn't uh preserve so well. Uh

623
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.889
So after all this criticism of the soils, um

624
00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:17.840
not going through to, we actually found something um

625
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.219
which was statistically um robust. Now, that's not to

626
00:35:21.229 --> 00:35:25.919
say that the um highly acidic soils which give

627
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:29.939
um the most interesting wines because the, the, the

628
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.760
from the grapes point of view, the nutrients are

629
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.159
so low that it wants to get out of

630
00:35:35.169 --> 00:35:37.510
there. And so it, it's, it's making grapes that

631
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.199
are gonna be dispersed that are more tempting, more

632
00:35:40.209 --> 00:35:45.439
delicious. Um That's not to say that it's always,

633
00:35:45.449 --> 00:35:48.600
that's, those are always the most esteemed vintages uh

634
00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.810
by wine connoisseurs. So we also ran a correlation

635
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.459
between the ones that are most highly ranked uh

636
00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:59.790
and the amount of rainfall in October, which is

637
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.429
the time of ripening of the grapes. And we

638
00:36:02.439 --> 00:36:04.899
found that if there was no rain in October,

639
00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:07.699
those were the best wines by far. So it's,

640
00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:10.330
it's not as if ph is, is the only

641
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.419
thing. Um THE really esteemed ones, but I was

642
00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:17.489
just in France. Um Well, last week and looking

643
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.449
at Beaujolais, um which is a, a AAA wine

644
00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:24.530
district that upholds this tradition quite well in um

645
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.719
the Valley, we have um Pinot Noirs that are

646
00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:31.949
like those of burgundy, but Beaujolais is a, is

647
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:34.419
a wine that grows on granitic salts that is

648
00:36:34.429 --> 00:36:37.429
super low in nutrients. And I think it's because

649
00:36:37.439 --> 00:36:40.439
there's this paleo o on the granites uh that

650
00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.729
just really sucked out the nutrients uh for them.

651
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.919
And the Beaujolais wines are best and most uh

652
00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:48.629
fruity and most interesting early on the, the bole

653
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.020
Nove. Uh AND they, they, they demonstrate that when

654
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.280
the vines are stressed, they seem to be impressed

655
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:59.790
to really um develop an interesting flavor uh spectrum.

656
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.550
But they don't last. Of course, you can't put

657
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.830
them down for a long, a long time. They're

658
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.909
acidic enough that bacterial infection and observation will eventually

659
00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:08.629
destroy them.

660
00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:12.449
Mhm A and I would imagine that in this

661
00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:15.840
particular case, we are talking about the effects of

662
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.830
soil on grapes that are used to produce wine,

663
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.699
but this would also apply to other aspects of

664
00:37:25.709 --> 00:37:26.689
agriculture,

665
00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:30.649
correct? Oh, yes. Well, the, the French concept of

666
00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:35.050
terra extends to virtually everything, uh cheeses, um fruits,

667
00:37:35.399 --> 00:37:40.479
um uh preserves pickles, all sorts of uh things.

668
00:37:40.489 --> 00:37:45.149
Yes and yes, indeed. It, the idea uh in,

669
00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:49.860
in, in Italy also not only wine but cheese.

670
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.979
Uh uh PROSCIUTTO preserved meats. Um These are all

671
00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:58.169
linked to particular kinds of soils and it's, it's

672
00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:03.010
really kind of wonderful to explore those different tastes

673
00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.179
and how they relate to particular regions. Uh I

674
00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:10.840
think, I think wine, uh cheese and preserved meat,

675
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.510
tourism is going to be really a big thing

676
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.800
as people become a lot more sophisticated about food

677
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:21.199
and shy away from mass production. There's a Velveeta

678
00:38:21.209 --> 00:38:24.689
culture that America has uh foisted upon the world.

679
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.530
Yeah. Uh You know, uh when I introduced the

680
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.030
question about the taste of wine, I was laughing

681
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.850
a little bit because also, as you probably are

682
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.580
aware here in Portugal, we have one of the

683
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:41.040
most famous wines in the world. The Porto wine.

684
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.270
So,

685
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.139
absolutely, yes. Yes. Yes. Um Yes, the Portuguese and

686
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:50.659
the um Northern Spanish wines are quite uh famous

687
00:38:50.669 --> 00:38:53.699
and uh the international Terroir Congress, I think it

688
00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:56.610
was of 2016 was there. And I was really

689
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.879
sorry, I couldn't make it. That Congress, by the

690
00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:02.600
way is absolutely fantastic. I presented my work and,

691
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:05.350
and, and sang my song uh when it was

692
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.879
in Linfield, which is here in, in Oregon. And

693
00:39:08.889 --> 00:39:11.739
uh it's a, it was a four day meeting

694
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.969
and we all lived together in dorms. Uh All

695
00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:18.340
the food was prepared for us and we had

696
00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:22.750
wine pairing lunch. Um And then after morning sessions,

697
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.330
we all hopped on a bus and went to

698
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.560
a vineyard and looked at soil profiles and then

699
00:39:27.689 --> 00:39:30.399
we had a wine pairing dinner, of course with

700
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:33.879
often a live band and dancing. Um uh I'd,

701
00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:36.040
I'd, I'd, I'd love to take my wife to

702
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.899
another one of those. It was such a blast.

703
00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:42.860
Oh, yeah. The most scientific conferences. I, yeah,

704
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:48.159
the Doro region here in where you find the

705
00:39:48.169 --> 00:39:52.800
best grapes, the best vineyards is really beautiful. So,

706
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.439
yes, yes, yes. The other aspect of um that

707
00:39:57.449 --> 00:39:59.370
the, that the French emphasize and I think is

708
00:39:59.379 --> 00:40:02.659
really important is the thousands of years of viticultural

709
00:40:02.669 --> 00:40:09.010
experience um in those regions. Um And uh the,

710
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.790
it, it, it goes back at least to, to

711
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.050
Roman Times. I, I was in Lyon last week

712
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.959
and I learned that um the goals of Lyon,

713
00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:21.139
which was the lun on the capital of Roman

714
00:40:21.149 --> 00:40:24.350
Gaul. They were so keen on the first Italian

715
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.489
wines that came through that and they had no

716
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.389
means to buy it except to sell slaves. I

717
00:40:28.399 --> 00:40:32.750
mean, whoa, that is pretty, that is a pretty

718
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.010
serious investment in wine. And of course, they quickly

719
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.790
learned how to make it themselves. And the same

720
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.149
was true for Hispania uh which was then a

721
00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:44.360
part of the Roman Empire once they got a

722
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.479
taste for Italian wines and, and then they found

723
00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:49.709
their own great varieties that work best for them.

724
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:55.360
Um It was, it was all over. And although

725
00:40:55.669 --> 00:40:59.120
modern great techniques like even the lamb ones have

726
00:40:59.129 --> 00:41:02.919
won awards in in French competitions, even though modern

727
00:41:02.929 --> 00:41:08.120
techniques have improved dramatically, that expertise which goes back

728
00:41:08.129 --> 00:41:10.719
thousands of years is, is a no small part

729
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:12.419
of the tar effect.

730
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:18.139
Yeah, I mean, definitely wine is one of the

731
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:23.360
biggest aspects of Portuguese culinary culture.

732
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.250
That's true. That's true. No, the tradition of Tapas

733
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.120
is taking over the world as well.

734
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.239
Well, well, that, that's more, that's more from Spain.

735
00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:38.560
It is more from Spain, although we also have

736
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.159
them here, but it's more from the Spanish origin.

737
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.479
Yes, I have, I have friends in Portugal who

738
00:41:44.489 --> 00:41:50.889
have really become addicted to Tapas with one. Yes.

739
00:41:51.689 --> 00:41:56.629
Ok. So Doctor Rae uh I'm leaving links in
