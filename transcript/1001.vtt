00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.730
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob. And

3
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.539
today I'm joined by Doctor Edward Hall. He is

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.729
Norman Eve Willem, Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University.

5
00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.439
He works on a range of topics in metaphysics

6
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.629
and epistemology that overlap with philosophy of science. And

7
00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:24.420
today we're focusing mostly on the philosophy of causation

8
00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.510
and we'll talk a little bit about some aspects

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.899
of the nature of reality that might overlap with

10
00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.069
the philosophy of causation. So, Doctor Hall, welcome to

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.860
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.290
Oh, thank you very much for having me. I'm

13
00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.139
delighted to be here.

14
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.150
OK. So how do you approach the issue of

15
00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.500
causation from a philosophical perspective, particularly from the perspective

16
00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.189
of philosophy of science? What is causation exactly?

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.970
Oh, so let me separate the question of how

18
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.110
I approach the topic and, and the much harder

19
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.430
question of what causation is. Um So I'll, I'll

20
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.900
put this in a little bit of kind of

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.099
autobiographical context. I used to approach the study of

22
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.610
causation in a way that I learned from my,

23
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.250
one of my teachers, David Lewis, which was to

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.959
take it that the main task for us as

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.800
philosophers is to come up with some kind of

26
00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:26.629
informative analysis of causation. That's kind of a way

27
00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.319
of filling in the blanks. Um In the following

28
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.459
equation X causes why if and only if blank,

29
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.580
no. And David Lewis famously uh defended a kind

30
00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:40.580
of way of filling in those blanks that that

31
00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:44.769
appealed to counterfactual. So the very simplest version of

32
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.800
the kind of theory or analysis that he endorsed

33
00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.239
was X causes why if and only if if

34
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.500
X had not occurred, why would not have occurred.

35
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.879
And we might add just to for clarity, X

36
00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.029
and Y both do in fact occur. So Susie

37
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.309
throws a rock at a window, the window breaks.

38
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.330
What does it mean to say that her throat

39
00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.230
caused the window to break? It's to say first,

40
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.949
she threw the rock, second, the window broke and

41
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.160
third, and this is the crucial element. If she

42
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.149
hadn't thrown the rock, the window wouldn't have broken.

43
00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.300
Um That wasn't Lewis's preferred analysis. He added some

44
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.759
complexity to it, but it gives you the flavor.

45
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.339
Um And one of the things to emphasize is

46
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.119
that for Lewis, the way to proceed was to

47
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.059
construct analyses like this and then test them against

48
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.059
our intuitively held judgments about cases. So for example,

49
00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.100
the analysis I just gave you looks like it

50
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.139
runs into trouble if we um just think of

51
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.050
the right kinds of cases. Suppose Suzie and Billy

52
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.250
are both throwing rocks at the same window, but

53
00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.979
Susie is a little faster. So it's her rock

54
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.539
that hits the window, whereas Billy's was just a

55
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.600
split second too late. So it's intuitively still the

56
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.119
case that her throat caused the window to break.

57
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.029
And yet if she hadn't thrown the window would

58
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.690
have broken all the same. Thanks to thanks to

59
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.360
the backup. And so this gives you a kind

60
00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.839
of capsule summary, a kind of illustration of a

61
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.089
way of proceeding here. Philosophically, you propose an analysis,

62
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.589
you come up with cases that make trouble, you

63
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.009
go back and revise the analysis or maybe try

64
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.839
something different. And quite a lot of work on

65
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.210
causation in the last I think 50 years has

66
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.600
that flavor kind of proposal and counterexample drawing heavily

67
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.410
on our, on our intuitive reactions to cases. And

68
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.929
I've come to think that a different way of

69
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.100
proceeding is much more helpful. And it's one where

70
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.360
I've been inspired by the work of, of James

71
00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:48.289
Woodward on causation, where, where we should step back

72
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.889
and ask what having a concept of causation or

73
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:56.199
more generally, what thinking about the world in causal

74
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.750
terms does for us? Why is this a valuable

75
00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.690
thing? Yeah. Um And for me, one way to

76
00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.210
focus this is to, is, is to start with

77
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.869
what looks like a kind of like obvious truth,

78
00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.850
like maybe even trivial truth about the sciences, which

79
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.839
is the sciences. Aim to discover and articulate the

80
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.928
causal structure of the world. Um THAT can seem

81
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.230
obvious. Um But if we approach that question in

82
00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:25.700
the way Woodward recommends we should ask like, well,

83
00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.910
what is causation need to mean in order for

84
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.630
this to be a useful characterization of what's important

85
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.049
in science? And, and then no, that's, that gets

86
00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.450
very complicated. Uh We need to think about like,

87
00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:43.609
well, what are the different kinds of value that

88
00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:46.589
causal thinking in causal terms can have for us?

89
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.779
And I don't have a settled view about that.

90
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.010
I think, I, I think Woodward's own view, which

91
00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:54.239
is that we think in causal terms because we're

92
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.209
very concerned, not merely to passively record what goes

93
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.799
on around us and passively predict it, but to

94
00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.760
intervene and navigate and control and manipulate, that's, that's

95
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:07.899
important and causal concepts helps observe that. But I

96
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.459
think a lot of the way we think about

97
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.489
causation is also structured by the need to have

98
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.279
a kind of organized view of the world. Um

99
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.059
So I think that it's a very deep seated

100
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.459
part of the way we humans think about causal

101
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.510
structure that we look for connecting processes. And so

102
00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.239
if I go back to the Suzie and Billy,

103
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.040
both throwing rocks at the window example and ask

104
00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.600
like, well, what are we focusing on when we

105
00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:36.679
immediately judge in the case where they're both throwing

106
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:40.119
that? It's Susie's throw that causes the window break

107
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.600
to break and not Billy's, we're focusing on a

108
00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:46.040
very characteristic kind of process that links her throat

109
00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:48.230
to the windows breaking. It just consists of a

110
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:51.709
rock flying through the air and making contact. And,

111
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.589
and this is something II I do not have

112
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.859
again, a settled view about, but I think one

113
00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.619
way or another, that notion of process is really

114
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.109
important to us. And so when I come back

115
00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:07.309
to your question, what is causation? I tend to

116
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.309
want to rewrite that question and, and pose it

117
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.250
as like what are the most helpful, functional, useful

118
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.529
ways to think about the world in causal terms?

119
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.779
And now things are gonna are gonna get very

120
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.670
hand wavy very fast. I think that it's got

121
00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.500
to be some combination of thinking about the world

122
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.339
in terms as divided up into separately identifiable processes.

123
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.339
But where those processes also have something, some interesting

124
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.489
kind of dependent structure to them. No, like the

125
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.730
the fact that a rock flying through the window,

126
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.429
sorry through the air and and striking window appears

127
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.130
to us as an important process is partly because

128
00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.390
that kind of process has a lot of internal

129
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:53.890
connections. No earlier stages. Um SORRY, later stages of

130
00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:56.670
it depend on earlier stages. The final stage depends

131
00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:59.450
on initial stages, at least when nothing in the

132
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.649
environment like in another throw, you know, from another

133
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.329
vandal like Billy is going on to mask that

134
00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:09.799
dependency. Um So, so in earlier work of mine,

135
00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:12.790
II I sort of ambitiously thought, well, we just

136
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.089
have two distinct concepts of causation. There's a kind

137
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.649
of concept that is just captured by this notion

138
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.910
of dependence. And then there's a concept that I

139
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160
called production, which is somehow captured by the notion

140
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.769
of connecting process. And I now think it's not

141
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.829
that simple, that both of these strands in our

142
00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.350
thinking are very, very important. But how exactly we

143
00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:34.299
knit them together is a complicated matter. So that

144
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:36.700
was a long answer, Ricardo. But hopefully that can

145
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.579
no, I understand this is a very complicated subject.

146
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:45.320
Uh But I mean, here just to make things

147
00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:48.549
clearer because we are approaching things from the perspective

148
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:52.970
of philosophy of science. And I mean, just thinking

149
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.010
about science and looking for example, across the several

150
00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:02.079
different disciplines from physics, chemistry to geology, biology and

151
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:07.399
the social sciences. I mean, ii I have perhaps

152
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.679
two questions I want to ask you. I mean,

153
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.480
is it that what you're trying to do here

154
00:08:12.489 --> 00:08:19.040
as a philosopher is trying to understand um causality

155
00:08:19.049 --> 00:08:24.549
uh as it works across all different fields, all

156
00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:27.779
different areas and in all different kinds of circumstances,

157
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.390
I mean, basically have a, an overall framework as

158
00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:35.570
to how we can determine that something caused another

159
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.780
or a couple of things caused uh uh uh

160
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:44.190
something else, whatever or uh for example, uh I'm

161
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.380
asking you this because of course, if we look

162
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.390
across the several different scientific disciplines, it seems that

163
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.320
the way we determine that something caused another uh

164
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.440
is different. So for example, if we look at

165
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.229
physics, the way we determine that something caused another,

166
00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:04.940
there, it seems very different or it seems I

167
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.309
might be wrong, but it seems very different from

168
00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:11.299
the way we determine that uh I mean, the

169
00:09:11.309 --> 00:09:14.640
cause of a particular behavior of a human or

170
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.390
another animal. In, for example, biology, psychology, I mean,

171
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.520
iii I in a very simplistic way, I guess

172
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.429
it would seem that things become more and more

173
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.640
complicated as we move through levels of analysis. So

174
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.190
again, going back to the question, I was trying

175
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.059
to ask you, are you trying to come up

176
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.549
with the a universal framework to determine causation, whatever

177
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:45.030
kind of scientific discipline we're talking about? Or do

178
00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:50.349
you think that we should understand causation depending on

179
00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.799
the object of study or the question we are

180
00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:56.429
trying to answer?

181
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.340
I think it's a great question. I will say

182
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:03.979
my own ambition, which I recognize is absurd is

183
00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:07.010
to come up with a universal account. It's exactly

184
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.239
to do that. But at the same time, it's

185
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.400
obvious that there are differences between the fields and

186
00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:18.599
in how they, you know, just the methodologies for

187
00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:21.320
trying to figure out what causes what and, and

188
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.549
maybe even for um but in some loose sense,

189
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.530
they, they mean by causation now, I, I wanted

190
00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:30.580
to say that's a loose sense. II I think

191
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.929
part part of the reason I have this kind

192
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.090
of absurd ambition is I, I don't think it's

193
00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:37.599
just some weird linguistic accident that we use the

194
00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:41.530
same term so fluently in so many different areas.

195
00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:44.820
Um, um, I mean, it might be, no, it,

196
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.969
it might be that at the end of the

197
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.080
day we should just think that social scientists should

198
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.080
use a different word from physicists and they should

199
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.369
use a different word from biologists And we'd all

200
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.419
do a much better job of not confusing each

201
00:10:56.429 --> 00:11:00.039
other if we sort of jettison the single word

202
00:11:00.049 --> 00:11:02.900
cause. But, but I, I don't think that's right.

203
00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:05.140
Um Now, that's just a hunch, it's a working

204
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:10.640
hypothesis. Um um But it, it may be that

205
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.799
in order to fulfill that ambition of having a

206
00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:16.700
universal theory, we, we need an approach that recognizes

207
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.659
that there are gonna be a number of different

208
00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:21.539
parameters to pay attention to and in some fields,

209
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.679
those parameters will have one setting and in another

210
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.059
field, they'll have a different setting and that will

211
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.719
make a comparatively superficial difference to how people talk

212
00:11:30.729 --> 00:11:34.659
about causation, even though the underlying no structure of,

213
00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:37.239
of thought is very similar. Um That's again a

214
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.229
working hypothesis. But I'll give you one example of

215
00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:43.859
where I think that plays out sometimes in some

216
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:48.340
settings, we, we work with a, a fairly clear

217
00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:52.320
understanding of normal conditions. And on the one hand,

218
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.280
and deviations from those conditions, on the other hand,

219
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:59.349
um So even in my little prosaic example of

220
00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:02.280
Susie, throwing a rock at a window, you know,

221
00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:05.159
throwing a rock is a deviation from something like

222
00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:08.080
normal conditions where she just like sitting around or

223
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.169
the rock stays idle on the ground. No rock

224
00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:13.440
being propelled through the air is a deviation from,

225
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.479
you know, what we might think of as like

226
00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:20.289
the normal conditions for rock in those circumstances. Um

227
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.880
IN physics, it might be even clearer. And we,

228
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.200
the, the easiest examples from physics will take us

229
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.320
back to Newton. So they're a bit dated. But

230
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.159
the whole idea of a force um is under

231
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:35.880
conceptualized as something that's a deviation from a background

232
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.950
condition. The kind of default condition for an object

233
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.630
is to have no force on it. And by

234
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.169
default, we don't mean common. Now, Newton was perfectly

235
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:48.210
aware that most objects, maybe all objects at all

236
00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:50.609
times have forces acting on them. But if you

237
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:52.190
think about how we set up his laws of

238
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.739
motion, the first law of motion is an object

239
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.780
not acted upon by a force moves with constant

240
00:12:56.789 --> 00:13:03.330
velocity. And that, you know, that's a mathematically that

241
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.679
law is a trivial consequence of the second law

242
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.309
that says f equals ma force equals mass times

243
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.440
acceleration. Because if you know force is zero, then

244
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.000
by that equation acceleration is zero. So velocity is

245
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.409
constant. So why did he single out, you know

246
00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:21.210
this one case as for special attention? Well, I

247
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:23.450
think it was to set it up a a

248
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.489
certain conceptual structure where we think of the world

249
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.450
when we have our Newtonian glasses on as a

250
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.599
world where the kind of the default no behavior,

251
00:13:34.609 --> 00:13:38.119
the kind of behavior provided nothing is interfering of

252
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.919
any object is to just move with constant velocity.

253
00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:43.250
And then of course, is a deviation from that.

254
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.599
And that can be very important in how we

255
00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:48.380
think about causation. It already structures things a certain

256
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.590
way. It's natural when you have a really rich

257
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:55.500
conception of default versus de default states versus deviations

258
00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:58.070
there from, to think of causes as things that

259
00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:00.080
in the first instance, whatever else they are, they

260
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.109
need to be deviations. And it also helps with

261
00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:06.960
understanding counterfactual. So in my example, and I said,

262
00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:08.460
like if Susie hadn't thrown the rock at the

263
00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:10.500
window, the window wouldn't have broken. This is the

264
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.309
original case where we don't have Pesky Billy in

265
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.179
the background trying to break it. At the same

266
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.169
time. You, you know, you and your listeners probably

267
00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:20.830
heard that counterfactual thought. Yeah, that's obviously right. If

268
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.919
she hadn't thrown, no, nothing else was going to

269
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.340
do it. So it wouldn't have broken. But notice,

270
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:28.820
I didn't say when I asked you to entertain

271
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.669
that kind of counterfactual supposition, suppose she hadn't thrown,

272
00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:36.340
then what would have happened? I didn't say, you

273
00:14:36.349 --> 00:14:40.309
know, she was doing anything else. No. In fact,

274
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.890
I didn't specify much about what she's doing in

275
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.900
that kind of factual situation aside from the mere

276
00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:50.590
fact that she's not throwing a rock. Well, who

277
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.520
knows, maybe she's running up and kicking the window

278
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.760
instead, but you didn't hear it that way. You

279
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.210
didn't hear it that way at all. What you,

280
00:14:57.219 --> 00:14:59.260
you probably did is like, like said, well, some

281
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.059
kind of default state replaces the actual deviation where

282
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.159
she's throwing and, and the default state for the

283
00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:09.000
rock in particular would be one where it's still

284
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.159
on the ground. No, and no other processes have

285
00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:13.880
been set in motion that are aimed at the

286
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.210
wind, breaking the window. Ok? But it doesn't always

287
00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:20.460
work like that. Like think about causation in our

288
00:15:20.469 --> 00:15:27.349
mental lives. Suppose. Um um TRYING to think of

289
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:32.609
a good example. Um SUPPOSE I'm, you know, trying

290
00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.210
to decide what to do and a bunch of

291
00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:36.059
thoughts are running through my head and they lead

292
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.909
me to a certain conclusion and we ask like,

293
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:42.830
what would have happened if I hadn't? No drawing

294
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.929
that one inference I did at a certain step.

295
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.109
No, in my mental thought. Well, when you play

296
00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:51.390
out examples like this, it might be that the

297
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.950
first thing that comes to mind is like, who

298
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.710
knows? Like there's no obvious like default status for

299
00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:01.359
my mental life. No, to revert to in the

300
00:16:01.369 --> 00:16:06.369
counterfactual situation. Um A maybe clear example of, of

301
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.599
how there can be no default is like, suppose

302
00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:12.539
I ask like, suppose I had been, um, had

303
00:16:12.549 --> 00:16:14.479
grown up to be taller than I in fact

304
00:16:14.489 --> 00:16:17.070
am. So, I'm a little bit under 6 ft.

305
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.390
How tall would I have been? So, so I'll

306
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.119
ask you that, Ricardo. Like, what, what do you

307
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.940
think? Like, how should we answer a question like

308
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:33.510
that? I don't know. Exactly. Yeah. It's like, I

309
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.299
don't know, you know, 6 ft or above somewhere,

310
00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:40.219
but it's indeterminate. We think, like, if I had

311
00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:42.969
been taller, we don't think like there's any very

312
00:16:42.979 --> 00:16:45.340
determinate story about how much taller it would have

313
00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:47.299
been. And that's because there, there's no kind of

314
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:49.710
default setting for us to go to. So if,

315
00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:52.330
if all I say is I'm not this tall.

316
00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:56.429
No. Um THEN, then we're left, it's left wide

317
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.049
open how to fill in the details. Whereas very

318
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:02.450
often when we're using causal concepts and using counterfactual

319
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.030
to try to unpack them, it's not wide open

320
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.069
how to fill in the details. No. Um But

321
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.709
that's something that I think can vary between disciplines.

322
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.670
No. Um NO another, another parameter that can vary

323
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.550
is in some disciplines, there's a kind of natural

324
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.060
way to carve up any situation into different variables

325
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.829
that we can in principle, at least tweak or

326
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.060
toggle or very independently of one another. Um This

327
00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:33.170
is like the idea of a controlled experiment if

328
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.290
I have some piece of the world and I'm

329
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.380
doing a controlled experiment, the first thought you have

330
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.260
maybe even without even noticing it is OK. There's

331
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.989
some variables that characterize the thing in a controlled

332
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
experiment consists in manipulating one or more of them

333
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.020
while holding the others fixed. OK. Um But in,

334
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.900
in the social settings, we can't always do that.

335
00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:57.849
Um CONSIDER for example, how people dress what people's

336
00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:02.579
biological, perceived, biological sexes and when whether people are

337
00:18:02.589 --> 00:18:05.310
gender, non conforming. So this is an example I

338
00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:07.939
learned from one of my phd students, she, she

339
00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:10.339
asked you to imagine like Billy goes in for

340
00:18:10.349 --> 00:18:14.569
a job interview and he's clearly presents as male.

341
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.160
Now, maybe has a beard and just his, his

342
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.650
physique would, um, and facial structure like would, would

343
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.619
immediately signal to anyone like, ok, he's male. Um,

344
00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:30.709
BUT he's wearing a dress and makeup and carrying

345
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:34.569
a purse. Ok. And we might wonder if social

346
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:40.660
psychologists how he'll be received by the interviewer. Um

347
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.510
And offhand, there are three things that the interviewer

348
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.260
might be paying attention to his sex. No, that

349
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.880
like or, or might care about, say even have

350
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.010
biases about. It might be that the interviewer is

351
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.060
biased against males. It might be, the interview is

352
00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:59.660
biased against people who wear dresses and makeup doesn't

353
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.390
matter whether they're male or female might be. The

354
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.390
interview is biased against people who dress in a

355
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.310
gender, non conforming way. They don't have a problem

356
00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:08.829
with males. They don't have a problem with females.

357
00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:10.180
They don't have a problem with wearing dresses, et

358
00:19:10.189 --> 00:19:12.640
cetera, but it's got a match in their mind,

359
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.459
right. So here are three parameters, all of which

360
00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:19.880
could causally matter his sex, his physical dress and

361
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.030
appearance, and whether he's gender conforming in his dress,

362
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.939
all this can matter. But notice you can't toggle

363
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:31.150
those independently of each other. There's no such thing

364
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.500
as a controlled experiment that isolates one of them

365
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.000
and holds and manipulates one of them while holding

366
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.489
the others fixed. And once you see this point,

367
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.250
this is due to Lily, who, who's now a

368
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260
philosopher at Yale, you see this is like widespread

369
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.199
across the social world. You know, we have, we

370
00:19:47.209 --> 00:19:53.319
regularly work with characteristics or parameters or variables that

371
00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:56.869
we want to attribute some causal status to. But

372
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.160
where we can't think of them as like independently

373
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.099
manipulable. OK. So there's, there's a, there's a, there's

374
00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:06.699
a sort of very specific way in which the

375
00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:10.109
social sciences differ from other sciences where we can

376
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:13.310
analyze things in terms of independently manipulable variables. And

377
00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:15.949
that's gonna make a difference to how we think

378
00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:18.979
about causation. Um But going back to your original

379
00:20:18.989 --> 00:20:22.439
point, it doesn't, to me at least immediately ruin

380
00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:24.699
the the prospect of coming up with a universal

381
00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:27.400
account. It just means a universal account has to

382
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:32.280
be flexible enough to sort of like know how

383
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.550
to apply in a case where you've got independently

384
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.660
manipulable variables and how to apply in a case

385
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.500
where you don't to know how to apply in

386
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.800
a case where you've got a clear distinction between

387
00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:43.819
a default state and deviations there from and how

388
00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:45.260
to apply in a case where you don't and

389
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.819
so on.

390
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.400
So let me ask you a different kind of

391
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:54.380
question. Now. Um What is the metaphysical status of

392
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:59.280
causation? I mean, is causation itself part of the

393
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.979
structure of reality or is it just the things

394
00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:07.390
that have a cause or relation between themselves that

395
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.199
are part of reality?

396
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.310
That's a great, great question. I, I don't know

397
00:21:14.699 --> 00:21:16.829
myself. I don't think any of us do. I

398
00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:21.420
guess I do like to think about that question

399
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.939
by relocating it to a question about fundamental laws

400
00:21:26.949 --> 00:21:30.760
of nature. And the reason I do that relocation

401
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.979
is already committing me on the metaphysics of causation

402
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.459
because in general, and we ask whether something is

403
00:21:37.469 --> 00:21:40.180
a genuine part of reality kind of independent from

404
00:21:40.189 --> 00:21:43.229
us or is perhaps like an illusion or maybe

405
00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:45.859
a projection onto reality of some aspect of our

406
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:49.680
psychology. Um EVEN if we take it to be

407
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:51.660
a genuine part of reality, we can ask where

408
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.180
it's located, like how fundamental is it. So just

409
00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:58.130
to help clarify that, I, I think that there

410
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.729
are lots of properties of material objects that they

411
00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:03.180
have quite independently of us. For example, I think

412
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.300
that the table, that's the, the coffee table that's

413
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.689
next to me right now is a solid object

414
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:11.810
and, and more or less rigid. It's a rigid,

415
00:22:11.819 --> 00:22:15.319
solid object. Um And I don't think that has

416
00:22:15.329 --> 00:22:17.050
anything to do with me or anyone else. I

417
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.349
think it just is that way intrinsically independently of

418
00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:25.119
how humans think about it. Um And, but even

419
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.900
if I'm right about that, it's not as if

420
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.660
solidity or rigidity, those two properties are fundamental. It's

421
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.020
not like quirks, you know, are solid and rigid

422
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.969
or not, you know, it's just not a, a

423
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:40.390
category that applies at that stage. So it's natural

424
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.619
to think in, in some sense, these properties of

425
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.420
the table are derivative of something deeper. And I

426
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.359
tend to favor approaches to causation that assume that

427
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:52.130
if it's part of the real furniture of the

428
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.729
world, it is. So in a derivative sense doesn't

429
00:22:55.739 --> 00:22:57.550
make it any less real, just means it's not

430
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.229
fundamental now, that might not be right, but let's

431
00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.829
run with it for a minute, right? Um Then

432
00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.310
we can ask if it is derivative, what's it

433
00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:10.290
derivative on? And to me, the most crucial ingredient

434
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.680
down at the foundations would be something like fundamental

435
00:23:12.689 --> 00:23:15.089
loss of nature, you know, the aspects of the

436
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:18.939
real of reality that distinguish between what in a

437
00:23:18.949 --> 00:23:21.770
kind of physical sense can happen and what can't

438
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.770
happen. Um And then we can ask, OK, well,

439
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.819
what about those elements of reality? Are they or

440
00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:30.890
sorry? Elements of our description of reality? I should

441
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.579
be more careful, are they really part of reality

442
00:23:34.589 --> 00:23:37.020
or are they simply something like a, a conceptual

443
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.420
overlay we impose on reality and there, I, I

444
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.380
don't know, I mean, depending on the time of

445
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.790
day and how much coffee I've had and what

446
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.829
mood I'm in, I'll sort of lean one way

447
00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:53.229
or the other. Um, AND I think that some

448
00:23:53.239 --> 00:23:55.369
of the most interesting recent work in metaphysics and

449
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.930
philosophy, science has been about this question and there's

450
00:23:57.939 --> 00:24:00.829
a kind of divide between people on one side

451
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:03.930
who view themselves as heirs to David Hume and

452
00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:06.949
think like no reality itself doesn't have any law

453
00:24:06.969 --> 00:24:10.260
or necessity in it. Um It's rather that we

454
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.459
can describe it in certain ways that are useful

455
00:24:12.469 --> 00:24:15.010
to us. Now, we can pick out certain claims

456
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.819
about reality or at least could if we knew

457
00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:21.959
enough as being the laws, not because they're metaphysically

458
00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:25.760
special, but because those claims are particularly useful to

459
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.800
us in organizing our view of the world. That's

460
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.459
a kind of quick overview of like one way

461
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.949
of thinking about um law. Um And then there

462
00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:35.380
are people on the other side who think no,

463
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.359
no, the world really does have necessity in it.

464
00:24:38.369 --> 00:24:41.709
There are lots of variations on that second view.

465
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.300
Um But, but I find it, I find that

466
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.939
a really deep question and it's not clear how

467
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:49.880
to get to the bottom of it right now.

468
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.599
I think the most productive work is being done

469
00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:55.359
just trying to lay out those options with as

470
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:58.359
much clarity and depth as possible so that we

471
00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:00.530
can get to the point where we can ask

472
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.920
this harder question, how would we decide between them?

473
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.430
But I don't think we're there yet.

474
00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:08.750
I mean, I guess that if we wanted to

475
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.040
really complicate this question about the metaphysical status of

476
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.170
position to the maximum extent, I guess we could

477
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.449
say something like or start with something like OK,

478
00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:24.000
so uh uh uh in my question, I mentioned

479
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.979
uh things and then I mentioned causal causal relations

480
00:25:27.989 --> 00:25:31.770
between them. But even mentioning things themselves is already

481
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.719
starting from an assumption that there are actually things

482
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.280
in the world. I mean, sort of optic perspective

483
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.739
of the world because if you get into stuff

484
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.959
like there are people coming from complexity theory and

485
00:25:47.969 --> 00:25:52.319
dynamical systems theory, chaos theory that I intend to

486
00:25:52.329 --> 00:25:58.040
talk more about relations processes and they don't like

487
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.699
things, they don't really like to talk about things

488
00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:06.199
or whatever I think might be and then uh

489
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.760
to complicate even further, we might get into stuff

490
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:15.510
like neuroscience and cognitive science and say, and physics

491
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.939
as well and say, but look even the things

492
00:26:18.949 --> 00:26:22.859
you are referring to are not there really because

493
00:26:22.869 --> 00:26:25.510
that's only what you see, what we see through

494
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.300
our perception. And so whatever we are referring to

495
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.140
that is also not part of the structure of

496
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.890
reality itself and that's another complication. Uh And then,

497
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.439
and then, I mean, there are people II, I

498
00:26:41.449 --> 00:26:44.339
mean, I mentioned the people who prefer things like

499
00:26:44.349 --> 00:26:47.099
relations or processes. But then on the other side,

500
00:26:47.109 --> 00:26:50.160
people who prefer to talk about things, they might

501
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:55.219
say that, I mean, possibly causation is not even

502
00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:58.020
part of the structure of reality itself. It's just,

503
00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:03.099
it's just how we experience uh I mean, events

504
00:27:03.109 --> 00:27:07.939
happening or things I interacting with, with one another.

505
00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:13.869
It's just moral, uh let's say an epistemological approach

506
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.589
to whatever we experienced or something along those lines.

507
00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:21.949
But wherever the case, I mean, it doesn't matter

508
00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:26.339
if people from complexity theory or some other similar

509
00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:30.729
approach or the atomist are, right? Uh uh But

510
00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:35.410
uh if one or the other is right, also

511
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:42.010
the way we understand causation itself, it changes completely,

512
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.900
right? And so I guess that what I'm trying

513
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.170
to say is that when considering the metaphysical or

514
00:27:50.189 --> 00:27:54.699
ontological status of causation, we could get into all

515
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:57.150
of these sorts of complications.

516
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.140
Yeah, I think, I think one of one of

517
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.790
the things that attracts me to thinking of causation

518
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.050
as derivative is it allows you to be flexible

519
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.849
in no, like I, if any time we take

520
00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:13.810
something to be fundamental, the question naturally arises like,

521
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:16.660
well, which category are you putting it in? No.

522
00:28:16.689 --> 00:28:20.290
Um um No, it would be, it might be

523
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.689
weird to say there are things that are fundamental

524
00:28:22.699 --> 00:28:25.770
and there are also processes that are fundamental and

525
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.380
there are, you know, events that are fundamental, you

526
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.900
know, all together. No. Um BUT but I I'm

527
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.050
a kind of like, I'm hopeful that we, when

528
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.270
it comes to causation, we can be ecumenical and

529
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.609
say like, well for certain purposes, it might be

530
00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:41.530
useful to think about some part of the world

531
00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:45.770
as carved up into processes, not distinct things say.

532
00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:50.040
Um um But you can still like, especially if

533
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:53.689
you take a broadly counterfactual approach, talk about dependence,

534
00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:56.930
relations between different stages of a process just as

535
00:28:56.939 --> 00:29:00.439
you can talk about like dependence, relations between something

536
00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:02.199
that a thing is doing at one time and

537
00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:04.030
something that some other thing is doing at another

538
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.060
time. Um I do think though, like your, your

539
00:29:07.069 --> 00:29:10.800
comment made me like realize that there's more to

540
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.900
say about this reality question when it comes to

541
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:19.560
distinctions between different kinds of causes. Um Because when

542
00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:21.810
we think about the world, it's not just that

543
00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:23.849
we think about the world in causal terms, we

544
00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:27.969
also have causal taxonomies. Um No, we think of

545
00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:33.250
flammability as a distinct power from solubility, say um

546
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.540
or if I want to do it in terms

547
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.920
of processes, we think that no, when, when Susie

548
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.510
throws a rock at a window and Billy throws

549
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.439
a rock at a window, maybe they're throwing it

550
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.560
separate windows now and both windows break that it's

551
00:29:47.569 --> 00:29:50.199
the same kind of process in each case that

552
00:29:50.209 --> 00:29:53.489
led to the windows breaking. Whereas, you know, if,

553
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.920
if an airplane goes by and breaks the sound

554
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.209
barrier and the Sonic boom breaks the window. That's

555
00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:02.459
a different kind of process. And that seems very

556
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.569
important in the sciences too. I remember, you know,

557
00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:06.609
way, way back, I won't tell you how long

558
00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:09.329
ago that's that secret. But when I was studying

559
00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:12.729
chemistry as an undergraduate, um part of what we

560
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:14.949
had to learn when we were learning organic chemistry

561
00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:18.560
is distinct reaction mechanisms. That was a basic explanatory

562
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:20.489
notion in the field, the notion of a distinct

563
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.660
reaction mechanism. And that's a causal notion we're thinking

564
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.800
about like there are chemical reactions about in the

565
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.810
world. A lot of particular chemical reactions gazillions of

566
00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:33.410
them happening all the time. And we categorize those

567
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.939
causal processes, those individual discrete causal processes into types

568
00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:40.189
and say like, well, all these reactions are the

569
00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:42.989
same and all these reactions are different but similar

570
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.290
in the following way and so on. And it's

571
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.630
really, really important to the advancement of science that

572
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.979
we have an effective way of doing that like

573
00:30:50.989 --> 00:30:57.209
a useful, flexible illuminating taxonomy of causal types. OK?

574
00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:00.670
Is, are those distinctions real we can ask your

575
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.369
question? Um OR they are they somehow imposed by

576
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.630
us now? Like you could put it this way

577
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.750
from a God's eye view. Are there any distinctions

578
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.989
but like built in distinctions between causal types? Um

579
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.619
OR, or any such distinctions that are special? No,

580
00:31:17.729 --> 00:31:19.780
we can draw distinctions all over the place. But

581
00:31:20.229 --> 00:31:21.969
when in fact, what we do is we draw

582
00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:24.430
them in very particular ways we say like, no,

583
00:31:24.439 --> 00:31:28.000
this reaction is really fundamentally different from this reaction

584
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.989
mechanism. Um But in saying that, are we tracking

585
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.020
a distinction that's like out there in the world

586
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.530
and we're simply discovering it or are we imposing

587
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.640
a kind of taxonomic structure on the world? That's

588
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:43.160
another question I find really interesting. Um And I,

589
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.469
I think this is gonna sound wishy washy. I

590
00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:47.229
think this is a theme in, in my work.

591
00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:50.689
But I think somehow there's a combination somehow like

592
00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:52.989
there's a lot of imposition on the world that

593
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.020
we do. Um But the world lends itself to

594
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.979
being imposed on by creatures like us in some

595
00:31:58.989 --> 00:32:00.109
ways better than others.

596
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.449
Yeah, I think that that last bit connects to

597
00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:07.969
one of the brief things I mentioned in my

598
00:32:07.979 --> 00:32:12.770
previous question when I said that uh perhaps we

599
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.770
should think if something is just part of the

600
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.959
way we epistemological approach the world or part of

601
00:32:21.969 --> 00:32:26.300
reality itself because, and, and that's a very, I

602
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.560
guess, complicated question because to, to know what the

603
00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:34.459
world is about the nature of reality, we have

604
00:32:34.469 --> 00:32:40.114
to approach it with some epistemological framework in mind.

605
00:32:40.484 --> 00:32:45.915
But then, but then separating what is epistemology from

606
00:32:45.925 --> 00:32:51.435
what is metaphysics is very, very complicated and sometimes

607
00:32:51.525 --> 00:32:56.685
we as humans might get uh iii I mean,

608
00:32:56.694 --> 00:33:02.989
might find ourselves uh confusing what is part of

609
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.380
the epistemological framework with what is reality itself.

610
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.270
Yeah, I think that's, that's exactly Right. And that's

611
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.869
a really important insight and, and going back to

612
00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:18.099
your first question about like, how, how do I

613
00:33:18.109 --> 00:33:21.900
approach the study of causation part of what ended

614
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.199
up making me a little frustrated with the old

615
00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:27.089
fashioned way of like, we just amass, just generate

616
00:33:27.099 --> 00:33:29.010
intuitions about cases and try to come up with

617
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.579
a good analysis. Is it, is it, it's kind

618
00:33:31.589 --> 00:33:35.420
of blind to this point you're making no, like

619
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.689
you wonder like, well, why are like, like what's

620
00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:41.119
the value in the analysis? Is it getting at

621
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.439
the the way like if we have a successful

622
00:33:43.449 --> 00:33:46.449
analysis, has it revealed to us the metaphysical nature

623
00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:48.569
of causation? Or is it simply revealed to us

624
00:33:48.579 --> 00:33:51.359
something about our own minds and how we find

625
00:33:51.369 --> 00:33:54.369
it convenient to think? And, and I think it

626
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.609
can be, it can be good but very difficult

627
00:33:56.619 --> 00:33:59.729
to just front load that question, right? And, and

628
00:33:59.739 --> 00:34:03.819
ask like, what, what kinds of epistemic and practical

629
00:34:03.829 --> 00:34:06.609
needs do we have such that thinking in one

630
00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:08.790
way rather than another is gonna be effective at

631
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.620
meeting those needs? And once we're sufficiently aware of

632
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:15.699
that, how should we rethink that metaphysics epistemology divide?

633
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.688
You know, 11 area that I think could use

634
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.540
more attention here, believe it or not, is mathematics

635
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.659
now, we don't think of causation is happening in

636
00:34:26.668 --> 00:34:31.610
mathematics. Um But, but we do talk about explanation

637
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.550
and we do work with a conception of mathematics

638
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.610
that is structured like even the basic distinction between

639
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.899
what counts as an axiom of a certain branch

640
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:45.069
of mathematics versus a theorem um is, is kind

641
00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:48.697
of imposing some structure on, on the subject matter.

642
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:51.789
And there too, like there, II I think one

643
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:53.728
thing that can be helpful about thinking about mathematics

644
00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.539
is it's, it's a little more tractable. Like I,

645
00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:58.928
I tend to think for ex if we go

646
00:34:58.938 --> 00:35:01.708
back to the, the, the distinction between axioms and

647
00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:05.368
theorems that there's nothing in metaphysical reality that draws

648
00:35:05.378 --> 00:35:10.540
a distinction between axioms and theorems. Whether um or,

649
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.139
or, or at least not just out in metaphysical

650
00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:16.800
reality. What's true is that certain claims strike us

651
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:21.290
as obvious? No. Um MAYBE so obvious that they

652
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.510
wouldn't become more obvious if we proved them from

653
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.760
other mathematical claims. And for those reasons and maybe

654
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.600
because they're like sufficiently powerful enough that we can

655
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.000
prove lots of things from them, we over time

656
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.860
settle on some is playing the role of axioms

657
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.250
now. But there's a nice example if, if that's

658
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.840
right of a distinction where it could be really

659
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.810
easy to be tempted by the metaphysical picture, like

660
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.610
some truths about arithmetic or about the numbers are

661
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.060
just metaphysically fundamental. And those are the axioms, you

662
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.479
don't have to go that way and, and it's

663
00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:57.590
more productive, I think, to step back and ask

664
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.320
like, well, why, what is the notion of axiom

665
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.110
do for us? Why do we need it? And

666
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.709
then you can start reflecting that well, we need

667
00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:07.659
to regulate our practice with each other of, you

668
00:36:07.669 --> 00:36:10.239
know, doing mathematics, say, doing the theory of arithmetic

669
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.879
in a certain way. And it's helpful to have

670
00:36:11.889 --> 00:36:13.699
some statements that we can all point to as

671
00:36:13.709 --> 00:36:16.080
ones that, that in principle, at least should be

672
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.209
starting points and, and so on. And likewise, in

673
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:21.629
the case of causation, I think it's, it's useful

674
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:25.030
to think like what does structuring our conception of

675
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.050
the world or some portion of the world in

676
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.659
causal terms do for us collectively? And how, how

677
00:36:30.669 --> 00:36:34.850
might getting clear about that about our own epistemic

678
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.830
and practical needs and the way they drive the

679
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.949
way we set up our thought, how could that

680
00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:43.169
get us to rethink the metaphysics epistemology divide? That's

681
00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:46.350
a really great um question. And I think a

682
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.389
really productive area for inquiry in philosophy.

683
00:36:49.879 --> 00:36:53.189
Yeah. And I mean, you mentioned mathematics there and

684
00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:56.040
it's very interesting because there's also this never ending

685
00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:02.040
discussion about if uh the numbers, mathematics, I know

686
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:07.889
geometric structures are part of reality itself or if

687
00:37:08.179 --> 00:37:11.780
mathematics uh the entire field of mathematics is just

688
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.040
a human invention. And we can't really attribute any

689
00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:21.679
metaphysical reality to numbers and geometrical structures. And all

690
00:37:21.689 --> 00:37:24.560
of that, I mean, II, I have to admit

691
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.479
that there are parts of it that if, if,

692
00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:32.260
for example, if it's true that reality itself is

693
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:37.000
just uh some geometric structure or something like that.

694
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.449
Uh ME as a human, I can't understand what

695
00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.639
that really means. I might, I mean, I might

696
00:37:43.649 --> 00:37:47.719
understand the mathematics itself. I might be able to

697
00:37:47.729 --> 00:37:52.820
visualize to some extent the geometric structure, but I,

698
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.689
I don't know.

699
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:54.469
Right.

700
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.919
With the real implications.

701
00:37:56.929 --> 00:38:00.399
That's right. Right. Right. Right. One of the more

702
00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:02.449
radical views I've come across is the view that

703
00:38:02.459 --> 00:38:06.870
reality itself just is a mathematical object. And I,

704
00:38:06.879 --> 00:38:09.909
I share your bafflement at that, but it's fascinating.

705
00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:11.429
I mean, this is a great thing about philosophy,

706
00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:14.310
you get to explore these completely wacky ideas and

707
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.669
as long as you do so rigorously, yeah. And

708
00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:19.870
I just like one follow up to that your,

709
00:38:19.879 --> 00:38:22.500
your point about just numbers in general, like, like,

710
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:26.149
or, or mathematical objects, maybe they're not part of

711
00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:28.919
reality in some sense that you can kind of

712
00:38:28.929 --> 00:38:31.649
zoom out and notice that this divide between metaphysics

713
00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:34.340
and epistemology. Can you, you, you could have different

714
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.949
views about where it comes up. So I, I

715
00:38:36.959 --> 00:38:40.510
might think that mathematics is entirely kind of, you

716
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.459
know, epistemology if you like no, that like there,

717
00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:46.870
as far as the metaphysics of mathematical objects are

718
00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:48.739
concerned, maybe I, I might think there's nothing to

719
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.270
say they're not, they're not real but uh like,

720
00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:54.699
maybe they are useful fiction or, I mean, I'll

721
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.939
have to tell some story about what we're doing

722
00:38:56.949 --> 00:38:59.250
when we do mathematics. But even if I'm a

723
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.620
platonist about like numbers, suppose, I think numbers really

724
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:06.250
exist independently of us and have their mathematical properties

725
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.870
independently of us. I still might be as, or

726
00:39:09.879 --> 00:39:13.030
an epistemology about the distinction between axioms and theorems,

727
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.870
considering the numbers, right? That distinction, just because I'm

728
00:39:16.879 --> 00:39:19.439
a realist about one part of mathematics doesn't mean

729
00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:22.120
I'm a realist about everything, every part of mathematical

730
00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:25.409
practice. Um, AND same so too, you know, with

731
00:39:25.419 --> 00:39:27.830
causation and laws of nature and things like that,

732
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.260
I think.

733
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.320
Mhm. But uh by the way, since you mentioned

734
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:36.290
laws of nature, um what, what is the law

735
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.510
of nature? Exactly? Because I guess that should be

736
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.469
a very controversial uh thing, right? I, I mean,

737
00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:48.050
of course, for example, in science, if we're talking

738
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:52.040
about physics, OK, I guess there's no big deal

739
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:56.530
in using uh a word like law there. But

740
00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.000
if we get into something like, I mean, if

741
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.879
we look at it as different levels of analysis,

742
00:40:02.889 --> 00:40:04.889
of course, we can have a different view of

743
00:40:04.899 --> 00:40:07.570
it. But if we go with that and we

744
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.790
go even one step above physics, then using something

745
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.090
like law or law of nature already gets very,

746
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.489
very controversial. So what does that mean exactly in

747
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.489
this context of trying to figure out what the

748
00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:30.810
compositional structure of reality is and also associated with

749
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.010
the philosophy of causation?

750
00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:38.590
Right? Great question. Um I mean, my, my own

751
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.870
view is that the concept of love of nature

752
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.810
has, has a few roles to play. But, but

753
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.620
that we should start by distinguishing like fundamental laws

754
00:40:47.629 --> 00:40:49.570
of nature and other things that we might loosely

755
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.600
call laws of nature and that fundamental laws of

756
00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.409
nature are whatever it is um about reality or

757
00:40:56.419 --> 00:41:01.199
perhaps about our conception of reality that draws it

758
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:04.250
a, a basic distinction between what can happen and

759
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:08.350
what can't um where the can and can't have

760
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.649
to be understood in an appropriately kind of physical

761
00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:15.850
sense. No. Um uh Sometimes philosophers talk about what's

762
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.729
metaphysically possible. No. And, and they know the imagination

763
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:22.959
runs wild, but when we're talking about what's physically

764
00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:27.120
possible, we can strain ourselves. Um And, and I

765
00:41:27.129 --> 00:41:29.770
think that that so understood that the notion is

766
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.070
tied to things in our ordinary experience. Now, if

767
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.689
I have like here's my phone, for example, if

768
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:37.090
I let it go, you know, it's gonna fall

769
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.020
onto my lap. Um And it's not just that

770
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.800
it's going to, but in some sense, it has

771
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.300
to given that there's nothing supported, supporting it, you

772
00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.040
know, other kinds of behavior would be impossible. So

773
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.340
we recognize this distinction in a kind of in

774
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.219
coate way just all the time in our ordinary

775
00:41:53.229 --> 00:41:55.590
life when we think, you know, there, there are

776
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.840
things that could happen and things that couldn't. Um

777
00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:03.080
And fundamentally in, in the, it, maybe I should

778
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.199
be careful about over using the word fundamentally. But

779
00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:07.459
at bottom, I think we want a notion of

780
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:09.870
law of nature to draw that kind of distinction.

781
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:14.139
Um And then the um the, the like astonishing

782
00:42:14.149 --> 00:42:18.129
ambition of modern physics is to articulate the structure

783
00:42:18.139 --> 00:42:21.550
of what's possible in this incredibly mathematically elegant fashion.

784
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.449
No. And uh that physicists like um like uh

785
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.699
draw attention to when they talk about things like

786
00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:31.179
Newton's laws which uh they didn't quite work or

787
00:42:31.189 --> 00:42:35.580
Maxwell's equations or the shorting and so on. Um

788
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.610
But I think, I think that there's a way

789
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.020
of, of there's another way in and here I'm

790
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.810
again, inspired by the work of Jim Woodward. Uh

791
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.780
TO think that there, there are claims about the

792
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.090
world that don't have that status, but that are

793
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.090
still really important to, to us. Jim calls them

794
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.750
highly invariant generalizations. So, so there might be some

795
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.340
generalization that's true about the world and would have

796
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.449
remained true under a wide range of different circumstances.

797
00:43:06.129 --> 00:43:09.360
Um So chemistry is chock full of things like

798
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.729
this like, you know, um there's a generalization that

799
00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:15.750
if you take a hydrocarbon and, and mix it

800
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.110
with oxygen and add enough energy, you'll get combustion,

801
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.560
you know. Um BUT that's not a law of

802
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.280
nature in the physicist sense there, they're interfering conditions

803
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:30.179
that could make it not happen. It's, it's sort

804
00:43:30.189 --> 00:43:33.699
of probabilistic, it's not absolutely guaranteed to happen, you

805
00:43:33.709 --> 00:43:36.209
know, like you could have just a weird way

806
00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:39.149
in which the hydrocarbons and oxygen are configured relative

807
00:43:39.159 --> 00:43:40.810
to each other where they just happen, not to

808
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.489
be able to react. Um But it's still, it's

809
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.830
a fairly robust generalization um invariant under a wide

810
00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.290
range of circumstances. And there's a way you could

811
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.770
think of what the physicists are after as the

812
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.000
most invariant generalizations. No, the maximally invariant ones, the

813
00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:59.169
ones where you don't have to worry about anything

814
00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:02.870
interfering because the law itself is so comprehensive that

815
00:44:02.879 --> 00:44:06.350
it covers anything that could qualify as an interference.

816
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.760
Um So I, I tend to think like in,

817
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.750
in the history of philosophy, science, I think there,

818
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.409
there was an overemphasis on laws of nature as

819
00:44:14.879 --> 00:44:19.419
as um kind of showing up in the same

820
00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:22.780
way across different disciplines. You saw this in Carl

821
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:27.469
Hempel um deductive nomology kind of explanation where the

822
00:44:27.479 --> 00:44:30.560
notion of law of nature was central there. But

823
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.770
he didn't really distinguish between the laws as they

824
00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.620
show up in fundamental physics and quote unquote laws

825
00:44:36.629 --> 00:44:40.100
where I would think with Woodward Ie highly invariant,

826
00:44:40.189 --> 00:44:43.489
you know, generalizations that show up in, in other

827
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:49.419
um disciplines. Um But if, if we um again,

828
00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:51.199
if we go back and, and ask like, well,

829
00:44:51.209 --> 00:44:55.060
what's the core distinction we're after? I think it's

830
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.520
really the distinction between what in a physical sense

831
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.979
can happen and what can't happen. And then other

832
00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:02.530
distinctions like among things that can happen, there may

833
00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.020
also be distinction between how likely they are in

834
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.879
an objective sense. This is where we start getting

835
00:45:06.889 --> 00:45:08.649
into probabilistic laws,

836
00:45:10.219 --> 00:45:13.360
right? So, uh I, I think that perhaps we

837
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:17.179
have time just for one more question. So let

838
00:45:17.189 --> 00:45:19.639
me ask you this, then that is something we

839
00:45:19.649 --> 00:45:22.959
haven't got into yet. At least not very much.

840
00:45:22.969 --> 00:45:28.699
So, is the causal structure of a process intrinsic

841
00:45:28.709 --> 00:45:28.939
to it?

842
00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:34.110
Oh Right. Yeah. So I used to think that

843
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.139
the answer is yes, that, that was a defining

844
00:45:36.149 --> 00:45:38.510
feature of what we meant by a causal process.

845
00:45:39.409 --> 00:45:44.419
Um And now I think um partly from thinking

846
00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:50.419
seriously about processes in the social world that um

847
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.169
that the answer is, is no, not in general.

848
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:59.520
Um So, so why should we give a no

849
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.909
answer? Well, let me think if I can. So

850
00:46:01.919 --> 00:46:05.689
suppose we're suppose the process we're considering is a

851
00:46:05.699 --> 00:46:10.899
financial transaction. So an exchange of money for goods

852
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:13.560
or services and, and we think it's a causal

853
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.979
structure, like it's not just that Susie handed over

854
00:46:16.989 --> 00:46:19.909
some paper and then, you know, like took a

855
00:46:19.919 --> 00:46:22.340
cup of coffee, like one led to the other,

856
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.540
like there's a genuine process there. Um Now you

857
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:28.000
could analyze that process at the level of physics,

858
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.669
like there's just like two co some complicated physical

859
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:36.129
system, Susie, the barista, the machinery, you know, that

860
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:38.120
generates the coffee and they're all sort of interacting

861
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:40.820
in a way that begins with her, making certain

862
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.340
motions and ends with her like making certain motions.

863
00:46:44.909 --> 00:46:47.280
But, but you can also describe that process in

864
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:51.560
a more illuminating way as an economic transaction. And,

865
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.929
and I don't think that's kind of incidental, I

866
00:46:53.939 --> 00:46:57.629
think like we are, you know, describing it correctly

867
00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:01.760
when we say like she, you know, uh paying

868
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:06.399
the, the uh barista caused the barista to give

869
00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:10.110
her some coffee. OK. Um But now if we

870
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.040
just ask, step back and ask like, well, what,

871
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:16.449
what makes something count as paying? No, it has

872
00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:18.260
to be a transfer of money. What makes something

873
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.229
count as money? Well, it's not what's intrinsic there.

874
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.030
No, like in fact, what makes something count as

875
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.629
money is complicated? It has something to do with

876
00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:30.820
a whole network of common expectations about how certain,

877
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.120
you know, bits of paper or coin or, or

878
00:47:34.129 --> 00:47:37.979
you know, data in a in a bank somewhere

879
00:47:37.989 --> 00:47:40.370
is to be used. Um But at any rate,

880
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:45.159
what what makes that causal process can't like count

881
00:47:45.169 --> 00:47:47.959
as a financial transaction is not intrinsic to it.

882
00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:51.179
And yet I think it's being a financial transaction

883
00:47:51.189 --> 00:47:53.449
is part of it's like, like that's essential to

884
00:47:53.459 --> 00:47:59.169
its causal structure. Um So, so really simple thought,

885
00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:01.250
which is like if I have a causal process

886
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:05.810
and I simply duplicate it perfectly intrinsically somewhere else,

887
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.040
then it'll still be the an instance of the

888
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.110
same causal process that that can't be right? I

889
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.780
don't think. Um BUT that said, I think it

890
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.409
is part of the way we think about causal

891
00:48:16.429 --> 00:48:20.929
processes that, that over a wide range of circumstances,

892
00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:24.899
duplicates of them will share their causal characteristics. So

893
00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:28.840
in a normal economy another transaction that looked like

894
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.419
a bit of behavior that looked just like that

895
00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:33.050
between Susie and the barista would still count as

896
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.129
a financial transaction even though if we like plucked

897
00:48:36.139 --> 00:48:38.270
it out and I don't know, had, had a

898
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.060
perfect duplicate of this process happening out in space,

899
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:43.260
you know, with nothing around, it wouldn't be a

900
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.760
financial transaction there. It would be like two very

901
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:50.260
perplexed short lived beings, you know, doing some motions,

902
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.979
you know, um that's OK. As long as like

903
00:48:53.989 --> 00:48:57.189
in a relevant set of circumstances, duplicating the process

904
00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:00.189
duplicates its causal structure too. And that I think

905
00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:03.909
is the crucial um idea I and if we

906
00:49:03.919 --> 00:49:05.820
go back to the idea that thinking about the

907
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.399
world in causal terms is highly functional for us,

908
00:49:08.459 --> 00:49:10.409
well, it kind of makes sense that we'd want

909
00:49:10.419 --> 00:49:15.159
a way of thinking about processes causally structured processes

910
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:18.330
that allows us to acquaint ourselves with them in

911
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.489
some circumstances and having so acquainted ourselves with them,

912
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.810
then port those processes that kind of process like

913
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.979
over into other circumstances and still think about it

914
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:31.320
in the same causal way. And that doesn't require

915
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.979
something as strong as like a bold like intrinsic,

916
00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:36.699
this thesis which I is what I used to

917
00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:39.629
think, but it it requires a kind of softer,

918
00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:41.310
you know, variant on that I think.

919
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.500
Mhm

920
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.179
And I think the structure is almost intrinsic. Yeah.

921
00:49:46.929 --> 00:49:48.989
And, and I guess that and this is not

922
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.620
a comment on the, exactly the question I asked

923
00:49:52.629 --> 00:49:56.540
before. But uh the example you gave of the

924
00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.020
financial transaction, buying a cup of coffee, for example,

925
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.600
I guess that uh it's a very good illustrative

926
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.050
example of uh uh the idea that in this

927
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:12.520
particular case, understanding what causes, for example, that particular

928
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.659
behavior in that context. I mean, o of course,

929
00:50:16.669 --> 00:50:19.360
perhaps it would be a way, I don't know

930
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:24.149
how to describe it just in purely physical terms,

931
00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:27.169
but I it uh I mean, at least from

932
00:50:27.179 --> 00:50:30.320
the point of view of a human and I

933
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.489
mean, that's the point of view we have to

934
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:38.570
work with uh not adding the psychological and the

935
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:44.050
cultural context to it is not uh as informative.

936
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.159
Uh I, I mean, we need to have that

937
00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:50.399
context for it to be more informative than just

938
00:50:50.409 --> 00:50:53.610
trying to describe things in terms of, I don't

939
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.110
know, anthems or molecules or something like that,

940
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.600
right? That seems right to me and, and, and

941
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.010
you could generalize that and say there, there's obviously

942
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.689
some deep value for us as humans to having

943
00:51:06.889 --> 00:51:10.399
multiple ways to describe different, you know what? Well,

944
00:51:10.409 --> 00:51:11.770
I should say one in the same part of

945
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.780
reality we're looking at now. Um And, and here,

946
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.739
there's controversy here, like as, as you know, like

947
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.989
you could get yourself into a frame of mind

948
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
where you think like, well, the only thing that's

949
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.000
real is physics and everything else is a kind

950
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:31.020
of, you know, projection of human epistemic interests onto

951
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.580
the world.

952
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.340
Yeah. Or, or the only thing that's really geometric

953
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:36.060
structure.

954
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:41.500
Yes. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even better. Um,

955
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.610
um, AND I, I think it's hard to sort

956
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.760
out, you know, whether that could be right. I

957
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.870
mean, one thing that's puzzling about that if, is,

958
00:51:47.879 --> 00:51:51.409
if you, if you, if you remove too much

959
00:51:51.419 --> 00:51:54.429
from your conception of reality, do you still have

960
00:51:54.489 --> 00:51:57.090
the human element that's supposed to explain why you

961
00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.500
were misled into thinking that, that the other stuff

962
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.729
was there in the first place? No. Um Like

963
00:52:02.739 --> 00:52:04.840
if like if I really strictly say the only

964
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.770
thing that's real is what physics talks about, well,

965
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:11.010
physics doesn't talk about humans and their epistemological and

966
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.479
practical needs. So those aren't real. So what kind

967
00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:16.439
of explanation is it to say? Like we only

968
00:52:16.449 --> 00:52:18.679
think that chemistry is real because of our human

969
00:52:18.699 --> 00:52:21.729
practical and epistemic needs or, or sociology or what

970
00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:26.179
or whatever? Um Yeah, II, I tend to like,

971
00:52:26.189 --> 00:52:29.360
start feeling vertigo when I encounter questions like that

972
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:30.879
and think like, well, let's go back and just

973
00:52:30.889 --> 00:52:34.520
like, like slow down and probe like again, what

974
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.610
does it do for us to have multiple levels

975
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.989
at which we can describe or multiple time and

976
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.179
length scales at which we can describe a phenomenon,

977
00:52:41.189 --> 00:52:44.020
there's some kind of illumination or insight we get.

978
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.110
And I, and I should say this is maybe

979
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:51.010
AAA good places to um no for the conversation

980
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.340
to lead. No. Um BEHIND all this interesting causation

981
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:58.290
and laws of nature and related concepts, I think

982
00:52:58.449 --> 00:53:03.399
is an interesting explanation. No, that is the kind

983
00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:05.209
of thing we're after when we say we don't

984
00:53:05.219 --> 00:53:08.610
merely want a catalog of facts about the world,

985
00:53:08.729 --> 00:53:12.010
but we want insight and understanding and, and we

986
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.439
think learning about what causes, what gives us that

987
00:53:14.449 --> 00:53:16.409
we think, learning about laws of nature gives us

988
00:53:16.419 --> 00:53:18.760
that. But it, it in a way if we

989
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:22.939
want to like really probe the question, why is

990
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:25.090
it good for us humans to think of the

991
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.820
world in causal terms? A prior question might be,

992
00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:30.149
why is it good for us to, to ask

993
00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:32.949
not only like what, where when questions but why

994
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:33.629
questions?

995
00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:39.000
Yeah. OK, great. So look, I'm getting mindful of

996
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.530
your time. So perhaps that's a good point to

997
00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.870
wrap up the interview on. So uh just before

998
00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:48.610
we go, would you like to tell people where

999
00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.669
they can find you and your work on the

1000
00:53:50.679 --> 00:53:51.189
internet?

1001
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.639
Oh Phil papers.org is probably the best place because

1002
00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:59.199
my website is like out of date. Um THOUGH

1003
00:53:59.209 --> 00:54:01.699
though one of my projects, once I get myself

1004
00:54:01.709 --> 00:54:05.379
organized is is to, to change that. Yeah, the

1005
00:54:05.389 --> 00:54:08.510
film papers.org is like the ideal location.

1006
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.689
OK, great. I'm leaving a link to it in

1007
00:54:11.699 --> 00:54:15.129
