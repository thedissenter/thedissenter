00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.230
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.190
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:09.470
today I'm joined by Doctor Sergio Al Meja. He

4
00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:13.130
is senior research scientist in Biological Anthropology at the

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.889
American Museum of Natural History. And today we're focusing

6
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:24.139
on, he's edited book, Humans Perspectives on our, on

7
00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.590
our evolution from world experts. So, Doctor Almera, welcome

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.639
to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.450
Thank you Ricardo for having me here.

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.419
So you brought together this very interesting book uh

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.979
about basically the opinions of several different people, experts,

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.900
mostly anthropologists, but also people from other fields as

13
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.680
we're going to talk about uh to hear more

14
00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.819
about their perspectives on certain big questions in human

15
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.290
evolution. So, uh but tell us a little bit

16
00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.189
more uh about the history behind it. I mean,

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.069
what is this book really about? Why did you

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.410
decide to write it? What motivated you basically,

19
00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:16.019
um I think with a constellation of different things,

20
00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:20.010
not just one, but I guess one of the

21
00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:23.889
first things that kind of like um got me

22
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.970
thinking about this making a was just making a

23
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.389
book, not this book, just I was at the

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.550
time, a professor in a, in a university in

25
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.300
Washington and, and, uh, and I was teaching among

26
00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:40.599
other courses, private evolution, human evolution. And, you know,

27
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.639
like, it's really hard to have like a one

28
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.260
book where you can have everything. Right. And, and

29
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.879
they are like few books. They are very good

30
00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.400
books, but always back me that every author has,

31
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.339
of course, their own, like, views on how everything

32
00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.959
happened, right? And I didn't wanna kind of just

33
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.569
give one sided view of, of the sta the

34
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.309
state of the art in, in a, in a

35
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.720
field of any field of evolution in general. But

36
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.149
human evolution particularly is so much, you have so

37
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.500
much personal investment on it, right? That every two

38
00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.639
weeks with some news, uh this fossil changes everything

39
00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.679
and so on. So I really was like, struggling

40
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.990
to like have one source, so like to use

41
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.850
as the main material for my courses for my

42
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.669
teaching. So basically, I kind of like, didn't follow

43
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.630
any book and was just trying to like, provide

44
00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.830
everything that was in the primary, primary literature, right?

45
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.410
Um But it was kind of too much, you

46
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.050
know, for like Jessica Intro to course human evolution.

47
00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.270
So I always teach, I was just, I kept

48
00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.020
thinking I should come up with some sort of

49
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.289
book that I can have everything there in an

50
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.479
interesting way. And I was going to write my

51
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.679
own book about it. But then kind of like

52
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.070
the idea just crossed my mind, like, why I'm

53
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.729
just like, would be so cool to have a

54
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.240
place where it's just like a, so sort of

55
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.160
like encyclopedia where you can look for every different

56
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.529
people that are very well known in the field.

57
00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:08.320
From different aspects, from fossils, to geology, to morphology,

58
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.139
to behavior and kind of like, just introduce them.

59
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.100
So people know who, who they are, what they

60
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.699
work on and then just ask them the same

61
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.440
questions, you know, that that and just that let

62
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.059
them speak by themselves. So that on the one

63
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.880
hand, they would provide like a very wide perspective

64
00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.279
of all things like what the ideas are about

65
00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.330
human evolution. On the other hand, it would highlight

66
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.199
the problem that I was having that. It's not

67
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.110
one story, human evolution. I know that the problem

68
00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.710
or not, but clearly, it's like everyone has a

69
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.800
different story. And that, to me, it was important

70
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.470
to remark that. So that's how the idea emerged.

71
00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.740
And then kind of like I started contacting some

72
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.449
of my close colleagues about it and, you know,

73
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.699
like over like I was in the field and

74
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.229
I was like, coming up with ideas and they

75
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.559
had to, what questions should I ask them and

76
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.009
why? And, and I had like a little experiment

77
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.690
test test group, you know, and, and, and usually

78
00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.190
the most of them were like very senior people

79
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.350
in the field because they are like kind of

80
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.149
my, my personal heroes and sheers, you know, so,

81
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.779
and because I had, uh I was in a

82
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.829
good position basically to make this something like this

83
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.790
happen because I met most of the people in

84
00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:21.358
the book, not everyone, but most of them. I

85
00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:24.000
actually have known them for years. I have even

86
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.609
worked with some of them. So I was thinking

87
00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.049
I could, something like that could, could happen and

88
00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:31.450
I probably can't make it happen. So I just

89
00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:34.559
kind of went ahead with it, you know, it

90
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.880
was kinda an experiment, it was an experiment that

91
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.899
I didn't know what was gonna happen. And in

92
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.880
that being a very interesting book, but, you know,

93
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.510
could have never happened to,

94
00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.730
by the way, some of them have already have

95
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:50.350
on the show also. So with that, uh some

96
00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:54.260
of the people you've uh basically interviewed for the

97
00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.899
book, I've also read on the show as guests.

98
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:57.500
So

99
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.489
I know, I know, I know, I know because

100
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.130
they are very interesting people and they are worth

101
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.660
knowing and, and listening to.

102
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.700
Yeah. And by the way you mentioned there that

103
00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.269
you basically ask the same set of questions to

104
00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.700
all of the people you interviewed for the book.

105
00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:19.290
How did you arrive at that set of questions

106
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:22.579
and why do you think they are so illuminating?

107
00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.679
So I um I mean, they could have been

108
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.720
of course other questions and actually some of them

109
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.420
after the fact have suggested to me like, oh,

110
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:34.040
it would have been so nice that you have

111
00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:35.959
asked these other questions as well, you know. And,

112
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.570
but it was just like, well, this is what

113
00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:40.510
we have now. And basically these questions were set

114
00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:43.279
up to be some sort of um blank canvas

115
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.239
for them to talk about what they wanted to

116
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.670
talk to. And even though I sent to everyone,

117
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.589
the same set of 10 questions, I didn't ask

118
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.950
them to answer all of them. I asked because

119
00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:55.359
they are kind of, they are like some are

120
00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.019
more like personal about their origins and background. Others

121
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.869
are more about the meat of what they work

122
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.890
on and what they think is interesting. And then,

123
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.579
then it's a set of them that is more

124
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.760
a kind of philosophical question. So different people, I,

125
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.290
I told them like, you don't have to answer

126
00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:12.130
them all, just answer the ones that you feel

127
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.679
like you want to answer and you can use

128
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.720
your own words and your own length. You know,

129
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.690
there are some people who answer with one word,

130
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.750
people who answer with a one sentence, people who

131
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.100
answer it with a one page. And actually many

132
00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:27.510
people in, in the book have told me that

133
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.410
they were surprised to read the answers of the

134
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.079
others because they, they know them and they clearly

135
00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.049
like you can kind of like the personality of

136
00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:38.859
every person is kind of reflected in the way

137
00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.730
they answer because it's just the style, the, how

138
00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:44.929
much they talk, you know, and I didn't edit

139
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.000
any of that and we just, like, I promised

140
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.299
them, we would only edit for like style, you

141
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.549
know, but not change anything else. So because we

142
00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.399
wanted this book to kind of reflect everyone's ideas

143
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.790
and personality, it's like it feels like you kind

144
00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:02.209
of know a little bit the person in person,

145
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.600
even though you might not good. You uh So

146
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.399
I know that answer your question or you want

147
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.239
something more specific about the each of the questions.

148
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.140
Uh

149
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.369
Yeah. Uh I mean, uh yeah, perhaps we, we

150
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.510
can get into a few of them. So what

151
00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:22.019
perhaps are some of the questions that you would

152
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.459
highlight there?

153
00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:32.820
Um um I mean, I don't, they're all these

154
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:34.429
10 were like kind of a selection already of

155
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.279
many, right? But let me just, maybe I can

156
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.239
just do a very short summary of each of

157
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.839
them. And so I can explain a little more,

158
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.269
but basically it was 10 questions plus a bonus

159
00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:46.950
question. And the third, the three first questions were

160
00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.350
kind of more like, um I breaker, it's a

161
00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:52.750
way to produce so they can talk about themselves,

162
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.179
their background. And you know, the first question, for

163
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.239
example is about, they can talk about their beginnings

164
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.000
and they can describe the moment in their lives

165
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.160
and what they kind of think started for them

166
00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:06.239
in their career and what they work on. And

167
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.429
the second question is, is, is called game changer.

168
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.029
It's basically if there is any particular study or

169
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.769
book or discovery that it changed everything for them,

170
00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:16.890
the way they think, the way they look at

171
00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:20.140
what they do. And that, that's a very, that

172
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:24.089
was a, an interesting outcome on that uh compilation

173
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.559
of answer to that question is that there is

174
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.100
now a section at the end of the book,

175
00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:30.279
which is recommended readings, which basically is just a

176
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.900
compilation of the papers and books that the experts

177
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.599
like responded that. So like they thought they were

178
00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:41.030
game changing, studying her work and many of them

179
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.669
are the same, they gave the same and many

180
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.880
of them I pointed to same study, same, same

181
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.270
books. So I thought we thought it was worthwhile

182
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.210
to have just those, all them compiled at the

183
00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:50.739
other the book. It like it is a good

184
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.340
resource. The third question was something just it was

185
00:08:55.349 --> 00:08:58.049
about uh if they think it's something amazing, something

186
00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:01.090
amazing about human evolution, something that blows their mind.

187
00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:03.169
I was just also part of the click in

188
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:05.510
their eyes about if there is something that really

189
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.109
strikes them, you know, and you will have answers

190
00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:11.640
from like it amazes me that humans have got

191
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.739
in so far, you know, because we're so stupid

192
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.710
or other people would answer like, you know, like

193
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.179
they're amazed about particular aspects of like human evolution,

194
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.200
you know, as compared to other animals. So it,

195
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.260
it goes all over depending on the personality of

196
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.020
the, of the, of the, the expert in that

197
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.940
case. No. And then what I, what I call

198
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.989
the, the cool questions, the, the they, they are

199
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.909
designed to get more to the meat of like

200
00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:40.270
what they work on what they think is interesting

201
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.159
in a but in a kind of in a

202
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:45.789
interesting fun uh engaging way, right? So for my

203
00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:48.530
favorite question in that section is the time travel

204
00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:51.179
question, which basically I asked them, like, if you

205
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.919
had like a one shot round trip in a

206
00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:58.159
time machine to which specific time and place would

207
00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:01.809
you go past or future? And why? You know,

208
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.750
and that's basically a question. It's just a way,

209
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.450
it's an interesting way to ask them. Like, why

210
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.150
do you, like if someone is working about studying

211
00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:13.090
how lustrous aeris was walking, they probably would. The

212
00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:15.289
answer usually is, oh, I would travel 2 million

213
00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:18.599
years ago to Ethiopia to this particular site in

214
00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:21.400
Haar and, and like have some sort of kinematic

215
00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:24.419
like portable lab to study like the gate of

216
00:10:24.429 --> 00:10:26.659
this species to, to test if what I've been

217
00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:29.640
like, thinking for the last 20 years is, is

218
00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:32.200
real or not, you know, but that's like an

219
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.729
entry way to like the study of kinematics in,

220
00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:38.080
in living in the study of motion, in living

221
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.770
species. How can we infer the motion of the

222
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.969
species. Why is that important and so on? Right.

223
00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:46.890
Another question in that section of the core question

224
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.330
is driving factors, which basically it was asking like,

225
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.640
what happened, what's the driving factors that made a

226
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.679
nape evolve into human at some point? Right. And

227
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.900
um and this is just like the, it's a,

228
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.590
it's a different way to ask like, why are

229
00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:04.219
they humans? You know, why are we here? You

230
00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:08.200
know, what happened originally speaking? And you know, it

231
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.609
was interesting because there were answered all over the

232
00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:12.500
place, you know, from like it is impossible to

233
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.200
know from the typical answer because we would come

234
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.059
by it and we can vipe it because the

235
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.909
the environment changed, it was more open, you know,

236
00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:22.190
it's all you can see all the views about,

237
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.979
about what we different people think like jumpstart the

238
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.210
human. And it's clear from the answers that this

239
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.590
is the one answer. The next question in this

240
00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:35.049
section was like future evolution, you know, just like

241
00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:38.590
basically, what do you think will be shaping human

242
00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:40.690
or in the future and from time to the

243
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.070
future? And it's just a way to ask like,

244
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.659
are humans still evolving? And so how are they

245
00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:48.219
evolving? What do you think are the next steps

246
00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:50.469
in our revolution? And you have, you have all

247
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:52.119
over, you know that some people think that, you

248
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.840
know, like we're gonna be extinct soon or people

249
00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:56.099
think that there is no way to know too

250
00:11:56.109 --> 00:11:59.349
much contingency or people provide very specific answers about

251
00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:01.599
how exactly we're gonna look a million years from

252
00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:07.309
now. Very interesting. Um The next question here was

253
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.109
evolutionary lessons which basically was asked, this was very

254
00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:13.080
important for me because I was just after 20

255
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.349
plus years working in this field. I, you know,

256
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.200
I find it very interesting, but I always wonder,

257
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.250
is this actually precise, interesting? Is it useful? And

258
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.460
we learned something that could be practical for our,

259
00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:25.809
for our daily life? And again, you have answered

260
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.099
from Moreover, like some people would answer, I don't

261
00:12:29.109 --> 00:12:31.109
think this is useful, but you know, like any

262
00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:35.380
like elementary science is very interesting and it's worth

263
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.510
studying just for the sake of studying it. Other

264
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.799
people actually say no, no, this is could have

265
00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:44.630
like uh very important implications for our daily life

266
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.700
to provide specific examples. I don't know if you

267
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.580
want to go into this now or later. But

268
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.979
like, you know, one example was like the one

269
00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:56.250
of the experts uh Professor in Japan was saying

270
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.700
that that um the accident after the tsunami in

271
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.099
the Fukushima power plant in 2011 could have been

272
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.010
much worse if they, if the people who built

273
00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:11.340
the power station have listened to the scientists who

274
00:13:11.349 --> 00:13:15.530
were like advising them to put the the like

275
00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:18.010
the power back up in higher grounds because it

276
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.969
was historically known based in Geo Geological studies that,

277
00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:24.869
that tsunamis have reached that region before. So, but

278
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.119
they didn't pay attention to that. So they put

279
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.010
them in lower ground and they, they were affected

280
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.520
as well. So it was horrible accident after the

281
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.280
other accident. And then the, the, the last questions

282
00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:36.849
that I asked was, were, were kind of in

283
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:41.789
the philosophical side and one was just arguments special,

284
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.250
you know, and again, you have all over it,

285
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.090
it was kind of like a way to trigger

286
00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:49.150
some reactions and I it did trigger some reactions

287
00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:51.190
because some people would be like, of course, we're

288
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.229
special, you know, we have language, we talk to

289
00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:55.049
each other, we make books like this, we ask

290
00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:58.210
weird questions about our evolution. Nothing else as this,

291
00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:01.130
of course, we're special. Other people would go to

292
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.030
the other extreme and be like every species by

293
00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:06.700
definition is special. That's the definition of a species.

294
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.020
Uh We just as special as being a human

295
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.190
as an elephant is special, human elephant, right? Um

296
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.799
And then is everything in between. Uh So it's

297
00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:20.340
very interesting because it really gathers like, oh how

298
00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:23.109
wide the perspectives are as many as people in

299
00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:25.239
the book are probably more, you know, and this

300
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.690
is just a selection. Next question was unleash and

301
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.419
spirituality. Like, basically, I was asking the experts if

302
00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:33.820
they think that they are compatible with having a,

303
00:14:34.049 --> 00:14:37.549
a scientific view of the world in study with

304
00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.150
the study of evolution or human evolution specifically. Are

305
00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:42.530
this view compatible or not? Again, you have all

306
00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:46.150
over, you know. So I actually, I thought that

307
00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:48.169
no one would answer. Many scientists would try to

308
00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.210
not answer this question. But I was really surprised

309
00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:52.890
that many actually did respond to this question and,

310
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.859
and it went from not compatible whatsoever to fully

311
00:14:57.869 --> 00:15:00.330
compatible. I don't see the problem because one addresses

312
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.890
the whole things happen. The other address is that

313
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.260
why things happen? One is about morality, the other

314
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.630
is about this. It's very interesting that you can

315
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.559
see a clear divide between researchers in the US

316
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.369
and in the US in this view. Um Then

317
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.369
the last question was kind of meant more for

318
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.090
people interested in the in the field of human

319
00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:21.409
evolution, whether they are specific students or young researchers

320
00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:24.630
or just people who are interested, like, what advice

321
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.630
would they give to people interested? They want to

322
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.469
know more about it. But I think it's gonna

323
00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:32.380
be a useful um resource for, for students specifically

324
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.169
because they provide advice that help them like go

325
00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:41.619
where they are today, you know. Um And you

326
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.780
know, like it's uh I think it's a could

327
00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.359
be a good resource. The answer to that question,

328
00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:48.530
I think I was not expecting a lot from

329
00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:51.549
that, but actually many people kind of focus on

330
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:54.169
giving a good advice to it. And then the

331
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:56.859
bonus question I asked was like, basically who would

332
00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:59.479
you ask these questions to living our life ie

333
00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:01.880
or that right? And it is very interesting as

334
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.219
well because people pointed from classic philosophers to like

335
00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:07.619
someone in the future who know all these answers

336
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.159
already, what they would think, you know, other people

337
00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:13.869
suggested other experts like today, that was a good

338
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.520
resource for me to actually then reach those invited,

339
00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:20.880
invited them to bring the book. So those are

340
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.080
the, those are the questions.

341
00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:26.010
Uh So you, you also divide the book into

342
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.500
several different parts. I mean, because people, if you

343
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.609
of course interview different experts and some of them

344
00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:37.989
are more focused on some particular periods in our

345
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.219
evolution and of course, uh others are from different

346
00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:46.039
areas, even some of are not anthropologists. But you

347
00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:50.989
start with the people who study the, the antecedents

348
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.950
of human evolution. II, I would like to ask

349
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.489
you here, what exactly are the antecedents of human

350
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.210
evolution? I mean, what kinds of experts are studying

351
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.659
this topic?

352
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:09.250
So basically, um those are people who are focusing

353
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.178
their efforts and deciding what happened before, before human

354
00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:17.288
evolution. So how do you find before human evolution?

355
00:17:17.298 --> 00:17:19.519
That's uh that's an interesting question on its own.

356
00:17:19.729 --> 00:17:22.838
But basically, it's, you know, before the lineage who

357
00:17:22.868 --> 00:17:26.938
basically was clearly evolving into us today even originated,

358
00:17:26.948 --> 00:17:29.718
you know, and that, so that's people who studied

359
00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:32.348
climate evolution in general or, or a evolution in

360
00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:35.369
general before, like human, the human lineage originated from

361
00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:40.060
people who just have um you know, study like

362
00:17:40.069 --> 00:17:43.689
older, like origins of mammals even, you know, because

363
00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:45.849
I think that it was a way to highlight

364
00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:48.969
that, that perspective is equally like, it's really hard

365
00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:53.989
to define a concrete like section of time that

366
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.209
is human evolution because there, I, I find it

367
00:17:57.219 --> 00:18:01.680
very limiting because many, many researchers who work in

368
00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:05.089
human evolution, they basically, there are some that only

369
00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:08.670
look at modern humans and maybe and compare them

370
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.119
with the chimpanzees because chimpanzees are our closest living

371
00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:14.300
today, right? And they, and they kind of like,

372
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.839
you know, that's, that's human evolution, like whatever is

373
00:18:16.849 --> 00:18:20.319
different from us and chimps, that's what's changed on

374
00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:23.750
our lineage, that's what's happened in human evolution, right?

375
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.130
And um I think it's very limiting because that's

376
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.089
basically assuming many things. One of them, the biggest

377
00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:35.000
assumption here is that chimpanzees have never evolved, right?

378
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.939
Like they are just some sort of a static

379
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:40.390
ancestor and it's like humans and humans and chimpanzees

380
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.400
have evolved from a common ancestor, they live around

381
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.530
60 million years ago, you know, but that ancestor

382
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.069
also like evolved from an ancestor shared with gorillas

383
00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:53.609
that live around 10 million years ago. And then

384
00:18:53.619 --> 00:18:56.180
we all share a primate ancestor, you know, at

385
00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:58.699
some point more than 60 million years ago. So,

386
00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:02.760
you know, like when do you decide what is,

387
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.910
you know, everything that happened before is essential for

388
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.380
what happened later? It's like a continuum, right? Like

389
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.229
you could argue that human evolution is just evolution.

390
00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:14.890
We're just one of the outcomes of a larger

391
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.410
process with millions of species over millions of years.

392
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.209
So like it's hard to. So I thought that

393
00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:23.979
just I would be interested to bring that into

394
00:19:23.989 --> 00:19:27.109
the, not just ask questions to experts that work

395
00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:30.369
in specifically human evolution and fossils that are clearly

396
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.069
are human, but people who are looking at the

397
00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:36.739
broader picture from things that happened before, you know,

398
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.430
or even other groups that are parallel to us

399
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.099
today just to like basically reach the bigger picture,

400
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.079
right? And, and this period in our revolution is

401
00:19:48.089 --> 00:19:54.959
very interesting because it brings together uh primatologists and

402
00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:58.410
paleoanthropologists. And I mean, uh how do you look

403
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:05.319
at the relationship specifically between primatology and paleoanthropology? Because

404
00:20:05.569 --> 00:20:08.859
uh as far as I understand it, um I,

405
00:20:08.869 --> 00:20:13.430
I've talked, for example, with primatologists who have a

406
00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:18.239
background in biology and then they specialized in the

407
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.380
study of primates. But there are, there are also

408
00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:29.119
anthropologists, specifically paleoanthropologists and sometimes biological anthropologists who themselves

409
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:35.520
study not only hominids but also other primates, particularly

410
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.469
usually the great ape. So how do you look

411
00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:42.140
at the relationship there between those two different kinds

412
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.400
of experts?

413
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.469
So for example, when people ask me, what do

414
00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:48.900
you study? II, I usually don't say I study

415
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.849
human evolution. I say I study ape and human

416
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:55.770
evolution. And that's kind of linking back to, to

417
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.989
what I just said that you know, like, like

418
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.089
we, our closest living relatives are the great apes

419
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:06.040
chimpanzees, the gorillas, the no guan and, and there

420
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.420
is just no way to understand. Like there is

421
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.979
anyone who studies any evolutionary biologist would not, let's

422
00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:17.369
study the evolution of, let's say in dinosaurs, they

423
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.609
don't look at one. I studied the evolution of

424
00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:22.469
T rex. They look at the evolution of the

425
00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:26.989
group that includes direct only by comparing you can

426
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.439
know what is the special or not special or

427
00:21:29.449 --> 00:21:33.189
common in the particular group of interest or species

428
00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:35.619
of interest, right? If you're interested in human evolution,

429
00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:39.150
it's impossible to understand what's especially in humans. If

430
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.239
we not compare with the other things that are

431
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.619
out there, especially the ones that are closer closely

432
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.969
related to us like the Great Tapes. So that's

433
00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:49.739
why it's kind of essential like in and and

434
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.170
in the case, like an anthropology and primatology, like

435
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.890
there is uh this assumption that oh we can

436
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.729
kind of look at living great depth, especially chimpanzees

437
00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:02.369
as some sort of, it's kind of looking at

438
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.880
our past, right? It's like they are similar to

439
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.219
our ancestors. So if a chimpanzee can use tools,

440
00:22:09.229 --> 00:22:11.670
probably our ancestor was using tools. If a chimpanzee

441
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.920
is this kind of a smart, they don't have

442
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.359
developed language, but they have like some, you know,

443
00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.599
some they could get in this other way. But

444
00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:21.709
so we can in that our ancestor was probably

445
00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:24.890
also doing that. So that's why they are linked

446
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.420
because it, without comparing, it's impossible to know. What

447
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.369
is this thing in human evolution when you find

448
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.890
a fossil that goes somewhere in the human lineage

449
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.160
and usually that's defined based on, oh, it was

450
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.349
working biped, it was working by purely because it

451
00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:41.849
has this morphology that is more human than chimpanzee.

452
00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:43.900
So you cannot know that if you don't compare

453
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.359
to know where the fossil falls in the, you

454
00:22:47.369 --> 00:22:50.030
know, it, it is this bone, the femur of

455
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.609
Lucy Astros is closer to a human or is

456
00:22:54.619 --> 00:22:56.739
it closer to a chimpanzee or is in between

457
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.369
or is in between but closer to one and

458
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.719
the other? It's impossible to know without comparison. So

459
00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:04.150
that's why comparisons are important and that they, they

460
00:23:04.239 --> 00:23:07.410
go together the different, I think it's for many

461
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.500
pa anthropologists um living primates, particularly great apes and

462
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.150
particular chimpanzees with the, with the great apes. That's

463
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.810
the end of the story. Like the great apes

464
00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:20.630
to them are, are interesting just as this comparative

465
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.219
thing, like something to compare their fossils with, to

466
00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:27.780
know like how primitive or modern their fossil is,

467
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.199
right? And that's, that's, that's fine. Like I think

468
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.099
I started like that back in the day. But

469
00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:36.369
like then it kind of grew i it, it

470
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.469
grew me the curiosity about understanding also the evolution

471
00:23:39.479 --> 00:23:42.030
of the apes because then I realized that, well,

472
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.560
there are also f apes out there and they

473
00:23:45.569 --> 00:23:47.819
don't look like the living apes. So that means

474
00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:50.439
that living great apes are also evolved from something

475
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.719
that something is probably closer to our ancestor than

476
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.969
any living today. So that's what I kind of

477
00:23:56.979 --> 00:23:59.550
like now. It's more, more and more people are.

478
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.790
Ok. It is essential to understand human evolution within

479
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.290
the broader perspective of primate evolution.

480
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.660
Mhm. So, I mean, there's not a strict division

481
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:17.000
between primatologists and paleoanthropologists, right?

482
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.550
And there is in the sense that some like

483
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.189
primatologist are usually most of the time, they don't

484
00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:25.660
look at fossils. Most of the time they look

485
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.140
at living primates, their biology, their behavior, their genetics

486
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.709
and so on. Anthropologists are more looking at the

487
00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:36.650
fossil record, archaeological record and then look at living

488
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.180
primates as kind of like their competitive like toolbox

489
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.869
to understand like contextualize what they are finding in

490
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.959
the fossil record. But there are some, there are

491
00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:51.420
some researchers which are kind of have a foot

492
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.319
in each of them. So there are like some

493
00:24:53.329 --> 00:24:55.699
that study puzzles and then they go to the

494
00:24:55.709 --> 00:24:59.130
field and study primates because they feel like they

495
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.719
are interesting on their own as a field of

496
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:04.109
study. But they, they, they help them better contextualize

497
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.969
what they find in the fossil record. There are

498
00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:08.910
many like that, but it's like it's a minority.

499
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.130
Usually this DNH everyone is so specialized that usually

500
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.810
like anthropologists look at fossils, primatologist, look at living

501
00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:18.589
primates, but there are some, there are some colleagues,

502
00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:19.910
for example, in the book that it was hard

503
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.520
to put them in one section or another of

504
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.300
the book because they kind of do everything, you

505
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.770
know, they, they do archaeology and then they look

506
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.859
for fossils and then they also go and study

507
00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:32.130
chimpanzee behaviors. It's just hard, you know, it was,

508
00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:35.119
it was a kind of like um the edit,

509
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.979
the I was the editor of the book, but

510
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:38.530
it was like the editor and the, and the

511
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.209
publishing company in Colombia in the present in this

512
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:44.109
case. And they thought that it, it will be

513
00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:46.910
easier to subdivide the booking section. So we need

514
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.609
to come up with a way to separate the

515
00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:50.719
different experts in different areas. And we did the

516
00:25:50.729 --> 00:25:52.550
best that we could. But, you know, there are

517
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.150
some colleagues that kind of like could have been

518
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.099
in, in all the sections, almost.

519
00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:59.949
No, no, I've had the same experience on the

520
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:06.390
show interviewing uh some primatologists and some paleoanthropologists because

521
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.790
I have an anthropology and the primatology playlist on

522
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.935
my channel. And sometimes it's very hard to choose

523
00:26:14.944 --> 00:26:18.625
if I should put someone on the primatology or

524
00:26:18.635 --> 00:26:21.714
the anthropology playlist. And usually I end up putting

525
00:26:21.724 --> 00:26:22.964
them in both.

526
00:26:22.974 --> 00:26:25.214
So I think that I think that's the right,

527
00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:28.494
the right decision honestly because because they do both,

528
00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:31.175
they're interesting to both in the both context. They

529
00:26:31.185 --> 00:26:34.125
probably bring out a broader perspectives into each of

530
00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:35.005
them in immediately

531
00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:39.900
a and So another kind of experts that you

532
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.910
interview for the book are the ones that are

533
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.010
focused mostly on the early stages of what you

534
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.979
call the human career in the book. But this

535
00:26:48.989 --> 00:26:52.359
leads us to have one of the, I would

536
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:57.209
imagine biggest questions in anthropology. That is, when did

537
00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:01.829
we become human? Exactly. I mean, there are of

538
00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.550
course several different ways we could approach the question.

539
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.199
We could even tackle it through uh uh from

540
00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:11.609
a philosophical perspective. But since we're talking about anthropology

541
00:27:11.619 --> 00:27:16.729
here, what does it mean to be human in

542
00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:17.640
anthropology?

543
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.209
As you said, there's not a clear answer. Um

544
00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:26.420
I can give you like uh some perspectives on

545
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:32.199
it um for different people. So basically, um it's

546
00:27:32.209 --> 00:27:35.079
again like we humans, I think I would start

547
00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:37.680
with the philosophy here, which is we humans like

548
00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:40.020
to t everything, everything has to have a name,

549
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.770
everything, everything has to be in a category. But

550
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.829
the reality is that the real world doesn't have

551
00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:51.719
categories, everything is a continuum, right? And so people

552
00:27:51.729 --> 00:27:54.000
has been trying to understand what is human evolution?

553
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.650
When does human evolution start like? And so I

554
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.609
would start by saying like we are Homo sapiens.

555
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:03.640
Um Basically the genus Homo is by definition, the

556
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.209
human genus. So before there are other hominins, so

557
00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:09.890
they are in the human lineage, but they're closer

558
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.739
to us than to any living other species like

559
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.880
Apis para Anthropy or Rin or the pits heus,

560
00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:19.839
there are so many now but they are not

561
00:28:19.849 --> 00:28:23.339
within the genius homo genus, homo, homo sapiens, they

562
00:28:23.349 --> 00:28:25.630
are like fewer species. They are more and more.

563
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.589
Right, right at the reus gaster ole obeli oluo

564
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.469
senses. There's just so many species now that this

565
00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:37.319
is again, I think we're in a period of

566
00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:39.569
time in which everyone is finding a new fossil

567
00:28:39.579 --> 00:28:41.650
and making a new species of, of the genus

568
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.150
hormone within the genus hormone. And then 10 years

569
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.630
from now, someone is gonna revise the whole evidence

570
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.780
again and come out with only three species and

571
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.859
then it's gonna come out again. It's these are

572
00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:53.369
cycles that happen to happen. But by definition, the

573
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.699
human genus is homo. So everything that is inside

574
00:28:56.709 --> 00:28:59.930
the genus is homo, we basically start the oldest

575
00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:01.900
forces that we have of the genus homo are

576
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:07.130
like around 2.62 0.7 you know, maybe 2.8 you

577
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.859
know, man, 2.8 years from um Ethiopia. But that's

578
00:29:11.869 --> 00:29:13.650
all we know like most of what we know

579
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.180
of homo, it's a little 2.52 and later on.

580
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.489
And actually this first fs that are within the

581
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.500
genus Homo, which is basically homobiles and related forms

582
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.079
of homobiles is this, it's been a debate over

583
00:29:29.089 --> 00:29:31.729
like since the nineties, I'm still alive today in

584
00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:33.670
which like should we even put these in the

585
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.900
genus Homo? Because they really look so primitive that

586
00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.900
maybe they should be in the genus astra pts,

587
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.280
right? Like you said before and astro PTS are

588
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:47.640
known to have like uh basically general, they have

589
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.520
features in the skeleton that look more kind of

590
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.780
ape, like some feature are more humanlike homo, like

591
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.910
others are more like apelike, more like not exactly

592
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.250
like a chimpanzee, but some, some are more chimpanzee

593
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.160
like others are more like a gorilla. Others are

594
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.089
more like, you know, Utah, others are like other

595
00:30:03.099 --> 00:30:05.640
fossil fossil that we don't have anything alive today,

596
00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:10.500
you know, but clearly they, they were different starting

597
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.270
really starting at 2 million years when we have

598
00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.400
Homo actus. Uh AND ho actus is like e

599
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.359
even though that you can see still weird things

600
00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:22.170
like as compared to us, we will be weird

601
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.750
to them, but like to us, they are weird

602
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.369
in the face. Um They still have like thick

603
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.920
eyebrows and smaller like brain cases and like big

604
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.729
faces. But basically from the distance, you would think

605
00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:37.010
it's a human like me, he already has neck

606
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.540
down, it has a body like us. Like they

607
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.280
were like, like very like even bigger than us.

608
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.040
Some of them, some fossils are bigger than humans

609
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.250
alive today. Like very tall. They were probably like

610
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.319
walking by p like we walk, running, hunting, you

611
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:56.150
know, they're basically from the distance they are like

612
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.060
us. Um So some people would argue that that's

613
00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:01.280
the beginning of what it means to be a

614
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.209
human. But other people. So around 2 million years

615
00:31:04.219 --> 00:31:07.140
ago and also around that time is when we

616
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.160
have, before, we have already stone tools, like all

617
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.229
their stone tools are now like 3 million years

618
00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:14.739
old, but they are very like rudimentary, they're like

619
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:18.890
big rocks, you know, it's hard to but started

620
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.630
2 million years or something like that or slightly

621
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.369
later. Like with Homo actus, we start having this

622
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.660
like nice, like um like the hand access that

623
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.540
I have like nice symmetry to them. And, and

624
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:36.199
clearly like that, that technology shows that something else

625
00:31:36.209 --> 00:31:38.170
is happening up here, like, you know, and so

626
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.099
some people would argue that some kind of protolanguage,

627
00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:45.369
you know, like modern language, but like some language

628
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.270
was at play then because it's been their experiments

629
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.420
showing that when you're trying to, to teach someone

630
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.689
else to do something, it's just by looking at

631
00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:55.459
the other doing, it is not as, as much

632
00:31:55.469 --> 00:31:58.719
doesn't work as well as showing and explaining and

633
00:31:58.729 --> 00:32:00.439
you hold this like this and then you have

634
00:32:00.449 --> 00:32:01.969
to do it like that because if not, you're

635
00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:05.349
gonna, this is gonna happen. So there are indirect

636
00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:07.170
evidence, of course, we don't know they were talking,

637
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.310
but this indirect evidence that there was some sort

638
00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:11.829
of more advanced communication right around 2 million years

639
00:32:11.839 --> 00:32:13.979
ago. So is that the beginning of being a

640
00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:18.199
human, other people argue that not yet that it

641
00:32:18.209 --> 00:32:22.680
really was not until around 70,000, 50,000 years ago,

642
00:32:22.689 --> 00:32:24.699
so much, much later, not millions of years, not

643
00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:27.589
hundreds of thousands of years, just thousands of years.

644
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.979
Because around that time with 50,000 years ago, it's

645
00:32:30.989 --> 00:32:34.130
going, you start seeing everywhere, like starting to see

646
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:39.459
in different places, paintings, you know, personal ornaments, things

647
00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:43.319
that clearly had conceptual meaning, things that people can

648
00:32:43.329 --> 00:32:46.219
give to each other as presents. You know, there,

649
00:32:46.489 --> 00:32:49.479
there is symbol, symbolism is what people call this

650
00:32:49.609 --> 00:32:53.239
augmented reality is like this interior world that we

651
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.939
have today that is made out of concepts. And

652
00:32:56.949 --> 00:33:00.300
that basically shows that these like a very, very

653
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:05.199
well developed like full fledged modern human language and

654
00:33:05.209 --> 00:33:08.849
that really didn't start before 50,000 years ago. So

655
00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:12.589
again, things is like continuing, probably things happen like

656
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:16.540
gradually slowly, which is like things took over after

657
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.829
around 50,000 with the full fledged language and culture.

658
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.910
So, but we know that things that things fossils

659
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.109
of humans that, that basically look already like modern

660
00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:36.109
Homo sapiens were already around 200,000 years ago in

661
00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:40.530
Africa. So, and those are currently situated in the

662
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.939
Homo Sapiens group. And then they photo from Homo

663
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.439
Ballet in Ethiopia. They are Homo considered Homo sapiens

664
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:52.979
and they are 200,000 years old. So, but you

665
00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:55.290
know, but the modern behavior doesn't seem to appear

666
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.319
until later. So that's why people talk about anatomically

667
00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:03.859
modern humans versus modern human behavior. And then it's,

668
00:34:03.869 --> 00:34:06.550
it's hard to tell, it seems that one came

669
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.290
after the other, other, I have colleagues that work

670
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.110
in all their sites in Africa at 300,000 year

671
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.379
old sites. And they, they found traces of ochre,

672
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.149
you know that meaning that probably these, these humans

673
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.179
were like using it to paint themselves to like

674
00:34:20.188 --> 00:34:23.250
signal the others, you know, things like I belong

675
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.620
to this group, you belong to that group. So

676
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:28.449
language was clearly some there and the beginnings of

677
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:32.030
modern behaviors were there much earlier. But so when

678
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.610
this is kind of a philosophical question at this

679
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.810
point, when do you put the mark like this

680
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.819
is another human? I don't know, it depends. What

681
00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:42.849
do you, how do you consider, what do you

682
00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:44.748
consider to be among a human and based on

683
00:34:44.759 --> 00:34:46.589
anatomy based on behavior?

684
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:52.800
Right. And so earlier, I've asked you about primatology

685
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:58.020
and its relationship to anthropology, but you also interview

686
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.229
experts from other fields, like for example, medicine, psychology,

687
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.300
philosophy, uh how do you think these other disciplines

688
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.709
can contribute to an understanding of what humans are?

689
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.639
But I think it's precisely based on the the

690
00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:19.530
last answer I gave you like there at some

691
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.989
point, we can, as scientists, we can like find

692
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.830
things, study things quantify things. But then at some

693
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.320
point, there is a factor that is not that,

694
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.699
you know, there's more kind of at some point,

695
00:35:31.709 --> 00:35:36.290
it's just purely semantics, purely philosophical like OK, now

696
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.810
hold you based on all this evidence because I

697
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.959
have colleagues that the the colleague that found the

698
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.520
Ochre in Africa 300,000 years ago, this they say

699
00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.800
this is the beginning of humanity. The colleagues who

700
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.530
founded the the K paintings 50,000 years ago, they

701
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.810
say, no, this is the beginning of humanity. So

702
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.040
who do you who, who is, who is going

703
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.439
to decide this? I think having a kind of

704
00:35:57.449 --> 00:35:59.629
external views to people who are just in the

705
00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:05.159
trenches of plot itself. Anthropology maybe can provide some

706
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:07.620
sort of perspective. You know, when you are, let's

707
00:36:07.629 --> 00:36:10.760
say like this is like people who, who study

708
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.479
like, like for example, they would say if you

709
00:36:13.489 --> 00:36:17.110
are inside the washing machine tumbling around you, it's,

710
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.739
it's probably gonna be hard for you to understand

711
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.590
what's happening. But if you are outside looking from

712
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.300
the distance, the thing, you, you might have a

713
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.879
better perspective of what happened, what's happening around you

714
00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:27.949
at that moment. So the idea was kind of

715
00:36:27.959 --> 00:36:32.659
like that like, ok, people who are clearly interested

716
00:36:32.669 --> 00:36:36.629
in understanding human nature, human evolution, but they are

717
00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:41.040
not working specifically with the fossil record, archaeological record,

718
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.709
how they, how they see things are they see

719
00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:46.510
things the same way that we are seeing them

720
00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:49.709
or not. And, and that really like it was

721
00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:52.050
very eye opening for me because one of the,

722
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.719
one of the people in the book, All The

723
00:36:54.729 --> 00:36:57.280
Humans in the book, that was the, the name

724
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.780
of the book kind of was playing with this

725
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.260
is about humans and human evolution. But also it's

726
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.800
kind of showcasing real humans, you know, that it's

727
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.159
kind of uh behind the scene view of the

728
00:37:06.169 --> 00:37:08.510
field and the people behind it, right? But one

729
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.000
of them in the, in this section is more

730
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:14.340
like the philosophical section is uh is her name

731
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.219
is Mia Landau and she's, she's an anthropologist, right?

732
00:37:17.229 --> 00:37:21.320
But, but she's a peculiar anthropologist because her, she's

733
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:26.110
also an artist and, and her dissertation, actually, she

734
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.889
was interested both in uh you know, the, both

735
00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:33.530
the, the science of human evolution, but also the

736
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.239
humanistic part of human evolution. What has been written

737
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.010
about it, how it has been written about it

738
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.179
and so on and by kind of kind kind

739
00:37:41.189 --> 00:37:44.870
of by accident, she found out that that many

740
00:37:44.879 --> 00:37:48.879
of the narratives of human evolution since Darwin until

741
00:37:48.889 --> 00:37:52.989
these days, like they are, they follow a narrative

742
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.580
like when and it's not just human evolution, but

743
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.239
science in general, her argument is that humans based

744
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.750
on our language is just kind of a, there's

745
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.750
no other way around it, the way we communicate

746
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.179
using human language. It's in a, it's always a

747
00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:11.050
narrative, you know, it's always a subject predicate and

748
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.649
so on. And then, and then it seems that

749
00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:17.469
it's just the way we communicate information and when

750
00:38:17.479 --> 00:38:19.739
we do so we tend to do it in

751
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.449
a, in a, in a way that, you know,

752
00:38:21.689 --> 00:38:24.199
the more interesting is communicated in the form of

753
00:38:24.209 --> 00:38:27.550
a tail is like more interesting for the other

754
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.439
person is probably likely to remember. So this is

755
00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:33.870
happening at some point, this is happening mostly unconsciously.

756
00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:36.479
But her argument was that since the first or

757
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.010
the first narrative of a human evolution, the rest,

758
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.020
the rest of researchers basically are kind of fitting

759
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.979
their discoveries into pre-existing narratives and just kind of

760
00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:48.530
tweaking, tweaking them a little bit. And then she

761
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.370
was actually mapping, you know, like there is a

762
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.290
um like one of the people who came out

763
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.459
with this theory is Joseph Campbell, who was an

764
00:38:56.469 --> 00:39:00.739
anthropologist in New York. And actually like his, his

765
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.199
research on that is what inspired George Lucas to

766
00:39:03.209 --> 00:39:05.639
write Star Wars. You know, the way it was

767
00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:09.780
written is that the hero's tale, basically, what Campbell

768
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.620
found out is that like across cultures, like many

769
00:39:13.629 --> 00:39:16.050
cultures who have different times in history, in different

770
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.750
continents, cultures that never met each other. So it's

771
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.570
not like they copied the other. They came out

772
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.100
with myths and stories and religions that kind of

773
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:27.379
follow the same narrative structure of the hero who

774
00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:30.750
lives, you know, they're like homeland and they encounter

775
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.969
different problems and then a mentor shows up and

776
00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:35.280
helps, you know, and then at the end of

777
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.689
the story is transformed into something bigger that comes

778
00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:41.070
back home and helps the people around them. So

779
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.929
he found out that that kind of uh archetype

780
00:39:44.939 --> 00:39:47.889
of the hero's journey tale. It's kind of uh

781
00:39:47.899 --> 00:39:50.419
it repeats over and over again in different cultures,

782
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:52.600
in different myths and different religions. And what Lisa

783
00:39:52.669 --> 00:39:55.689
Landau found out is that this also happens in

784
00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:58.989
science. When people describe the results of their own

785
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.699
studies, even there are scientific studies with based on

786
00:40:01.709 --> 00:40:05.060
scientific data analysis, still the way they communicate their

787
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.409
discussion, their conclusions is always in a narrative style

788
00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:12.800
that sometimes also feed that Hitter's journey tale, you

789
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.449
know, and it's just it seems that her argument

790
00:40:15.459 --> 00:40:17.560
is that this is just a way, this is

791
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.379
the way in which the human psyche works and

792
00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:21.500
it's hard to escape from it, but we need

793
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.340
to be aware of it. So we when we

794
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.199
communicate or like raol a scientist, we do it

795
00:40:27.209 --> 00:40:28.449
in a way that it is not just a

796
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:30.350
tale that it's OK, it has the shape of

797
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.449
a narrative, but it's communicating novel information, not just

798
00:40:33.459 --> 00:40:36.570
building pre existing tail, right? So this is an

799
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.010
interesting perspective I thought for example, that only you

800
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.860
could only bring into the picture if you talk

801
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:46.260
to people outside the specific field of like the

802
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.560
regular science. Mhm

803
00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:56.040
And so you interviewed all these variety of experts

804
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.840
uh asking them what it means to be human,

805
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:06.639
asking them questions about human evolution. So looking back

806
00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:10.030
at that, what would you say are perhaps some

807
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.989
of the most disputed questions. There is the aspects

808
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.040
where uh looking at that variety of experts, you

809
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.179
would say they disagree the most on.

810
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.139
Oh, there, there are many of them. But I,

811
00:41:27.149 --> 00:41:32.000
I guess I would say, um, one of them

812
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.860
is, is that what the, what I mentioned about,

813
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.030
is it useful to study human evolution from a

814
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.189
practical perspective? But it's just interesting, you know, it

815
00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:41.899
went like, like, no, this is purely, like, you

816
00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:43.739
know, in the same way that watching a movie

817
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.050
is not useful for anyone's life, but it's interesting

818
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.790
and entertaining. But this is the same, you know,

819
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.010
and it's based on real things that actually happened.

820
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.300
So it's even more and it's about us. So

821
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.330
it's therefore very interesting for everyone and no one

822
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.739
has to do it. Other people would actually argue

823
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.610
it's interesting, but it also has practical, practical issues,

824
00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.530
not like the example of the Fukushima Station. But

825
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.090
there are other people who study more in the

826
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.459
medicine world, for example. And what we mentioned that

827
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.550
that it's interesting to understand the human evolution because

828
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.419
it seems that physiologically, for example, we are adapted

829
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.510
to, to not eat almost sugar or fats, right?

830
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.949
And that's why most of the the obesity pandemic

831
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:26.449
in the world is because we most diet now

832
00:42:26.459 --> 00:42:28.429
are rich in the things that we are able

833
00:42:28.439 --> 00:42:32.169
to eat very little. So basically, and this happens

834
00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:34.919
also in other animals, like, you know, like orangutans

835
00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:37.260
in the in the field, in the, you know,

836
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.830
in their habitats there, there's, there are sometimes there

837
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.570
are months or years in which there is almost

838
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.149
no food to eat no fruit. And they just,

839
00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:45.860
they are literally chewing on the bark of the

840
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.949
tree because there's nothing to eat. So they are

841
00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:50.550
adapted to like when there is something that has

842
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.159
sugars and fats, which has a lot of energy.

843
00:42:53.429 --> 00:42:56.439
Their bodies are adapted over millions of years to

844
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:58.850
like suck it up in the form of fat.

845
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.330
So they can then survive for long periods of

846
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.169
time with no food or very little food or

847
00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:05.909
low quality food. It seems that something like that

848
00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:08.780
happened in the human lineage. But now we're just

849
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.530
eating the things that we are adapted not to

850
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.469
eat all the time and that is causing us

851
00:43:12.479 --> 00:43:16.959
a lot of problems. Then one could argue, oh,

852
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:19.209
that is, is that really useful to know because

853
00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:21.209
we already we know anyways that it is bad

854
00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:22.760
for us. So just don't need it. Why it's

855
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:26.070
important to know that the evolutionary like explanation of

856
00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.330
why this is the way it is. It is

857
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.790
a big discussion. Again, some people argue that you

858
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.790
can find having the evolutionary perspective can help you

859
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.050
find better solutions. So other things that is interesting,

860
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.899
but it's not going to change anything. Another big

861
00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:42.850
dis discussion was about um uh what's that? The

862
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.320
human evolution, right? Like some expert would, would say,

863
00:43:47.239 --> 00:43:50.459
is it possible to know? And Hogan, Hogan, it

864
00:43:50.469 --> 00:43:53.260
probably was something a very complex process with different,

865
00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:58.189
different things, interacting with other things, you know, and

866
00:43:58.489 --> 00:44:00.909
it's hard to tell exactly what is the one

867
00:44:00.919 --> 00:44:05.020
thing that jumpstarted human evolution. Others provide very clear

868
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.600
specific ideas on what happened is that the environment

869
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.199
changed, it was open. So we had to come

870
00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:10.870
down the trees and they come by it and

871
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.770
it's a by product. We, our hands were free

872
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.889
from locomotion. Therefore, we start using them for making

873
00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:16.830
tools and that made us smarter and blah blah,

874
00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.520
blah, blah, blah, blah blah. So you very opposite

875
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.659
views. The same for the future question. Like some

876
00:44:21.669 --> 00:44:23.770
people would argue that it's impossible to know it's

877
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.719
not happening in the future because everything is so

878
00:44:26.729 --> 00:44:28.830
there's so much contingency. You know, we don't know

879
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.439
if a mere is gonna come next year and

880
00:44:30.449 --> 00:44:32.969
kill everyone. We don't know climate change what's gonna

881
00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:35.699
happen 15 years on the road. Others would argue

882
00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:38.510
that for sure, gonna be exceeded 100 years from

883
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.929
now. Others are others provide like very specific perspective

884
00:44:42.939 --> 00:44:45.469
about this is exactly how humans are gonna look

885
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.389
100,000 years from now. This is exactly how humans

886
00:44:48.399 --> 00:44:50.080
are gonna look at a million years from now.

887
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.489
These are the reasons, right? So that was very

888
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.750
shocking to me as well. And then of course,

889
00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.689
the one about religion and spirituality that you have

890
00:44:57.699 --> 00:45:01.060
this big device, especially from faults in the US

891
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.810
and outside the US. But in the US. Like,

892
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.540
there are some exceptions, but the majority is, is

893
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.840
the place in which most researchers would if they

894
00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.120
answer the question that they are, like, not compatible.

895
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.169
Basically, if you believe in religion and spirituality, you

896
00:45:16.179 --> 00:45:19.590
are not a scientist, you know, and outside the,

897
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.489
outside the US, there are all kinds of views,

898
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.040
you know, especially there are some call from Asia

899
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.879
that you only have like Buddhist backgrounds and student

900
00:45:26.889 --> 00:45:30.250
religion. They always like, feel like animals are like

901
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.149
kind of equal to human, you know, and they

902
00:45:33.159 --> 00:45:35.189
just kind of feel that that one thing kind

903
00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:38.830
of compliments the other and they actually feel that

904
00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.790
ignoring um teaching that could come from the spiritual

905
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.050
world could kind of like blindside us in terms

906
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.840
of science. Maybe we're not studying something because we

907
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.530
think, oh, this is just some sort of like

908
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.679
Juju Mambo Jambo. Let's ignore this and some people

909
00:45:55.689 --> 00:45:57.610
are like, well, maybe there's some science behind that,

910
00:45:58.139 --> 00:46:00.330
let's actually look into it and see what happens,

911
00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.040
you know. So it's that question clearly was a

912
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.260
big divide and then, but I guess I know

913
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.199
if I had to highlight the one. So,

914
00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:12.590
uh le let me ask you about one specific

915
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.750
question. Uh And please tell me if this is

916
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.800
also something that people actually also disagree a lot

917
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:24.860
on. So what about specifically how people uh different

918
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.149
kinds of experts, anthropologists specifically but also others, how

919
00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:35.385
they look at how universal is our human behavior

920
00:46:35.395 --> 00:46:37.485
and psychology. I mean, in terms of, if you

921
00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:41.985
look cross culturally, human behavior and psychology varies a

922
00:46:41.995 --> 00:46:45.625
lot. Or if we have really a big common

923
00:46:45.635 --> 00:46:50.364
human nature and our psychology is mostly universal. I

924
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:53.215
mean, is there lots, did you find lots of

925
00:46:53.225 --> 00:46:54.945
disagreement there or

926
00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:57.334
not? Well, I think, I guess some of that

927
00:46:57.344 --> 00:46:59.625
came out in the, in the answers to the

928
00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:03.649
question about whether or not humans are special and,

929
00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:07.610
and, and the answer were not about it's, I

930
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.020
don't, I don't think it was any single answer.

931
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:16.080
That kind of doubted that humans as a whole

932
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.969
are kind of like, not different from each other.

933
00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.500
Like we, I think it is this discussion is

934
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.290
about whether the human uniqueness is so unique or

935
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.370
is it like a degree of, so humans versus

936
00:47:27.379 --> 00:47:30.449
a for example, other animals are like the difference

937
00:47:30.459 --> 00:47:32.370
that we have are like a matter of degree

938
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.860
or there is like a matter of uh quality.

939
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.639
So like any human behavior today, you can see

940
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:41.840
some of it in a chimpanzee today. It's just

941
00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:45.520
expressed there just as the same kind of capacity

942
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.919
that we have, but just to a lesser degree

943
00:47:47.929 --> 00:47:51.280
or this something clearly distinctive. It's a clear cap

944
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.000
between being a human and not being a human

945
00:47:53.239 --> 00:47:56.080
that was like kind of highly debated among the

946
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.810
different experts. And in, but no one doubted that

947
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.929
humans. They're like, it seemed, it seemed to me

948
00:48:02.939 --> 00:48:04.850
that the implication of the answer is that they

949
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.149
don't consider that there is something different among humans

950
00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:10.780
that they consider all humans to have a very

951
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:16.560
common psyche. And there's some commonalities in human nature.

952
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.479
And one of them is for example, this thing

953
00:48:18.489 --> 00:48:21.760
about human language and the way we structure uh

954
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.209
communication in the form of a narrative that dictates

955
00:48:25.219 --> 00:48:28.040
kind of the way that we think. I don't

956
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.669
like everyone, I think agrees that basically it's, it's

957
00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:33.979
11 human nature and there would, you know, very

958
00:48:33.989 --> 00:48:37.739
few attempt in terms of language. Um But the,

959
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.929
the debate is about whether or not it is

960
00:48:39.939 --> 00:48:43.699
a clear cut with other animals or not. Mhm

961
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:49.830
And uh looking at our, the current state, the

962
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.070
state of the art, let's say of our understanding

963
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.520
of human evolution, what would you say are the

964
00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.110
biggest known unknowns,

965
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.340
I mean, known and known. I mean, there are,

966
00:49:04.639 --> 00:49:07.290
there are values of that. Uh ONE big debate

967
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.479
today is um there are many but one big

968
00:49:11.489 --> 00:49:13.629
debate today is about the starting point of human

969
00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:17.699
evolution. For example, like there, everyone since the molecular

970
00:49:17.709 --> 00:49:20.770
revolution that started in the sixties and seventies, it

971
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.350
was kind of after the nineties, everyone, 99% of

972
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.149
the researchers agree that chimpanzees are are the living

973
00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:31.510
closer relative to humans before that just looking at

974
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.379
the anatomy, you know, the morphology, I mean, it

975
00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:36.870
was kind of like a surprise because you would

976
00:49:36.879 --> 00:49:39.629
assume that a chimpanzee is closer to a gorilla

977
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.100
than to us. So that kind of blew everyone's

978
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:46.360
mind at the time. Um And then since then,

979
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.600
it's been kind of a i still ongoing debate

980
00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.639
about, OK, so then the last, who was the

981
00:49:52.649 --> 00:49:56.570
ancestor from, with chimpanzees and humans evolve? Was it

982
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.590
like a chimpanzee or was like something else? And

983
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.330
that's still like a big unknown? And you can

984
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.540
see, just look at the literature that, that some

985
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.679
people just assume that we work from something like

986
00:50:05.689 --> 00:50:07.560
a chimpanzees. Other people assume that we work from

987
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.560
something completely different from a chimpanzee. Other people think

988
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.320
that some features of chimpanzees were an ancestor but

989
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.159
others were not in it. So that's still like

990
00:50:15.169 --> 00:50:17.340
kind of if you ask different people, they would

991
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.330
tell you that's not unknown to me. I know

992
00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.889
exactly the answer. But I would, I would suggest

993
00:50:21.899 --> 00:50:23.719
that just looking at in general the literature of

994
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.580
how desperate the assumptions are in that sense, it's

995
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.719
not that clear consensus about who the ancestor of

996
00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:35.300
chim chim humans was. And, and that's important because

997
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.050
it's basically the starting will be the starting point

998
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.929
of human evolution, but also the starting point of

999
00:50:39.939 --> 00:50:43.379
chimpanzee evolution. Now one of the big unknowns today

1000
00:50:44.179 --> 00:50:46.919
that which is I kind of mind blowing for

1001
00:50:46.929 --> 00:50:49.330
many people. And to me too, even though I

1002
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.729
work on this is that we don't have fossil

1003
00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:55.800
chimpanzees, we don't have fossil gorillas. So people argue,

1004
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.639
we don't even have fossil oral utan. It's like,

1005
00:50:57.649 --> 00:51:00.820
how is it possible that there are like hundreds

1006
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.399
of fossils of the human lineage or, or Africa,

1007
00:51:03.409 --> 00:51:06.560
Europe, Asia? But there are no fossil chimpanzees. I

1008
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.540
mean, they're like few t that are just a

1009
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.919
few 1000 years old. Not like they are not

1010
00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:12.659
million years old. They are. No, they do the

1011
00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:16.989
fossil record of chimpanzees, the fossil record of gorillas

1012
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.669
and so on. It's kind of like, it's like

1013
00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:23.370
what happened? This is still kind of what the

1014
00:51:23.379 --> 00:51:28.419
hell happened, you know. Um It's a big mystery

1015
00:51:28.429 --> 00:51:30.389
and that's important because if we don't know, we

1016
00:51:30.399 --> 00:51:32.739
don't have these fossils, we cannot understand the revolution

1017
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.120
and if we don't understand the evolution, we cannot

1018
00:51:35.129 --> 00:51:38.590
actually test if the ancestor of them and us

1019
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.360
was like them or was like something else. Um

1020
00:51:42.959 --> 00:51:45.679
And then another unknown relating to that is that

1021
00:51:45.689 --> 00:51:49.060
in general, we know very little about the fossil

1022
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.889
record of humans in, in Africa. We think we

1023
00:51:51.899 --> 00:51:53.610
know a lot because there are many fossils, especially

1024
00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.370
from Eastern Africa and South Africa, Southern Africa, but

1025
00:51:57.379 --> 00:52:01.330
like Africa is giant and like we know that

1026
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.419
they were all over just we don't have them.

1027
00:52:03.429 --> 00:52:06.189
We know because like there are a few outliers,

1028
00:52:06.199 --> 00:52:08.639
like there are sites in central a central and

1029
00:52:08.649 --> 00:52:12.189
northern Africa in Chad where we found besides the

1030
00:52:12.199 --> 00:52:14.989
fossils of Saan Anthro was one possible early Hoy

1031
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.840
of 7 million years. I know, I agree. It's

1032
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.590
a harmony but it's a different story. Do we

1033
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.780
have astro fossils there? Older than 3 million years?

1034
00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:28.959
We also have very bizarre fossil in Namibia, western,

1035
00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:32.429
like southern Africa. So, but they're like, they were

1036
00:52:32.439 --> 00:52:35.489
kind of accidental findings but they show you that

1037
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.350
the, the picture is way more complex than what

1038
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.620
we are. We think we, we think we know

1039
00:52:40.629 --> 00:52:43.689
what happened based on what we found but what

1040
00:52:43.699 --> 00:52:47.530
we found is not representative of what was there.

1041
00:52:48.649 --> 00:52:50.820
Mhm And I think this is this is kind

1042
00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:53.350
of, it's strange because this is known, but people

1043
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.639
cannot, don't acknowledge it. That is that we have

1044
00:52:55.649 --> 00:52:58.429
this limitation. There's kind of, we don't talk about

1045
00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:00.830
it because it makes it even more complicated, you

1046
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.110
know. Um And then still another big discussion today

1047
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.510
is, is um you know, all these like we

1048
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.110
know this the new genomic study showing that it

1049
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.169
was all these hybridization between humans and other species

1050
00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:18.389
of humans until very recently. But some of them

1051
00:53:18.399 --> 00:53:20.310
don't, we don't even have like clear fossils that

1052
00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.760
go with. We only know that something different was

1053
00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:26.580
there based on the genes. But what was it,

1054
00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:30.120
you know, still kind of debated, even like um

1055
00:53:30.439 --> 00:53:33.959
a big unknown and high highly debated thing is

1056
00:53:33.969 --> 00:53:36.570
what went back to a previous answer question is

1057
00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.570
about this uniqueness of modern humans, Homo Sapiens there.

1058
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.760
Our capacity for language and abstractions and conceptual world

1059
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:48.139
basically building is that unique of Homo sapiens or

1060
00:53:48.149 --> 00:53:50.820
they were, there were other human species also capable

1061
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:53.879
of that. So some argue that all human only,

1062
00:53:53.889 --> 00:53:56.830
only humans, only Homo sapiens has ever done all,

1063
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.919
all the other variety of humans that lived before,

1064
00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.419
not like us. And that's why they are not

1065
00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:06.780
here anymore, you know, but for example, like even

1066
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.959
neanderthals that we coexisted in Europe for like 10,000

1067
00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:12.419
plus years, like some people argue that they didn't

1068
00:54:12.429 --> 00:54:15.419
have a culture like a more human culture. And

1069
00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:18.739
they just, that's why we were able to basically

1070
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.699
like over, I don't know, you kill them all

1071
00:54:22.709 --> 00:54:26.459
or drive to extinction or it's not clear exactly

1072
00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:27.929
what happened with the neanderthals. It's still a big

1073
00:54:27.939 --> 00:54:32.199
unknown, very debated how they become extinct when they

1074
00:54:32.209 --> 00:54:35.459
have been in Europe for so long. Um But

1075
00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:37.189
some ideas are like, well, they didn't have this

1076
00:54:37.199 --> 00:54:41.010
sophisticated mind conceptual system that we have. But they

1077
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.540
are older. Like there is like a cave in

1078
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:47.429
France, 200,000 year old, like Brunei cave. And they're

1079
00:54:47.439 --> 00:54:51.050
like very complex constructions inside the cave with the

1080
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.889
static titan, static minds. And that was a Neanderthal

1081
00:54:54.899 --> 00:54:58.090
cave. So clearly, they, they were, they there was

1082
00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.399
something going on there that they're like some limited,

1083
00:55:01.409 --> 00:55:03.330
you know, they were making their own clothes, you

1084
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.580
know, some argue they would bury their dead. So

1085
00:55:06.669 --> 00:55:09.280
it's kind of interesting that neanderthals were kind of

1086
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.179
have a little bit of what we have, but

1087
00:55:12.189 --> 00:55:15.129
it's not clear exactly to what degree. But now

1088
00:55:15.139 --> 00:55:17.679
also we know that they were intervening with humans.

1089
00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:20.959
Good morning. The ship was almost happy. So, I

1090
00:55:20.969 --> 00:55:22.389
mean, it's hard to believe that they were like

1091
00:55:22.399 --> 00:55:25.550
mixing up with each other without shedding also like

1092
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.449
culture and knowledge, right? So that's still a very,

1093
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:32.000
it's kind of very intriguing and very and know

1094
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.350
big unknown of what was happening at that time

1095
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.939
and it was something so recent, relatively speaking,

1096
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:42.159
right? So I have then one final question for

1097
00:55:42.169 --> 00:55:45.610
you and you even mentioned earlier when I asked

1098
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.229
you about the questions that the experts in the

1099
00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:54.149
book uh disagreed the most on you mentioned uh

1100
00:55:54.159 --> 00:55:58.679
the religious or spiritual uh question. And I mean,

1101
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:02.610
if the scientific perspective is compatible with that. So

1102
00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.750
I, I would like to hear your own thoughts

1103
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.169
on that. Do you think that a scientific perspective

1104
00:56:09.179 --> 00:56:15.030
on humans is actually compatible with religious or spiritual

1105
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.229
views of humans or not?

1106
00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.709
I think, I think, I think the spiritual and

1107
00:56:20.719 --> 00:56:26.409
religion, religious like behaviors are just part of the

1108
00:56:26.419 --> 00:56:31.229
human cultural repertoire. And so I, I, some, some

1109
00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:32.979
experts in the book have pointed this out that

1110
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.270
it's worth studying them as any other aspect of

1111
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.729
being a human. Um Because, you know, like me

1112
00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:42.840
personally, I think that religions are like there are

1113
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.209
some commonalities about different religions as other people have

1114
00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:48.580
noticed and similar teachings. Another thing is how humans

1115
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:53.800
have over the years centuries use religion, religious books

1116
00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.669
for their own convenience. That's a different story. But

1117
00:56:56.679 --> 00:57:00.020
religion itself, I think it's just, it's like a,

1118
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.649
I think it's been selected. Right. Is, is, is,

1119
00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:06.580
is a way to, to be, to have a

1120
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:09.260
set of rules of what is good behavior or

1121
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.969
considered good behavior. But when they were written, maybe

1122
00:57:11.979 --> 00:57:14.830
they should have been updated with later on, maybe

1123
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.060
they didn't. But, but like they, they seem to

1124
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:21.510
have commonalities that might have been selected. So it's,

1125
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.489
it's just, I think it's just they are part

1126
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.290
of human behavior and they can study from an

1127
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:30.489
evolutionary viewpoint. And in terms of spirituality, I think

1128
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:35.159
it's a broad, a broad um question because to

1129
00:57:35.169 --> 00:57:37.040
me it means like, what, what, what, what do

1130
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:38.610
you mean? You can ask different people, what is

1131
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.629
the spirituality for you? You know, and like, you

1132
00:57:41.639 --> 00:57:43.379
know, like, for example, I don't believe that there

1133
00:57:43.389 --> 00:57:46.330
is like some sort of like man, old man

1134
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.659
with a white beard sitting on top of a

1135
00:57:47.669 --> 00:57:50.040
cloud looking at us, you know, I don't, but

1136
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.969
I think that that there are things that we

1137
00:57:52.979 --> 00:57:56.389
still don't understand exactly how they work and they've

1138
00:57:56.399 --> 00:57:59.780
been like different spiritual views developed over the centuries

1139
00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:02.699
about to explain them that might be based on

1140
00:58:02.709 --> 00:58:05.080
nothing but might be some true on them. They

1141
00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:09.209
just need more like scientific attention and maybe things

1142
00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:12.399
that we think are some sort of spiritual meaningless

1143
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:15.139
things like 100 years from now, it will be

1144
00:58:15.149 --> 00:58:18.409
a basis of it, you know. So as someone

1145
00:58:18.419 --> 00:58:20.679
has pointed out before, I think uh uh a

1146
00:58:20.689 --> 00:58:25.360
scientist with an open mind should consider everything and

1147
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.780
not just like scar things because that's kind of

1148
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:32.580
a way to narrow, you know, the how much

1149
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:35.639
reality you can kind of perceive and study.

1150
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.139
Mhm OK. Great. So the book is again, Humans

1151
00:58:41.149 --> 00:58:45.750
Perspectives On our Revolution from world experts. I'm leaving

1152
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.770
a link to it in the description box of

1153
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:51.500
the interview. And doctor Amei just before we go,

1154
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:54.080
would you like to tell people apart from the

1155
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.060
book where they can find you on the internet?

1156
00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.830
Well, my name is not very common. So they

1157
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.580
just Google me, they will come out with my

1158
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:05.469
web page, which is just my name.com and there

1159
00:59:05.479 --> 00:59:07.629
I have like links to my research and other

1160
00:59:07.639 --> 00:59:09.889
things I work on so everything can be found

1161
00:59:09.899 --> 00:59:10.120
there.

1162
00:59:10.949 --> 00:59:14.409
Great. So thank you so much again for taking

1163
00:59:14.419 --> 00:59:16.149
