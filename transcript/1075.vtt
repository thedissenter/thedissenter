00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.800
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Loops and

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.399
today I'm by Doctor Michael Cook. He is class

4
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.800
of 1943 University Professor of Near Eastern Studies at

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.989
Princeton University. He is the author of several books,

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.389
and today we're going to talk about his latest

7
00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.680
one, a history of the Muslim world, from its

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
origins to the dawn of modernity. So, Doctor Cook,

9
00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:28.799
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to

10
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:29.040
everyone.

11
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.189
It's a great pleasure for me to be here.

12
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.799
Great. So, let me start by asking you before

13
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.490
we get into the actual history of the Muslim

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.400
world. What is the Muslim world? I mean, what

15
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.830
is it characterized by what are we exactly talking

16
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.400
about when we reference the Muslim world?

17
00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.630
Right, and like, you know, like so many of

18
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.349
these uh phrases, it's one that different people could

19
00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:57.549
use in different ways. But I mean, what I

20
00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.330
want to mean by it is any part of

21
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.410
the world where Muslims are, one, the majority of

22
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.809
the population, or two, the rulers, or both. And

23
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:14.290
what is characterized by, I mean, by definition, it's

24
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.110
simply this allegiance to Islam of majority of rulers

25
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.230
or of both. And we can then start asking

26
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.059
what, so to speak empirically correlates with that. And

27
00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.220
I think we're gonna get onto that uh quite

28
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.660
soon. Right.

29
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.199
So uh just to clarify certain terms here, sometimes

30
00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:40.959
people use the word Islamic, other times Muslim. Is

31
00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.120
Islamic the same as Muslim?

32
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.500
Right. And here again, I mean, people can use

33
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.059
the words the way they want, but um, personally,

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.339
I'm, I like to make a distinction uh from

35
00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:59.129
my point of view. Anything that Muslims do is

36
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:05.309
Muslim. And whereas, uh, for something to be Islamic,

37
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.660
it has to be in some intrinsic way Islamic.

38
00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:12.438
So for example, um, I should take a extreme

39
00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:15.798
case, supposing we have somebody who's born into a

40
00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:19.438
Muslim family, and then um is brought up as

41
00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:23.039
a Muslim, but becomes an atheist. Could we call

42
00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.399
him a Muslim atheist? Well, perhaps it's a little

43
00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.878
contradictory, but perhaps, but I certainly wouldn't want to

44
00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:33.748
call him an Islamic atheist. That to my mind

45
00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:34.679
is nonsense.

46
00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.330
Mhm. Right. So let's get into the history here

47
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.809
then. When exactly does the history of the Muslim

48
00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:44.960
world start?

49
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.770
Right. So if we go by my definition of

50
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.520
what the Muslim world is in 622. Or before

51
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.470
6:22, when the prophet Muhammad was active in Mecca,

52
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.679
there was no Muslim world, um, because Muslims were

53
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.710
a minority in Mecca and they didn't rule Mecca.

54
00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.690
But uh after 6 to 2, we have the

55
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.610
pro excuse me. We have Muhammed in Medina. And

56
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080
there in Medina, he gradually comes to be the

57
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.199
ruler of the entire oasis. It's a big oasis.

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.080
It takes time, it takes years, and, and gradually

59
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.559
the entire population becomes Muslim. So that by the

60
00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:37.479
time that Muhammad dies in 632, we have, so

61
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.660
to speak, a very miniature Muslim world. Um, WITH

62
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.880
some extension outside Medina. Uh, NOT to the rest

63
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.520
of Arabia, but nowhere outside Arabia. So I would

64
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.160
say between 622 and 632, the death of the

65
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.869
prophet, that's when the Muslim world comes into existence.

66
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.470
So we'll come back to Mohammed and the rise

67
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.660
of the Islamic world later on in our conversation,

68
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.669
but just to give a little bit more of

69
00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.619
historical context and background because there's a context and

70
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.789
some events that can be for the rise of

71
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.350
the Muslim world here as you detail in your

72
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.630
book. Um, I mean, how did the Middle East

73
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.029
look like in late antiquity, from the, around the

74
00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.269
4th century to early 7th century?

75
00:04:28.329 --> 00:04:33.079
OK. So let's start with um an environmental point.

76
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.929
That applies throughout history, that uh in the Middle

77
00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.420
East, we have good lands where you can do

78
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.369
extensive agriculture, and we have bad lands where you

79
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.730
can't. And as a very crude first approximation, the

80
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.160
good lands are in the north, what's now Turkey,

81
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:56.489
Iran, the fertile crescent, and the badlands are in

82
00:04:56.489 --> 00:05:02.989
the south, and Arabia. And so the answer to

83
00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.589
your question is essentially, what has been erected on

84
00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.320
that basis? At the in the period of late

85
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.829
antiquity. And the the simple answer is two empires.

86
00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:20.899
Both in the north, the Byzantine Empire and the

87
00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:26.049
Persian Empire. And in the south, we have a

88
00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:32.570
land with no empires. Almost no states um dominated

89
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.170
by tribes, that's the Arabs in Arabia. So that's

90
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.420
very crudely the setup in late antiquity.

91
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.049
Mhm. And so at a certain point, I think

92
00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:46.920
you talk about in your book how the Byzantine

93
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.570
Empire and the Persian Empire went to war in

94
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.040
the early 7th century. Uh, COULD you tell us

95
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.609
about that and why is that particular event important

96
00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:57.920
here?

97
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.170
OK, right. Now, you have coexistence of those two

98
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.220
empires for centuries. And they quite frequently go to

99
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.329
war. But most of the time, the wars they

100
00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:16.149
fight are not seriously destabilizing. You know, the result

101
00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.410
in adjustments to the frontier. What happens in the

102
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.010
early 7th century is different. It's a very long

103
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.829
war, and it's very seriously destabilizing. And we almost

104
00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.899
get to get to a situation where the Byzantine

105
00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:34.390
Empire looks like it's finished, and we're going to

106
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.029
have a single Persian Empire ruling the whole Middle

107
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.250
East. And then there's a very dramatic reversal of

108
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.230
fortunes. And what comes out of that war is

109
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:51.959
two seriously weakened empires. And that constitutes a remarkable

110
00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:54.269
opportunity for the Arabs to step in.

111
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.369
OK, so you also mentioned the nomadic people. So

112
00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.369
tell us a little bit more about the nomadic

113
00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.170
people of the steps. I mean, what role did

114
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.010
they play and how did they relate to both

115
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.679
the Byzantine and the Persian Empire?

116
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.640
Yes, right. And in the Middle East, we have

117
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.480
this situation where the empires are kind of sandwiched

118
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.839
between two groups of nomads, the Arabs in the

119
00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:24.859
south, and the stepped nomads that you mention in

120
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:31.950
the north. And I think one important point there

121
00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:34.140
is that the steps are very different from the

122
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.760
Arabian Desert. The steps are not a desert. Uh,

123
00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:45.700
THEY are grasslands. And those grasslands are very extensive,

124
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.350
much more extensive than Arabia. So that what comes

125
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.350
out of that is, well, one that um you

126
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.320
have many different step peoples. Whereas basically we have

127
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.399
one people, the Arabs in Arabia. And 2, that

128
00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.760
because their economy is based on grass, which feeds

129
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.480
their flocks, they are more affluent, they're richer nomads,

130
00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:16.559
richer pastoralists than the ones of Arabia, and so

131
00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:20.859
they more easily create states in the steppes and

132
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:29.579
Because these step nomads ride horses more or less

133
00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:34.099
from infancy. They are the world's best cavalry. They're

134
00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.940
so to speak, natural cavalry, and that makes them

135
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.099
a serious military threat to the empires in the

136
00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:42.729
age of the cavalry, which we're in the middle

137
00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:47.929
of. And the result is that the empires have

138
00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:51.210
good reason to concentrate much more seriously on the

139
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.650
military threat from the nomads in the north than

140
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.530
on the Arabs in the south. The Arabs can

141
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.010
be a nuisance, but the nomads in the north

142
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.489
are a serious threat. So for example, during that

143
00:09:03.489 --> 00:09:08.030
last war, there are 2 occasions when nomadic states

144
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.590
intervene in the imperial conflict. The Arabs are not

145
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.280
intervening.

146
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.590
So, uh, and I mean, when it comes to

147
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.539
the people of the nomadic people of the steps,

148
00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:26.109
did they did they play any role in the

149
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:29.989
war between the two empires or in their fall

150
00:09:29.989 --> 00:09:30.669
in any way?

151
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.989
Yes, right. I mean, there's a point at which

152
00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:40.869
the Persians have invaded Anatolia, what's what's now Asiatic

153
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:44.739
Turkey. And they are on the shores of the

154
00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:49.820
Bosphorus looking across at Constantinople. And meanwhile, the Avas,

155
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:52.820
one of these nomadic peoples of the steppes, have

156
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.900
come right down and are threatening Constantinople on the

157
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.090
other side. And that's maybe the moment when it

158
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.489
looks most as if the Byzantine Empire is going

159
00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:08.770
to disappear. And then you have this dramatic reversal,

160
00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:13.940
uh, when the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius with extraordinary nerve,

161
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.200
he takes his army, he leaves Constantinople. And he

162
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.229
goes east and into the Persian Empire. And on

163
00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:26.909
the way into the Persian Empire, he's joined by

164
00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:30.190
another step people. They usually refer to them as

165
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.070
the Turks, very likely these are the Khazars from

166
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.080
north of the Caucasus. And they go, they march

167
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.469
through, they ride through the Persian Empire together. And

168
00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:44.989
until at some point the Hazars decide to go

169
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:49.940
home. But by that time, The Byzantine emperor is

170
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.500
already threatening the Persian capital. The Persians, they have

171
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.539
their armies in the west. They have no army

172
00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:59.979
to put between them and Heraclius. It's a catastrophic

173
00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:05.239
situation. There's a coup d'etat. And That's what really

174
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:08.320
what ends the war. So you have two dramatic

175
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.359
interventions, one from the others in the west and

176
00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:14.150
the other from the Khazars or Turks in the

177
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.630
east.

178
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.479
So let's talk now a little bit about the

179
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:21.840
Arabs and specifically in the book you focus on

180
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.159
the Arabian interior where again, Islam was born in

181
00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:31.429
the early 7th century. So what characterized society there?

182
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.070
Right. I think I we start from the resource

183
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.909
poverty of most of Arabia, certainly north of the

184
00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:45.159
Yemen. Uh, WHICH means that a lot of society

185
00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:48.960
is nomadic. That's one basic feature. Uh, THEY'RE not

186
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.809
all nomads, there are oasis. Though there's not too

187
00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:54.690
many of them in the hijas, there is one

188
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.440
big one, and that's the future Medina. And where

189
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.590
the prophet Muhammad is going to establish his state.

190
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.640
Um, BUT this is not territory that is friendly

191
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.099
to state formation. Which is why society is tribal.

192
00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:16.200
Um, IN other words, there are no strong ruling

193
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.479
authorities. There are these tribes which have messy relationships

194
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:24.450
with each other, and there are messy relationships within

195
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.599
the tribes. You know, one clan within a tribe

196
00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:31.159
may well go to war with another clan, and

197
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:37.849
so forth, and procedures for dispute resolution. Uh, ARE

198
00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:41.530
not very effective. If you and I have a

199
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.530
dispute, we can only go before a judge if

200
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.039
we both agree to make that guy the judge,

201
00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:51.530
and that doesn't always happen. So you have a

202
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.179
lot of violence coming into dispute resolution. So this

203
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:58.650
is a society. Yeah, let me sort of end

204
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:05.840
by saying, That Virtually every adult male possesses arms

205
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.130
and knows how to use them. Um, THIS is

206
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.450
not a society in which we have An army

207
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.320
on the one hand with the weapons and on

208
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.570
the other hand, the civilian population. It's not like

209
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.260
that. Every man is potentially a warrior. Mhm.

210
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.859
And was the lifestyle of this society shaped by

211
00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:31.140
the surrounding environment in any way? And if so,

212
00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:31.770
how?

213
00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:36.210
Yeah, I think in, in at least two ways.

214
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.890
One, we've already mentioned, and that is that um

215
00:13:39.169 --> 00:13:44.640
poverty of resources sort of places severe limits on

216
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.210
the kind of development you can have in Arabia.

217
00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:53.570
The other is that Arabia is mostly open desert.

218
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.169
And it's not like, you know, somewhere very mountainous,

219
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.130
like the Caucasus, where people live in valleys, separated

220
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.969
from each other by enormous mountains. And Arabia is

221
00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:11.679
very much open and to nomads who know how

222
00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:15.719
to travel in Arabia and can easily move around.

223
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.320
And that I think makes for a certain cultural

224
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.000
homogenization of Arabia. Um, AND if we leave out

225
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.239
the far south, it seems that uh in late

226
00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:32.349
antiquity. There is one people, the Arabs, they speak

227
00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:36.429
one language, Arabic. Uh, THEY have, uh, you know,

228
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.979
if you look at the personal names of Arabs

229
00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:43.679
that we have records of from that period. And

230
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.510
you have names that appear all over the peninsula.

231
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.109
Uh, IN the same way, there seems to be

232
00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:54.080
a poetic culture. Which, you know, sort of pervades

233
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.799
the whole peninsula. It's kind of understood in every

234
00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:00.520
part of the peninsula. So I think in that

235
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.989
openness of the Arabian Desert is also an important

236
00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:06.780
environmental factor. Mhm.

237
00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:10.900
But we've been talking mostly about the nomadic peoples

238
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.380
here. What about states? Were there also states in

239
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.619
the Arabian interior or not?

240
00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:21.989
Right. Well, first of all, I mean, the imperial

241
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:26.750
presence is marginal, literally marginal, um, you know, there's

242
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.650
a bit of it on the east coast with

243
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.229
the Persians, and you have client states, clients to

244
00:15:33.229 --> 00:15:37.549
the empires in the far north, but um no

245
00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:42.390
serious attempt even at imperial rule in the deep

246
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:48.080
interior of the peninsula. Um If we go to

247
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.349
uh to the south, we have a long tradition

248
00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:57.799
of state formation in Yemen because Yemen has better

249
00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:02.109
agricultural resources, although the mountains are not very favorable

250
00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:06.530
to states. Uh, AND in late antiquity, there's a

251
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.059
Himurite kingdom there, the Himurites being an Arabian people

252
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.929
somewhat distinct from the Arabs. But, uh, that state

253
00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.419
comes to an end in the 6th century. And

254
00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:22.059
by the time of Muhammad, when Muhammed is active.

255
00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:29.929
There is no state in Yemen. Um, DEEP in

256
00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:33.570
the interior, yeah, we have um memories of a

257
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.969
state known as the Kingdom of Kinda. Um, IT

258
00:16:37.969 --> 00:16:40.409
seems to have been a rather sort of flimsy

259
00:16:40.409 --> 00:16:44.619
state, uh, that lasted just a few generations and

260
00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:48.130
had very serious ups and downs, uh, and not

261
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.080
a solid state based on a good agricultural basis.

262
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.580
There wasn't one. But I mean, whatever the importance

263
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.369
of that state at the time, it had disappeared

264
00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:02.450
before Mohammed appeared. Mhm.

265
00:17:02.849 --> 00:17:06.650
And what was the relationship between the Arabs and

266
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.209
the two empires, the Byzantine Empire and the Persian

267
00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:11.118
Empire?

268
00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:15.189
Right I think from the point of view of

269
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:18.430
the empires, there are two essential things about the

270
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.800
Arabs. One is that if you leave them alone,

271
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.810
what they will do is to raid your agricultural

272
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.849
territory. And this will disrupt agriculture. There'll be killing

273
00:17:31.849 --> 00:17:36.219
and flight of, of peasants, and it's eroding your

274
00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:40.260
agricultural base, so you don't want it. So you

275
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.420
want to find a way to stop the Arabs

276
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.000
raiding your territory. And it's difficult because um the

277
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.310
obvious thing to do when the Arabs raid is

278
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.849
to send troops to confront them, but by the

279
00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:54.729
time the troops arrived, the Arabs are back in

280
00:17:54.729 --> 00:17:57.599
the desert. Uh, TRACKING them down in the desert

281
00:17:57.599 --> 00:18:01.660
is pretty awful. Um, SO it's not an easy

282
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.890
problem to solve that raiding problem. The other thing

283
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.140
is that, um, you know, since you're, you keep

284
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.849
fighting wars with the other empire. You can use

285
00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:14.770
the Arabs as soldiers. You can pay them to

286
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.650
fight for you. And the way in which those

287
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.439
two problems are solved together to an extent by

288
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:26.359
the empires in late antiquity is by what I

289
00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:30.000
mentioned before, client states. You have an Arab state.

290
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:34.680
That is subsidized and has good relations with one

291
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.650
of the empires. In the case of um the

292
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.819
Byzantine Empire is the Hassanids. In the case of

293
00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:44.719
the Persian Empire is the Lahmids. And those states

294
00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:47.709
will do two things for you. If it works

295
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:52.020
out. One is to keep order among the tribes

296
00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:55.189
and the subsidies to give them help to give

297
00:18:55.189 --> 00:18:58.430
them clout with the neighboring tribes. And the other

298
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.030
thing is to recruit from the tribes for your

299
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.670
army when you're fighting a war with the other

300
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.949
empire. So that's basically how it looks from the

301
00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:10.349
point of view of the empires, from the point

302
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:13.859
of view of the Arabs, they're well aware that

303
00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:16.790
um these empires out there are much bigger and

304
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.390
much more powerful than any Arab tribe can hope

305
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.069
to be. And there's a point at which this

306
00:19:24.069 --> 00:19:29.209
is anticipating the Prophet Muhammad mounts an expedition that

307
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:33.030
is said to be directed against the Byzantines, and

308
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.160
there are a lot of Arabs. In Medina, who

309
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.709
are very skeptical of this expedition, and they say,

310
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:44.270
no, there's a big difference between Arabs fighting Arabs

311
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:49.160
and Arabs fighting the Byzantines. They're really militarily serious

312
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.839
people. Our Arab fighting among ourselves is just kind

313
00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:56.680
of playing around. So there's a sense that those

314
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.160
empires are big and powerful out there.

315
00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:03.410
So let me ask you now, in terms of

316
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:08.489
religion, what characterized the Arabs? Uh WERE there in

317
00:20:08.489 --> 00:20:11.920
Arabia more generally, more broadly, not just the Arabian

318
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.609
interior. Were there any monotheistic religions back then?

319
00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:22.770
Right, and certainly there were. Um, LET'S start by

320
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.890
just saying that um the baseline in Arabia is

321
00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:31.579
paganism, polytheism. OK. And you know, we have Arab

322
00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.780
gods that are attested in antiquity, and we're still

323
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.020
known at the time of the rise of Islam.

324
00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:42.270
But of course, and of course back in antiquity,

325
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.719
you know, when the Roman Empire was pagan, being

326
00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:50.650
pagan was the norm. In late antiquity, that's no

327
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.400
longer the case. Um, AND just as there's a

328
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.479
sense among the Arabs that um those empires are

329
00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:02.599
much bigger and more powerful than us, there's a

330
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:06.869
sense that um maybe their idea of right religion

331
00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:10.520
is a better idea than what, what we traditionally

332
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.750
have. There is some sense of that. And that

333
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:20.560
correlates partly with A monotheist presence in Arabia, a

334
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.660
presence of Jews. We have Jewish communities sort of

335
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.380
down Western Arabia as far as the Yemen and

336
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.150
in Yemen that Himirite kingdom. Well, some people say

337
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.420
it converts to Judaism. Some people say it develops

338
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.670
a monotheism on the model of Judaism, and I

339
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.709
don't have a position on that. But then certainly

340
00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:46.969
there's very strong Jewish monotheist influence in late antique

341
00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:52.229
Yemen and further north as well. Um, BUT I'm

342
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:54.869
predominantly on the edges of Arabia, what you have

343
00:21:54.869 --> 00:22:00.630
is Christianity. And the Arabs are obviously aware of

344
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:07.500
that. Um Now, I think something crucial about Arabia.

345
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.599
Because it's, it's out, it's beyond the reach of

346
00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:17.550
the empires. The empires in late antiquity impose a

347
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.550
kind of religious discipline within their territories, and the

348
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.589
Byzantine Empire wants you to be a Christian. It

349
00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:27.989
would like everybody to be Christian on the same

350
00:22:27.989 --> 00:22:31.069
page. The Persian Empire would like you to be

351
00:22:31.069 --> 00:22:36.900
Zoroastrian. And there there is an intermittent persecution of

352
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.900
Christians. But Arabia is sort of completely open free

353
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.770
territory. Um, IS territory in which, I mean, as

354
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.969
one Meccan puts it in the time of the

355
00:22:48.969 --> 00:22:52.890
prophet, um, why shouldn't a man choose a religion

356
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.410
for himself? Why should any state be telling me

357
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.810
what religion I should follow? It's up to me.

358
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.900
Uh, AND in that, um, within that kind of

359
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:11.319
religiously free territory, you get the development of People

360
00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:15.040
and the Arabic term is Hanif, they're Haneef. And

361
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.000
what it seems to mean is that they're kind

362
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.599
of genetic monotheists, but they're not actually enrolled in

363
00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:26.239
any existing monotheist religion. They're not Jews, they're not

364
00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:30.449
Christians. There's some kind of intimation here of a

365
00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:35.670
third way. And it probably isn't particularly important in

366
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.900
terms of Arabia before Islam. But I think it's

367
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.099
very important for the emergence of Islam. This idea

368
00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:46.290
that there could be a third way that's neither

369
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.410
Judaism nor Christianity has some kind of presence in

370
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.050
Arabia.

371
00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:55.689
And so perhaps picking up on that last point

372
00:23:55.689 --> 00:23:59.609
you made there, how did these societies in Arabia

373
00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:03.140
move from paganism to what would become a new

374
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.089
monotheistic religion, namely Islam?

375
00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:10.400
Right. Now, first here, let me just slip something

376
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.640
in that there is at present a very interesting

377
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.689
controversy. About how far on the eve of the

378
00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:22.969
rise of Islam, Arabia was still solidly pagan or

379
00:24:22.969 --> 00:24:26.489
largely pagan. And how far paganism was a thing

380
00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:30.810
of the past that some kind of monotheist sentiment

381
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:35.689
was much more predominant and I, you know, the

382
00:24:35.689 --> 00:24:37.810
evidence is very contradictory and I don't have a

383
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.800
position on this, but um there is that question,

384
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.459
we should just note that. Now, in terms of

385
00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:49.750
um how conversion takes place in Arabia. Um, I

386
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.910
mean, unfortunately, we don't have videos of, of it

387
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.280
happening. But put it this way, um. I think

388
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:03.079
one crucial thing is the worldly success of the

389
00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:06.520
state that Muhammed established. That is to say that

390
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.719
it has a strong grip on Medina by the,

391
00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:11.630
by the time of the death of the prophet,

392
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.800
a strong grip on Medina itself, and a fairly

393
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.069
good grip on the hijabs, and the region around

394
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:24.000
it, and some kind of presence that's hard to

395
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.119
evaluate over the rest of Arabia. So that um

396
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.369
among the Arab tribes of Arabia, there's a sense

397
00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:35.569
that um You know, these Muslims are doing well

398
00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:39.140
for themselves, they must be getting something right. Maybe

399
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.540
we should think about it. And the reaction you

400
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:47.420
get. Well, one reaction is you get lesser imitators

401
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.420
of Muhammad. People who set up as prophets, and

402
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.000
they don't succeed because the Muslims are able to

403
00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:58.619
repress them. Um, BUT it shows you that sense

404
00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:02.939
that, hey, monotheism, you know, does something for you.

405
00:26:03.969 --> 00:26:10.300
Um The other thing that's going on is just

406
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:16.050
um individuals here and there converting or tribes here

407
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:19.069
and there converting. A common pattern is you have

408
00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:23.930
a tribe with an internal feud. One group then

409
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:27.859
picks Islam, they become Muslims, and they can then

410
00:26:27.859 --> 00:26:30.739
hope for help from the Muslim state. And the

411
00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:33.890
other group digs its feet in and doesn't want

412
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.209
to convert. And in terms of um sort of

413
00:26:37.209 --> 00:26:41.489
snapshots of conversion, and there's one story about um

414
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.650
two pagans who are transporting their idol on their

415
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.890
camel. And bad luck, the idol falls off the

416
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.969
camel and hits the ground and breaks into two

417
00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:57.969
pieces. And then these two Arabs say, Well, if

418
00:26:57.969 --> 00:27:00.969
this idol couldn't help itself from falling off the

419
00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:03.780
camel and breaking into two pieces, is it really

420
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.989
much good? And they become Muslims. Uh, THERE'S another

421
00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:13.060
story about him. A tribe that decides to convert

422
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.709
or a clan that decides to convert. And then

423
00:27:16.709 --> 00:27:19.270
they have to, they're supposed to do the Muslim

424
00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.829
prayer, and they haven't much idea how to do

425
00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:26.589
it. But there's a kid who, um, he would

426
00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.189
talk to traveling Muslims that were passing through the

427
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:32.859
traveling, the tribe's territory, and he'd learned a bit

428
00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:35.839
of Quran. So they made this kid their prayer

429
00:27:35.839 --> 00:27:39.750
leader, but uh the, the kid was came from

430
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.500
a very poor family. Uh, HE'S wearing a shirt

431
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.380
that's too short. The result is when he prostrates

432
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.140
himself in prayer, his bottom appears to the tribesmen

433
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.140
behind him, and the woman shouts out, aren't you

434
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.500
going to do something about the kid's bottom? And

435
00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.339
they then get him a new shirt, which he's

436
00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:02.619
very happy about. Now, no doubt there are lots

437
00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:04.790
of things like that that are happening all over

438
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.939
the place, and we don't really get to see

439
00:28:06.939 --> 00:28:09.689
it. But uh what we can say for sure

440
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.510
is that Arab paganism disappears very rapidly in the

441
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.770
early Islamic period.

442
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.939
So let's talk a little bit about Muhammad. Who

443
00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:23.319
who was Mohammed really?

444
00:28:24.609 --> 00:28:28.119
Right. Well, everybody agrees that he was a merchant.

445
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.089
And I think that's probably important because uh merchants

446
00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:35.969
and they get to see different parts of the

447
00:28:35.969 --> 00:28:42.280
world, different societies. Uh, AND you know, religious entrepreneurship

448
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.229
can go quite well with uh mercantile entrepreneurship. Then

449
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:52.170
the Islamic sources tell us exactly locate him exactly

450
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.260
within the tribe of Quraish, the tribe that dominates

451
00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:02.859
Mecca. Um, AND it's Mecca where his mission begins

452
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.910
among this, this tribe of Qosh.

453
00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:12.119
So, and why was it that he did not

454
00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:16.920
simply adopt one of the other monotheistic religions present

455
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.540
in Arabia back in the early 7th century? I

456
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.489
mean, why was it that he created a new

457
00:29:23.489 --> 00:29:24.060
religion?

458
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.829
Right. And I quite honestly don't know the answer,

459
00:29:29.329 --> 00:29:31.560
but I think I could mention maybe a couple

460
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.410
of things that at least help to make it

461
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:41.229
possible or more likely. Um Right, and one would

462
00:29:41.229 --> 00:29:44.869
be the previous existence of this kind of sense

463
00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:49.729
of a third way. The Haneefs in Arabia. So

464
00:29:49.729 --> 00:29:52.969
that it's not a kind of foregone conclusion that

465
00:29:52.969 --> 00:29:56.290
either you're a pagan. Or you're a Jew or

466
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:03.410
a Christian. Um, THERE is some some daylight in

467
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.089
between those. That's one thing. The other thing is

468
00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:11.750
that since I mean, if you look at a

469
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:18.030
conversion story like the, the French. In France or

470
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:23.849
the English. Um, WHAT happens there, the crucial figure

471
00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:29.359
is A king And the king kind of listens

472
00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:32.329
to what the missionaries have to say and decides

473
00:30:32.329 --> 00:30:35.239
that this could be a good idea. And then

474
00:30:35.239 --> 00:30:38.479
rather carefully, he engineers the conversion of his people.

475
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.589
Now, in stateless Arabia, we don't have kings like

476
00:30:42.589 --> 00:30:45.869
that who will engineer the conversion of their people.

477
00:30:46.229 --> 00:30:48.290
And that I think makes it all the harder

478
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:54.900
to uh carry out mass conversion. And in that

479
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.339
context, I think it may be important that Muhammad

480
00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:02.920
has something to offer on the doctrinal level. That

481
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.430
is, his message is. You Arabs You're terrible pagans,

482
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.199
but you should know that you descend from Abraham.

483
00:31:13.989 --> 00:31:18.650
Through his son Ishmael. Now, Abraham, everybody knows, was

484
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.800
a monotheist. And obviously he brought up his sons

485
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.270
to be monotheists. And so originally the ancestor of

486
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.329
the Arabs and for some generations no doubt his

487
00:31:30.329 --> 00:31:35.239
descendants, they must have been monotheists. So this paganism

488
00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:39.280
is something intrusive. It's not your real religion. Your

489
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.239
real religion is monotheism that you inherited from your

490
00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:47.660
ancestor Abraham. So I'm not telling you to adopt

491
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.290
some foreign religion from out there. I'm telling you

492
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.619
to go back to your very own religion. This

493
00:31:54.619 --> 00:31:59.170
Islam is your religion from Abraham. So there's something

494
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.319
there that in terms of appeal to the Arabs,

495
00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.040
I think has a definite value.

496
00:32:06.589 --> 00:32:11.000
So you mentioned Abraham there. What was the link

497
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.290
or how important was the link between the monotheistic

498
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.439
message of Muhammed and Moses and Jesus?

499
00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.619
Right, I think they're also very important in that

500
00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:27.219
um if you're going to adopt monotheism, they're very

501
00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:30.579
clearly the key figures in the story, they're founding

502
00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:36.069
figures. And I think I mean the process by

503
00:32:36.069 --> 00:32:41.119
which Mohammad comes to see himself. As kind of

504
00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:46.810
3rd in that line, Moses, Jesus, Mohammad. Um That

505
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.119
is, so to speak, what marks. The emergence of

506
00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:54.560
Islam as a new and different religion. From what

507
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.390
went before.

508
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.890
So now a question that relates to something we've

509
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.489
already talked about, namely how scarce were the resources

510
00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:09.239
in Arabia back then and how hard, how hard

511
00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:12.089
it was to form a state. So how was

512
00:33:12.089 --> 00:33:15.500
it that Mohammed was able to found a monotheistic

513
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.930
polity in such a region?

514
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.109
Yeah, it's a very good question. Um And I

515
00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:27.130
think there are Uh maybe two parts to the

516
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:32.500
answer. Uh, WHAT is that um You know, if

517
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.939
we go by the tradition and I don't see

518
00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:37.939
a reason to doubt it, um, he didn't start

519
00:33:37.939 --> 00:33:41.699
with the ambition of founding a state. Uh, THE

520
00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:45.739
foundation of the state was an incidental byproduct of

521
00:33:45.739 --> 00:33:48.520
the fact that he had to find and his

522
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.459
followers were being persecuted. He needed to find security

523
00:33:51.459 --> 00:33:57.979
for them. Um So there's something very chancy about

524
00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:00.739
the establishment of that state. Why is it all

525
00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:04.699
possible? Well, the person who thought most deeply about

526
00:34:04.699 --> 00:34:08.510
this, I think was even Khaldoun. Back in the

527
00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:14.179
in the Middle Ages, and what Ihadoon said, and

528
00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.219
I don't have anything better to say really than

529
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:22.010
what Ihadoon said. He said that um Arab tribesmen.

530
00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:26.250
I mean they are very refractory people. They don't

531
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.978
want to be told what to do, they don't

532
00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:31.270
want to be pushed around. Uh, IT'S very hard

533
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.750
to be a king in Arabia. Uh, YOU know,

534
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.929
the, the Arab tribesmen don't accept it. So they

535
00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:43.989
have this prickly pride. But if somebody comes and

536
00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:47.070
claims authority, not as a king but as a

537
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:51.059
prophet. This enables him to do an end run

538
00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:55.089
around this prickly pride of the Arab tribesmen. Uh,

539
00:34:55.138 --> 00:34:56.938
THEY will submit to that in a way in

540
00:34:56.938 --> 00:35:01.360
which they will not submit to kingly authority. And

541
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.840
it seems to be the case, and I don't

542
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.719
know exactly why it's the case, but it does

543
00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:09.879
seem to be the case. And what makes it

544
00:35:09.879 --> 00:35:12.120
seem to be the case is not just, you

545
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.760
know, the story of Muhammed, but the fact that

546
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.110
later in Islamic history, you have people, they religious

547
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:23.290
leaders who go to tribes. And managed to mobilize

548
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.010
tribes who previously had no kings or anything like

549
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:32.729
that. Somehow this religious religious authority works with the

550
00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:33.570
Arab tribes.

551
00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:38.120
So let me ask you about the Quran now.

552
00:35:38.239 --> 00:35:41.810
How was it written and when was it written?

553
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.479
Right. Well, of course, if we take the Muslim

554
00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:50.459
answer to that question, it's always been written. Uh,

555
00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:53.959
IT'S up in heaven on a tablet inscribed on

556
00:35:53.959 --> 00:35:57.219
a tablet. So I mean, the Quran is very

557
00:35:57.219 --> 00:36:00.219
much a scripture, seen as a scripture from the

558
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:04.520
start. Um And I think we can now, in

559
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.320
the light of discoveries made in the last few

560
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.560
decades, we can say pretty definitely that from the

561
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.639
mid, the middle of the 7th century, the Quran

562
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:17.320
is written here on Earth too, and it's in

563
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.120
the form of a codex. It's a book. And

564
00:36:21.469 --> 00:36:24.949
what is hard to figure out is exactly what's

565
00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:29.070
happening in between, because in the sources give you

566
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:36.360
contradictory. Uh, INCOMPATIBLE indications, um. On the one hand,

567
00:36:36.449 --> 00:36:40.610
they talk about Mohammed having scribes, who would write

568
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.050
down the revelations more or less as they came

569
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:49.229
down, so that um The oral, the, the, the

570
00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:52.790
revelation is oral only from the moment it comes

571
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.510
from Gabriel to Mohammad to when Muhammad uh enunciates

572
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.489
it to his scribes. Uh, BUT on the other

573
00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:03.489
hand, we have accounts of them, when the Quran

574
00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:06.850
is collected into a single volume, that there are

575
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.250
certain verses that you can only get the text

576
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.290
of if you go to so and so, he's

577
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.449
the one who remembers it. Uh, OR in, there's

578
00:37:16.449 --> 00:37:19.639
a battle soon after the death of the prophet,

579
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.129
uh, in fact, against one of the, those sort

580
00:37:23.129 --> 00:37:28.899
of imitate rival prophets in Arabia, and many Muslims

581
00:37:28.899 --> 00:37:31.169
are killed in that battle, though they win it.

582
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.090
Um, AND that includes many Muslims who knew the

583
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.989
Quran by heart. So back in Medina, there's a

584
00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:41.790
kind of a moment of panic that if these

585
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.860
people get killed, we won't remember the Qoran anymore.

586
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.709
So we better write it down. So we have

587
00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:52.760
these contradictory indications, and you have to piece together

588
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.129
whatever you think is the most plausible story.

589
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.610
So this is perhaps a good point to introduce

590
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:04.719
this question. In Islam, how does religion relate to

591
00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:05.280
the state?

592
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:13.129
Right. Um. Yeah, first of all, um, I mean,

593
00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:16.899
let's think away any kind of modern secularism. That's

594
00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:20.300
not how pre-modern states worked. I, I think you

595
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.169
can say that across the board, just about any

596
00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:27.899
pre-modern state is hand in glove with religion in

597
00:38:27.899 --> 00:38:30.520
some way or other. And what I would do

598
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:37.489
here is distinguish two ways. Um One Well, there's

599
00:38:37.489 --> 00:38:41.969
a saying that the Muslims inherited from the pre-Islamic

600
00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:46.889
Persians that says that religion and state are twins.

601
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.310
So in other words, they're very closely connected, but

602
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:56.530
they're two separate things. And I think that's the

603
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.689
normal situation in the pre-modern world, that religion and

604
00:39:00.689 --> 00:39:04.610
state are distinguishable, but closely related. So then you

605
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.699
take the Byzantine Empire, we have an emperor. That's

606
00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:12.389
the state, and we have a patriarch, that's religion.

607
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.790
Two figures, not one. I think what's different about

608
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:23.110
Islam is that Well, first of all, originally, back

609
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.790
in the time of the Prophet Muhammad, we have

610
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.949
only one figure. Muhammad is so to speak, both

611
00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:34.129
emperor and patriarch. In his role as prophet, he

612
00:39:34.129 --> 00:39:38.409
exercises both political and religious authority. So there's a

613
00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:41.489
complete fusion. They're not twins. They're the same thing.

614
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:48.500
Um And this is perpetuated in this after the

615
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.979
Muhammad's death in the sense that his successors. And

616
00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:57.310
they're called caliphs. Now that's the Arabic Khalifa. And

617
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.590
the Khalifa is somebody who stands in for you.

618
00:40:01.959 --> 00:40:05.459
And it can be, you can, you can be

619
00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:09.409
alive and he's your representative, or you can be

620
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.830
dead and he's your successor. And the caliphs are

621
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:19.949
conceived as Khalifas in both those ways. In in

622
00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:23.030
one telling, they're the successors of the prophet and

623
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:27.469
the other telling they're the deputies of God. But

624
00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:33.229
either way, this is an office that fuses religious

625
00:40:33.229 --> 00:40:37.590
authority with political authority, not as much religious authority

626
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.110
as in the time of the prophet, obviously, but

627
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:44.800
still real religious authority. And to the extent that

628
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:49.870
that system has Continued in Islamic history, there'll be

629
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.449
a lot of qualifications there. But it, it represents

630
00:40:54.449 --> 00:40:56.280
the kind of ideal at the heart of the

631
00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.830
religion. So that it never entirely goes away. It's

632
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.830
still there to be revived in the 20th century,

633
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.149
the 21st century.

634
00:41:08.489 --> 00:41:12.100
So I have just a few more questions now

635
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.419
focusing on the state that Mohammed founded. So what

636
00:41:17.419 --> 00:41:19.770
characterized this state?

637
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.290
Right. I think first what we've just been talking

638
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:33.669
about this unique authority of Muhammad as prophet. And

639
00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:38.330
secondly, the other thing would be The absence of

640
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:44.310
any. Serious institutional structure that you might look for

641
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.969
in a state. And states usually have A standing

642
00:41:48.969 --> 00:41:53.290
army. You know, they may recruit lots more soldiers

643
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.389
when they have a war to fight, but there

644
00:41:55.389 --> 00:41:58.790
is a permanent army with a permanent commander who

645
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.149
may be replaced from time to time, but it's

646
00:42:01.149 --> 00:42:05.110
an ongoing office. There's nothing like that in Muhammad's

647
00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:09.070
state. And let's say that Muhammad wants to mount

648
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.939
a military expedition to go and confront a certain

649
00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:16.889
tribe out in the desert. What you will do

650
00:42:16.889 --> 00:42:22.000
is you'll get men together. Um, THEY'RE the expedition.

651
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.360
He'll appoint one of them commander. They'll go, they

652
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.370
accomplish their mission, they'll come back. And they're, so

653
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.840
to speak, demobilized. They go back into the society,

654
00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:36.639
and the men are no longer, so to speak,

655
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.370
soldiers, so to speak, and the commander is no

656
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.530
longer a commander. So it's very ad hoc. Uh,

657
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.850
LIKEWISE, you know, you have a state, you want

658
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:51.060
to know about the bureaucracy. Well, there isn't anything

659
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.939
like a formal bureaucracy here. Muhammed has these people

660
00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:57.979
who can write, so if he has a revelation,

661
00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:00.179
they can write it down. If he wants to

662
00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:03.169
write a letter to somebody, they can write it

663
00:43:03.169 --> 00:43:07.060
for him, but there's nothing like a formal bureaucracy.

664
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:15.100
Um And then finally, Yeah, there's no formal institutions

665
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:21.459
of consultation and deliberation. There isn't an assembly. Or

666
00:43:21.459 --> 00:43:24.080
a council like you have, say, in an ancient

667
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.570
Greek democracy. Now if Muhammad wants advice and from

668
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.649
time to time, he wants advice, you will get

669
00:43:31.649 --> 00:43:35.969
people together and ask them for advice, but there's

670
00:43:35.969 --> 00:43:40.419
no formal institution. It's very unlike, it's unlike, for

671
00:43:40.419 --> 00:43:45.020
example, if we zoom out to 12th century North

672
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.189
African history, we have this figure even too marked.

673
00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:51.929
And he again is a religious figure who is

674
00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:56.590
recruiting the tribes by virtue of religious authority. But

675
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.330
I mean he has a council of 10, a

676
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.139
formal council of 10 with 10 known members. Nothing

677
00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:04.649
like that in Mohammed's case.

678
00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:10.929
And how much was Mohammed able to expand his

679
00:44:10.929 --> 00:44:14.530
state during his lifetime? How did the Muslim world

680
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.879
look like after his death?

681
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.689
Right. And I think one could say roughly. That

682
00:44:24.469 --> 00:44:29.689
There's a core area, the hijabs around Medina. And

683
00:44:29.689 --> 00:44:34.060
in that area, he can give orders. There's then

684
00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.179
a much wider periphery. This is more or less

685
00:44:37.179 --> 00:44:41.850
the rest of Arabia, where he certainly has considerable

686
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.340
influence. Um, BUT it's hard to pin down just

687
00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:51.739
how strong that influence is. And I, I think

688
00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:55.989
11 certainly would have to say that um You

689
00:44:55.989 --> 00:44:59.830
know, I mean, this is a completely unprecedented situation

690
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:06.020
in Arabia and it's probably very inherently unstable. You

691
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:09.919
know that um. The prospect of it surviving Muhammad's

692
00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:14.510
death is not very high. A priori. Actually, we

693
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.219
know it did, but um that's another question.

694
00:45:19.399 --> 00:45:22.820
So, uh, just before we go, let me ask

695
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.780
you one last question, because in our, in the

696
00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.739
second part of this conversation, which we will record

697
00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:33.290
later, uh, we're going to start by talking about

698
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.040
the caliphate from the 7th to the 9th to

699
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.500
the 9th century. What is the caliphate?

700
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:45.020
Right. So we have this Arabic term, Khalifa. It's,

701
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:50.830
it's definitely attested in pre-Islamic Arabia. And You know,

702
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:55.179
there's a ruler of the Yemen who appointed a

703
00:45:55.949 --> 00:46:00.469
deputy, um, and we have the, you know, the

704
00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:04.149
inscription recording this has the same root as the

705
00:46:04.149 --> 00:46:08.590
word Khalifa. It's definitely an idea that's around. Um,

706
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.949
IN, in Muhammad's time, let's say Muhammad. He wants

707
00:46:14.949 --> 00:46:17.830
to send an expedition, but this time he wants

708
00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:21.870
to lead it himself. So what happens in Medina

709
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.899
while he's away, Mohammed appoints a deputy in Medina,

710
00:46:25.909 --> 00:46:30.679
and that's Khalifa again. So then when Muhammad dies,

711
00:46:30.969 --> 00:46:35.250
the question is what happens next and what happens

712
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.449
is the, that the community appoints a Khalifa, and

713
00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:41.570
that is the caliph Abu Bakr.

714
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.919
Right. So, Doctor Cook, uh, the book is again

715
00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:51.159
a history of the Muslim world from its origins

716
00:46:51.159 --> 00:46:54.360
to the dawn of modernity. As I said, we're

717
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.479
going to record the second talk to cover the

718
00:46:57.479 --> 00:46:59.919
rest of the book, the rest of the questions

719
00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:02.919
I prepared. So thank you so much for taking
