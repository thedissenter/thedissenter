00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.679
Center. I'm your host, Ricard Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.409
joined by Doctor Gerald Mosley. He is a former

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.630
California supervising deputy attorney general and he has been

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.969
researching writing and speaking on the topics of law

6
00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:20.360
and sex work. And today we are focusing on

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.059
his book, sex workers and their clients in their

8
00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.219
own words. So Dr Mosley, welcome to the show.

9
00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:28.549
It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.329
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

11
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.479
So let me first ask you before we get

12
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.159
into the actual content of your book, what made

13
00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:42.799
you interested in studying such a controversial and even

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.599
stigmatized topic as the experiences of sex clients and

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.560
their of sex workers? Sorry. And their clients, why

16
00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.209
do you think it's important to talk about this

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.779
subject? Uh uh INCLUDING their own perspectives?

18
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:07.099
Well, I, I came to this work and from

19
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.190
a purely legal perspective, I was a lawyer all

20
00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:20.769
my professional life. Uh BUT I never worked in

21
00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:26.290
this area, but as a, as a legal intellectual

22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.089
matter, uh it was always of interest to me

23
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:42.699
how laws about sex work can be justified. Uh

24
00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:49.910
AGAINST American laws and constitutional provisions about privacy and

25
00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:55.139
due process. And so I think it's worth mentioning

26
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.150
that, that I am an example of the fact

27
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.069
that you, you don't have to be self interested

28
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.850
as a sex worker yourself in order to find

29
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.960
this interesting and then very concerning, uh you know,

30
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.820
that can happen to anyone who looks at the

31
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.779
matter studies, the matter and who's interested in constitutional

32
00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:32.360
principles and law. And that's what happened to me.

33
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.770
I sort of got into it slowly and began

34
00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.350
to read about it and my concerns grew and

35
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.949
grew. And, uh, when I retired from the Attorney

36
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.509
General's office, I then dedicated myself to researching, uh,

37
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.899
researching this issue and, uh, and interviewing, uh, sex

38
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.740
workers, uh, and clients trying to sort of break

39
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.419
through the stereotypes and to find out what was

40
00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.389
really there. Uh, THOSE people, the people that I

41
00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.309
talked to are people who needed to be talked

42
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.020
to because people don't talk to them. Mhm. Uh,

43
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.229
YEAH. A and we will get in a second

44
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.830
into the ideas that the population that people in

45
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.850
general have about sex workers. But let me just

46
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.149
ask you in the context of your book, what

47
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.190
counts as a sex worker? And do you focus

48
00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.380
on specific kinds of sex workers or are you

49
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.990
giving voice to sex workers in general?

50
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.080
Well, uh, setting aside my book for one sec,

51
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.419
OK. Phrase sex work is a very loosely defined

52
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:59.580
phrase and it can cover any kind of sexual

53
00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:08.520
service, whether it is um, only fans work phone

54
00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:17.190
sex, uh uh pornography, uh stripping and then what

55
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.010
we call prostitution, which is illegal in my country.

56
00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.760
And that's the reason why in my own mind,

57
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:36.429
there's this sharp distinction between illegal physical sexual contact

58
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.410
for money and all kinds of other sex work.

59
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.660
But I wanted to start off by saying the

60
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.079
phrase sex work itself is very expansive. It's very

61
00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.260
expensive now that actually poses a bit of a

62
00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:51.480
problem for someone like me who's a lawyer. Because

63
00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:55.769
what I'm interested in, it's what's legal and what's

64
00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.709
illegal, that's not the same distinction as between sex

65
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.880
work and non sex work. So, in my book

66
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.130
and I put it in a footnote somewhere and

67
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.890
whenever I write, I have to make this clear,

68
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.730
I will use sex work here to mean the

69
00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:19.059
kinds of sexual services that are illegal in the

70
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.720
United States and that is physical sexual contact for

71
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.589
money. So that's how I use the phrase. Uh

72
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:31.239
AND when you and I are talking, I will

73
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.269
probably use the phrase uh uh without thinking to

74
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.839
refer to illegal sexual services. But I just wanted

75
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.720
to make clear that in general out there, the

76
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.959
phrase is much more expansive than that. Mhm.

77
00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.790
And how does the general population tend to think

78
00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.089
about sex workers? What are some of the most

79
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.420
common ideas people have about them?

80
00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:04.660
Well, it it, it is evolving, it is evolving

81
00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:10.329
now, there is what you might call the, the

82
00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.540
old fashioned view, but it's still, uh, there's still

83
00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:17.190
a lot of it out there. So it's not

84
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.529
gone. And it's the, uh, it's the stereotype of

85
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.980
the sex worker that is the prostitute, uh, as,

86
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:35.540
as being just a reprehensible individual on all kinds

87
00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:41.970
of different levels. And they are unclean and unsafe,

88
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:51.970
um, uh, just basically disreputable human beings, you just,

89
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.149
you take the word icky and then you give

90
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.570
it, you give it all kinds of respectable verbiage,

91
00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.369
but that's what it ends up being is just

92
00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:09.000
they're so icky and so a great deal of

93
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.100
stigma is always surrounding sex work. Now I say

94
00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:23.700
it's evolving because, because nowadays in, in the United

95
00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.559
States and I'm, I, I think I can safely

96
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.440
say in most of Europe, at least most of

97
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.480
Western Europe, there is an evolving attitude of, of

98
00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:41.149
seeing the sex worker as a victim rather than

99
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.250
as just a low life that you wanna get

100
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:53.820
away from. And seeing uh the, the um seeing

101
00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:59.950
the sex worker as a victim entails a lot

102
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:08.739
of social, political and legal implications. Uh uh There

103
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.420
is, there is a great deal of, well, I'll

104
00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:20.920
just say attitudes rather than carefully articulated beliefs, attitudes

105
00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:25.750
that essentially sex work is this very, very bad

106
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.010
thing out there whereby men hurt women. And that

107
00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:34.349
is, of course, very, very simplified and people will

108
00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:37.960
have all kinds of, uh, different ways of approaching

109
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:44.150
that. But there is, there is that rudimentary sentiment

110
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:52.609
out there that is, um, sex workers are themselves

111
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:58.539
harmed and clients are do the harming. And it's,

112
00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:03.010
it's very simplistic and it is in, in my

113
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.330
opinion, just as wrong headed as the old fashioned

114
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.799
view. But, but we live at a time where

115
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:15.719
both of those stereotypes are mingling together in the

116
00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:18.010
public. Mhm.

117
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.289
So, let me ask you now and this now

118
00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:24.640
is about you directly about your book. Uh You

119
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.369
contrast the voices of sex workers and their clients

120
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.619
with the claims made by prohibitionists and prohibitionists here,

121
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.770
I guess, can include both, as you mentioned, the

122
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.539
old school kind of way of thinking. I mean,

123
00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:44.250
the more conservative prohibitionists, but also the more f

124
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.130
uh the feminists, the prohibitionist feminists, the more progressive

125
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.429
ones that, that also have arguments against uh sex

126
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.770
work. So, uh but how would you frame the

127
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.289
debate here? What are, what are people debating exactly?

128
00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:10.460
They're not debating one thing? OK. Uh um On

129
00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:18.429
the one hand, you have very practical debates about

130
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.530
harms and many of us try to focus the

131
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:28.590
debate on practical harms, but that is one debate

132
00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:33.239
out there. Um uh YOU know, uh uh uh

133
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:40.039
is uh is sex work conducive to violence is

134
00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:46.419
sex work conducive to health problems. Uh Does health

135
00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:52.210
work? Is it conducive to labor abuse? Those very,

136
00:10:52.239 --> 00:11:00.580
those very practical and empirical Yes. Uh There is

137
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.450
also the debate and, and these are not separated

138
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.049
cleanly. You know, you, if you debate this, you,

139
00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:10.690
you have to expect to find both of them

140
00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:16.349
going on. At the same time, there are abstract,

141
00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:25.190
philosophical or religious beliefs and feelings that are essentially

142
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:32.830
independent of those empirical issues about harms. But the,

143
00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:35.950
and I will just call them philosophical, they're actually

144
00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:41.250
sometimes very, very explicitly religious, sometimes they're more generally

145
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.719
moral. Um But I will just call them philosophical

146
00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:50.729
or the abstract approaches. And, and, and those approaches

147
00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:57.179
just see sex work as demeaning or degrading uh

148
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.880
without attaching an empirical meaning to those, to those

149
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.919
words. They are just uh and it's a very

150
00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:14.700
intense feelings but based on an abstract approach to

151
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:20.299
sex work, it is, it is evil and it

152
00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:24.979
diminishes the person. Uh And so you have those

153
00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:30.020
two strains and if you're arguing like I do

154
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.299
and many people do for decriminalization, you always have

155
00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:36.580
to be prepared to deal with both of them

156
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.630
because they're both out there.

157
00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:42.869
Uh And so uh let me just ask you

158
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.369
about what I mentioned earlier that you in your

159
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.630
book decided to put side by side the arguments

160
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.309
put forth by prohibitionists and the qu and quotations

161
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.590
from sex workers and their clients about their own

162
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.809
lives and experiences. I mean, why did you think

163
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.440
that it was important to structure the book in

164
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.030
that way?

165
00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:12.900
Well, the, the, the one simple reason is because

166
00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:16.520
for many people who are, who are conventionally raised,

167
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:21.539
like I was conservative, conventionally, it's just downright surprising.

168
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.679
You just don't expect so many sex workers to

169
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.539
say these sorts of things and people need to

170
00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:34.650
know it. Now, that's the simple, straightforward answer to

171
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:37.109
your question. Yeah. As a matter of fact, my

172
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:42.570
first, my first thought about doing this book was

173
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.500
to just have two columns and the quotations and

174
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.729
not do anything else, not tell the reader anything,

175
00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:54.179
not even to introduce it, just say, look at

176
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.070
this, you know, look at this and be surprised

177
00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:01.359
and you take it for what it is and

178
00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:03.500
you know, you do with it what you want.

179
00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:06.130
Uh But of course, in the, in the process

180
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.840
of figuring out how to actually structure the bulk

181
00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:11.330
and get it published, you know, I add it

182
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.609
on uh uh the other material. Uh But, but

183
00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:20.200
one reason, uh uh aside from the simple reason,

184
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.489
one reason is like, I, I wanna structure it

185
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.090
that way is it is very difficult to know

186
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:34.640
how to counter what I would call one of

187
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:40.119
the abstract arguments. If someone says that is degrading

188
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.090
and demeaning or that is that, you know, um

189
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:51.289
diminishes your personhood. One of my favorite phrases, how

190
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.809
do you rebut that? I mean, one thing you

191
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.429
can do is to try to, is to try

192
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.760
to play the philosophical game. And in this context,

193
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.780
I think it is a game and, and just

194
00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:08.530
talk about, well, what is personhood and, and, and

195
00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:12.500
what is, what is diminishing and what is there.

196
00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:17.770
And I don't know how far that gets you.

197
00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.510
And so I tried to do something else. I

198
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:30.020
tried to juxtapose the, the abstract, but really rather

199
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:39.099
vicious opposition to sex work with sex workers who

200
00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:44.539
don't respond philosophically. They just talk about the concrete

201
00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:49.510
aspects of their life and that's what they're doing.

202
00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:57.590
And to juxtapose this very, very concrete practical description

203
00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:05.130
of their lives against very very abstract condemnations of

204
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.890
what they do. And then inviting the reader reader

205
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:16.349
to say now, to what extent are these abstract

206
00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:22.130
arguments relevant to the practical reality of this sex

207
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.750
worker? And once you begin to try to connect

208
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.700
the two, then you begin to ask her. So

209
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:34.239
what do these abstract phrases actually mean? Do they

210
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.659
really mean anything or they just out there as

211
00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:44.809
linguistic tools to trigger an emotional response is that

212
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.549
the only function that they have? And so I'm

213
00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:52.390
trying to get at that when I juxtapose them

214
00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:00.690
with practical down to earth descriptions of how sex

215
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.229
workers work. For example, there's a, you know, the

216
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.699
that a lot of the prohibitions talk about how,

217
00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:12.880
how cool and dominating clients are. And there's you

218
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:20.079
like to use the word power, imbalance and dominating

219
00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.449
and then cruel and then you juxtapose that with.

220
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.660
And I was surprised to hear this too. They're

221
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.469
amusing but then they're very, very touching and important

222
00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:36.719
and, and, and one sex worker says, you know,

223
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.150
I got clients who try to, who try to

224
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.250
give me an orgasm and of course, I can't

225
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.780
come all the time. But, but they try so

226
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.439
hard, they deserve a pat on the back. I

227
00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:54.520
mean, you know, and yeah, and, and you know,

228
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.160
another sex worker says, you know, I gotta spend

229
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.359
so much time just convincing my clients that they're

230
00:18:02.369 --> 00:18:08.550
not bad people. It's OK. It's OK. Well, and,

231
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.390
and you know, I those kinds of statements are

232
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.589
surprises to people who were raised in the world

233
00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.449
that I was. People who are raised in that

234
00:18:21.459 --> 00:18:25.849
network, need to hear those voices and they especially

235
00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:29.420
need to hear those voices when they are, when

236
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.750
they are, when they are asked to listen to

237
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.459
these philosophical debates.

238
00:18:39.469 --> 00:18:43.949
So just to make this point clear, what, what

239
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:47.869
were the main goals that you had in your

240
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.689
mind? Uh What, what goals did you have in

241
00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:55.170
mind when writing this book? Because uh there's, I

242
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.099
guess at least one point that we have to

243
00:18:59.109 --> 00:19:02.050
address here. That is the fact that uh you

244
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.380
interviewed sex workers and some clients, you put their,

245
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.680
uh their, their experiences, their, their statements in the

246
00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:17.359
book. But it's a limited number of sex workers

247
00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:20.270
and a limited number of clients. So someone could

248
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.959
put forth the criticism that we can't generalize from

249
00:19:24.969 --> 00:19:28.280
that number and, and make broader claims about sex

250
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.109
workers in general, for example. But uh were you

251
00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:37.239
simply trying to show people that there are some

252
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.390
sex uh sex workers and some clients out there

253
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.630
that do not experience sex work? The ways that

254
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.989
prohibitionists tend to claim?

255
00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:51.300
Uh Yeah, it, it, for example, you, you, you

256
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:56.969
take, you take the sex worker who says, uh

257
00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:59.760
she, she has to spend a lot of time

258
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.910
making her clients feel good. Uh And, and you

259
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.020
know, uh they're all most pathetic in the way

260
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:13.099
they try to please her. No one suggests that

261
00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:17.079
all sex workers like and I certainly don't suggest

262
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:31.119
what I want to do is refute, universalizing philosophical

263
00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:36.890
pictures of sex work. And that's different than taking

264
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.479
sex workers and generalizing and say, gee see, I've

265
00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:45.069
now discovered what sex workers like. It's always like

266
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:48.079
this. I don't try to do that. And of

267
00:20:48.089 --> 00:20:51.969
course, you know, but it is, it is I

268
00:20:51.979 --> 00:21:00.949
believe effective in confronting universalizing statements about what is

269
00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:10.089
inherent in sex work. If you believe that, that,

270
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:19.250
that dangerous power hungry, dominating clients are inherent in

271
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.969
sex work, then I want to show you all

272
00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:29.599
the people that you have to disbelieve in order

273
00:21:29.609 --> 00:21:34.810
to get to that conclusion. Uh And there are

274
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:37.819
a lot of them and they have different things

275
00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:44.209
to say but, but the, but, but you cannot

276
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:49.300
take from what they say and take seriously a

277
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:57.060
universalizing or essentialist view of what sex work inherently

278
00:21:57.069 --> 00:22:04.890
is, right. Uh You know, people, what, what a

279
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.170
lot of people who think that sex work should

280
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.520
be decriminalized. They do, they, they, they don't want

281
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.119
to tell you what sex work is like. It's

282
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:23.010
some philosophical discovery. Now, there are exceptions. But he

283
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.609
here, I'm generalizing, that's not the point. Uh The

284
00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:35.339
point is, is you cannot rationally come up with

285
00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:42.430
generalizations that justify the typical stereotypes and that justify

286
00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:46.349
the kinds of laws that we have. And you

287
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:50.020
can't do that because the number of people you

288
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:55.359
have to disbelieve just keeps growing. And you know,

289
00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.510
you can start off by saying uh uh that,

290
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.630
that they have some illusion or delusion or mental

291
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.780
problem, but you know, they keep coming and that

292
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.989
retort gets weaker and weaker all the time. So

293
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:20.550
all that process of arguing can be done without

294
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.989
having a systematically rigorous sampling of sex works to

295
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.390
generalize into a uh an overall statement about sex

296
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.630
work with one reason why that's extremely difficult to

297
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.930
do is because it's illegal and you're asking people

298
00:23:38.939 --> 00:23:41.849
to come forward to break the law and then

299
00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:44.530
have some sort of statistical mechanism to make sure

300
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.510
you're getting a representative sample that would be extremely

301
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.050
difficult to do. But there's a lot that can

302
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.060
be done short of that.

303
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.300
And do, do you think that people might also

304
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.619
be missing something if they tend to think to

305
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.300
think that most or even all sex workers are

306
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.140
female and most or all clients are male. I

307
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.540
mean, because there are also male sex workers and

308
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.170
female clients. Do you think that people, if people

309
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.089
have in their minds, this picture of sex workers

310
00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:22.829
always being female and clients always being male, that

311
00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:26.729
they would be missing something about this subject.

312
00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:29.790
Um No, I don't think there's any question that

313
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.000
that's the stereotype and that's what's in people's minds

314
00:24:34.329 --> 00:24:36.650
when they talk about the law and when they

315
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.260
talk about the, their philosophical perspective, they imagine a

316
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:47.760
woman selling and a man buying. Uh And it

317
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.500
is, it, it is, as you say, it's not

318
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:56.150
true that that's always the case, but it is

319
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.390
important to understand, but that's not always the case

320
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.430
because many of the, many of the say, essentialist

321
00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:14.640
arguments and philosophical arguments a so that it's a

322
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.380
woman who is selling and a buyer who is,

323
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.560
who is buying and that women are now being

324
00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:28.000
subjected to a, you know, patriarchal dominance. And that

325
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:33.130
sex work is just another example of our inscription

326
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:38.770
of patriarchal dominance. All that kind of talk assumes

327
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.579
that you're talking about a woman who is providing

328
00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:46.280
sex in a man who is, who is spying

329
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:51.510
it. Uh And one of the things that I

330
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.959
tried, well, I, I didn't try for like I

331
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:59.209
had one conversation with a group of folks and,

332
00:25:59.219 --> 00:26:01.739
and there were a lot of LGBT Q uh

333
00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:07.650
representatives there. And I, you know, I brought up

334
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.479
the suggestion which I still believe in, but it,

335
00:26:11.489 --> 00:26:14.130
it, I couldn't get that ball rolling. So, you

336
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.920
know, why, why doesn't the gay community bring a

337
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:26.729
lawsuit? And, and, and, and in, in most jurisdictions

338
00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:29.920
in the United States, you can bring an as-applied

339
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.119
lawsuit. You can say here is this constitutional principle

340
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.839
or here is this legal principle. And we're not

341
00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:39.380
gonna argue that the law is always wrong. We're

342
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:43.900
gonna argue that as applied to us, it's unconstitutional.

343
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.430
And I say, look, look, you guys, there, there

344
00:26:48.439 --> 00:26:50.819
are, there are a lot of straight and gay

345
00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:55.109
men who sell sex. Why don't you bring a

346
00:26:55.119 --> 00:27:02.050
lawsuit as applied and say the law against prostitution

347
00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:07.089
is unconstitutional as applied to me and then force

348
00:27:07.099 --> 00:27:10.060
the other side to come up with all the

349
00:27:10.069 --> 00:27:14.040
arguments about why sex work is supposed to harm

350
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.170
you. I would, I would be delighted to see

351
00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.750
a lawsuit like that. Uh But there are, well,

352
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.979
there's always economic reasons and there may be political

353
00:27:24.989 --> 00:27:27.839
reasons when that hasn't been done. It's hard to

354
00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:31.400
do because you have to get a representative client.

355
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.640
And these are, this is illegal behavior and it's

356
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:40.979
stigmatized behavior. But I, I mentioned that just because

357
00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:44.900
I want to emphasize the fact that so much

358
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:50.329
of the argument that goes on rests on the

359
00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:54.800
view that sex work is all about men hurting

360
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.949
women, right? So, mhm. So

361
00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:03.660
let's now go through the main claims made by

362
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.920
prohibitionists and what some of the sex workers, the

363
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.030
ones you interview have to reply to them or

364
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.540
to say about them in their own words. So

365
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.260
first uh they, the prohibitionists tend to make claims

366
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.250
about their subjective lives and they use terms like

367
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.979
self contempt, loss of dignity, degradation, dehumanization. What is

368
00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:31.819
the main claim made here by the prohibitionists? And

369
00:28:31.829 --> 00:28:34.689
then we can get into what the sex workers

370
00:28:34.699 --> 00:28:35.560
themselves say.

371
00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:40.420
Well, uh you have to be careful about trying

372
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:45.510
to, to pin down the thing that prohibitionists say,

373
00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.959
prohibitionists will say anything that they can get away

374
00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:56.160
with saying uh and, and um the words like

375
00:28:57.069 --> 00:29:01.969
degrading and demeaning and disrespectful. They do not have

376
00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:07.469
a clear enough defined meaning to restrict prohibitionists. They

377
00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:13.300
will throw out those words whenever it's convenient. So

378
00:29:13.589 --> 00:29:16.969
it, so I don't want to say, gee this

379
00:29:16.979 --> 00:29:19.150
is their, their one thing that they have to

380
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:26.750
say what they want to emphasize is that, that,

381
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.849
well, that it's, that's very bad for the provider

382
00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:35.479
and they're usually talking about a woman provider because

383
00:29:35.489 --> 00:29:39.479
it diminishes that person. And then you can go

384
00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:41.380
into all of the synonyms that you want to

385
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.819
use, degrading and exploiting and, and all those kind.

386
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.500
Uh And, and, you know, we could talk about

387
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:52.300
words for a long time, even the word exploitation

388
00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:56.069
uh in, in many contexts that has a clear

389
00:29:56.079 --> 00:29:59.739
enough meaning, but not when you're talking about sex

390
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:03.949
work. The, the, the whole, the whole meaning of

391
00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:12.959
exploitation collapse. When you're talking with prohibitionist, they will

392
00:30:12.969 --> 00:30:16.050
simply want to say that sex work is exploited

393
00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.630
by its own nature inherently. And you say so

394
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.560
what do you mean by that? I mean, I

395
00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:24.260
mean, you certainly don't mean that the guy needs

396
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.359
to pay more. That's not what you mean. And

397
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:31.300
isn't it ironic that if he doesn't pay her

398
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.400
anything that's not exploitation, but as soon as he

399
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.479
actually pays her, then it's exploited. So you see

400
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:43.780
the word in, in the context of sex work

401
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.829
just collapses. Uh My, my favorite example is there's

402
00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:54.459
underage girl, I guess in high school and she

403
00:30:54.469 --> 00:30:58.530
was taking, you know, the sex pictures of herself,

404
00:30:58.569 --> 00:31:03.780
nudes of herself and, and sending them out some

405
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:09.560
on social media coming and she was arrested. Now,

406
00:31:09.569 --> 00:31:13.150
II I don't know that she was ever convicted.

407
00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:17.729
I'm not sure what actually happened, but she was

408
00:31:17.739 --> 00:31:24.630
charged with exploitation, sexual exploitation because she was exploiting

409
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.849
herself. Now that's how bizarre the notion of exploitation

410
00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:33.119
gets. But I digress a little bit in talking

411
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.680
about exploitation. What, what let's call them the abstract

412
00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:41.069
prohibitionist. What they want to do is simply to

413
00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:48.150
instill and to reinforce the stereotype that there's something

414
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.709
very, very icky about prostitution and they don't want

415
00:31:53.719 --> 00:31:57.900
to use the word icky. So they sound philosophical

416
00:31:57.989 --> 00:32:02.239
by using all of these other terms. I, I

417
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.439
like to think of it as it, it, it's

418
00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:08.540
a way of, it's a way of spitting and

419
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:14.410
sounding philosophical at the same time. Uh So that's

420
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.449
what they're trying to do. They're just trying to

421
00:32:17.459 --> 00:32:23.930
say that, that we should have an emotionally averse

422
00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:29.589
feeling to sex. Uh Now, now that's the abstract

423
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:32.369
people, there are other people who make empirical claims,

424
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.430
but if we're just talking about the abstract folks,

425
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:42.300
it's very, very difficult to pin them down. And

426
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:47.729
that's the same reason why their arguments ultimately collapse

427
00:32:47.739 --> 00:32:50.849
on themselves. That's just what they're trying to do.

428
00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:54.459
Right? A and we will also probably get into

429
00:32:54.469 --> 00:32:57.839
some of the empirical claims made by them later

430
00:32:57.849 --> 00:33:00.479
in our conversation. But when it comes to the

431
00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:05.449
topic of satisfaction and well being of subjective life

432
00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:09.089
in general, what do I, I mean, could you

433
00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:12.170
give us examples of what some of the sex

434
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.979
workers you interviewed have to say on that topic?

435
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.599
Yes. Now, and, and now that this can become

436
00:33:20.329 --> 00:33:25.119
an empirical issue and, and one that's legitimately studied,

437
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:31.560
uh the mental health of sex workers. Um AND

438
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:34.640
there's, there, there's a stereotype that, that they all

439
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.510
must be miserable because, well, gee whiz they gotta

440
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.910
be miserable and I'm sure that there are sex

441
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.050
workers who are miserable. Uh uh It does happen.

442
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.739
No question about that. I mean, there are, um,

443
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.140
you know, I was a lawyer all my career

444
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.800
and I guarantee you that there are, that there

445
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.719
are legal secretaries out there who are miserable uh

446
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.359
in, in, in sex work, you if you have

447
00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:10.620
a sex worker who was born in a culture

448
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:17.929
where it is intensively stigmatized. But now she, for

449
00:34:17.938 --> 00:34:21.620
whatever reason, now she is taking money, she may

450
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:24.679
very well feel miserable, that may very well happen.

451
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.800
But what is important from a legal perspective is,

452
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:36.418
is what's the generalization, what characterizes sex work? And

453
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:41.679
the, the empirical evidence is that, is that mental

454
00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:48.070
health issues don't do not characterize sex. You do.

455
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.719
Uh There's re empirical research and they, they found

456
00:34:54.728 --> 00:35:02.469
uh uh a good number of sex workers say,

457
00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:05.580
I mean, in some states, there are many studies

458
00:35:06.189 --> 00:35:08.929
uh uh but just, just to point to a

459
00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:11.489
few of them, I mean, there are some studies

460
00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:17.360
uh especially of indoor sex workers. And also, you

461
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:24.030
know, sex work has enhanced my self esteem. That

462
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:34.020
notion is, is utterly incredible. Too many conventional Western

463
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:40.050
people. It, they just cannot believe that, but that's

464
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.770
what you find now. Not all of them, of

465
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.580
course not. And, and, and there's, there's much less

466
00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:49.219
of that kind of talk. If you're talking about

467
00:35:49.229 --> 00:35:51.830
women who work on the street, there's a great

468
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.469
deal of variation uh in sex work. Uh Barbara

469
00:35:56.479 --> 00:36:04.820
Brent studied brothels in Nevada. And uh and her,

470
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.600
her conclusion was look, when you, when you have

471
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:15.199
problems with the emotional life of a sex worker

472
00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:20.439
as a general matter, they stem from two things.

473
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:26.419
What? And we're talking about brothels in Nevada. So

474
00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:29.939
we're talking about women. One, she's not getting enough

475
00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:37.379
clients, she doesn't make enough money. Two stigma, those

476
00:36:37.389 --> 00:36:43.010
are the two factors that are behind most emotional

477
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.260
or mental difficulties when they do arise. And you

478
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:53.560
know, she, she quotes two of them. 111 sex

479
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.719
worker says, you know, this was just terrible and

480
00:36:56.729 --> 00:37:01.320
nobody should ever do sex work. Uh And then

481
00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:04.280
another one says this was the best thing that

482
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:09.780
ever happened to me. I love it. And we

483
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.239
just have to accept the fact that there are

484
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.550
all kinds of sex workers doing all kinds of

485
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.850
work for all kinds of reasons. And it is

486
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.629
not true that mental health issues characterize them. And

487
00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:29.280
when you do have mental health issues, the odds

488
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:34.310
are that you're going to find that it's basically

489
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.239
business related, not having enough customers. What the stigma

490
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.909
that they have to live in? We've created a

491
00:37:40.919 --> 00:37:45.100
world that stigmatizes these people and then we scratch

492
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.189
our heads and say, gee why do they feel

493
00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:50.389
that what is the reason?

494
00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:54.679
And when it comes to that point on stigma,

495
00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:59.929
isn't it the case that prohibitionists or abolitionists either

496
00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:03.310
from the conservative end of the spectrum or the

497
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.639
more pro progressive end of the spectrum? Aren't they

498
00:38:06.649 --> 00:38:12.199
all also contributing to the stigmatization of sex workers

499
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:14.689
with the kinds of claims they make?

500
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.060
Of course, I mean, uh and, and, and, and

501
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.129
of course they did, like I say, it is

502
00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:27.780
evolving overall, I would agree they're contributing to stigma.

503
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.489
Now, now there are some who would argue, well,

504
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.310
we're just saying they're victims and their clients are

505
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:42.129
evil. Well, you're certainly stigmatizing the clients. Uh, AND

506
00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:48.409
there's, there is a, it can be said they're

507
00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:54.530
stigmatizing the sex workers too. There was research done

508
00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:01.600
in the Netherlands about how sex workers feel about

509
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:08.709
their work and they have complaints, they have complaints.

510
00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:10.669
And so you read and you look at the,

511
00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:13.510
the they pull them, well, what are their complaints

512
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.169
and their complaints are exactly the same complaints that

513
00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:20.510
employees have. You know, I wanna make more money.

514
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.500
I wanna have more flexible hours. And then another

515
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:31.590
thing they say is the government treats us like

516
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.830
victims. That is their complaint. Those are sex workers

517
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:41.780
themselves complaining about that. Uh So that's a good

518
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.300
reason to say even, you know, even the more,

519
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:53.739
more contemporary victimizing pp uh philosophy that just continues

520
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.830
stigma uh in a different form.

521
00:39:58.459 --> 00:40:02.159
And another very interesting thing uh or uh something

522
00:40:02.169 --> 00:40:05.840
that I find really curious uh about the arguments

523
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.840
coming from the prohibitionists is that one very common

524
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:15.250
thing they claim is that prostitutes in general do

525
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.379
not have a choice. That is they, they, they're

526
00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:24.070
basically implying that no one, if they were not

527
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.040
in specific kinds of circumstances that forced them into

528
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.760
sex work would from their own free will choose

529
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.270
this kind of work. I mean, I isn't that

530
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.760
also a little bit condescending.

531
00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:45.419
It's, it, it, it's really outrageous what poor habits

532
00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:50.350
have done with the notion of consent. And of

533
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.189
course, the notion just stripped sex workers of any

534
00:40:55.199 --> 00:41:02.090
kind of agency. Oh, but you know what, like,

535
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.000
like the word exploitation, the word consent has now

536
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:11.989
been virtually destroyed as a useful and honest term

537
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.090
to use whenever we're talking about sex work. The,

538
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:24.719
the argument, for example, that, well, she didn't consent

539
00:41:24.729 --> 00:41:29.360
to sex work because she needed the money. What

540
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:37.810
I'm sure that's true. Uh And you know, that

541
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:44.810
does not mean that, that she did not consent

542
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.500
to this work. But if you continue to use

543
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.250
the word consent like that, if you find any

544
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:59.729
pressure, economic or otherwise, then you're going to use

545
00:41:59.739 --> 00:42:03.419
non consent. I if you're going to use that

546
00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:06.750
word like that, then the only fair way to

547
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.729
talk about consent is in a comparative way. And

548
00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:14.860
instead of taking a sex worker and say, does

549
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.629
she consent? You should take a sex worker and

550
00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:24.280
say, how does she compare to this other person

551
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:30.209
who makes life's decisions based on economic pressures or

552
00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:35.719
any other pressures? I have, I have a lady

553
00:42:35.729 --> 00:42:41.399
from Guatemala who doesn't speak very good English and

554
00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:45.429
I speak to her in Spanish a bit and

555
00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:48.790
she cleans my house every once in a while

556
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.139
and I pay her to do that. You know,

557
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.459
I don't think she really, really enjoys mopping the

558
00:42:55.469 --> 00:42:59.129
floors to my house. She does it because she

559
00:42:59.139 --> 00:43:02.750
needs the money and I try to give her

560
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.010
a reasonable pay for that. That does not mean

561
00:43:06.189 --> 00:43:09.409
that I'm a slave driver. It doesn't mean that

562
00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:15.360
she's a slave. If you take, you take lawyers.

563
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.689
I was a lawyer the last, you know, why

564
00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:21.510
did I do it? Well, I did it because

565
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.169
I wasn't independently wealthy. I couldn't, you know, retire

566
00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:27.419
to Tahiti and put my feet up. I had

567
00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:30.909
to work for a living that does not mean

568
00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:33.800
that I didn't consent to it. That's not how

569
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:40.679
we use the word consent. Uh In, in Norway,

570
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.040
they uh I hope things have calmed down a

571
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:53.370
bit but they're really, really into trafficking and trafficking.

572
00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:57.290
Forceful pro it's a very, very big evil. We

573
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.330
can get to that later on. That is not

574
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:05.270
consensual prosecution, but they're trying to attack trafficking and

575
00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:08.389
they arrested a guy and charged him with trafficking.

576
00:44:08.399 --> 00:44:11.659
And I believe they convicted him of trafficking. And

577
00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:15.639
that's because he brought in migrants and I believe

578
00:44:15.649 --> 00:44:19.060
they came in from, from eastern European country, maybe

579
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:25.560
from Romania. And, and they had the women testify

580
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.550
and the women said no, we did this voluntarily.

581
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.419
We chose to do this, but they still convicted

582
00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:38.899
him of trafficking. You know why? Because the court

583
00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:46.419
said in Romania, they didn't have economic opportunities. Therefore,

584
00:44:46.709 --> 00:44:49.320
they did not come of their own free will.

585
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.939
Therefore, you are a trafficker. Now, just think of

586
00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:58.879
that way of reasoning it's just appalling. What if,

587
00:44:58.889 --> 00:45:02.620
what if he had brought them from Romania and

588
00:45:02.629 --> 00:45:06.520
he had hired them to, to clean toilets in

589
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:12.399
public restrooms and that was their best economic option.

590
00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:17.830
Would he have been arrested? No, they would have

591
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.649
thanked him for giving a job. So there's no,

592
00:45:21.659 --> 00:45:24.179
now, now I, I'm not saying that sex work

593
00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:26.290
and cleaning toilets are the same thing. They're very,

594
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:31.320
very different. They're very, very different consequences. But consent

595
00:45:31.409 --> 00:45:38.479
is not the difference. Consent is the thing. And

596
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:45.219
the people get very, very uh extreme in these

597
00:45:45.229 --> 00:45:49.239
notions. I mean, there's one prohibition who said, you

598
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:54.040
know, the money coerces the sex. Therefore, it's rape

599
00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:59.949
that is just irrational. But she can get away

600
00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:03.979
with saying it because it feeds into a stereotype

601
00:46:03.989 --> 00:46:07.370
and what people want to believe and I've gone

602
00:46:07.379 --> 00:46:09.070
on a long time but it is, it, it

603
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.800
is just so upsetting what people can get away

604
00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:19.340
with when they're talking about consent because, because true

605
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:23.870
trafficking is a very, very bad thing and it

606
00:46:23.879 --> 00:46:29.620
is very, very hurtful and they want to pretend

607
00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:35.290
that consensual prostitution is trafficking. Uh THAT'S just an

608
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.330
awful thing to do. And it's, it's, it's intellectually

609
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.250
dishonest.

610
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.300
So when it comes to the point of uh

611
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:47.979
work, uh sex work, but also work more generally.

612
00:46:48.209 --> 00:46:51.370
And also at a certain point there, you mentioned

613
00:46:51.379 --> 00:46:56.260
the trafficking. Isn't it interesting that uh when it

614
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:01.540
comes to other activities, like for example, construction work

615
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:06.179
there are certain places oo on earth where people

616
00:47:06.189 --> 00:47:09.419
are trafficked into that sort into that form of

617
00:47:09.429 --> 00:47:12.479
work. And there are also other examples of course,

618
00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:17.330
agriculture and so on. But people in those specific

619
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:23.229
case only worry about ending that trafficking and not

620
00:47:23.239 --> 00:47:27.699
ending the activity itself. But in this specific case

621
00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:31.489
of sex work, they take one step forward and

622
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.719
argue that if there's any trafficking at all, then

623
00:47:35.729 --> 00:47:39.570
the solution is just to prohibit any kind of

624
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.090
sex work. Isn't it interesting?

625
00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:46.739
Well, yes. And, and that's true. And, and if

626
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.489
you, you know, if you focus on all the

627
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:57.120
emotion behind stereotypes of sex work, it's not surprising.

628
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.010
It's, it's, it's not reasonable at all. But it's

629
00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:05.860
not surprising because when you're talking about sex work,

630
00:48:06.129 --> 00:48:11.679
people have so much philosophical animosity that they will

631
00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:14.500
jump on the solution of let's do away with

632
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.219
all sex work even though it's not reasonable, even

633
00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:18.830
though like you say, they would never say that

634
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.360
about construction work or, or agriculture. Uh uh YOU

635
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.360
know, they want to do away with sex work.

636
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:33.729
1st, 2nd, they want to do away with trafficking.

637
00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:35.959
And so they use trafficking as a way to

638
00:48:35.969 --> 00:48:39.699
do away with sex. Uh Now you can get

639
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:45.139
into, I mean, you can have an honest argument

640
00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:49.669
with, with a pragmatic person about, well, you know,

641
00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:53.149
is it true that, you know, once you, once

642
00:48:53.159 --> 00:48:57.270
you decriminalize it, more sex work happens and if

643
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.320
more sex work happens and more trafficking happens. And

644
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:06.110
so simply as a, as a statistical matter, uh

645
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.840
don't, don't the prohibitionists have a point that that

646
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.459
and when you're talking about sex work, the only

647
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:18.330
remedy is really do away with it. And, and

648
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.889
I can accept that as an honest concern and

649
00:49:21.899 --> 00:49:24.929
one that has to be addressed, the point is

650
00:49:24.939 --> 00:49:29.840
it has been addressed and people have looked at

651
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:37.330
it, people have empirically looked at decriminalized contexts and

652
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:43.300
no trafficking does not increase in those jurisdictions. We

653
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:47.479
have jurisdictions. We, we, you know, we don't have

654
00:49:47.489 --> 00:49:51.459
to just speculate about this. We have New Zealand,

655
00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:55.500
we have most of Australia uh A as two

656
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.149
of the two of the clearest examples of decriminalization

657
00:49:59.489 --> 00:50:01.889
and in other jurisdictions, you have legalization who is

658
00:50:01.899 --> 00:50:08.209
heavily regulated and you do not find an increase

659
00:50:08.219 --> 00:50:12.060
in trafficking uh that you have to go through

660
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.459
statistics. And once again, you have to be very,

661
00:50:15.469 --> 00:50:20.699
very careful that you keep people honest when you're

662
00:50:20.709 --> 00:50:25.629
in this debate because if you're not careful what

663
00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:28.080
you're going to find, if you're confronted with someone

664
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:32.459
who says, why of course trafficking increased and what

665
00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:35.620
do they mean? They mean that sex work increased,

666
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.439
but they believe that no one can consent to

667
00:50:38.449 --> 00:50:43.709
sex work. Therefore, all sex work is trafficking. And,

668
00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:47.750
and you know, in some, actually, in some jurisdictions,

669
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.209
if you have an increase in sex work, they

670
00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:52.979
will claim that's an increase in trafficking. So you

671
00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:57.540
always have to be on guard. Uh uh But

672
00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.520
if you're, if you're serious about what trafficking means

673
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:06.760
as force or fraud or underage, it's just not

674
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.669
true. New Zealand is one of the clearest examples

675
00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:15.260
of decriminalization and, and they were very serious about

676
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:20.469
finding out what would happen. New Zealanders are ordinary

677
00:51:20.479 --> 00:51:23.530
Western people. You know, they weren't, they weren't out

678
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.320
on some radical binge and, and, and they wanted

679
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.979
to make sure that this was gonna be ok,

680
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.780
that there were no bad effects from this radical

681
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.370
thing they were doing of decriminalizing five years after

682
00:51:38.379 --> 00:51:40.070
and I believe they did another 1, 10 years

683
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:45.250
after that is government sponsored review to find out

684
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:51.310
what the effects were. And they, the end result

685
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.550
will say that sex workers are better off, they're

686
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.120
not worse off, they're not being trafficked, they're better

687
00:51:57.129 --> 00:52:00.629
off. Now, the word trafficking means that back then

688
00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:02.899
it meant something different. In New Zealand, you have

689
00:52:02.909 --> 00:52:07.239
to be careful about the statistics. Uh AND, and,

690
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:11.010
and, and traffic trafficking did not, did not go

691
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:16.100
up and certainly not in the legalized uh environment.

692
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:20.179
Uh But if, if, if say, say Americans and

693
00:52:20.189 --> 00:52:23.610
Western Europeans have a broader definition of trafficking. Even

694
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.620
if you use that broader definition, you go to

695
00:52:25.629 --> 00:52:29.540
New Zealand, they still say, look, they're better off,

696
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.870
it improved their lives. It did not, it did

697
00:52:32.879 --> 00:52:35.810
not hurt them. You go to Australia has, has

698
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.820
a long history of decriminalization. It does not increase

699
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:45.729
trafficking. The state of Victoria in Australia, they had

700
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.629
legalized. Prostitution means it's regulated, it's not decriminalized. There

701
00:52:50.639 --> 00:52:52.989
are all kinds of, you know, they surrounded with

702
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.889
all kinds of all kinds of regulations and they,

703
00:52:56.899 --> 00:53:01.060
and they had that system for years. They know

704
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:04.870
about that system and you know what they finally

705
00:53:04.879 --> 00:53:10.290
decided in 2021 let's just decriminalize it. That will

706
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.070
be better, just the opposite of what you would

707
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:22.520
think if loosening restrictions increase trafficking. So, so for,

708
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:26.679
for, you know, for the honest person who's actually

709
00:53:26.689 --> 00:53:32.169
concerned about trafficking as an empirical reality, we have

710
00:53:32.179 --> 00:53:35.429
a lot of data for it. We need to

711
00:53:35.439 --> 00:53:40.239
keep fighting trafficking. There's no question about that, you

712
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.610
know, but the way to do it is to

713
00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:50.620
decriminalize, decriminalizing does not exacerbate trafficking. And it is

714
00:53:50.629 --> 00:53:56.570
probably the case that it will help. I what

715
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.409
what you need to do is to think of

716
00:53:59.419 --> 00:54:04.850
the situation where, where sex workers are no longer

717
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.830
afraid of the police, they don't hide from the

718
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:14.949
police, the police are their protectors. And if they

719
00:54:14.959 --> 00:54:18.989
face violence, they can call the police and the

720
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.030
sex workers will be the ones who will know

721
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:27.129
about trafficking. If it's happening, sex workers have no

722
00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:31.639
desire for there to be trafficking. Why would, why

723
00:54:31.649 --> 00:54:35.189
would an adult consensual sex worker be interested and

724
00:54:35.199 --> 00:54:38.060
down the street? Some 17 year old being forced

725
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.330
into sex work? If the police have a good

726
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:45.600
working relationship with sex workers, it will help in

727
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:50.040
the badly against trafficking. I mean, the, the the

728
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:54.760
problem of trafficking is vastly exaggerated um because people

729
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:59.959
conflated with just ordinary prostitution. Uh And, and so

730
00:54:59.969 --> 00:55:07.030
it is uh it, it's extremely exaggerated. Nevertheless, it's

731
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.909
there and if it happens one time, it's a

732
00:55:10.919 --> 00:55:13.239
very bad thing and you need to stop it.

733
00:55:13.489 --> 00:55:19.350
No question about that. But decriminalization is not the

734
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:25.159
problem. Decriminalization helps matters. It doesn't hurt matters.

735
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.510
So, let me ask you now a little bit

736
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.409
about some of the words and concepts that the

737
00:55:32.419 --> 00:55:37.260
prohibitionists use in their discourse. So earlier, even you

738
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:41.989
mentioned the a word such as exploitation. So when

739
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.370
it comes to claims made by prohibitionists in the

740
00:55:45.379 --> 00:55:50.929
context, in the context of sex work, does exploitation

741
00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:52.590
have a concrete meaning?

742
00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:56.879
Well, now, even, even in, in ordinary life in

743
00:55:56.889 --> 00:56:01.790
say economics, exploitation is, is uh uh it is

744
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.530
a bit loose. Uh But you know, if, if,

745
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:10.149
if you're talking about uh workers being exploited, uh

746
00:56:10.449 --> 00:56:14.929
you know, well enough what's being meant and it's,

747
00:56:14.939 --> 00:56:18.310
it's, it's so it's a useful term. Uh I

748
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:26.879
in sex work uh i it's not uh and

749
00:56:26.889 --> 00:56:31.590
it's interesting to speculate as to why people sort

750
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.959
of sense that must mean something. And, and I

751
00:56:36.969 --> 00:56:41.239
can, I can only imagine a very traditional view,

752
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:46.129
you know, of, of the female as being a

753
00:56:46.139 --> 00:56:50.290
sexual commodity. This is an irony here. You know,

754
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.820
it, it, it, it, it's not the pimp who's

755
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:58.010
saying who's talking about about. But it's, it's, it's

756
00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.889
the government, it's prohibitionist treating a woman as a

757
00:57:01.899 --> 00:57:06.649
sexual commodity. And then if you take that commodity

758
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.830
without compensation, then you're exploiting her. But money can

759
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.959
never be compensation, compensation. Some kind of ideas like

760
00:57:15.969 --> 00:57:18.620
this. I'm speculating and I'm trying to, I'm trying

761
00:57:18.629 --> 00:57:22.360
to put myself in their minds what they must

762
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.199
think about. I mean, and there are prohibitionists who

763
00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:28.530
talk about, you know, sexuality is inherent to a

764
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:31.959
woman's personhood. It's a very interesting thing to say

765
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.889
because you don't say that about a man. Uh

766
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.669
uh And, and so II, I think that there

767
00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:39.639
are a lot of, a lot of women who

768
00:57:39.649 --> 00:57:42.300
might think about that and decide not to go

769
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:46.320
in that direction, but some have, some have and

770
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:49.439
that's the best I can do to, to try

771
00:57:49.449 --> 00:57:51.570
to put myself in the frame of mind of

772
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.979
people who say sex work is always exploitation, you

773
00:57:55.989 --> 00:58:00.350
know, in the state of Washington, in my country,

774
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.729
they had a law against sex work and they

775
00:58:04.739 --> 00:58:07.409
used the term I believe it was prostitution that

776
00:58:07.419 --> 00:58:12.229
they used, they amended the law so that it

777
00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:17.649
says the same thing except they say exploited individual,

778
00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:23.379
even in the codified war, they decided to use

779
00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:28.840
the word exploitation, exploited person, you know, and you

780
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:34.560
know, my suggestion, tongue in cheek, tongue in cheek,

781
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:40.989
suggestion is, you know, some client who is being

782
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:49.570
charged with exploitation should go into court and should

783
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.209
defend himself by saying yes, I paid her for

784
00:58:53.219 --> 00:58:56.239
money. I'm a client of apostate. But in an

785
00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:00.560
exploiter and see what the judge says. Now it's

786
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.590
tongue in cheek. He's not gonna get very far

787
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.719
doing that. But those are the ideas that you

788
00:59:06.729 --> 00:59:10.209
have and the way the word exploitation has been

789
00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:12.540
totally wrecked for political purposes.

790
00:59:13.959 --> 00:59:17.469
And uh uh still on the topic of exploitation

791
00:59:17.479 --> 00:59:23.209
and also powerlessness. I've heard and read some feminist

792
00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:25.800
sex workers. And even if they are not sex

793
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:30.070
workers, some feminists who are, uh let's call them

794
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.219
sex positive. So they are not against sex work.

795
00:59:33.439 --> 00:59:38.739
Uh CLAIMING the opposite of what the prohibitionists claim.

796
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:42.370
There is. Some of them say that no, actually

797
00:59:42.379 --> 00:59:44.830
sex work or they look at sex work as

798
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.870
a form of empowerment and of them being in

799
00:59:47.879 --> 00:59:52.209
control of their own work because they establish their

800
00:59:52.219 --> 00:59:56.340
own rules so that there's also that feminist perspective

801
00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:56.620
out there,

802
00:59:56.629 --> 01:00:02.100
right? I'm a straight male. Mhm. That's the way

803
01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:07.229
I imagine. I imagine, you know, if there's a

804
01:00:07.239 --> 01:00:10.429
woman and I want to have sex with her,

805
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.120
she gets to set the terms. I'm not the

806
01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:18.780
one with power she is now. So then that

807
01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.459
makes a lot of sense to me. And there

808
01:00:20.469 --> 01:00:24.120
are women who are sex workers who talk about

809
01:00:24.129 --> 01:00:28.739
empowerment. No question. There are, uh like I said,

810
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:35.300
at the beginning, I, I generalizations are dangerous. Uh

811
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:38.870
I don't want to generalize and say that sex

812
01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:43.060
work is always empowering or it's never empowering. Uh,

813
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:47.050
IT was a, a very respected author, Ronald Weitzer

814
01:00:47.739 --> 01:00:52.229
who writes on sex where a sociologist and he

815
01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:54.820
says, and, and, you know, he, uh, he, he's

816
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.969
very good, he's very good on this. Uh, AND

817
01:00:58.979 --> 01:01:01.260
he says that, you know, there, there, there are

818
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:05.270
paradigms and there is the, there's the victim paradigm

819
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.300
and there's the empowerment paradigm and people select which

820
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.340
paradigm they want. And he says, you know, you

821
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.300
shouldn't do either one, you shouldn't sell yourself to

822
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:21.100
either one. There's, he calls it the polymorphous paradigm,

823
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.209
which means you have a lot of different people

824
01:01:24.219 --> 01:01:25.969
doing a lot of different things and a lot

825
01:01:25.979 --> 01:01:28.989
of different contexts. Why can't we just accept that

826
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.729
fact? Um And, and so, you know, uh what

827
01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:38.540
can I say to me? It sounds empowering, but

828
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.520
I'm sure that, you know, for a lot of

829
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.379
women, uh do not see it that way. And

830
01:01:44.389 --> 01:01:49.020
um uh that's fine, that should not affect the

831
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.719
law and it should not affect my attitude toward

832
01:01:53.729 --> 01:01:58.860
them or my stigma either way. I, you know,

833
01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:00.290
it's none of my business,

834
01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:05.649
right? So another kind of word that prohibitionists sometimes

835
01:02:05.659 --> 01:02:10.110
use is coercion. So they say that they associate

836
01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.860
sex work with coercion. They say that the only

837
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:17.159
reason why they, of course, most of the time

838
01:02:17.169 --> 01:02:20.649
they're talking about women, uh The only reason why

839
01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:23.370
women go into sex work is because they are

840
01:02:23.379 --> 01:02:26.870
coerced into it. What, what do they mean by

841
01:02:26.879 --> 01:02:27.219
that?

842
01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:30.399
Well, you know, I don't like to think I

843
01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:32.689
need, you know, I, I need to constrain my

844
01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:36.030
criticism of people I don't agree with. But at

845
01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.909
a certain point, I mean, you, you, you have

846
01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:46.639
to talk about honesty. I mean, to say that

847
01:02:46.649 --> 01:02:55.020
sex work is intrinsically coercive. So blatantly flies into

848
01:02:55.030 --> 01:03:01.540
facts, the empirical fact that, that you just can't

849
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:06.050
eat, eat, you can't take it seriously as an

850
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.030
empirical proposition. You have to take it seriously because

851
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.489
of its emotional content and the emotional reaction that

852
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.939
people will have. Now, if you talk to sex

853
01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:23.179
workers, you realize that no, they're not being coerced.

854
01:03:24.489 --> 01:03:27.320
If you just think about sex work, you say

855
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:30.830
no, they're not being coerced, they're deciding to take

856
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:38.070
money. Oh, and, and, and so you, it's hard

857
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.800
to know what to say to a person who

858
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.699
says, well, it's just all coercive if they're trying

859
01:03:44.709 --> 01:03:47.850
to be empirical, if they're trying to say, you

860
01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.669
know, all those women out there are coerced. Well,

861
01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:55.179
then there's an empirical answer to that and it

862
01:03:55.189 --> 01:03:57.850
turns out you're just wrong. It's just not true

863
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.850
in any ordinary meaning of the word coerced. It's

864
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.250
not true and we can get back into the

865
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.870
issue of consent. Yeah, of course, they're doing it

866
01:04:06.879 --> 01:04:11.580
because they need money. Uh But it's simply not

867
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.729
true. If by coercion, you mean something more abstract,

868
01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:19.959
you just mean, well, that, uh you know, intrinsically,

869
01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:22.780
it's the inscription of the patriarchy and they have

870
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:31.060
power and the woman in the sex change gets

871
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:36.810
a, it is stigmatized more than the man. And

872
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.110
I think that that's behind what a lot of

873
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.179
what people are talking about that doesn't translate into

874
01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:49.500
coercion that translates into a real problem about stigma.

875
01:04:50.129 --> 01:04:53.419
But it doesn't translate into coercion. You know, people

876
01:04:53.429 --> 01:04:57.770
like to use people like to sound sophisticated and

877
01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:02.969
talk about power dynamics and they'll talk about in

878
01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:09.159
this sex work relationship. There's a power differential. One

879
01:05:09.169 --> 01:05:11.989
party is more powerful than the other. And what

880
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.010
they really mean is the man is more powerful

881
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.969
than the woman. Well, first of all, they, they,

882
01:05:18.979 --> 01:05:22.159
they just like to use the word power because

883
01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:25.570
in this case, it's a bit vague. But, you

884
01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.729
know, I mean, I can go a long way.

885
01:05:27.739 --> 01:05:31.629
I mean, like I, I, I will imagine, although

886
01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:33.239
I don't know if it's true or not, but

887
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.899
I will imagine that the man always has a

888
01:05:35.909 --> 01:05:39.179
lot more money than the woman does. The man

889
01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:41.290
has a way of getting a lot more money.

890
01:05:42.159 --> 01:05:44.939
The man can write a, a letter to the

891
01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:48.120
editor of the newspaper and it will be published

892
01:05:48.129 --> 01:05:50.399
a lot sooner than the woman. So he has

893
01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:54.229
that social power, economic power. So there is a

894
01:05:54.239 --> 01:05:58.469
power differential. And what they want to do is

895
01:05:58.479 --> 01:06:00.949
they want to say there's a power differential and

896
01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:03.360
then they want to stop talking like they've made

897
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.889
a point. What is the point? I don't know

898
01:06:06.899 --> 01:06:10.370
what the point is. I, I think the point

899
01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:14.979
is they want to insinuate that, that power is

900
01:06:14.989 --> 01:06:20.540
being used to coerce the woman, but you have

901
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:24.370
to make that case. You don't just say there's

902
01:06:24.379 --> 01:06:28.489
a powerful man there. I mean, the powerful man

903
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.850
buys a cup of coffee at, at a coffee

904
01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.850
shop and the woman who provides him the coffee

905
01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:41.050
doesn't have power like he does. He's got a

906
01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.429
lot of power, but that doesn't mean he's coercing

907
01:06:44.439 --> 01:06:50.110
her. And as a matter of fact, the powerful

908
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.360
man, you know, paying the woman, you can imagine

909
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:57.929
him is that being one part of his life

910
01:06:57.939 --> 01:07:00.850
where he doesn't have that much power and you

911
01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.610
know, this woman is gonna limit him. You can

912
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.929
imagine it that way just as much as you

913
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:13.060
can imagine something else. So, so, so you can

914
01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.699
talk about power dynamics and you can talk about

915
01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:19.179
a power differential and, and you may have a

916
01:07:19.189 --> 01:07:23.250
lot to say there may be, you know, you,

917
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:25.729
you know, you may, you may look at the

918
01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:28.770
evidence and say gee whiz in almost all the

919
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.979
cases, the man is more powerful than the woman

920
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:35.439
but but you haven't made an argument yet. You

921
01:07:35.449 --> 01:07:39.030
know, that does that mean coercion that does not

922
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.000
mean lack of consent. Uh You know, i it

923
01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:46.469
ju it just means that there are some jobs

924
01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:50.300
that are more lucrative than sex work jobs. Although

925
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:54.280
if you, the researchers who have, who have, who

926
01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:58.030
have researched the money angle and found out that

927
01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.000
there are a great many people, middle class women,

928
01:08:01.169 --> 01:08:04.030
young women who do sex work because the money

929
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.389
is just good. That's a whole other issue too.

930
01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:15.739
The issue of coercion, oh, that's just blatantly flies

931
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.959
in the face of reality. Reality is concerned by

932
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.660
research. What can you say?

933
01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:26.270
So there are also middle class women that go

934
01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.680
into sex work. I'm asking you because uh we

935
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.580
have also this very common idea that it's only

936
01:08:32.589 --> 01:08:36.310
poor women who choose or in the words of

937
01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:40.350
the prohibitionists are coerced into sex work. So, but

938
01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.620
that's also not entirely true.

939
01:08:43.629 --> 01:08:47.439
Right. Well, I, I use the word middle class.

940
01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:52.500
I'm, I'm thinking about 11 researcher who determined a

941
01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.129
lot of middle class and young people are going

942
01:08:55.140 --> 01:09:00.009
into sex work. I hate to make any bold

943
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.589
pronouncements based just on one piece of research. OK.

944
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.290
Sociology, you know, the more the better. Uh BUT

945
01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:11.350
that was what that that person found and other

946
01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:16.279
people have found. The the economics are quite surprising

947
01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:19.049
and there was once one study that was done

948
01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.500
just to figure out why the money is so

949
01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:25.688
good. Now, of course, the phrase so good is,

950
01:09:25.698 --> 01:09:33.889
is a relative term. Um But there, there is

951
01:09:33.898 --> 01:09:37.849
a stereotype of women, uh sex workers as workers

952
01:09:37.858 --> 01:09:42.069
who work on the street that stereotype I think

953
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.830
is wearing a little thin, but the old fashioned

954
01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:51.359
stereotype has them as street walkers. The phrase street

955
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:56.759
walker, she's walking on the street. She's poor, very

956
01:09:56.770 --> 01:10:02.250
poor. She's addicted to drugs. She needs money and

957
01:10:02.259 --> 01:10:05.669
she will do anything to get it. But yeah,

958
01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.459
that, that's a horrible picture and she needs help.

959
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:17.060
No question about it. Uh, BUT you know, the,

960
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.689
the, the numbers that I've seen are that about

961
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:24.600
20% of sex work is sex work on the

962
01:10:24.609 --> 01:10:30.129
street. That means 80% of sex work is indoors.

963
01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:33.930
80%. Now, that could be a brothel and massage

964
01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:40.049
parlor, but also be escort agencies, right where the

965
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.359
woman is living in her apartment and she gets

966
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:50.089
a call, uh, from, not from a client but

967
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.459
from her madam. And we need to address the

968
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.049
phrase madam here because this madam is more like

969
01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:02.080
the sex worker employee than anything else. And the

970
01:11:02.089 --> 01:11:04.069
madam says I've got a client for you. So

971
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.290
and so such as you. And she says, ok,

972
01:11:06.299 --> 01:11:10.910
yeah, now, I don't know how much she makes,

973
01:11:11.819 --> 01:11:13.540
but she makes a lot more than the street

974
01:11:13.549 --> 01:11:19.970
walker, I'm sure. And, uh, there is, uh, I

975
01:11:19.979 --> 01:11:21.580
believe, I believe, yeah, I quote her in the

976
01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:25.950
book Norma Almodovar and she was one of the

977
01:11:25.959 --> 01:11:30.270
first ex sex workers that I interviewed and I

978
01:11:30.279 --> 01:11:34.540
talked to. Yeah, I know, you know, she was

979
01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:41.839
high end escort and, you know, she's playing around

980
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:47.240
with celebrities and wealthy people. Uh, I, I, you

981
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.439
know, I don't have dollar figures for you but

982
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.979
that was not a poor lifestyle for her. And

983
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:59.790
it's just not true that, well, the 20% don't

984
01:11:59.799 --> 01:12:03.740
represent everybody. We should pay attention to the 20%.

985
01:12:04.649 --> 01:12:08.520
Uh, WE should make sure that they're protected and

986
01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.959
for God's sake, you know, can you give him

987
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.680
a job, maybe all kinds of things you can

988
01:12:13.689 --> 01:12:16.919
do with the 20% but they don't represent the

989
01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:21.620
80%. It's, you know, it's, it's not true that

990
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:27.990
this is, uh you know, destitute women looking for

991
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.009
sustenance that empirically is just not true.

992
01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:37.799
So, and what can we say about violence in

993
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.279
sex work? Because one of the common claims made

994
01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:45.720
by prohibitionists is that if not all, at least

995
01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:50.339
most sex workers are victims of violence, that there's

996
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:53.790
a very high prevalence of violence in sex work.

997
01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:56.240
Is that true or not?

998
01:12:56.939 --> 01:13:02.520
Well, uh once again, we have to appreciate the

999
01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:05.540
fact that there's, there's no one thing that's sex

1000
01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:08.870
work. They're all different kinds of sex workers doing

1001
01:13:08.879 --> 01:13:12.649
all different kinds of work in all different contexts

1002
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:18.259
now. And not surprisingly, most of the violence and

1003
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.319
violence does occur and we have to face that

1004
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.919
fact that violence occurs in sex work. Most of

1005
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.319
it occurs on the street, for street workers, street

1006
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:31.700
workers are vulnerable. Ok. Uh If you are talking

1007
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:38.490
about escorts, it is not present as a matter

1008
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.229
of fact, I would venture to say that it's

1009
01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:49.169
rare. Um, I interviewed, uh, a sex worker who

1010
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.220
had also was a, was a madam. And so

1011
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:55.600
she was, she had very knowledge and a great

1012
01:13:55.609 --> 01:13:58.040
deal of knowledge about the sex workers who were

1013
01:13:58.049 --> 01:14:05.000
working for her. And, um, one time one of

1014
01:14:05.009 --> 01:14:07.060
the girls complained that a guy was a little

1015
01:14:07.069 --> 01:14:13.729
rough about it. Um, AND there are some other

1016
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.830
statistics, I don't have it on my fingertips. Uh,

1017
01:14:18.339 --> 01:14:22.310
BUT they show that you get the higher echelon

1018
01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.979
violence is just not a big factor. One researcher.

1019
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:30.089
Now, let me see. Once again, I don't have

1020
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:35.740
my fingertips but, but she compared sex workers with

1021
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:41.890
orderlies in a hospital and she, she found the

1022
01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:45.129
orderlies were subject to violence more often than the

1023
01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:49.279
sex worker. You know, and that does not trivialize

1024
01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:52.430
the violence of a sex worker. Of course, that's

1025
01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:53.859
a bad thing. We have to make sure that

1026
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:58.370
sex workers have police protection and sex workers respect

1027
01:14:58.379 --> 01:15:02.319
them when they call for work. But we, but,

1028
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:05.189
you know, if you're talking to a person who

1029
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.319
believes it says that, you know, violence is endemic

1030
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:13.500
are, it's just, it's not true, it's not true.

1031
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:20.049
And here again, there's empirical studies about violence and,

1032
01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.950
and it is there no question about it, but

1033
01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:25.520
you have to be careful, you know what you're

1034
01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:29.899
talking about. Uh, AND it is not endemic. Uh

1035
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:33.859
It is not pervasive, I don't think you would

1036
01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:37.240
use the word pervasive, uh, for violence and sex

1037
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:44.149
work. But what, what interests me even more and

1038
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.520
how much violence goes on. What interests me as

1039
01:15:48.529 --> 01:15:52.970
a lawyer is, what is the effect of our

1040
01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:58.149
laws on violence? Right now? We've had, we have

1041
01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:06.680
studies that show when you prohibit sex work, you

1042
01:16:06.689 --> 01:16:15.180
increase violence. If you decriminalize sex work, that itself

1043
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:22.319
helps to protect sex workers. Yes. Uh, AND there's

1044
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:25.180
more than one research on this topic, more than

1045
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:30.339
11 example, which was astonishing to me. One, once

1046
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:35.180
again, this, this, you know, conventional guy in Rhode

1047
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:42.649
Island, a state in the United States, they, they

1048
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:48.299
decriminalized indoor sex work. Now that this is a

1049
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:51.950
weird example considered by accident, they really didn't intend

1050
01:16:51.959 --> 01:16:56.149
to. But, you know, the legislators are amending legislation

1051
01:16:56.990 --> 01:17:01.649
and the prohibition on sex work only applied to

1052
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:08.970
street work. So for six years from 2003, 2009,

1053
01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:19.399
indoor sex work was decriminalized. Whoa. Now they finally

1054
01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:23.000
got their act together in 2009 and the prohibitionist

1055
01:17:23.009 --> 01:17:25.479
came in and no doubt they were screaming about

1056
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.799
it. And so they reinstated prohibition. So now Rhode

1057
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.399
Island is another typical state where it's all prohibited.

1058
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:36.970
But for nine years, for nine years, it was

1059
01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:42.330
legal indoors indoors. So, you know what a wonderful

1060
01:17:42.339 --> 01:17:47.180
empirical experiment, right? Look, you get nine years, it's

1061
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:53.200
legal indoors. What happened? Uh One of the things

1062
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:56.209
that happened was if the population at large, not

1063
01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.529
just sex workers at large, the rates of gonorrhea

1064
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:05.160
went down 40%. Nobody can really explain these results.

1065
01:18:05.479 --> 01:18:08.910
But there, there and, and as far as rape,

1066
01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:14.979
the instances of rape at large went down, 30%

1067
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:22.810
went down 30% when it was legalized indoors. Now,

1068
01:18:22.819 --> 01:18:26.649
that's just one example, it's very, very hard to

1069
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.410
tease out the cause and effect here. But that's

1070
01:18:30.419 --> 01:18:35.339
just one example of research showing that you don't,

1071
01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:41.109
you, it doesn't solve or mitigate the violence problem

1072
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.910
because you make sex work itself illegal. It just

1073
01:18:44.919 --> 01:18:46.509
doesn't work that way.

1074
01:18:46.879 --> 01:18:50.279
So another type of claims that we hear very

1075
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:55.399
often from prohibitionists is that they say that uh

1076
01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:59.359
all sex workers are in some way or another

1077
01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:04.040
victimized by their clients. Sometimes they even make the

1078
01:19:04.049 --> 01:19:10.490
claim that all sex work involves uh or is

1079
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.250
or involve sexual assault. So, but taking into account

1080
01:19:15.259 --> 01:19:19.220
the sex workers, you interviewed, what did they have

1081
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:23.290
to say about the kinds of people that their,

1082
01:19:23.299 --> 01:19:27.040
their clients were? And how did they describe their

1083
01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:28.439
interactions with them?

1084
01:19:29.569 --> 01:19:32.250
This same, this same woman who is a sex

1085
01:19:32.259 --> 01:19:35.470
worker and then became a madam that I interviewed

1086
01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.359
and, and she put it very, very succinctly uh

1087
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:45.629
uh as her experience as a madam, she said,

1088
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.629
you know, I asked her about clients, you know,

1089
01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:51.109
how does sex workers feel about their clients? What,

1090
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.140
what kind of people are? They said, look, 5%

1091
01:19:55.979 --> 01:19:59.970
of your clients are guys that you hate. You

1092
01:19:59.979 --> 01:20:02.810
never want to see them go again. Even if

1093
01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:06.870
you're making money from them, they just, you know,

1094
01:20:07.299 --> 01:20:09.310
they, they don't like them, don't like them at

1095
01:20:09.319 --> 01:20:14.549
all. Another 5% of your clients are guys and,

1096
01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.819
and she's speaking from a woman's perspective, a woman

1097
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:21.709
providing to me 5% of your clients, you just

1098
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.209
love them. They really like the guy, you know,

1099
01:20:24.589 --> 01:20:28.140
I mean, sex workers are human beings and they

1100
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:31.939
really like the guy. They really do. The rest

1101
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:35.810
are 90% 90% are just not good or bad.

1102
01:20:35.819 --> 01:20:38.270
It's just work. It's just a guy, another guy

1103
01:20:38.419 --> 01:20:42.500
and he's ok. But that's all. Now from everything

1104
01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:45.649
that I've read that seems to be a very

1105
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:52.200
accurate picture that you can drop. Um, uh, SEX

1106
01:20:52.209 --> 01:21:00.560
workers will say. Yeah, sometimes they're shitty but most

1107
01:21:00.569 --> 01:21:03.500
of the time they're not, they ask, they ask

1108
01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:06.470
one woman, you know, if you had, if you

1109
01:21:06.479 --> 01:21:09.799
didn't have to do sex work for money, what

1110
01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:15.790
would you do? Marvelous question? Right. Gee. She doesn't

1111
01:21:15.799 --> 01:21:17.910
have to do it for money. What would she

1112
01:21:17.919 --> 01:21:21.750
say? She would say? You know, I would go

1113
01:21:21.759 --> 01:21:24.890
out fewer times in a week but she would

1114
01:21:24.899 --> 01:21:27.330
still go out, you know, I wouldn't go out

1115
01:21:27.339 --> 01:21:29.430
all the time. Yeah. Take it easy. But I

1116
01:21:29.439 --> 01:21:31.529
would go out like, I don't know what she

1117
01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.549
said, maybe two or three times a week because

1118
01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.910
she enjoys the power like uh OK, that, that's,

1119
01:21:38.919 --> 01:21:44.029
that's another, that's another uh uh one example. Uh

1120
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.540
SO, you know, in my book, I could go

1121
01:21:48.549 --> 01:21:51.930
through and I could point to everyone who said

1122
01:21:51.939 --> 01:21:55.439
their clients were just fine but, but, but as

1123
01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:59.220
you say, that's not a representative sample in, in

1124
01:21:59.229 --> 01:22:04.549
a, in a rigorous statistical way. So you don't

1125
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.700
have a number that you can reveal and say,

1126
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:10.529
well, that this percentage of clients are really bad

1127
01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:17.790
people. But the idea that, that men who victimize

1128
01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:23.819
you uh are, are, are characterized clients. That's just

1129
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:28.299
not true. That's just not true. It is not

1130
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:34.490
true. There's one, there's 11 woman who uh she

1131
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.419
did a TED talk, she did a TED talk.

1132
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:39.689
She was one of the plaintiffs in a famous

1133
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:44.350
lawsuit in Canada, which got the laws, loss loss

1134
01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:48.089
changed up there. And she had this wonderful way

1135
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.709
of putting it. She said, you know, who are

1136
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.930
sex workers? Well, sex workers, we're, we're just normal

1137
01:22:53.939 --> 01:22:55.870
people, you know, and you meet us every day,

1138
01:22:55.970 --> 01:23:00.189
the grocery store and there are clients, clients are

1139
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.330
just normal people too. You know, there's an accountant,

1140
01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:05.720
there's a lawyer, there's this guy, there's that guy

1141
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.879
and i it's not true that they control everything

1142
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:16.080
that happens. But you know, it uh uh it,

1143
01:23:16.089 --> 01:23:19.520
in other words, it's ordinary, the, the, the relationship

1144
01:23:19.529 --> 01:23:22.689
is much more ordinary than people want to think.

1145
01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.370
Uh So what do you conclude from all this

1146
01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.430
clients? Are not victimizer. There are clients who are

1147
01:23:33.439 --> 01:23:36.200
criminals. There are clients who are murderers for God's

1148
01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:40.939
sake. It does happen. But that doesn't characterize clients

1149
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:44.020
as a matter of fact, another, another guy throw

1150
01:23:44.029 --> 01:23:48.529
this in another sex worker and, and more than

1151
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.149
one sex worker told me this, a lot of

1152
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.020
clients who want to talk, they wanna use a

1153
01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:56.060
sex workers therapist and one of them in particular

1154
01:23:56.069 --> 01:24:00.819
was telling me about this. She's actually uh she

1155
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:04.180
actually has a degree in physics and she edits

1156
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:07.729
physics notebooks. Just, you know, you gotta tell that

1157
01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.299
to your friend who says that all sex workers

1158
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.450
are coerced because they need the money. They don't

1159
01:24:12.459 --> 01:24:15.589
have any options and it's just crazy. But she

1160
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.790
was telling me, yeah, you know, I, I get,

1161
01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:21.830
I get clients who come by uh one, once

1162
01:24:21.859 --> 01:24:23.830
she's not just talking about one client plan will

1163
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.700
come by and we'll sit down there and we'll,

1164
01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:27.720
and we'll talk and we'll chat. He likes to

1165
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:31.160
talk and, and she says, you know, I realize

1166
01:24:31.169 --> 01:24:33.660
II I gotta let him know, you know, ti

1167
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:37.189
time is time is passing and you know, your

1168
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.240
hour or you to uh you know, it, it's

1169
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:44.720
almost up uh just to let him know and

1170
01:24:44.729 --> 01:24:46.580
he says, no, no, I just, I didn't wanna

1171
01:24:46.589 --> 01:24:51.209
talk. Let's just keep talking. Those kinds of images

1172
01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:57.640
are images that conventional people never get. They never,

1173
01:24:57.649 --> 01:25:01.290
they never see that picture of a client but

1174
01:25:01.299 --> 01:25:05.270
it's out there, they need to see it. Uh,

1175
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:12.120
DID the sex workers you interviewed, uh, uh, did

1176
01:25:12.129 --> 01:25:16.640
any one of them mentioned or complained about being

1177
01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:18.399
objectified?

1178
01:25:21.609 --> 01:25:25.490
No. Uh, I mean, that phrase is sort of

1179
01:25:25.569 --> 01:25:32.750
a infinitely malleable tool, I suppose. Um, uh HUH.

1180
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.870
Well, the answer is no. And it, it would

1181
01:25:37.879 --> 01:25:43.350
be odd if they did a, um, prohibitionists who

1182
01:25:43.359 --> 01:25:46.209
want to use that term and say, well, sex

1183
01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:49.979
workers are bad because, because uh once again, it's

1184
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:51.870
a man and a woman and the woman is

1185
01:25:51.879 --> 01:25:55.209
being objectified and you just have to throw up

1186
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.439
your hands and you simply have to ask what,

1187
01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:02.919
what and how they mean by that. If you

1188
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:09.520
mean that the only reason the man is paying

1189
01:26:09.529 --> 01:26:13.049
her is to have sex with her. Well, that

1190
01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:20.660
may be true. It also may be true that

1191
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:25.350
the woman doesn't want him to be interested in

1192
01:26:25.359 --> 01:26:30.500
anything else. There are, you know, uh sex workers

1193
01:26:30.509 --> 01:26:33.109
and, and, and she may be in this book

1194
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.379
or it may be in another article talking about,

1195
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.930
well, one of the more difficult things in her

1196
01:26:38.939 --> 01:26:44.495
work is managing the expectations of her client, clients,

1197
01:26:44.654 --> 01:26:47.334
clients who want to get to know her too

1198
01:26:47.345 --> 01:26:51.955
much. You know, our, our clients who AAA and,

1199
01:26:51.964 --> 01:26:54.875
and then there's another part of the job which

1200
01:26:54.884 --> 01:26:59.185
is emotional work. Someone will sell the girlfriend experience,

1201
01:26:59.365 --> 01:27:02.354
which means, which means at least you simulate an

1202
01:27:02.365 --> 01:27:07.830
emotional attachment, affection and kissing Well, I, I can

1203
01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:10.430
imagine very well that, that there's a woman who,

1204
01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:13.950
you know, doesn't want any of that. Just let's

1205
01:27:13.959 --> 01:27:16.850
just have sex and be done with it. She's

1206
01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:20.189
the one who, who wants that. It's just as

1207
01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.700
plausible to believe that the woman in this transaction

1208
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:30.120
really wants to limit it. Just a sexual act

1209
01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:33.270
as it is to think of the man as

1210
01:27:33.279 --> 01:27:35.790
doing that. There's, there's a lot of literature on

1211
01:27:35.799 --> 01:27:39.979
men who don't want just the sex. They want

1212
01:27:40.319 --> 01:27:50.939
some uh an un effective relationship, playful kissing, simulating

1213
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:58.700
a girlfriend um or just talking for. And once

1214
01:27:58.709 --> 01:28:01.319
again, there are all kinds, there are all kinds.

1215
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:05.500
Uh And if, if by objectify, you mean just

1216
01:28:05.509 --> 01:28:08.950
sex. Well, OK, that's a context and we just

1217
01:28:08.959 --> 01:28:13.600
sex is OK, if you mean they're always like

1218
01:28:13.609 --> 01:28:19.520
that. Uh They're always, always sort of not considerate

1219
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:22.350
of the woman. Is that what you mean? Well,

1220
01:28:22.359 --> 01:28:24.520
yeah, I'm sure there are rude clients out there.

1221
01:28:24.529 --> 01:28:27.919
No question about it. Does that characterize sex work?

1222
01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:33.240
No. Uh There, there are guys who are timid.

1223
01:28:34.049 --> 01:28:35.669
There are guys who don't know what to do.

1224
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:41.339
There are guys who want kinky stuff. There are

1225
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:45.569
guys who just want to talk. Uh There are

1226
01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.750
guys who are rude just because they're kind of

1227
01:28:47.759 --> 01:28:50.250
stupid and don't know any better. They're all guys.

1228
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:52.870
There are people, you know, they are human beings

1229
01:28:52.879 --> 01:28:57.009
but nothing about sex work. Uh Nothing that's intrinsic

1230
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:57.850
about sex work.

1231
01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:04.390
Right. So another type of claim that uh prohibitionists

1232
01:29:04.399 --> 01:29:09.629
make have to has to do with power dominance

1233
01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.109
where they say or claim that uh sex work

1234
01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:19.080
is the product of male domination and patriarchy. They

1235
01:29:19.089 --> 01:29:21.930
use words like that. So I I mean, is

1236
01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:27.149
there any way of empirically testing such a claim?

1237
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:31.919
Not precisely simply because the climate itself is not

1238
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:37.089
precise? Uh And, and the best you can do

1239
01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.899
is just, is just to try to speculate on

1240
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:43.779
why people say things like that. Since, since, as

1241
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:47.870
I've mentioned, empirically and talking to sex workers, there's

1242
01:29:47.879 --> 01:29:52.290
no basis to say that whatsoever. Uh And, and,

1243
01:29:52.299 --> 01:29:57.020
and perhaps the it is so I, so I

1244
01:29:57.029 --> 01:30:01.779
speculate and, and well, there's the old fashioned notion

1245
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:08.160
of women, women's place is in the home, a

1246
01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.319
man's place is to go out and make a

1247
01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:19.450
living that then that then spawns the idea of

1248
01:30:19.459 --> 01:30:24.729
women are economically dependent on men. Women are vulnerable

1249
01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:29.770
to men and which is obviously very true in,

1250
01:30:29.779 --> 01:30:35.299
in many respects. And so then, then your next

1251
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:38.850
thought is, well, you, you just think about all

1252
01:30:38.859 --> 01:30:41.830
women as being vulnerable to men. And the way

1253
01:30:41.839 --> 01:30:44.819
a woman survives is to attach herself to a

1254
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:48.439
man. And then if you have that in your

1255
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:53.750
head, and then you say, well, prostitution, there is

1256
01:30:53.759 --> 01:30:57.410
a way for a woman to survive, but she's

1257
01:30:57.419 --> 01:31:01.580
not getting marriage out of it, which in this,

1258
01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:04.080
this very old fashioned way of thinking is, is

1259
01:31:04.089 --> 01:31:07.129
the prize, the goal that she needs to get

1260
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:10.209
in order to economically survive. And so if you

1261
01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.069
think that way, then you think of the man

1262
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.450
as dangling economic viability in front of a woman

1263
01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.169
and she's out to try to get it. Now,

1264
01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.700
you have a picture of a power relationship that's

1265
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:27.839
very unhealthy and, and the man dominates the woman

1266
01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:32.689
economically. And that's the best I could do to

1267
01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.359
try to figure out why women would say, well,

1268
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:40.330
sex work is spawned by the patriarchy. It makes

1269
01:31:40.339 --> 01:31:42.209
as much sense to say that sex work is

1270
01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:47.029
spawned by women who don't want to be attached

1271
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.830
to a man, women who want other options and

1272
01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:54.339
men who discover their own power and decide they're

1273
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:58.500
going to use it. That's an equally plausible explanation

1274
01:31:58.509 --> 01:32:03.270
of the genesis of sex work. Uh And then,

1275
01:32:03.279 --> 01:32:10.330
you know, there's no substitute for, you know, forgetting

1276
01:32:10.339 --> 01:32:13.290
all the theories and they just sitting down and

1277
01:32:13.299 --> 01:32:17.529
talking to sex workers concretely and finding out what

1278
01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:20.810
benefits them in their lives and what doesn't. And

1279
01:32:20.819 --> 01:32:23.490
if you want, if you wanna talk about where

1280
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.270
it all comes from, that is, that is a

1281
01:32:26.279 --> 01:32:31.259
very, very difficult thing to do. Uh IS, you

1282
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:36.490
know, sex work has been in human cultures for

1283
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:41.720
a very, very long time. Women getting consideration for

1284
01:32:41.729 --> 01:32:46.270
sex is a normal and prevalent thing whether you

1285
01:32:46.279 --> 01:32:49.700
think it's a good thing or not and only,

1286
01:32:49.919 --> 01:32:55.629
you know, explicit monetary payment is called prostitution and,

1287
01:32:55.899 --> 01:33:00.720
and, and triggers this kind of stigma. So, you

1288
01:33:00.729 --> 01:33:02.609
know, if you wanna, if you wanna go into,

1289
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.310
you know, where does it all come from? It

1290
01:33:04.319 --> 01:33:08.180
would be an enormously complicated enterprise. And I suggest

1291
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:10.830
that it would be irrelevant for what kind of

1292
01:33:10.839 --> 01:33:14.879
laws you pass today about what sex workers are

1293
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:18.950
telling you today about what helps them or doesn't

1294
01:33:18.959 --> 01:33:19.580
help them.

1295
01:33:20.339 --> 01:33:23.319
So we've been talking about some of the main

1296
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:29.310
claims made by prohibitionists and also what sex workers

1297
01:33:29.319 --> 01:33:31.540
and also their clients have to say in their

1298
01:33:31.549 --> 01:33:36.040
own words about their own experiences. But uh there's

1299
01:33:36.049 --> 01:33:39.120
also as I mentioned earlier. So, uh there are

1300
01:33:39.129 --> 01:33:43.479
also some feminists out there that are, I will

1301
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:46.899
call them here. Sex positive there is they are,

1302
01:33:47.049 --> 01:33:50.270
they support the normalization of sex work and they

1303
01:33:50.279 --> 01:33:54.439
are for pornography and all of that. What do

1304
01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:58.640
you think about uh the role that they could

1305
01:33:58.649 --> 01:34:01.750
play in this sort of debates if they are

1306
01:34:01.759 --> 01:34:04.040
not sex workers themselves?

1307
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:12.990
Well, uh I was gonna say they play a

1308
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.089
great work until you added the caveat, not sex

1309
01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:20.410
workers themselves. A lot, a lot of the, a

1310
01:34:20.419 --> 01:34:23.870
lot of the very powerful voices out there are

1311
01:34:23.879 --> 01:34:26.979
women who have been sex workers. Uh But I'm

1312
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:30.680
sure not all of them and, and I'm sure

1313
01:34:30.689 --> 01:34:32.649
they would all consider themselves to be feminists and

1314
01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.799
have every right to consider those to be feminists

1315
01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:40.040
and their voices are very, very impressive. Uh, uh,

1316
01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:43.569
I simply didn't write a book about them. I

1317
01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:50.069
wrote a book about sex negative people. Ah, and,

1318
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.189
and I simply wasn't talking about them. They are

1319
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.549
out there and they are very, very impressive. I

1320
01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:02.080
mean, uh, uh, you know, Caitlin Bailey is, has

1321
01:35:02.379 --> 01:35:06.040
started the old pros. I've listened to her a

1322
01:35:06.049 --> 01:35:10.990
few times. She sounds most intelligent, articulate person. You

1323
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.060
can imagine. Uh, Norman G almodovar that I quote

1324
01:35:15.069 --> 01:35:20.049
in my book. Uh uh SHE has, she has

1325
01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:23.850
written her own book. She started her own organization,

1326
01:35:24.589 --> 01:35:28.799
Ella A Ella, I believe. And that's the only

1327
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:31.810
name I know her by. Uh SHE has been

1328
01:35:31.819 --> 01:35:35.669
a sex worker and she calls, she calls herself

1329
01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.209
a data scientist now. And every time I listen

1330
01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:43.790
to her, I say that's an accurate description. She

1331
01:35:43.799 --> 01:35:47.129
is a, she's a data fiend and, and she

1332
01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.930
does all kinds of uh uh all kinds of

1333
01:35:49.939 --> 01:35:55.589
statistical work about, about sex workers. Um And so

1334
01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:02.470
they're out there. Uh THEY have strong voices and

1335
01:36:02.479 --> 01:36:07.290
um there are uh you know, they are, they

1336
01:36:07.299 --> 01:36:11.910
are, they are leading the charge and a great

1337
01:36:11.919 --> 01:36:16.770
work, a great deal of work uh uh to

1338
01:36:16.779 --> 01:36:23.859
get legislators to either modify their prohibitions or to

1339
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:27.740
decriminalize sex work. And this is going on in

1340
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:34.379
Rhode Island, New York, Vermont. Um And you know,

1341
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:38.700
they're, you, you, you go on youtube and you

1342
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:41.790
can look up, you know, sex work legislation and

1343
01:36:41.799 --> 01:36:48.299
you will see sex work positivists lined up speaking

1344
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:53.209
to these legislative bodies and um so they're very

1345
01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:53.859
encouraging.

1346
01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:58.160
So, since earlier, we talked a little bit about

1347
01:36:58.169 --> 01:37:02.390
sex trafficking or the issue of traffic in the

1348
01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:08.250
sex industry, taking into account the that serious risk.

1349
01:37:08.259 --> 01:37:10.819
What do you think should be done then to

1350
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:13.319
prevent it as much as possible?

1351
01:37:14.459 --> 01:37:20.279
Well, uh you decriminalize consensual sex with and make

1352
01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:27.129
allies of sex workers and then a big, big

1353
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:31.450
problem, we get honest statistics so that you know

1354
01:37:31.459 --> 01:37:34.890
what you're up against and then you can fight

1355
01:37:34.899 --> 01:37:38.319
it and then you can fight it. Uh um

1356
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:44.759
YOU know, and, and you need to fight it

1357
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:48.500
but you'll have allies and sex workers, you will

1358
01:37:48.509 --> 01:37:52.270
know, you will know if you have good numbers,

1359
01:37:52.549 --> 01:37:55.060
you will know where it's hap happening and you

1360
01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:59.430
may get a handle on why it's happening. Uh

1361
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.470
11 problem with numbers, for example is every time

1362
01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.629
we have a Super Bowl in the United States,

1363
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:12.250
there are people who run around and say, oh

1364
01:38:12.259 --> 01:38:15.060
no, now you're going to have a lot of

1365
01:38:15.069 --> 01:38:21.819
prostitution and a lot of trafficking. So then uh

1366
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.790
uh what will happen is you will, you will

1367
01:38:24.799 --> 01:38:31.859
form a anti trafficking, law enforcement task force and

1368
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:35.379
it's all about trafficking and you'll go out and

1369
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:38.689
you make a big AAA big production of this

1370
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.560
when all the crowds here for the Super Bowl

1371
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.339
and then you'll read in the paper about arrests

1372
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:47.609
that were made by the anti trafficking people. Sorry,

1373
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:52.939
we made 40 arrests. And that's it. Well, so

1374
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:55.930
the ordinary person reading the paper says the anti

1375
01:38:55.939 --> 01:38:59.939
trafficking force made 40 arrests. Oh, we've been saved

1376
01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:04.910
from traffickers. How good. Well, they don't tell you

1377
01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:10.120
that the people they arrested were traffickers. They just

1378
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:14.209
say the anti trafficking force made the arrest. Well,

1379
01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.850
the only thing the anti trafficking force is doing

1380
01:39:16.859 --> 01:39:21.660
is going out there harassing prostitutes because, well, somewhere

1381
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:23.799
there must be trafficking. So they go on, they

1382
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:26.359
arrest a whole bunch of consenting protests and their

1383
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:29.729
arrests, they really were arrested. There really were 40

1384
01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:32.620
of them and you know, maybe they found one

1385
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:36.040
person who was 17 years old instead of 18

1386
01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:39.589
years old, that's underage. So that, that counts as

1387
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.350
a trafficking victim and that's what happened. So uh

1388
01:39:43.359 --> 01:39:44.899
now what I, what I'm saying is you have

1389
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:47.890
to get honest numbers about what the problem really

1390
01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:49.810
is. If you can get a handle with the

1391
01:39:49.819 --> 01:39:53.830
problem, what the problem really is and you decriminalize

1392
01:39:53.839 --> 01:39:58.109
prostitute. Now we can rationally fight traffic. And one

1393
01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.049
other thing I should add, there are a lot

1394
01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.350
of people who believe that a person who is

1395
01:40:03.359 --> 01:40:07.839
a migrant to your country and a sex worker

1396
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:12.439
must be trafficked. And in the United States immigration,

1397
01:40:13.939 --> 01:40:17.669
it's a big, big hot issue and illegal immigration

1398
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:22.120
is a big, big hot issue. And it uh

1399
01:40:23.459 --> 01:40:28.720
and so when, when you see, when you, when

1400
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:31.709
you find a person who's a migrant, especially from

1401
01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.240
a poor country and they're doing sex work. Then

1402
01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:38.479
immediately people think of trafficking after all, think of

1403
01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:42.609
the word trafficking. It must be movement actually, legally,

1404
01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.220
it doesn't mean movement. It's nothing to do with

1405
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:47.080
movement. But that's the word that's in people's lives.

1406
01:40:47.129 --> 01:40:50.390
Trafficking. You traffic a migrant and so now they're

1407
01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:53.959
doing prostitution. So you arrest the migrant for prostitution.

1408
01:40:53.970 --> 01:40:57.600
Now, you think you've done something about trafficking nonsense?

1409
01:40:58.959 --> 01:41:01.240
She is like she is like any other sex

1410
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:04.859
worker. She's, she's trying, she's trying to find the

1411
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:09.490
best economic option that she can. One economic action

1412
01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.459
was to sneak into the United States. The second

1413
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:16.700
economic option was to sell sex. That's what's happening,

1414
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:20.709
that's not trafficking. So you have all this corruption

1415
01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.649
of traffic trafficking statistics. So you really don't know

1416
01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:26.339
what to find or where to find. Fix that

1417
01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:31.419
decriminalize work with sex workers and you fight trafficking.

1418
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:35.509
So just for this last part of our conversation,

1419
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.379
I have a couple of questions for you specifically

1420
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:43.689
about the clients because we've been focusing mostly on,

1421
01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:48.240
for example, how sex workers are stigmatized. But in

1422
01:41:48.250 --> 01:41:51.629
the case of the clients, in what ways are

1423
01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.680
they stigmatized? And what are some of the most

1424
01:41:54.689 --> 01:41:59.770
common ideas that people have about the clients of

1425
01:41:59.779 --> 01:42:00.770
sex workers?

1426
01:42:01.959 --> 01:42:08.589
Well, they're stigmatized. Uh I think the, the advantage

1427
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.779
that a client has is in the long run,

1428
01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:16.750
he may be able to hide the fact that

1429
01:42:16.759 --> 01:42:19.330
he's a client a lot better than the woman

1430
01:42:19.339 --> 01:42:21.830
can hide the fact that she's a sex worker.

1431
01:42:22.029 --> 01:42:26.819
But there's no question that women are subjected to

1432
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:31.879
a much greater stereotype of a spoiled identity, the

1433
01:42:31.890 --> 01:42:36.830
old fashioned view of sexual purity and the old

1434
01:42:36.839 --> 01:42:40.770
fashioned view of sexual quantity and being destroyed. And

1435
01:42:40.779 --> 01:42:43.509
now your identity is destroyed and, and you can

1436
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.490
never go back and recover all that kind of

1437
01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.149
crap, uh, is out there that a woman has

1438
01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.310
to face but men are, men are stigmatized. I

1439
01:42:53.319 --> 01:42:57.109
mean, uh, in the old fashioned way, they're stigmatized

1440
01:42:57.299 --> 01:43:01.040
because they're seen as doing something icky. You're having

1441
01:43:01.049 --> 01:43:04.370
sex with a prostitute who's, who's, you know, very

1442
01:43:04.379 --> 01:43:08.529
undesirable. You may get s may get AAA disease

1443
01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:11.839
from her and you're a loser. Only a loser

1444
01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:16.279
would have to pay for sex. Nowadays, it's evolving

1445
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:20.910
and, and the evolving stereotype is, you must be

1446
01:43:20.919 --> 01:43:24.169
harming someone. You must be harming someone because you

1447
01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:29.140
paid for sex. Uh, AND that, uh, that does

1448
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:34.459
not compare to the stereotype of a woman who's

1449
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:37.500
somehow been branded for life in a spoiled identity.

1450
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:40.180
It doesn't compare with that. But nevertheless, it's a,

1451
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:44.700
it's a real, it's a real stereotype that, uh,

1452
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:48.810
that men suffer if they, if they, they pay

1453
01:43:48.819 --> 01:43:51.209
for sex and they don't want to say it

1454
01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:55.839
and it doesn't, uh, it doesn't increase your, it's

1455
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:58.879
not supposed to increase your self esteem. But, you

1456
01:43:58.890 --> 01:44:02.750
know, iiii, I was happy to find the clients

1457
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:09.149
talking. And you'll notice, uh, this is apropos to,

1458
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:13.520
to stigma. It's actually easier to find sex workers

1459
01:44:13.759 --> 01:44:17.120
to interview than it is to find clients. All

1460
01:44:17.129 --> 01:44:22.240
right. You know. Uh uh, SO I was fortunate

1461
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:25.990
in finding, uh, client statements that I was able

1462
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.120
to put the book and, um, you know, what

1463
01:44:30.129 --> 01:44:33.939
comes through is their ordinariness. That's a theme that

1464
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:38.450
I think of is ordinary, uh, for conventionally minded

1465
01:44:38.459 --> 01:44:45.700
people. There is a big chasm between real life

1466
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:48.310
and sex work and sex work has got to

1467
01:44:48.319 --> 01:44:51.529
be something really, really strange. It's either a really,

1468
01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:55.549
really bad thing or it's a really, really empowering

1469
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.729
thing or, you know, the woman is really, really

1470
01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.229
undesirable or she's really, really desirable but it's, it's

1471
01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:08.370
different and that's, that's what's not true. Uh, uh,

1472
01:45:08.859 --> 01:45:14.700
SEX workers and clients are ordinary people. Yeah. The

1473
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:19.049
sex that they engage in is enjoyable for ordinary

1474
01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:24.609
reasons and it is surprising how little money changes

1475
01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.790
that and that's very, very difficult for conventional people

1476
01:45:28.799 --> 01:45:32.370
to believe. Um, I digressed a little bit there,

1477
01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:36.180
uh, with the clients, they suffer stereotypes. It's not

1478
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:39.109
like a woman's stereotype. And what they have to

1479
01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.500
say is, gee, I'm happy that, you know, that

1480
01:45:44.509 --> 01:45:47.069
I found this, I found this woman and, and

1481
01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:51.759
you can find, you can find, uh uh and

1482
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:57.850
then talk about bad experiences. Uh, BUT it's interesting

1483
01:45:57.859 --> 01:46:01.140
up in Washington DC, they had a big anti

1484
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:07.700
trafficking bust and they busted people who talked about

1485
01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:14.439
the sex workers, uh, that day, uh, that they

1486
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:19.410
hired on this website and they got busted for

1487
01:46:19.419 --> 01:46:23.180
it for promoting prostitution. Well, if you look at

1488
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:25.529
the website, if you look at the things they

1489
01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:29.549
said, most of them are very positive. These men

1490
01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.810
are hanging around saying very positive thing. I said,

1491
01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:33.970
well, I really like her. I hope she doesn't

1492
01:46:33.979 --> 01:46:36.490
move, you know? And, oh, wow, this one is

1493
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.060
really nice and oh my God, you know, and

1494
01:46:41.069 --> 01:46:42.549
of course you have bad on you. You have

1495
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.600
bad clients like I've said and, and sometimes there

1496
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:52.009
are bad experiences. Yeah, that happens. But you know,

1497
01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.660
the atmosphere created by this website was a very

1498
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:59.930
positive one about sex workers. My God. Do you,

1499
01:46:59.939 --> 01:47:00.169
do you

1500
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:00.560
think

1501
01:47:00.569 --> 01:47:05.279
that of course, with your experience not only interviewing

1502
01:47:05.290 --> 01:47:10.279
some sex workers and also some clients and uh

1503
01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:14.990
dealing with or reading or learning about the, some

1504
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.100
of the arguments put forth by prohibitionists, do you

1505
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:23.870
get the sense that most of these ideas that

1506
01:47:23.879 --> 01:47:28.549
they have or develop about sex work itself, the

1507
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.350
sex workers? And then also the clients stem mostly

1508
01:47:33.359 --> 01:47:37.754
from them having specific moral values that they are,

1509
01:47:37.765 --> 01:47:42.285
for example, more socially conservative. And so they associate

1510
01:47:42.294 --> 01:47:46.884
sex work with something that goes against, for example,

1511
01:47:46.895 --> 01:47:51.604
family values monogamy and stuff like that. I mean,

1512
01:47:51.615 --> 01:47:54.584
is, do you get that sense from what you

1513
01:47:54.595 --> 01:47:55.685
studied there or

1514
01:47:55.694 --> 01:48:01.379
not? My sense? Is that, let's just say morals,

1515
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:06.220
the sense of morals that is so deeply intertwined

1516
01:48:06.979 --> 01:48:14.370
and everything that is said, uh except for the

1517
01:48:14.379 --> 01:48:21.259
most bare bones, empirical analysts that you really can't

1518
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:29.020
parse out moral underpinnings. And what may be just

1519
01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:38.620
other philosophical underpinnings or abstract underpinnings, even though the

1520
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:44.229
21st century is, is different than the 20th century

1521
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.890
and certainly different than the 19th century. All of

1522
01:48:47.899 --> 01:48:56.770
us have been raised in a culture that, that

1523
01:48:56.779 --> 01:49:01.129
has something to say, something moral to say about

1524
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:05.259
sex and something moral to say about women and

1525
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:09.859
something moral to say about sex work. We've grown

1526
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:13.009
up in that culture. We didn't just go to

1527
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:17.669
school and learn it. It was inculcated in us

1528
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.819
as Children. To me, it's obvious that that never

1529
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:30.470
goes away when I listen to prohibitionists talk about

1530
01:49:30.479 --> 01:49:35.459
the maladies of sex work. It's just floating around

1531
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:41.250
back there all the time. Uh And it's what,

1532
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:45.100
you know, i it's what, what means I think

1533
01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.290
to a large extent, it is the reason why

1534
01:49:49.299 --> 01:49:52.049
people can get away with using the words like

1535
01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:57.890
exploitation and power differential without defining it without getting

1536
01:49:57.899 --> 01:50:00.209
careful of what they're saying. They can get away

1537
01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.450
with that because they're talking to people with this

1538
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.009
moral substratum in the back of their minds. It's

1539
01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.799
sort of there, it's an audience that's waiting to

1540
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:17.350
hear that and they can get away with it.

1541
01:50:17.359 --> 01:50:21.799
Uh uh WHICH is all the more reason why

1542
01:50:23.649 --> 01:50:28.370
we have to emphasize concrete things that sex workers

1543
01:50:28.379 --> 01:50:32.629
say and, and it just seems to me that

1544
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.899
that's a more effective way to talk and this

1545
01:50:38.549 --> 01:50:41.629
conventional world that we live in rather than trying

1546
01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:47.129
to sort of out philosophize or out moralize the

1547
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.750
moralists. It's, it's, uh, you end up going in

1548
01:50:51.759 --> 01:50:56.549
circles and people, people can have the moral beliefs

1549
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.549
that they believe. My point is, well, listen to

1550
01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.080
what sex workers say and maybe you'll leave them

1551
01:51:02.089 --> 01:51:04.689
alone and you can just, you know, you can,

1552
01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.890
you can have the morals that you wanna have.

1553
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:11.819
But before you start imposing them on sex workers,

1554
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:14.560
listen to the concrete things that they have to

1555
01:51:14.569 --> 01:51:15.089
say.

1556
01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:20.279
So I have one final question. Then earlier, you

1557
01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:26.310
talked about decriminalization as a solution to sex trafficking,

1558
01:51:26.319 --> 01:51:30.620
for example. But another approach that some people left

1559
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:37.109
to prostitution is the the end demand approach. So

1560
01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.330
could you tell us about that approach? And do

1561
01:51:40.339 --> 01:51:43.950
you think that it would solve any of the

1562
01:51:43.959 --> 01:51:49.109
issues identified by sex, negative people, sex, negative feminists

1563
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.089
and so on? And that it wouldn't, it would

1564
01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:55.439
even be good for the sex workers themselves?

1565
01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:01.040
Well, we've got research on that. OK, by and

1566
01:52:01.049 --> 01:52:04.259
large. The answer is no, Sweden is the one

1567
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:08.270
who started this, say, well, we'll outlaw buying sex

1568
01:52:08.279 --> 01:52:14.419
but we won't outlaw selling it. And oh, that

1569
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:19.609
is sold uh as an abstract issue. The same

1570
01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.859
way anything else is solved is because it, it

1571
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:24.799
hurts women. So let's punish the men. But then

1572
01:52:24.810 --> 01:52:29.060
you add on to that the assumption that women

1573
01:52:29.069 --> 01:52:34.669
themselves are sort of these Children, you infantilize Children

1574
01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.589
say, well, they really don't have anything to do

1575
01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:42.060
with it. This is all doing of men. So

1576
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:47.370
we'll just outlaw men. The more, the more empirical

1577
01:52:47.439 --> 01:52:51.669
effort was to say, we will do the end

1578
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.089
in demand in order to eradicate trafficking as a

1579
01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:59.379
way to as an empirical matter. You know, if

1580
01:52:59.390 --> 01:53:04.600
you outlaw buying sex, the market will dry up

1581
01:53:04.799 --> 01:53:08.279
for sex slaves, you want sex slaves. And the

1582
01:53:09.129 --> 01:53:17.100
statistical analysis is complex. But the results are pretty

1583
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:21.419
much out now that in Sweden, there's no, there's

1584
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:25.100
no evidence that that decreased traffic didn't happen. I

1585
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:28.279
have not seen evidence from any other country that

1586
01:53:28.290 --> 01:53:34.180
later on took up that manner other Scandinavian countries.

1587
01:53:35.049 --> 01:53:37.339
France is a late entry. Israel is a late

1588
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:41.879
entry. Both the Irelands did it. I have not

1589
01:53:41.890 --> 01:53:45.689
seen evidence in any of those locations that say

1590
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:52.129
if you do inman trafficking decreases now. So that's

1591
01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.350
the, that's the empirical evidence for it. No, let's

1592
01:53:56.359 --> 01:53:58.569
just think about it. Just think about it lo

1593
01:53:58.709 --> 01:54:06.890
logically as it stands now. Trafficking is illegal even

1594
01:54:06.899 --> 01:54:10.750
in a jurisdiction that decriminalizes the whole thing, even

1595
01:54:10.759 --> 01:54:14.049
like New Zealand or New South Wales trafficking is

1596
01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:21.930
a crime. It's a serious crime. OK? So now

1597
01:54:21.939 --> 01:54:25.520
you have, now you have people who say well,

1598
01:54:25.529 --> 01:54:29.330
OK, if, if you have a jurisdiction, any jurisdiction

1599
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:32.419
or let, let's say a, a jurisdiction where it's

1600
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:36.859
decriminalized, but we need to add on to that

1601
01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:41.990
the criminalization of customers. So what is the customer

1602
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.859
supposed to think? I mean, if the, the customer

1603
01:54:49.029 --> 01:54:51.770
is not most jurisdiction, most jurisdiction in the United

1604
01:54:51.779 --> 01:54:57.180
States. Mm Sex work is a misdemeanor and New

1605
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:59.669
Zealand is not a crime at all and that

1606
01:55:00.479 --> 01:55:03.060
uh but sex work happens both in the United

1607
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:08.770
States. New Zealand customers are not deterred by it

1608
01:55:08.779 --> 01:55:16.700
being a misdemeanor. The in demand suggests as far

1609
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:20.709
as I can see that, that, that you keep

1610
01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.330
those same prohibition laws, but you only apply them

1611
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:28.859
to the, to the buyer if you keep those

1612
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:33.080
same prohibition laws in place, that means it's a

1613
01:55:33.089 --> 01:55:38.140
misdemeanor for the guy to buy sex. It is

1614
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:46.779
a felony to engage in trafficking. If that felony,

1615
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:49.509
the fact that you will go to prison if

1616
01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:53.779
that is not a deterrent, why do you believe

1617
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.759
that it being a misdemeanor if you buy sex

1618
01:55:57.770 --> 01:56:02.240
from anyone is going to deter you? I and

1619
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:04.540
I, I know I went on, I went round

1620
01:56:04.549 --> 01:56:08.879
and round about that a bit. Say I'm, I'm

1621
01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:14.520
a male and, and, and I'm thinking about, I'm,

1622
01:56:14.529 --> 01:56:17.859
I'm, I'm gonna buy a slave. I'm gonna engage

1623
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:22.620
in sex trafficking. And then, and then I realized

1624
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:25.649
if I get caught that is a felony, I

1625
01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:30.609
will go to prison. And then I think, well,

1626
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:36.549
now if I if I do that, that will

1627
01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.149
also be a misdemeanor. So gee whiz I won't

1628
01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.729
do it. Does that make any sense? If the

1629
01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:48.359
fact that it is a felony does not deter

1630
01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:54.089
me? Why would a misdemeanor prostitution violation deter me?

1631
01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:59.060
But that is what the inman theory is. It

1632
01:56:59.069 --> 01:57:05.009
is, it is, it is make all prostitution illegal.

1633
01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:08.859
This, this, this misdemeanor but just for the buyer,

1634
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:16.080
it doesn't make sense that that would deter criminals

1635
01:57:16.939 --> 01:57:21.000
for abducting and forcing people that's not a deterrent.

1636
01:57:21.379 --> 01:57:26.080
They, they hide from you and they're willing to

1637
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:30.640
risk prison. And you know, e even if that

1638
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:35.879
was a little too convoluted, the point is research

1639
01:57:35.890 --> 01:57:42.689
has been done. Uh It doesn't work, it has

1640
01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:46.009
some effects I think in Sweden for some time,

1641
01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:50.500
sex workers move from the street indoors. Maybe that

1642
01:57:50.509 --> 01:57:53.540
made people happy. Although now they may have moved

1643
01:57:53.549 --> 01:57:58.529
back out. Sex workers will tell you uh you

1644
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:03.089
know what happens, what happens when you, when you

1645
01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:07.509
criminalize my clients, you know, you pretend to have

1646
01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:09.990
compassion for me. This is the root of it.

1647
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.589
All. You wanna help me, you have compassion for

1648
01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.740
me. So you outlaw my clients. You know what

1649
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:23.439
happens? What happens is my respectable law blinding clients

1650
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:25.609
that I love. They don't come to see me

1651
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:30.080
anymore. I'm left with the criminals, the people who

1652
01:58:30.089 --> 01:58:32.240
don't care about the law, the people who don't

1653
01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:36.370
care about respectability. It just makes my client base

1654
01:58:36.379 --> 01:58:39.959
worse that's one of the things that sex workers

1655
01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:44.279
actually say about it. But you know, it is.

1656
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:47.200
Um IT'S a funny theory because in the end

1657
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:53.040
it infantilize women. It doesn't recognize the fact that

1658
01:58:53.049 --> 01:58:56.500
sex work is something that women choose because it's

1659
01:58:56.509 --> 01:59:01.299
the best option. You're not helping her by putting

1660
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:04.759
a cop at her door and saying we're not

1661
01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:08.189
going to let the clients in. And by the

1662
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.919
way, we're doing this because we love you sex

1663
01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:15.020
worker, we have compassion for you. So we're not

1664
01:59:15.029 --> 01:59:18.040
gonna give you a better job. We're just going

1665
01:59:18.049 --> 01:59:20.609
to put a cop at your doorstep and not

1666
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:23.520
let your clients come in. That makes no sense.

1667
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:26.709
That makes no legal sense. That makes no moral

1668
01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:28.060
sense. Great.

1669
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:31.370
So let's send on that note then and the

1670
01:59:31.379 --> 01:59:35.060
book is again sex workers and their clients in

1671
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:37.830
their own words. Of course, I'm leaving a link

1672
01:59:37.839 --> 01:59:40.520
to it in the description of the interview and

1673
01:59:40.529 --> 01:59:44.600
Doctor Mosley just before we go, are there any

1674
01:59:44.609 --> 01:59:47.490
places on the internet where people can find your

1675
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:51.810
work? Or are there any online resources you would

1676
01:59:51.819 --> 01:59:52.890
like to point to?

1677
01:59:53.459 --> 01:59:55.709
Well, you, you can just put in the title

1678
01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:59.120
and you can find it. The publisher is Paul

1679
01:59:59.129 --> 02:00:02.479
Gray mcmillan and you can go into their website

1680
02:00:02.490 --> 02:00:06.830
and find when you find the book, uh you

1681
02:00:06.839 --> 02:00:11.350
can actually purchase individual chapters if you like. That's
