00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.710
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.270
today I'm joined by Doctor Tais Panani. She is

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.710
an associate researcher at the the Smithsonian Museum of

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.430
Natural History. Her main research questions are about human.

6
00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:19.504
Interaction with the Pleistocene megafauna in the Americas and

7
00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:22.545
the people in of the Americas. So today we're

8
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.225
going to talk about uh humans arrival in the

9
00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:30.024
Americas and megafauna there and its extinction. Those are

10
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.895
the two main topics we're going to cover. So,

11
00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:35.325
Doctor Panzani, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

12
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:35.935
to everyone.

13
00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:41.819
Hello, welcome, and thank you for um asking me

14
00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.740
for to join this interview and for the opportunity

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.250
to talk a little bit about these topics that

16
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.860
I think is fascinating. So really happy to be

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.409
here. Thanks for the invitation.

18
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.540
No, it's really fascinating and I've already talked a

19
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.259
little bit with some other anthropologists on the show

20
00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.459
about the people of the Americas, so I would

21
00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.799
really like to get some more details today. So,

22
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.440
but uh let's start with perhaps uh a timeline

23
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.400
here. So do we know when exactly Homo sapiens

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.279
arrived in the Americas?

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.260
We know what is for sure the timing that

26
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.779
humans were in the Americas. So we know that

27
00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:27.580
for sure humans got to the Americas around 15,000

28
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.699
years ago. That is what is settled in archaeology,

29
00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:39.209
anthropology, paleontology, but it's still a huge discussion because

30
00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.910
We have several researchers, including myself, who worked with

31
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.470
earlier archaeological sites and claim for evidence that humans

32
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.349
were in the Americas. Around at least 20 or

33
00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.160
even before 20,000 years ago, which is the time

34
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.190
uh for the last ice age, so we call

35
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.139
the last glacial maximum. So during 26 to 19,000

36
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:15.149
years ago, we have our last ice age, so.

37
00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:21.630
This timing, like from before 19,000 years ago is

38
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.059
kind of complicated. Some researchers think that uh how

39
00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.320
we would be able to cross uh Siberia to

40
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.839
the Americas, so it's still like a lot of

41
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.639
discussion regarding earlier dates. So we know for sure

42
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.000
that around 15,000 years ago, humans got here, but

43
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.800
we have evidence for maybe earlier.

44
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.419
Mhm. And uh how long did it take for

45
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.419
humans to populate uh the entire continent or the

46
00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.100
two continents if we consider North America and South

47
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.820
America, to different continents. Uh, HOW long did it

48
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.490
take for us to arrive in uh in North

49
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.449
America and then to go all the way down

50
00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.470
to the tip of South America?

51
00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.600
That is also a great question that we were

52
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.850
still investigating and we are still discussing. So we

53
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.779
have a very solid um archaeological site and evidence

54
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.580
in Chile here in South America, uh, that dates

55
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.020
to at least 14, 14,000 years ago, maybe 15,000

56
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.279
years ago. So we know that humans were in

57
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.169
South America at least 15,000 years ago. Maybe earlier

58
00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.199
than 18,000 years ago, there's another layer in this

59
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:43.410
same archaeological site called Montei that we still researchers

60
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.710
are still uh a little skeptical and so maybe

61
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.169
another layer that shows evidence far earlier than 18,000

62
00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.490
years ago, but we have solid evidence uh that.

63
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.479
Most archaeologists should they accept that humans were in

64
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:06.550
Chile and Montever at least 1514, 15,000 years ago.

65
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.720
But we, like I said, maybe we were here

66
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.399
earlier, so we still don't know and we still

67
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.839
don't know the routes, we don't know how they

68
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.529
got to the Americas, if it was in the

69
00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.880
Pacific coast or the Atlantic coast or inland or

70
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.450
several routes, so all that is is still debated.

71
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.809
Yeah, I understand there's lots of uncertainty here, but

72
00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.170
I mean, if we were already in South America

73
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.640
by 15, 14,000 years ago, then if what you

74
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.850
mentioned earlier about we getting to the Americas, to

75
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.690
North America specifically 15,000 years ago, then it was

76
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.799
over just the course of like, what, uh around

77
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:55.500
1000 years that we went from Uh, North America

78
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.010
down to South America. Am I getting that right?

79
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.239
Yes, some researchers say that this was the starting

80
00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:07.619
point, so humans got to the Americas around 15,000

81
00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:10.089
years ago. So in this perspective, if that would

82
00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.464
be like a. Very fast uh human migration to

83
00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:18.385
all the Americas, which is another uh evidence, I

84
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:21.545
think for like, yeah, maybe humans got to North

85
00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:25.024
America way earlier, so we have the time for

86
00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:27.375
all this migration to South America.

87
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.739
Yeah. And so, uh, just to go a little

88
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.130
bit back for a second. So, uh, what is

89
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.769
the best understanding we have right now about the

90
00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.160
way we got to the Americas? I mean, from,

91
00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:48.679
let's say, Northeastern Asia to America. How did we

92
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.329
get there?

93
00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.440
So for a long time, we thought about the

94
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.829
inland route that is when humans uh after the

95
00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.670
last ice age when, because during the ice age,

96
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:07.200
everything was covert, especially North America, like almost all

97
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.450
Canada in great part of the continental, continental United

98
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.309
States was covert, were covered um with ice sheets,

99
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.040
so Uh, the ice age made almost impossible for

100
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.029
humans to walk. It was like blocking the, uh,

101
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.429
North America, uh, land portion. So after the the

102
00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:34.510
glaciation of these ice sheets and when the climate

103
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.040
was better and favorable for human migrations, we thought

104
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.160
that humans from uh Asia, from Northeast Asia, they

105
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.850
walk inland. To the North America from Siberia and

106
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.130
then North America and then south, the continent. So

107
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.690
this is one main route, especially for a long

108
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.690
time it was supposed to be the only route,

109
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.290
but then when we start to see all these

110
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.114
different and urge uh, archaeological site than the Clovis

111
00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:11.165
culture that was for a long time also considering,

112
00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:18.114
considered the major ar um evidence for the first

113
00:07:18.114 --> 00:07:22.035
Americans, especially in Chile, which is also in the

114
00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:26.410
Pacific coast. Uh, WE start to think about and

115
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.609
not other possibilities, other routes. And after Chile, uh,

116
00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.380
researchers, especially in the US, start to find other

117
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.049
archaeological sites in the Pacific coast of the US,

118
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:42.989
so Oregon, California. So they came to the con

119
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:46.619
the conclusion, the hypothesis of a new theory, which

120
00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:50.959
was the, that humans walk from the Pacific coast.

121
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.540
So they were walking, even if the inland was

122
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.269
covered with Ice, it doesn't matter because we have

123
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.950
the beach, you know, like we have the Pacific

124
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.309
coast so we walk and we have the sea

125
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.709
we, we can fish we can sometimes go a

126
00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:11.589
little bit in in um into the forests and

127
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:14.950
hunt, but we, we have like this whole uh

128
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.829
rich ecosystem in the Pacific coast. So we just

129
00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:25.489
walk through also the same um. Origin, that is

130
00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:29.130
like Northeast Asia, and then we walked through the

131
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.270
Pacific coast. So this is the 2nd main route.

132
00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:35.880
But like I say, I think I'm gonna be

133
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.039
like the whole interview saying like, we still don't

134
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.989
know, we're still talking, we're still discussing. So, um,

135
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.590
so far we have like these two main routes.

136
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.280
We don't know if maybe it happens first through

137
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.669
the Pacific and then another migration wave happened in

138
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:58.049
inland or maybe happen simultaneously. So uh we're still

139
00:08:58.049 --> 00:09:01.710
discussing the timings for that. And even now we

140
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.070
have another possibility that it was maybe the same

141
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:12.150
um post migration, but in the Atlantic. So uh

142
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.909
we have the continent so we can go to

143
00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:18.580
the Pacific Ocean, and we have the Atlantic Ocean.

144
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.270
So maybe humans also was on the border of

145
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.080
the continent and was moving to the Atlantic coast.

146
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.960
Which makes sense also when you think about really

147
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.080
early archaeological sites in Brazil that is in northeast

148
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.119
Brazil that is really close to the Atlantic Ocean

149
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:42.210
and we have uh researchers working there claiming for

150
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.710
evidence for humans around 20, maybe 30,000 years ago.

151
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.090
Mhm. Or perhaps if we're still not sure about

152
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.849
the routes that humans took back then, maybe there

153
00:09:56.849 --> 00:10:00.840
could have been a population splits and two different

154
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.119
populations could have gone through the two different coasts,

155
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.969
right, the Pacific coast and the Atlantic coast, that

156
00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:09.570
could have happened as well, I imagine.

157
00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:15.630
Exactly, and we have a genetic evidence of about

158
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.770
uh Native Americans that shows that the current Native

159
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:26.700
Americans, they are descendant from uh Asian population. So

160
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.989
we know for sure that our Native Americans have

161
00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:38.909
this ancestors ancestry uh to um with thisberian And

162
00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:46.030
the North Asia, Asian uh populations, but, uh, maybe

163
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.590
they also come from like this more recent migration

164
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.500
wave maybe we have other migration waves from other

165
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.229
routes that maybe Pacific or Atlantic coast that didn't

166
00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:02.270
succeed. It's, it's hard to say didn't succeed because

167
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.859
they succeed for a specific time, but they didn't.

168
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:12.289
Pass their genes and that's why we, we don't

169
00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:15.409
find that in the genetic history yet but even

170
00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:20.679
the genetics are very in their genetics is improving

171
00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.770
recently so we are being able to find uh

172
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.940
DNA and sediments and other things, not just bones,

173
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:36.090
but sediments rather than just skeletons, human skeletons. So

174
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.440
we are Finding new interesting uh stuffs, and I

175
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.239
think that we have potential to find more, more

176
00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:44.039
stuff about that.

177
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.590
Mhm. So, uh, before we change topics, let me

178
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.390
just ask you this just to make sure of

179
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.869
this point. So we Homo sapiens were the first

180
00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:59.630
and the only hominid species to get to the

181
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.390
Americas, right? I mean, it was not that some

182
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.210
other species prior to us, like, I don't know,

183
00:12:06.349 --> 00:12:09.669
Homo erectuss or a descendant of Homo erectus got

184
00:12:09.669 --> 00:12:10.950
to the Americas,

185
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.640
right. I love that I'm gonna say the same

186
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.909
thing again. I'm kidding, for sure, no, for sure,

187
00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:20.210
for sure, like the solid evidence is that Homo

188
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.960
sapiens was the first and so far the only

189
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.010
one to,, a species to reach the Americas. But

190
00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:32.000
as science is crazy and beautiful, we have, uh,

191
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:38.174
evidence in California. Archaeological site in California that those

192
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:43.854
uh authors who wrote that paper uh talk and

193
00:12:43.984 --> 00:12:47.065
claimed that some human, and they don't know, they

194
00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:50.744
don't say, oh definitely Homo sapiens, and then is

195
00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:53.825
this uh a specific topic and discussion about oh

196
00:12:53.825 --> 00:12:59.585
maybe another uh species, maybe another human. So they

197
00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:03.025
claim evidence in California in this archaeological site that

198
00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:08.840
is called um My I forgot the name of

199
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.500
the the site right now is just uh fade

200
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.679
away Cerruchierucche, I think if I remember, I'll, I'll

201
00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.609
I'll remember here. So yeah, so like in this

202
00:13:21.609 --> 00:13:27.059
um mesodon probably related uh side they found evidence

203
00:13:27.059 --> 00:13:32.989
for fractures of mesodon. Maodons. So they think that

204
00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:39.059
it's human intentional break breakage of these bonds. So,

205
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.820
uh, but this site dates to 130,000 years ago,

206
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:49.590
so it's like way earlier. Most cha archaeologists do

207
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.700
not accept this evidence. They think it's natural breakage,

208
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.940
um, but the authors think that, yeah, humans broke

209
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.750
those bonds. And not necessarily homo sapiens. So we

210
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:07.390
do have like some or other uh Little bit

211
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.280
of discussions regarding that. So I just wanted to

212
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.479
introduce this here, even that is not widely accepted

213
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.640
in archaeology, in American archaeology, but just to give

214
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.919
an idea of of how science is, uh, science

215
00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:25.280
is dynamic and We need to discuss, you know,

216
00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:27.400
like they published in Nature, one of the biggest,

217
00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:32.679
uh, scientific journals, so the evidence was published, those

218
00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:39.200
authors are uh important archaeologists like uh ins institutionalized

219
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.900
authors, researchers, so they. Give this uh contribution to

220
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.950
science and then we need to evaluate and discuss.

221
00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:52.979
So I just wanted to give this um brief

222
00:14:52.979 --> 00:14:58.210
overview about how this discussion uh goes in terms

223
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.909
of Homo sapiens War was the only one in

224
00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:06.869
the Americas, but yes, after saying that and giving

225
00:15:06.869 --> 00:15:11.190
like this little introduction to one major discussion and

226
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.669
I think that is the only discussion that people

227
00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:17.349
still talk about the possibility of another homo sapiens

228
00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:22.609
in the Americas, uh. We know that just the

229
00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:25.119
uh Homo sapiens got to America, especially because the

230
00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:30.309
Americas was the, were the last continents to be

231
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:34.559
populated for sure also. So in human evolution, we

232
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.130
know that the Americas were the, the last continent.

233
00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:40.380
Mhm. Great. So, uh, yeah, and we have to

234
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.710
keep in mind, I guess, always in these discussions,

235
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.130
particularly surrounding paleoanthropology and archaeology, that we're always working

236
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.500
with an incomplete picture of the past, right? I

237
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.500
mean, it's by uh gathering new sources of evidence

238
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.900
and finding new archaeological sites and so on that

239
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.255
we little by little uh try to. With the

240
00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:04.815
picture, but of course, I'm not trying to imply

241
00:16:04.815 --> 00:16:08.044
here that yeah, there must have been some other

242
00:16:08.044 --> 00:16:11.075
hominid species in the Americas before us, but I,

243
00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:13.695
I'm just saying that we have to always keep

244
00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:14.474
that in mind,

245
00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:18.614
right. Exactly, because what if we find we're gonna

246
00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:21.715
dismiss this evidence if we find like solid evidence

247
00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:25.859
just because it wasn't supposed to be so. Maybe

248
00:16:26.229 --> 00:16:29.640
and maybe if we have solid evidence that's, I

249
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.880
think that's is one of our jobs as scientists

250
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.549
to evaluate each other's claims and each other's studies.

251
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.090
So instead of just disregard and just say, oh

252
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.119
this is not possible. OK, so let me see

253
00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:46.840
what you're proposing and why you're saying that as

254
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.219
something that it seems crazy right now, but It

255
00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:53.559
it might be where it's natural science. We are

256
00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:58.010
always uh trying to go deeper into natural science

257
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.900
and find out something that It's new and exciting.

258
00:17:03.869 --> 00:17:07.339
Mhm. Uh, DO we have a good idea about

259
00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.739
the kinds of environments that humans homo sapiens found

260
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.670
in the Americas when they arrived there? I mean,

261
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.140
and was it something, of course, if they survived,

262
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.430
at least to some extent, they must have been

263
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.348
able to adapt to them, but was it something

264
00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:27.469
that they were particularly well adapted to when they

265
00:17:27.469 --> 00:17:29.859
arrived there? I mean, what do we know about

266
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:30.189
that?

267
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.170
I think that this came also to the same

268
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:39.739
uh discussion of when that happened, because depending on

269
00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:42.489
when do you think and do you agree, do

270
00:17:42.489 --> 00:17:45.060
you accept that as for humans got in here,

271
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.949
the environment is going to be different, right? So

272
00:17:46.949 --> 00:17:50.550
if you think that humans got here around 14,000

273
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.709
years ago, it's already after like the the glaciation,

274
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.359
so the climate was totally different than the ice

275
00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:03.660
age. So I think that Discussing that would depend

276
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.219
on the time frame that you accept the, the

277
00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:11.209
evidence for humans got in the Americas, but if

278
00:18:11.209 --> 00:18:15.630
you think about humans, humans migrating from Siberia to

279
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.849
North America, so from being there in the Bering

280
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:24.810
Strait in the Siberian area and the north of

281
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.660
North America. Uh, AROUND at least 30,000 years ago,

282
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.979
which I think that is the most. LIKELY scenario,

283
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.949
um, at least 30,000 years ago, uh, I think

284
00:18:38.949 --> 00:18:42.989
that you will find, um, a cold environment that

285
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:46.709
they humans were already adapted because it's similar, you

286
00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:50.089
know, to where they come from, from Siberia. And

287
00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:54.010
then when they reach uh North America, they found

288
00:18:54.010 --> 00:19:00.359
similar uh vegetation, especially like tundras and big animals,

289
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.770
like a more open uh cold uh environment. But

290
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.589
then, of course, if they reach to South America.

291
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.140
We don't have ice sheets anymore. It, it was

292
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.579
probably colder than it is now, but it's not

293
00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:19.500
the ice age configuration in South America that we

294
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.660
see in the Ice Age movie, for example, that

295
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.540
is very like North American uh scenario. So I

296
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.260
think that they were very adaptable uh uh groups

297
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.930
of people because we are smart, humans are very,

298
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.719
very smart, and the Americas is Not only huge,

299
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.680
but we have so much diversity so we think

300
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.560
a lot and I know that we're gonna talk

301
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.319
a little bit more about megafauna here. So we

302
00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:50.510
think a lot about the Pleistocene and the Quaternary

303
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.199
uh megafauna, but there's others, there's like other animals,

304
00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.479
there's birds, there's fish, there's this huge ecosystem, this

305
00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:08.280
huge um. Availability of resources and vegetation and fruits,

306
00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:13.430
so I think that they were very adaptable from

307
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.040
their environment in Siberia and North America, so like

308
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.790
really similar. And then when they were reaching south,

309
00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:26.989
they start finding, they start to find new configurations

310
00:20:26.989 --> 00:20:30.319
and even going to inland, so the archaeological site

311
00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:33.280
that I work in is in central Brazil, is

312
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.410
like in center of South America, and it was

313
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.670
Definitely not an ice age environment, but it was

314
00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:46.810
perfect for humans to be there because we have

315
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.829
even in the Pleisto and we had so much

316
00:20:48.829 --> 00:20:53.229
diversity of fruits of vegetation, of small mammals, of

317
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.800
giant mammals. So I think that when humans start

318
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.380
to find these new configurations, new biomes, they just

319
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:07.589
They're easily to adapt because it's all in the

320
00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:11.819
Americas, I think they're all easily adaptive biomes and

321
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:12.550
environments.

322
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.199
By the way, uh let me uh perhaps introduce

323
00:21:16.199 --> 00:21:19.439
now this question, which I think will not only

324
00:21:19.439 --> 00:21:22.040
apply, it is sort of a broader question that

325
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.739
will not only apply to our migration to the

326
00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:28.560
Americas but perhaps even to uh Homo sapiens migrations

327
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.959
in general. So, do we know why Homo sapiens

328
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.599
migrated to the Americas. I mean, why is it

329
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:42.910
that migrations occur? Are there specific, uh, uh, pressures,

330
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:47.229
environmental pressures or something like that that lead people

331
00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:51.520
to migrate uh from even from one continent to

332
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.119
the other?

333
00:21:52.949 --> 00:21:55.959
That is a great question. I, I never stopped

334
00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:59.260
to think or I think I, I never read,

335
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.510
read, read about that. I think that would be

336
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.550
a great question to talk with Brianna if you

337
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.869
invite her again and she has the opportunity to

338
00:22:06.869 --> 00:22:10.229
come here, she's gonna be uh able to talk

339
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:13.510
a lot more than me about human evolution in

340
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.910
general, because I'm not a paleontologist and not an

341
00:22:17.949 --> 00:22:23.239
anthropologist or archaeologist. So, I don't work with human

342
00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:29.130
evolution, uh, with human evolution indeed. I work more

343
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.910
with the paleontology and paleoecology and now a little

344
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.849
bit with zoarchaeology and regarding the uh people of

345
00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:39.170
the Americas. So I read a lot about the

346
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.890
people of the Americas, but I don't know how

347
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.359
to answer that. That is a great question. I

348
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:51.260
think with my understanding that. There's like several of.

349
00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:56.479
Reasons for human migrating, especially following animals, you know,

350
00:22:56.599 --> 00:23:00.479
like, we're following resources, you know, like, we're getting

351
00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.800
hungry, there's nothing here. We know that these animals

352
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.760
are going that way. Let's go that way. So

353
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.099
I think that In evolution as an er kind

354
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:14.500
of setting scenario, uh, it's a lot about the

355
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.160
um Ecological pressures, you know, like environment is bad

356
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.969
here, it's getting cold, let's go that way. So

357
00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:25.650
I think that we follow the environmental conditions, but

358
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.849
definitely that would be a question I think for

359
00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:30.930
like uh paleoanthropologists working with human evolution, they would

360
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.969
give like a really better uh response than I'm,

361
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.040
I'm doing here.

362
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.189
No, fair enough. That's totally fair. I mean, I

363
00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:42.310
was just wondering because, uh, we have to keep

364
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.349
in mind that back then, of course, nowadays, if,

365
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.300
for example, uh, we migrate to a new country,

366
00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:53.069
we can gather lots of information about that place

367
00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:55.229
before we go there. But back then, I mean,

368
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.375
there was no one. In the Americas, no one

369
00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:02.015
in northeastern Asia. So, I mean, it was always

370
00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:05.375
a huge risk, I would imagine, for people to

371
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:09.156
migrate to a completely new place, right? So there

372
00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:13.576
must have been very good reasons evolutionarily speaking, for

373
00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:15.526
people to do that. I imagine,

374
00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:18.362
of course. It makes a lot of sense. It's

375
00:24:18.362 --> 00:24:22.241
a great question, and I, I'm certainly that I'm

376
00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:25.562
certain that there's like a huge discussion and also

377
00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:27.802
some researchers might think, oh, it's just because human

378
00:24:27.802 --> 00:24:32.161
pressures uh environment and then other researchers might have

379
00:24:32.161 --> 00:24:36.202
like other perspectives, but it's definitely interesting to think

380
00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:36.722
about that.

381
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.510
Yeah. I, I will try to keep that in

382
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.989
mind and ask uh other paleoanthropologists and I have

383
00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:45.550
them on the show, particularly ones who work on

384
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.239
the Americas. So let's get into megafauna now. So,

385
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.510
first of all, what is megafauna? What is it

386
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.310
that we call megafauna? What kinds of animals are

387
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.829
classified as such?

388
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.880
OK, so we call megafauna, all the mega animals,

389
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:09.359
so all animals that are large or even giants

390
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.969
in size, and that could be the rest from

391
00:25:13.969 --> 00:25:18.130
the land, like land animals or marine, so we

392
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:23.050
can have like huge uh animals in both water

393
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.000
and land. But, uh, It is very common to

394
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.339
associate megafauna with this specific group that is uh

395
00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:37.880
is land mammals, but not only mammals, we have

396
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.199
like some giant birds even like in the pattern

397
00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:43.839
in the Pleistocene of South America for example we

398
00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:47.369
have like what we call the. Um, HOW is

399
00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:50.930
in English, uh, uh, but it's like this bird

400
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.719
Avidu Tejo in Portuguese. I don't remember exactly anger,

401
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.469
anger bird. I forgot the name in English, so

402
00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:03.910
like this huge uh bird, uh, that We have

403
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.150
here in South America, so it's not only mammals

404
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.739
and it's not just land mammals, but we commonly

405
00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:16.280
uh commonly talk about megafauna for like this uh

406
00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:21.589
large land mammals that lived, uh, especially in the

407
00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:29.599
Pleistocene because the Pleistocene was the. Less epoch in

408
00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:33.719
the in the geological geological time frame this that

409
00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:36.839
these animals live. So during the transition of the

410
00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:41.770
Pleistocene to the Holocene, which is the um geo

411
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.359
geological time that we are living now, we have

412
00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:52.459
the extinction of most of these land mammals worldwide.

413
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.180
So in Australia, in Eurasia, and Asia and the

414
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.819
Americas but not like with different proportions in the

415
00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:07.180
different continents. So because of that, because when we

416
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.339
talk about mega mammals and how there's a specific

417
00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:14.819
group of mega mammals that live to around 10,000

418
00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:18.579
years ago, they got, they disappeared around 10,000 years

419
00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:22.819
ago, we commonly associate megafauna to this group of

420
00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:25.500
animals. I hope that it makes sense. Let me

421
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.699
know. If there's any, anything that was not clear

422
00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:30.709
with that. No,

423
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.229
it was, it definitely was, but perhaps it, it

424
00:27:34.229 --> 00:27:38.540
paint as a broader picture of the, some of

425
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.189
the main perhaps mega mammals that we could find

426
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.589
back to 15,000, 14,000 years ago when we arrived

427
00:27:47.589 --> 00:27:50.510
in the Americas. I mean, what kinds of animals

428
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.989
could we find back then?

429
00:27:52.449 --> 00:27:56.349
In the Americas only, so in the Americas, we

430
00:27:56.349 --> 00:28:00.890
had the mammoths, the Maodons, so all the proboscideans,

431
00:28:00.989 --> 00:28:03.750
right, that are extinct because now we just have

432
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.339
like the elephants, but we used to have mammoths,

433
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:12.520
masodons, um. In North America and some species of

434
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.719
horses because now the only horses that we have

435
00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:20.319
in the Americas are the ones that Europeans uh

436
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:22.920
brought to the Americas, domesticated and brought to the

437
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.650
Americas but before that we used to have uh

438
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.760
species of horses uh that were natural from uh.

439
00:28:30.844 --> 00:28:35.435
These, uh, continents that they were extinct we used

440
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:39.635
to have paleo yammas we used to have, especially

441
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:44.305
in South America now uh giant armadillos, giant uh

442
00:28:44.305 --> 00:28:50.234
slots, giant ground slots, uh, this specific to specific

443
00:28:50.234 --> 00:28:55.219
animals that There's nothing related, so this is like

444
00:28:55.219 --> 00:28:59.709
really interesting about megafauna because some groups disappeared and

445
00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:02.500
we don't have anything related to, to think about.

446
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.949
So when we think about giant armadillos, we know

447
00:29:05.949 --> 00:29:10.439
the Little armadillos that we have now, but we

448
00:29:10.439 --> 00:29:14.989
have some species like Toxodons that were like similar

449
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:19.760
to a hippo, but it's not like very different

450
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.989
uh strange animals. So we have macrocanias, we have

451
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.599
a very interesting uh group of animals that disappear

452
00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:33.969
and we don't have anything similar to today. So

453
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.579
these are, and of course, like the carnivores, I

454
00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:39.939
was just talking about the herbivores because it's the

455
00:29:39.939 --> 00:29:43.540
ones that we we think more but besides that

456
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.250
we have the carnivores, most of them that originated

457
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.219
in North America so uh bears and uh saber-toothed

458
00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:58.260
cats. And then both uh this megafauna originated like

459
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:03.489
some, especially like the giant slots, dagillos uh originated

460
00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:06.739
in South America and the carnivores and the horses

461
00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:11.640
uh originated and in the North America. And they

462
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.280
were isolated for a long time during the whole

463
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.810
uh Cenozoic since like 6 65 million years ago

464
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.829
after the uh dinosaur extinction, uh, these continents were

465
00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:30.239
totally isolated, but then due to the movement of

466
00:30:30.239 --> 00:30:33.359
the continents, the continents, the South and the North

467
00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:38.219
America were. Integrated they were linked uh due to

468
00:30:38.219 --> 00:30:44.180
the Panama Isimus. So the Central America just glued

469
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.250
everything together during the tectonic activities. And because of

470
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:53.010
that, the this megafauna start to migrate, so megafauna

471
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:56.530
from North America migrated to North America and some

472
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:01.130
animals from North America migrated to South America. That

473
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:05.530
is what we call the great biotic interchange uh

474
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.989
event. So these animals were migrating and because of

475
00:31:10.989 --> 00:31:15.229
that, we also have a specific species of some

476
00:31:15.229 --> 00:31:19.910
native groups of the other continent that given an

477
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:24.189
example, we have um slots, like the giant ground

478
00:31:24.189 --> 00:31:28.435
slots, they were originated in South. America and they

479
00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:32.364
could reach and they migrated into North America and

480
00:31:32.364 --> 00:31:36.724
we have this uh uh this uh grounds law

481
00:31:36.724 --> 00:31:42.645
that is called paramilodon that only occurs in North

482
00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:47.474
America. This species does not occur in South America.

483
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.209
So this is just interesting to think about of

484
00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:55.180
how uh the evolution of these animals happen in

485
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.680
this continents and that uh this megafauna, this group

486
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.079
of uh giant slots, giant armadillos, saber-toothed cats, bears,

487
00:32:05.369 --> 00:32:10.410
all of that. Uh, SURVIVED through all the the

488
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.949
last glaciations because we don't, didn't have only one

489
00:32:13.949 --> 00:32:17.150
ice age, right? We have like several uh glass

490
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:23.719
glacial and interglacial cycles and this megafauna survival sometimes

491
00:32:23.719 --> 00:32:29.329
they were in smaller populations, sometimes they were um

492
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.969
in refugees, um, types of environments, but they survive

493
00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:39.569
through the Quaternary through the Pleistocene, just the Pleistocene

494
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.290
is from 2 million years ago, 2. 2.5 million

495
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.964
years ago until the 10,000 years ago. So during

496
00:32:49.964 --> 00:32:53.994
2 million years ago and all the different environments

497
00:32:53.994 --> 00:32:59.025
uh change and climate change, these animals survived in

498
00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:04.474
the Americas but only uh around 10,000 years ago

499
00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:06.915
they were extinct and like a lot of them

500
00:33:06.915 --> 00:33:10.530
were extinct. Especially in South America, we lost a

501
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.000
lot, a lot of biodiversity and that's why we

502
00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:17.609
wonder why that happened and what kind of influence

503
00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:19.040
maybe humans have on that.

504
00:33:19.589 --> 00:33:22.209
Yeah, let's, uh, put a pin on that because

505
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:24.170
we're going to come back to that point. I

506
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.770
mean, what led to the extinction of all these

507
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.250
animals back then. But so, uh, I mean, the

508
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.810
kind of picture you're painting there, there, if I

509
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.819
understood it correctly, there were lots and lots of

510
00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:40.089
new animals that, uh, when Homo sapiens arrived at

511
00:33:40.089 --> 00:33:43.930
the Americas, they had never seen before. They had

512
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.520
never interacted with before. Correct.

513
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.729
Yes, definitely. Especially in South America, I think that

514
00:33:52.099 --> 00:33:59.489
um. Maybe in. Yeah, maybe North America too, but

515
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.819
I think that they were used to like Macedon,

516
00:34:04.979 --> 00:34:09.050
mammoths, uh, what they were reaching south and then

517
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.699
in South America, they start to find like very

518
00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:19.099
weird and uh Especially herbivores, like very weird and

519
00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:24.329
new uh animals, but herbivores that was not like,

520
00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:26.728
uh, so much of dangerous for them.

521
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:31.320
And so the homo sapiens start, uh, start interact

522
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.100
with these animals also around the time that they

523
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.168
arrive in the Americas or was it a little

524
00:34:39.168 --> 00:34:41.610
bit later? I mean, what do we know about

525
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:41.728
it?

526
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.090
Great question. This is also what we are trying

527
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.889
to understand. It makes sense that they were interacting

528
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:54.330
right when they got, right, because it's resources, so

529
00:34:54.330 --> 00:35:00.370
it's resources, uh, so we don't know yet, um.

530
00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:04.479
The full picture of how they were interacting, like,

531
00:35:04.689 --> 00:35:08.129
where they're hunting these animals, where they're hunting all

532
00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:10.850
of these animals or if there was a preference

533
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.889
for a specific kind of animals, we don't know

534
00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:17.659
that yet. It's a lot of open questions. But

535
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.370
yeah, it makes sense. We find, uh, we are

536
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:24.290
finding evidence that humans were interacting with these animals,

537
00:35:24.409 --> 00:35:28.449
not necessarily hunting, maybe they just found the animal

538
00:35:28.449 --> 00:35:31.149
dead. Because it's hard to say right in the

539
00:35:31.149 --> 00:35:34.830
archaeological record if we hunt something unless we find

540
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.429
like specific cut marks on the specific parts of

541
00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:41.229
the body of the skeleton that shows that yeah

542
00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:43.800
we were hunting that but sometimes we just find

543
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.939
OK burn bones or uh some marks of interaction

544
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.340
that could be uh. SCAVENGING behavior. So the animal

545
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.179
was dead by other animal where they died from

546
00:35:57.179 --> 00:36:01.100
some uh disease or whatever. And then humans found

547
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.649
that animal dead and they interact. OK, so let's

548
00:36:04.649 --> 00:36:08.209
eat the meat. Let's use their skin for something.

549
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.459
So, uh, yeah, there's so a lot of open

550
00:36:13.459 --> 00:36:18.500
questions about how we interacted with this uh giant

551
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.699
mammals, this giant with this megafauna.

552
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.010
Mhm. But then, at least from a certain point

553
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:31.060
onward, there's evidence that we started hunting them.

554
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.590
Yeah, at least, um, when we think about the

555
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:40.010
Clovis culture, like when we think about uh the,

556
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.750
for a long time we thought that Clovis were

557
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.949
the first, uh, Americans, right, because we found several

558
00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:51.389
of the specific stone tools that are very specific

559
00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:54.870
for hunting, so they have like this function for

560
00:36:54.870 --> 00:37:01.229
hunting. And several archaeological sites, Clovis, uh, Clovis sites

561
00:37:01.229 --> 00:37:05.189
were found in association with Megafo, especially proboscidents like

562
00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:10.030
Mas Masodons and mammoths. So we found these stone

563
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.750
tools that are specific for hunting together with these

564
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:18.040
animals and sometimes also With Mark, so this is

565
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.540
like, OK, solid evidence that humans were hunting mega

566
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.000
fau at least 13,000 years ago. So we know

567
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.159
that humans were hunting, uh, megafauna, uh, around 13,000

568
00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:32.320
years ago, but like I say, we don't know

569
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.800
when humans got here first, so it's hard to

570
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.129
say that they've got. He and they start hunting

571
00:37:38.129 --> 00:37:41.090
already or they were like, OK, we don't have

572
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.129
a lot of population yet let's be sure that

573
00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:46.770
we're safe before we try to interact with a

574
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.689
giant slaw that is 6 m tall and then

575
00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:55.290
after the density of humans uh were higher, they

576
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.399
were like. This and the climate was more favorable.

577
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.870
They start hunting more. We still don't know this

578
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.689
answer, so we know for sure that humans were

579
00:38:04.689 --> 00:38:08.659
hunting megafauna, uh, at least from 13,000 years ago.

580
00:38:08.689 --> 00:38:11.810
We had several evidence, especially for, uh, North and

581
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:17.780
South America, like 13 12,000 years ago, but we

582
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.030
don't know when that start happened. Together with like

583
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.250
exactly your question like we got here and we

584
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.229
start to interacted already. It makes sense that yes,

585
00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:33.719
for me, but not necessarily hunting, because hunting is

586
00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:36.239
a little more risky than just wait for the

587
00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:38.389
animal to be dead and you just go there

588
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.800
and you, you get your meat and you get

589
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.260
whatever you want. So I hope it's clear, like

590
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.179
what, what I was trying to explain that we

591
00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:49.060
don't know for sure when that happened because again,

592
00:38:49.219 --> 00:38:53.979
we still uh discuss when you got here and

593
00:38:53.979 --> 00:38:58.280
how we were interacting with megafauna. Mhm.

594
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.330
But since there were also some carnivores, what about

595
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.060
the other way around? Is there any evidence that

596
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.020
some of those carnivores might have hunted or have

597
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.459
humans as spray or not?

598
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.620
That makes a lot of sense. I don't remember

599
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.060
now any paper, maybe I just missed, but I

600
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.219
don't remember any paper of people discussing like evidence

601
00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:28.610
for carnivore marks, right, on bite marks on human

602
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.620
skeletons. I think also because it's really hard to

603
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.939
find human skeletons, uh, especially like really old uh

604
00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:40.919
human skeletons in the Americas. Uh, BUT I don't

605
00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:45.360
remember seeing any evidence for carnivores, uh, for carnivore

606
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.199
damage on human skeletons, maybe they are, and I,

607
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.550
I'm not sure, but it makes a lot of

608
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:55.320
sense. Yeah, probably they were like being like a

609
00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.310
huge risk. CARNIVORES were a huge um danger for

610
00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:06.320
humans. Maybe humans understood and knew how to handle

611
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.889
that. Mhm. But yeah, makes a lot of sense.

612
00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:16.520
They were like definitely uh dangerous for for humans.

613
00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:21.370
Mhm. And still in the domain of interactions, were,

614
00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:24.570
were any of these animals or was it even

615
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.090
possible to domesticate any of these animals?

616
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:36.659
Ah, then I don't think so because the domestication

617
00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:42.939
of animals happen like way. Uh, LATER in the

618
00:40:42.939 --> 00:40:48.540
human history, human evolution history, so yeah, I don't

619
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.419
think so, especially because they were very huge like

620
00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:55.260
I think it would be really hard for them

621
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.100
to try to domesticate somehow. I think they were,

622
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.590
especially because they were, were also um hunter gatherers

623
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:09.909
of uh uh population, so they were not. In

624
00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:12.840
one place for a long time. So they were

625
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.110
there, they were eating, they were doing their toast,

626
00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:17.580
they were surviving, they were moving, they were moving,

627
00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:20.629
they were moving. So that makes like really hard

628
00:41:20.629 --> 00:41:23.870
for you to domesticate and spend time trying to

629
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.709
domesticate an animal that you, you have to bring

630
00:41:26.709 --> 00:41:29.379
the giant slot with you to another place. So,

631
00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:32.070
uh, I don't think that they even try to

632
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.110
do that back then.

633
00:41:33.879 --> 00:41:37.000
Yeah, I don't think that would fulfill any of

634
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.409
the criteria that we also, that we tend to

635
00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:44.810
have associated with, uh, species that are, that we

636
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.929
are able to domesticate. So, um, uh, and, and

637
00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:51.929
perhaps, I mean, some of the species that eventually

638
00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:55.610
later on were domesticated were not megafauna and it

639
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.560
probably occurred more or less around the time of

640
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.129
the American Neolithic, right.

641
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.770
Yeah, it was like very recent, more like history

642
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.620
stuff, not pre-history. I don't think maybe I'm wrong,

643
00:42:09.699 --> 00:42:11.520
maybe I missed something, but I don't think that

644
00:42:11.939 --> 00:42:16.580
domestication happened in the pre-history, at least in the

645
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.570
Americas for sure.

646
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:23.290
Mhm. But I, I mean, through zoo archaeology, how

647
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:28.770
can we identify traces of human interaction in extinct

648
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.320
animal bones, for example? What do we look for?

649
00:42:32.889 --> 00:42:36.929
So first, we need to find uh traces, we

650
00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:41.120
need to find evidence that we need to find

651
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.199
the Animal bone, right? And then we look to

652
00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:48.280
this bone and we try to see if there's

653
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.280
marks of human doing something with that bone. So

654
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.510
for example, fractures, that's what I was talking about

655
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:59.399
the example of this really old and controversial site

656
00:42:59.399 --> 00:43:04.159
in California. Researchers found mazodone bonds that are broken

657
00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:07.209
and they found hm this, they did some experiments,

658
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.810
they did a lot of research and they came

659
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.360
to the conclusion that that was human and made

660
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.360
it was human intentional breakage. But it's really complicated.

661
00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:19.159
It's not an easy task because even like breaking

662
00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:21.600
some bone can be due to several causes. Maybe

663
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.239
the animal fall, maybe some the animal die and

664
00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:29.320
then some rock fall into that, or maybe humans

665
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.080
or maybe other animals. So this is one example

666
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.004
like Breakage so we try to understand the the

667
00:43:36.004 --> 00:43:40.685
fracture uh partners and try to identify especially through

668
00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:45.274
experiments how similar uh it is like the fracture

669
00:43:45.274 --> 00:43:47.844
that we find in the archaeological in this archaeological

670
00:43:47.844 --> 00:43:50.965
context to what we know that is human made

671
00:43:50.965 --> 00:43:53.750
or natural made. So this is one example. Another

672
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.389
example is to find the marks of stone tools.

673
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.189
So when humans are hunting, or they find the

674
00:43:59.189 --> 00:44:01.840
animal die and they are scavenging and they are

675
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:05.360
using their stone tools to take out the meat

676
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.790
to um clean the animal. So when you are

677
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.949
doing all of that, you are marking with the

678
00:44:12.949 --> 00:44:16.570
stone tool, the bone. And it makes like specific

679
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:20.149
marks that are preserved. So when the fossil, so

680
00:44:20.149 --> 00:44:22.929
like when the bond turns to fossil, this mark

681
00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:27.699
is also preserved. But again, several factors can make

682
00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:31.179
like marks like carnivore, uh, when they are biting,

683
00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:35.360
they have like specific uh marks of two car

684
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.419
rodents are, if the animal is exposed for a

685
00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:43.459
while, rodents can use the bones to sharp their

686
00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:48.129
teeth, uh, trampling, so some animals can just trampling

687
00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:51.899
and walk around and the sediments and the trampling

688
00:44:51.899 --> 00:44:55.340
can make like marks. So all of that is

689
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.110
also makes also complicated. So we need to do

690
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.709
a lot of research, we need to find protocols,

691
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.580
we need to uh Find a new methods to

692
00:45:06.889 --> 00:45:10.489
uh be able to identify something confident as, OK,

693
00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:14.090
this is how a tooth mark looks like. This

694
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.969
is how a stone tool mark looks like. This

695
00:45:17.969 --> 00:45:23.810
is how sediments, grains looks like. And another possibility,

696
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.179
burn bonds. So if we find in this archaeological

697
00:45:27.179 --> 00:45:31.340
context, some black bonds or even white because it's

698
00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.949
calcified from burning bonds, we can Of course, with

699
00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:39.330
the whole context, it's even better if we have

700
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.959
like evidence for fire structures, you know, like uh

701
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.830
uh fireplace uh around the site, but if somehow

702
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.580
we find like some bones that look like burned,

703
00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:53.989
that can be also an evidence that humans were.

704
00:45:54.199 --> 00:45:58.590
Burning the bonds, but not because it's just black,

705
00:45:58.639 --> 00:46:05.350
it's burned all natural um um reactions, natural uh

706
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:09.199
agents can make some bond turn black, such as

707
00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:12.919
iron and manganese staining from the soil. So you

708
00:46:12.919 --> 00:46:14.760
need to, it's not just look, oh, this is

709
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.000
black, this is burned, humans interacted with this animal.

710
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.520
No, we need to find evidence that this is

711
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.239
not iron and manganese standing for sure. This is

712
00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:25.909
the first thing. This is not a natural fire

713
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.840
that happened for some reason. So this is like

714
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.000
some of evidence that we look in the archaeological

715
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.570
records. So, um, marks from stone tools, breakage, partners,

716
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.729
a burning. Also, not just this, uh, this is

717
00:46:44.729 --> 00:46:46.620
just like what we can see in the bond,

718
00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:49.620
but just like the association, if we find like

719
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.449
bonds, like I said, let's talk about the obvious

720
00:46:52.449 --> 00:46:55.889
points, if you find like together with stone tools

721
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.459
is evidence that they were together, you know, like

722
00:46:58.459 --> 00:47:02.060
they were uh bury in the same layer, so

723
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.739
they were in association. So These are some of

724
00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:10.020
the evidence that we look for, but also it's

725
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.110
very complicated. It's not just finding and saying oh

726
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:16.409
this is evidence for human interaction with these animals,

727
00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:19.580
let, let's publish that because we have all these

728
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.669
other uh possibilities. That's why it's very important to

729
00:47:23.979 --> 00:47:28.340
do a very meticulous uh study, especially in what

730
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:32.820
we call taphonomy in in archaeology and paleontology, that

731
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.939
is they study. Of how, uh, after the death

732
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:39.780
of the animal, what happened after that, everything that

733
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:44.949
happened from the animal dead. Was like other animals

734
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:48.290
pushed that animal to the other part or like

735
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:51.600
the ray moved the bones, like what happened until

736
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.239
from the moment of that until like after the

737
00:47:55.409 --> 00:47:59.010
berry and thousands of years when we found that

738
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:02.179
bond. So this is the fundament, this is why

739
00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:05.370
it's a very important study when we're trying to

740
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.929
understand all these evidences.

741
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.479
That's all very fascinating. And actually, I was going

742
00:48:10.479 --> 00:48:13.570
to ask you even before you answered my previous

743
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:18.050
question, with the kinds of protocols, methods, and tools

744
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.149
that we have at our disposal, I mean, the

745
00:48:20.149 --> 00:48:23.889
best ones when we get a new bone with

746
00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:26.689
a particular mark on it, and we are trying

747
00:48:26.689 --> 00:48:30.010
to identify whether it was, for example, um, a

748
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.010
mark from uh from the tooth of another animal

749
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:36.800
or done by a stone tool, for example. When

750
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.050
we arrive at the conclusion, let's say that it

751
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.129
was a stone tool, what is the degree of

752
00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:47.169
certainty that we have even with the best methods

753
00:48:47.169 --> 00:48:49.820
and tools that we have at our disposal that

754
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.290
it was actually done by a stone tool because

755
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:57.370
we can't be ever 100% sure, right?

756
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:03.820
That's right. I think that. The The only possible

757
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.979
so far that I'm aware, like the only evidence

758
00:49:05.979 --> 00:49:08.739
that is like, OK, you cannot say that this

759
00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:13.340
is not human interaction is like there's a specific

760
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.739
um it's called uh Macedon, not Maodon, sorry, like

761
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:24.060
not mestaton like a proboscidean, extinct proboscidean uh from

762
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.780
South America and Brazil. There's like this call with

763
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.959
like um a stone tool like uh Uh lytic

764
00:49:32.959 --> 00:49:36.909
like a stone tool in engraved in this skull.

765
00:49:37.239 --> 00:49:39.840
So it's direct evidence. This is like the only

766
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.199
thing that you can say. It was not a

767
00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:45.600
carnivore. It was not, it didn't fall like this

768
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.550
is, and but it is so rare, you cannot

769
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.280
expect to find like the exact picture of human

770
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.540
hunting, you know, so this is like I think

771
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.909
maybe I'm wrong, but I think that is the

772
00:49:58.909 --> 00:50:01.030
only evidence that we have for the Americas of

773
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.189
something like the picture of the moment, you know,

774
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.750
like, somehow humans did that, the animal died, they

775
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.790
left it there and it was preserved and great

776
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:15.030
for us, amazing stuff. But most of this other

777
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.550
stuff is always gonna fall into this uh subjective

778
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:25.110
interpretation. So, we try our best as scientists, so

779
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:28.229
we try our best to do experiments and see,

780
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.649
OK. Uh, I wanna know how it looks like,

781
00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:36.020
um, carnivore tooth marks, so I'm going to give

782
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.699
my bone to a carnivore. They're going to do

783
00:50:38.699 --> 00:50:42.179
like their little marks there. I'm going to see

784
00:50:42.179 --> 00:50:44.929
that on the microscope. I'm gonna see, OK, they

785
00:50:44.929 --> 00:50:48.620
are squared, they are little, they are, they have

786
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.659
like a little round edge or they have like

787
00:50:51.659 --> 00:50:55.659
a sharp edge. I'm going to characterize how this

788
00:50:55.659 --> 00:50:58.340
mark looks like, make like a little protocol on

789
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.510
that. And then when we find something on the

790
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.989
archaeological site, I'm going to compare and see, OK,

791
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.350
if it looks like that. But it's really hard

792
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.919
because maybe what is deep enough for me is

793
00:51:11.919 --> 00:51:13.989
not deep enough for you. So if I say,

794
00:51:14.199 --> 00:51:17.320
oh, this mark is deep enough to be human

795
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:22.479
made and are and not uh sediment abrasion, for

796
00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.610
you, it can be like, no, it does not

797
00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:31.399
convince me. So we still have Lots of disagreements

798
00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:36.350
on that in in science, which I, which is

799
00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:42.780
um healthy, I think, as long as researchers are

800
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.169
Ethical, you know, like, as long as they can

801
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:51.820
disagree without, uh, disregard, uh, each other's work, so

802
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.250
we can say like, mm, this does not convince

803
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.620
me, but I'm proposing you something, you know, like

804
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.500
I say, hea, I don't think that what you're

805
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.540
saying that is stone to marks looks like stone

806
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.899
to marks because I think that it looks more

807
00:52:05.899 --> 00:52:11.489
like Rodent. So my suggestion is do some experiments

808
00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:13.379
with this specific role, and that is what I

809
00:52:13.379 --> 00:52:16.500
think it is. So we can, you know, and

810
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.620
so this is contributing to science, I think. I

811
00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.860
think it's not useful if I just say, yeah,

812
00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:23.780
he, this is not, I don't think it is,

813
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.860
it does not look like, so it, this is

814
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.820
like really hard and this is one of the

815
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.379
problems that we face, I think we in in

816
00:52:31.379 --> 00:52:34.479
science. And we are doing our best, like, I'm

817
00:52:34.479 --> 00:52:36.399
trying to do my best. I'm in a very

818
00:52:36.399 --> 00:52:40.479
early stage of my career, but in this early

819
00:52:40.479 --> 00:52:43.310
stages, what I'm trying to do is finding new

820
00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:47.800
approaches. OK, so, uh, we try to characterize these

821
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:53.469
marks under the microscope and this specific um Powerful,

822
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.500
let's say like this uh uh instrument microscope that

823
00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.330
we, we call scanning electron microscope that makes us

824
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:04.939
be able to see very uh deep in a,

825
00:53:04.979 --> 00:53:07.939
in a deeper resolution. So what, what we see

826
00:53:07.939 --> 00:53:11.979
on the microscope a mark like this, when we

827
00:53:11.979 --> 00:53:15.060
see on the scanning electron microscope is like the

828
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:20.370
specific. Internal parts of my finger, you know, like

829
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:25.239
the texture of my skin. So this is what

830
00:53:25.239 --> 00:53:28.030
we use, like this is like the traditional method

831
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:31.010
like, OK, we are seeing the texture of the

832
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.090
marks, let's say like this, so we know the

833
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:38.449
characteristics of the marks to differentiate from human-made or

834
00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:41.409
not human made. But what we're trying to do

835
00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:44.489
is finding other possibilities. So let's try to see

836
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:49.290
that in 3D, let's try to see some using

837
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:56.320
synchron facilities that is like very powerful um. Instruments

838
00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.469
um that we have to see, to be able

839
00:54:00.469 --> 00:54:05.090
to see like microtomography in a very high resolution

840
00:54:05.639 --> 00:54:10.199
and elemental composition so we're trying to see different

841
00:54:10.199 --> 00:54:13.639
uh minerals on top of these marks. So yeah,

842
00:54:13.679 --> 00:54:16.989
just giving a brief overview is like we're trying

843
00:54:16.989 --> 00:54:20.320
to find new stuff and new methods to work

844
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:20.760
on that.

845
00:54:21.629 --> 00:54:24.030
No, and I really think that's really fascinating. I

846
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.429
mean, there are some people that get really, a

847
00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:29.189
bit frustrated, and then there are perhaps a few

848
00:54:29.189 --> 00:54:32.790
people that try to dismiss some of this evidence

849
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:36.709
because we don't have 100% certainty that it was

850
00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:38.750
really that. It was a stone tool or it

851
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.754
was too smart. OR something like that. But for

852
00:54:41.754 --> 00:54:44.784
me, at least personally, it makes it even more

853
00:54:44.784 --> 00:54:49.794
fascinating and exciting that we don't have 100% certainty

854
00:54:49.794 --> 00:54:53.435
what it is, and over time we develop new

855
00:54:53.435 --> 00:54:57.854
methods, new tools, new technology to address those questions.

856
00:54:58.675 --> 00:54:59.185
Exactly.

857
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.360
OK, so let's get into megafauna extinction in the

858
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.199
America. And of course, we can tie it to

859
00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:10.429
megafauna extinction in other places around the world. So

860
00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:14.850
how did the megafauna in the Americas go extinct?

861
00:55:14.879 --> 00:55:17.560
And how do we address such a question?

862
00:55:18.969 --> 00:55:21.969
I'm not sure you're asking when or how or

863
00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:21.979
how,

864
00:55:22.899 --> 00:55:24.649
how I'm asking how the,

865
00:55:24.949 --> 00:55:30.000
the real answers. Sorry, you mean the reasons like

866
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.510
the,

867
00:55:30.889 --> 00:55:33.199
yeah, yeah, yes, the reasons, the causes, yes,

868
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.760
we still don't know. We still don't know, we're

869
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.080
still trying to answer that. So the two main

870
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:45.919
hypotheses is climate change. And human pressure or a

871
00:55:45.919 --> 00:55:50.250
combination of both, which is actually the most I

872
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:56.060
think uh strong hypothesis. So we think that humans,

873
00:55:56.129 --> 00:56:01.250
uh, it makes sense to think about humans overhunting

874
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:07.159
this megafauna until they disappear, but Especially because that

875
00:56:07.159 --> 00:56:09.879
kind of happened in the all the continents like,

876
00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:13.270
like I said, these mega mammals were living from

877
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:18.280
millionaires uh and surviving climate changes from millionaires, thousands

878
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.919
of years. And then when humans start to go

879
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:27.060
through all these continents and migrate and Uh, increase

880
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:31.479
in density. These animals were extinct, especially the density.

881
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.399
I think density is the key, because for a

882
00:56:35.399 --> 00:56:38.199
long time we thought like we were talking about

883
00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:42.560
the human migration, humans were following animals, OK. Humans

884
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:47.290
got from Siberia to North America following mammoths, over

885
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.760
hunting them 13,000 years ago, they, they came, they

886
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.429
killed them all, and that's it. And I don't

887
00:56:53.429 --> 00:56:57.409
think it was so like straight like that, like

888
00:56:57.409 --> 00:57:02.229
linear like that, especially because like we are seeing

889
00:57:02.229 --> 00:57:05.989
new evidence showing we might be in the Americas

890
00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:09.469
way earlier than that. But maybe especially because we

891
00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:13.750
were here around 30, 20,000 years ago, we were

892
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:17.550
interacting uh differently with these animals. We were being

893
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:24.149
able to live with these animals and also Um,

894
00:57:24.429 --> 00:57:28.580
we were in lower density because the climate was

895
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:34.169
not so good around 20,000 years ago, uh, 15,000

896
00:57:34.169 --> 00:57:37.290
years ago, and then when climate changed, it was

897
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:41.030
good for us to, and we start to uh

898
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:47.110
increase intensity and Take more the space and change

899
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.070
the vegetation and compete for resources with the herbivores,

900
00:57:51.209 --> 00:57:53.709
not just hunting. It's not just like, oh my

901
00:57:53.709 --> 00:57:57.310
God, we que from the overkill hypothesis, but we

902
00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:02.110
were a huge new competitor with this herbivores and

903
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.189
with the carnivores, with the, we changed the whole

904
00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:09.139
ecosystem. So, After all of that and after like

905
00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:13.540
this density like this high density of humans for

906
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.820
that we have around 10,000 years ago, we start

907
00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:20.889
to see the extinction of these animals uh around

908
00:58:20.889 --> 00:58:26.330
the Americas, um, in North and South America. So

909
00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:29.800
we have like this both uh hypothesis, climate change,

910
00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:36.929
human pressure, and but we still don't have significant

911
00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:40.879
Um, I, I don't say significant evidence, but we

912
00:58:40.879 --> 00:58:45.090
don't have a consensus in academia yet. Mhm.

913
00:58:47.699 --> 00:58:49.820
But, but in terms of the timing, I mean,

914
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.540
not only in the Americas, but also over other

915
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.939
places in the globe, like, for example, Australia and

916
00:58:56.939 --> 00:59:00.820
the Eurasia. I mean, there was, there's a coincidence

917
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.919
or in terms of the period of it happening

918
00:59:04.919 --> 00:59:08.689
in the period after the arrival of humans there,

919
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.510
right? I, I mean that, that it, it follows

920
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:15.020
our arrival across the. DIFFERENT places.

921
00:59:15.379 --> 00:59:18.379
Yeah, it happened in different times, the extinction, so

922
00:59:18.379 --> 00:59:22.250
extinction in Australia happened different in the Americas, but

923
00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:26.139
like you said, similar to when humans got to

924
00:59:26.139 --> 00:59:29.379
the Australia that we know for now and when

925
00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:33.540
humans got to Eurasia and when humans got uh

926
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.590
to the Americas, it's like in, in similar context

927
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:40.919
in the time frame for that, but Also, like

928
00:59:40.919 --> 00:59:44.360
I say, I love that it's always, but because

929
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.800
some people might say, oh my God, they don't

930
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.290
know what they're talking about, but it's just because

931
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:51.520
science is always improving and this is great. So

932
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.199
for a long time, and we still think, of

933
00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:58.260
course, that megafauna was extinct around 10,000 years ago,

934
00:59:58.719 --> 01:00:01.209
but we are finding new evidence even here in

935
01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:06.060
Brazil that megafauna, some megafauna survived. LATER than that.

936
01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:11.469
So, some researchers, uh, they got a paper accepted

937
01:00:11.469 --> 01:00:14.139
now that is still not published, just got accepted.

938
01:00:14.229 --> 01:00:17.070
I'm looking forward to see that published, uh, showing

939
01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:21.469
dates for megafauna in Brazil that survived 3000 years

940
01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:25.709
ago, which is crazy, and I think a lot

941
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:28.280
of research is going to be like, what? Like,

942
01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.330
uh, how is that possible? Something is wrong, your

943
01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:34.889
dating techniques is not right. It's gonna make a

944
01:00:34.889 --> 01:00:39.260
lot of noise, but if it's true, it's like

945
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.129
so interesting to think about some specific parts of

946
01:00:43.129 --> 01:00:47.879
Brazil that this megafauna were able to survive. So,

947
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.050
I'm just saying that to show that if we

948
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.449
find the new evidence, we need to think about

949
01:00:54.449 --> 01:00:57.610
the new model to explain what happened in the

950
01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:00.330
past. So if we find evidence that megafauna, some

951
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:05.084
megafauna survived to 3000 years ago, 14,000 years ago,

952
01:01:05.274 --> 01:01:07.794
we would need to think about how to explain

953
01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:10.034
that if we find evidence that humans were in

954
01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:13.564
the Americas 20-30,000 years ago, we need to find

955
01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:17.754
new models to explain that. So definitely we have

956
01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:23.754
a new different scenario about regarding humans in the

957
01:01:23.754 --> 01:01:29.040
Americas and megaphone extinction and the interaction. Today, then

958
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.959
we had 10, especially 2002, 20 years ago. So

959
01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:37.760
researchers, like I say, thought about humans got in

960
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.929
here, killing everything, and now we have a very

961
01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:47.520
different view of humans being here later, interacting in

962
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.320
maybe a more suitable way and then maybe with

963
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:57.229
density and like higher density, they may have been

964
01:01:57.229 --> 01:02:01.760
affected. Megafauna in higher proportions. Mhm.

965
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.689
But even if it took longer, I mean, if

966
01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:09.129
it was due to human activity or the density

967
01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:13.409
of human populations, it could have still been uh

968
01:02:13.409 --> 01:02:17.530
as humans the cause of the megafauna extinction right

969
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:18.520
off. Or not.

970
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.250
It could be, yeah, uh, especially if there's a

971
01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:26.050
new paper that was published I think in the

972
01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:28.729
beginning of this year or late in the middle

973
01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:32.129
of this year about a very important uh ecologist,

974
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.429
like a very famous uh uh ecologist from Denmark

975
01:02:36.429 --> 01:02:39.050
where he, he did like he and his co-authors

976
01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:43.429
did like this study comparing like. Lots of groups

977
01:02:43.429 --> 01:02:46.229
of megafauna and the timing of extinctions are on

978
01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:50.709
the, the whole um the whole world and they

979
01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:53.739
came to the conclusions that we were the main

980
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:57.830
um factor like the main uh the we were

981
01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.979
the key for the extinction of these animals not

982
01:02:59.979 --> 01:03:03.189
climate change so we're seeing like more and more.

983
01:03:03.965 --> 01:03:08.725
uh, STUDIES interesting like good studies, uh, especially from

984
01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:13.915
pale ecologists and ecologists, uh, showing that we had

985
01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:17.445
a lot of influence on the megafauna extinction way

986
01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:21.445
more than climate change in all the continents, especially

987
01:03:21.445 --> 01:03:24.165
because like I say, like it's like different biomes.

988
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:29.830
In different uh timing and affecting a specific target

989
01:03:30.129 --> 01:03:34.820
of animals, like we were affecting huge, like more

990
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:41.239
than 40 kg, especially like tons of uh kilos,

991
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:45.844
like Animals, land animals were not affecting that much

992
01:03:45.844 --> 01:03:50.034
the animals in the sea in the uh like

993
01:03:50.564 --> 01:03:54.764
small or medium. So like all of that is

994
01:03:54.764 --> 01:04:00.364
makes a very select selective extinction that is not

995
01:04:00.364 --> 01:04:03.155
very well explained by climate change.

996
01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.739
Mhm. OK, so, uh, if it was due to

997
01:04:07.739 --> 01:04:13.340
human activity that the megafauna extinction occurred, was it

998
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.979
mostly because of hunting or also other sorts of

999
01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.050
human activity?

1000
01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.260
I believe that is all that is hunting, is

1001
01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.919
uh being a new competitor, so eating their fruits,

1002
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.530
eating their small animals shoes, so a change in

1003
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:38.959
the environment and Uh, deforesting like all of that,

1004
01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.320
you know, like I think it's not just the

1005
01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.719
hunting, I think it's just like being a new

1006
01:04:44.719 --> 01:04:49.110
pressure, uh, in the ecosystem in general.

1007
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.459
Mhm. Great. So, uh, let me just ask you

1008
01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:55.939
one last question then. Would you like to tell

1009
01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:59.500
us more before we go about what you're working

1010
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.979
on at the moment? And I mean, regarding the

1011
01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:06.379
topics that we talked about today, what are perhaps

1012
01:05:06.379 --> 01:05:10.590
some of the questions that we haven't answered yet

1013
01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.189
that you would be more excited about?

1014
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.919
There's so many questions. There's still, I think that

1015
01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:23.149
is really interesting how we have open questions, uh,

1016
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.320
in general. I think that my main questions right

1017
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.239
now, what I'm more interested in, in searching and

1018
01:05:30.239 --> 01:05:36.739
keep working on is This, uh, understanding this interaction,

1019
01:05:37.169 --> 01:05:40.139
understanding all of the questions that you made to

1020
01:05:40.139 --> 01:05:42.250
me, and I was like, we don't know yet.

1021
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.129
So how they were interacting with these animals, uh,

1022
01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.820
how long we were interacting, like you say, like

1023
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.139
we got here and we start to hunting them

1024
01:05:52.139 --> 01:05:54.659
already, and we start to interact them with them

1025
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:58.540
already. When we got here, uh, how and why

1026
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.739
these animals were extinct, like this megafauna were extinct.

1027
01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:06.229
And I'm definitely, definitely interested in the Americas, so

1028
01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:09.239
I want to keep working with the Americas, uh,

1029
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.379
especially South America, but like, The whole America, so

1030
01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:17.979
I want to understand uh how was the environment

1031
01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:22.879
where these animals lived, how that changed, and, but

1032
01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:26.889
yeah, especially like the interaction and finding the evidence

1033
01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:30.280
for these interactions in South America, especially in South

1034
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.620
America because we don't have a lot of people

1035
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.459
working with that here. So we have lots of

1036
01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:40.060
bonds. So I'm saying like just in Brazil, we

1037
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.419
have lots of bonds, the whole South America, but

1038
01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:45.139
just in Brazil, we have like so much potential.

1039
01:06:45.219 --> 01:06:48.330
We find like so, so many megafauna bonds and

1040
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.810
caves and rock shelters in what we call tanks,

1041
01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.449
that is like a specific uh geological setting here

1042
01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:59.010
uh in Brazil. So we have so much, but

1043
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.620
researchers were paying attention only on taxonomy, so trying

1044
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.840
to understand the species. OK, this is, this species,

1045
01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:10.080
no let's uh review that and come to the

1046
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.600
conclusion that it's a new species. So just like

1047
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.149
taxonomy in general, pale ecology, which is great and

1048
01:07:16.149 --> 01:07:19.550
I love it also. So uh let's do isotopes,

1049
01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:23.639
let's see like the do analysis on the teeth

1050
01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:26.969
of these animals to understand what they were eating

1051
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:30.590
and this is great and this is amazing, but

1052
01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.070
this is what they were doing. They were not

1053
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.969
looking. To these bonds trying to find evidence for

1054
01:07:37.439 --> 01:07:41.560
human interactions. So where human interacting with these animals

1055
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.639
at all. So I think that this is the

1056
01:07:44.639 --> 01:07:47.879
main question I have now is understand especially because

1057
01:07:47.879 --> 01:07:51.989
a lot of researchers, especially in North America, say,

1058
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.600
oh we don't have enough evidence, we have insufficient

1059
01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.739
data for South America. So this is what I'm

1060
01:07:59.739 --> 01:08:03.780
more interested in, in resolving it is trying to

1061
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:07.159
find this evidence, even if it's to say, yes,

1062
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.060
we don't like not having evidence is also an

1063
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.469
evidence, you know, like saying that we, we saw

1064
01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:17.259
the bonds, we are looking for that and we

1065
01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:22.779
don't find evidence for human interaction until interaction until

1066
01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:27.060
around 13,000 years ago, for example. IS an is

1067
01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.939
an example of uh a new result, but like

1068
01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.899
what I was doing since my PhD and I'm

1069
01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:36.910
still working on is this archaeological site called Santalina

1070
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.899
that I was saying that is in central Brazil

1071
01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:41.709
in center of South America, where we have evidence

1072
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:47.379
for humans, uh, human occupation, together with giant slots

1073
01:08:47.379 --> 01:08:52.709
around 27,000 years ago. So I Accept the evidence

1074
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:57.120
of earlier human migrations in the Americas. So there's

1075
01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.500
a lot of Interesting questions to answer about that

1076
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.609
archaeological site and because we know that we have

1077
01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:08.080
that archaeological site and humans were there, I think

1078
01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.990
that probably we have other evidence, other archaeological sites

1079
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.890
in the area in the region, but we're not

1080
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.450
looking for them. So I think that there's a

1081
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:20.250
lot of evidence that is buried and we didn't

1082
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.209
find that yet. So I would like to keep

1083
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:28.068
working on. Answering evidence for humans being here and

1084
01:09:28.068 --> 01:09:32.188
interacting with these animals uh before than we would

1085
01:09:32.188 --> 01:09:32.707
think.

1086
01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:36.410
Great, that all sounds very interesting, and if people

1087
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:39.450
are interested, where can they find your work on

1088
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.080
the Internet?

1089
01:09:41.048 --> 01:09:46.158
Uh, I have, uh, Twitter, uh, X right now,

1090
01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:51.249
uh, that is Tais Ronsoni. So sometimes, um, I'm

1091
01:09:51.249 --> 01:09:54.158
there and I also have like my website where

1092
01:09:54.568 --> 01:09:58.168
I publish the works that I'm doing and uh

1093
01:09:58.168 --> 01:10:01.935
if I have new publications and also. If I'm

1094
01:10:01.935 --> 01:10:04.375
doing new interviews or like where is I'm going

1095
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.734
to be next if I'm, what is my next

1096
01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:10.134
appointment if I'm in each country I am because

1097
01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:12.495
I'm, I still don't, I'm not fixed. I, I

1098
01:10:12.495 --> 01:10:15.334
still don't have like a a permanent position. So

1099
01:10:15.334 --> 01:10:17.654
I think like my website and Twitter are the

1100
01:10:17.654 --> 01:10:20.334
best way to reach out to me and even

1101
01:10:20.334 --> 01:10:22.024
ask questions if you want.

1102
01:10:22.959 --> 01:10:24.870
Great, I will be leaving links to that in

1103
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:28.040
