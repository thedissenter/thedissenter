00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.250
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.329
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:10.529
today I'm joined again by Doctor Michael Cook. He's

4
00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.140
class of 1943 university professor of Near Eastern studies

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.229
at Princeton University. And this is the second part

6
00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:22.909
of our conversation about his book A History of

7
00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.790
the Muslim World from its origins to the Dawn

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.829
of Modernity. So Dr. Cook, welcome back to the

9
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.770
show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:33.330
Glad to be back.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.130
OK, so let's start from where we left off

12
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.950
last time we were starting to talk about the

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.229
caliphate. How did the caliphate expand to Spain in

14
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.409
the west and to Sindh in the east?

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.729
Right, I think um by way of background. Let

16
00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.000
me remind you that um by the early 8th

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.199
century, the caliphate is the only imperial game in

18
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.050
town. I mean, you won't find another empire anywhere

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.559
west of China. So it doesn't have formidable enemies.

20
00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.459
But on the other hand, it's already expanded a

21
00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:20.139
long way, so that any new conquests are up

22
00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:26.730
against distance, and also often geographical barriers. So against

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.680
that background, if we take Spain, Uh, Spain, you

24
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.519
have the Visigothic Kingdom. It's usually quite a strong

25
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:39.720
state, but at the time in question, 7-Eleven, it's

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.760
in a state of civil war, so it's weak.

27
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.260
That makes it easy. The geographical barrier, apart from

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.529
distance is the sea at the space of the

29
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.769
Straits of Gibraltar, but it's not a very broad

30
00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:59.400
sea, and the Muslims get across it. But you

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.199
can also see here that they're getting towards the

32
00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:06.750
end of the line. Um, I mean, in Spain,

33
00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:10.210
they don't consolidate their power in the north of

34
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.130
Spain. They don't advance to the Pyrenees, which would

35
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.119
be the natural barrier. And the result is that

36
00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.000
there are, there is a continuing Christian political and

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.360
military presence in the north of Spain, and that

38
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.080
will eventually turn into the Reconquista. Um, IN Sindh,

39
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.460
it's a somewhat similar story. There is no formidable

40
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.259
state there. They don't, you know, confront a really

41
00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.529
dangerous enemy. But on the other hand, getting to

42
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.649
Sindh, it's a long way away, and it's, it's

43
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.369
tough to get there. You have um, you have

44
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.649
to either go through a very mean desert, or

45
00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.750
else you have to go through formidable mountains. And

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.389
the result is that while the Muslims conquer Sindh

47
00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.309
and even part of the Punjab in this early

48
00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.029
8th century period, they don't go any further. So

49
00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.149
the Ganges, which is maybe the richest part of

50
00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.669
India, is beyond their frontiers until the 11th century

51
00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.300
when the Turks come in.

52
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:18.020
OK, so we have the provinces of Spain, North

53
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.100
Africa, Egypt, Arabia, and Iran. Did it also extend

54
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.300
to territories that are now part of Afghanistan and

55
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.940
Pakistan?

56
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.639
Yes, right, and Pakistan, we've already dealt with that

57
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:43.160
sin. And Afghanistan. So I the major Muslim conquest

58
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.779
in Afghanistan is the city of Bal. Which at

59
00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.100
the present day is, I think, pretty much a

60
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.850
ruin, but close to Mazar i Sharif in northern

61
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.940
Afghanistan. So they take that in this early period.

62
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.029
But If, for example, we take Kabul, which is

63
00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.470
to the southwest of Baal, they don't get there

64
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.470
until the 9th century. And when they do get

65
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.429
there, it's not a caliphal army, it's the army

66
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.800
of one of the successor states in Iran. So

67
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.108
here again, we see Muslim conquest kind of petering

68
00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.519
out in the 8th century. It's gone as far

69
00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.440
as it can go.

70
00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:28.220
Was the caliphate stable or did it go through

71
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.940
periods where there was internal conflict through civil war

72
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.040
and rebellion and foreign invasions?

73
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.510
Right, I mean, like in any state or any

74
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.269
pre-modern state, it goes through bad patches. So if

75
00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:47.690
you have, for example, um, A civil war between

76
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.549
two brothers, each claiming the caliphate that lasts from,

77
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.529
I think, 811 to 819. So that's a lot

78
00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.170
of chaos. And you have all sorts of other

79
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.769
rebellions. If we come down to the 860s, we

80
00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:07.010
have a period of people usually refer to it

81
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.250
as anarchy. It's the Turkish slave soldiers making trouble

82
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.450
at the center because they're not being paid regularly.

83
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.549
And so yes, and it's ups and downs. But,

84
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.239
uh, Until the first half of the 10th century,

85
00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:29.339
each time you have a down, you then have

86
00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.899
an up again. But it's in the early decades

87
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.480
of the 10th century that you have a definitive.

88
00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:40.859
Down And after that, the Abbasid state, whatever it

89
00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.059
is, is never again going to be an empire.

90
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.649
Mhm

91
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.790
So it is at this time that we see

92
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.269
the emergence of Islamic civilization. What characterizes such a

93
00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:55.190
civilization?

94
00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.679
Right, I would say first, um, the centrality of

95
00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:04.399
the Arabic language. I mean, this is a language

96
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:08.600
that, uh, until then, until the 7th century was

97
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.649
not a language of high culture anywhere. Uh No,

98
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.410
in the 7th, in the middle of the 7th

99
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.929
century, there is only one book in Arabic, namely

100
00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:21.369
the Koran. By the time we get to the

101
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:25.250
10th century, the later 10th century, we have a

102
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.410
bookseller in Baghdad who makes a catalog of all

103
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.730
the books he knows of in Arabic, and he

104
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.880
has thousands of books. And we know that he

105
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.420
missed many more books that he hadn't heard of

106
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.839
in Arabic. So, I mean, there's been a very

107
00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.440
dramatic change. Arabic has become a language of high

108
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.239
culture, high civilization. So that's one central thing. Another

109
00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:51.519
central thing, very obvious thing is, and when you

110
00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:56.519
speak of Islamic civilization, Islam is absolutely central to

111
00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:59.290
it. Um, I mean, I could make a kind

112
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.760
of contrast here and And if you take Western

113
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.040
civilization, You know, the foundation is what the Greeks

114
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.160
and Romans did, right? And, and then at a

115
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.899
later secondary stage, Christianity is imported into that civilization.

116
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.540
In the case of Islamic civilization, it's the other

117
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.899
way around. The civilization is built around Islam, and

118
00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:29.980
later they will import the philosophy and science of

119
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.299
the Greeks and other peoples. So, and Islam is

120
00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:39.220
very central. Um But I would say that I

121
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.299
mean, people sometimes get the idea that Islam is

122
00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:45.980
everything in Islamic civilization, and it's not. I mean,

123
00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:49.820
you know, I've just mentioned Greek philosophy and science

124
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.179
that is brought in through translation. But equally in

125
00:07:55.179 --> 00:08:00.880
this civilization, People never cease to be fascinated by

126
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:07.239
pre-Islamic Arabia, pagan pre-Islamic Arabia, and they're endlessly fascinated

127
00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:11.420
with its poetry. So that's something very un-Islamic that

128
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.279
is nevertheless a very central part of this civilization.

129
00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:21.140
And equally You know, to qualify what I said

130
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.260
about the centrality of Arabic, we're going to, that's

131
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.839
going to change. You know, in the 100th century,

132
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.720
late 9th, 10th century, we start to get Persian

133
00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.780
coming back as a literary language, written in Arabic

134
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:40.820
script. Uh, BUT then it now becomes a respectable

135
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.780
medium of culture in a way in which only

136
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.969
Arabic had been before that. So I mean, those

137
00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:49.260
are the things that I think I would underline

138
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.599
most about Islamic civilization.

139
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.609
And uh in regards to the Islamic civilization, what

140
00:08:57.609 --> 00:09:01.609
were the Islamic sciences and how did they come

141
00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:02.010
about?

142
00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:11.820
Right So in the first instance We have Muslim

143
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.859
revelation. That's the Quran, and that's the Hadith, you

144
00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:18.580
know, the traditions about what the prophet said and

145
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.190
did. Um, AND each of those becomes the nucleus

146
00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:31.080
of disciplines. Um, SCIENTIFIC scholarly disciplines. So for example,

147
00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:34.849
with the Koran. Uh, YOU have the Koran there,

148
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.309
but what exactly should the text be? There are

149
00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:41.700
variations, which is right or are they all right?

150
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.429
And that becomes an academic discipline for the early

151
00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:49.909
Muslim scholars. And then, how exactly should you recite

152
00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:54.890
the Quran? That's another discipline. What does God mean

153
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.590
in the Koran? Because often the Koran is not

154
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.429
very, you know, transparent, and, you know, you have

155
00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:05.900
to interpret it. And that becomes another major scholarly

156
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.200
discipline. And it's the same with the hadith, with

157
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.400
the traditions about the prophet. And you have to

158
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.280
collect them. Initially, they're transmitted orally, then people start

159
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.719
to write them down, and then they start to

160
00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:21.799
collect them in the late 8th century, the 9th

161
00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:25.390
century. And I mean, collecting those traditions is a

162
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.669
discipline. And then, of course, there's interpreting those traditions.

163
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:38.630
That's another discipline. And then you get I mean,

164
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.229
with all that body of revelation, there are two

165
00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:45.150
basic questions. What should we believe? What should we

166
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.299
do? And for what should we believe you have

167
00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:52.099
a discipline that you can call theology. For what

168
00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:54.500
should we do, you have a discipline that we

169
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.500
can call law. So in this way, that body

170
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.940
of revelation gives rise to this. Large number of

171
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.520
distinct and increasingly well developed disciplines.

172
00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:10.200
So you in the book you also go through

173
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.460
the breakup of the caliphate in the west, which

174
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.340
includes Spain and North Africa, the East, Iran, and

175
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.500
the center, which includes the Fertile Crescent, Arabia, and

176
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.580
Egypt. In the interest of time, I will group

177
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.340
them together. Could you please tell us a little

178
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:34.289
bit about What led to each breakup, their aftermath,

179
00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:37.950
and what characterized each region in terms of the

180
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.599
polities that then formed and how diverse they were.

181
00:11:44.109 --> 00:11:47.409
Right. OK, I think the thing that is kind

182
00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:50.909
of uniform in the background to all this is

183
00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:54.190
that, you know, in any pre-modern, any state, when

184
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.630
the central government is weak, that creates opportunities for

185
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.150
provincial actors to increase their power at the expense

186
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.900
of the central government. And when the caliphate becomes

187
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.369
very weak, those are great opportunities. What is very

188
00:12:10.369 --> 00:12:15.200
varied is who takes advantage of these opportunities. So

189
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.169
I'd say, I mean, let's just start in the

190
00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:22.250
west. In Spain, we have this, in the 750s,

191
00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:26.789
we have this Umayyad refugee prince, a refugee from

192
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:30.469
the Abbasid revolution. Uh, IF he stays in the,

193
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.150
in Syria, he'll get killed. He flees westwards, he

194
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.070
gets to Spain, and he succeeds in establishing a

195
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.330
dynasty of his own in Spain, a kind of

196
00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.789
Umaya dynasty in exile that lasts into the 11th

197
00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:51.289
century. Uh, SO that's one actor. Then we, let's

198
00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:54.140
cross to North Africa, the western part of North

199
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.619
Africa. There we have all these Berber tribes, and

200
00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:03.719
many of them have been converted by non-Sunni missionaries.

201
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.979
In other words, heretical, mostly Kharija. And they established

202
00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:14.510
states. Karaite, also one important Shiite state. Um, SO

203
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.750
there we have a sectarian rebellion. And then if

204
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.669
we go to what's now Tunisia, we have another

205
00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:23.940
pattern that's quite common. We have a governor appointed

206
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.070
by the Abbasids. But as the Abbasids weaken, he

207
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.909
becomes more powerful. He's able to do a deal

208
00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:35.309
actually very early on, and he'll send tribute, and

209
00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:39.619
they'll leave him alone. And so his, uh, you

210
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:43.099
know, his descendants then form a dynasty that lasts

211
00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:45.440
for about a century, a bit over a century.

212
00:13:46.219 --> 00:13:48.219
Um, I mean, that's the kind of thing that's

213
00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:51.280
going on in the West, in the east, I

214
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.659
mean, some of it is very similar. Uh, YOU

215
00:13:54.659 --> 00:14:01.460
have the same sectarian rebellions. We have Kharija, uh,

216
00:14:01.469 --> 00:14:06.320
rebels in Sistan in sort of eastern Iran, and

217
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.080
they established some kind of Kharaja caliphate. Um, WE

218
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.109
have provincial governors who become more powerful, you know,

219
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:19.739
and found dynasties like the Tahlids and Samanids. Um,

220
00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:23.440
WE don't have anything like the Umayyad prince, but

221
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.119
we have a couple of other things you don't

222
00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:28.070
have in the West. And one of those is,

223
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.700
um, You have an anti-sectarian movement, a Sunni movement,

224
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.159
again in Sistan. They're against the Karaites. And in

225
00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:43.599
the, in the later 9th century, they suddenly establish

226
00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:48.369
a large state. And the ruler is, uh, I

227
00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:51.409
mean, he's known as Yaqub the coppersmith. He's someone

228
00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:53.729
who started right down at the bottom, but he's

229
00:14:53.729 --> 00:14:55.809
made his way all the way up. He's now

230
00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:59.929
a powerful ruler. And then one other thing is,

231
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.239
um, in the mountains in the north of Iran,

232
00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:06.010
you have some people called the Dynamites, and they

233
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.450
come down from the mountains, many of them as

234
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.530
mercenaries, and they enlist in the armies of whoever

235
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.539
is ruling in different parts of Iran. And So

236
00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:19.859
in a way, they're like the Swiss in Europe

237
00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:23.340
who come down from the Swiss mountains. And become

238
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.210
mercenaries in Italy. Um, BUT there's one thing the

239
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.940
Swiss never do, which is to take over a

240
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.140
state in which they are mercenaries. Whereas the Dynamites

241
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.380
do exactly that. After a while, they realize that

242
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.460
they can take over from the existing dynasties, and

243
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:47.539
they found Dynamite dynasties. So Mm Opportunity created by

244
00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:50.340
the weakness of the central government, and then a

245
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.179
great diversity of actors who take advantage of it.

246
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.489
Right, but why was there a decline in power

247
00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:01.750
of the central government of the caliphate?

248
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.299
Right Now there's always lots of factors you can

249
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:13.059
bring in here like Bad rulers, we have the

250
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.789
Abbasid caliphate in the early decades of the 10th

251
00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:20.799
century is a conspicuous example of that. Um, YOU

252
00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:24.760
know, bad luck, all sorts of troubles. But I

253
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.280
think the really basic thing in the background is

254
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.219
that there seems to have been a catastrophic decline

255
00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:35.619
in the revenue that the caliphate was getting from

256
00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:39.340
the agricultural lands of Iraq. And that seems to

257
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.200
be not a failure of the tax collectors, but

258
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.369
a failure of agriculture itself. That increasingly, there was

259
00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:53.849
a problem of agricultural land, going out of cultivation

260
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:56.570
because of the deposits of salt. This is always

261
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.690
a risk in Iraqi agriculture. Why exactly that happens

262
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.330
so much in the 9th century, I really don't

263
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.729
know. But it does seem to be the basic

264
00:17:05.729 --> 00:17:09.170
factor behind the decay of the power of the

265
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:09.930
caliphate.

266
00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:14.769
In our first interview we talked a little bit

267
00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:19.318
about the Steppe peoples in the early stages of

268
00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:22.398
the history of the Muslim world. In what ways

269
00:17:22.398 --> 00:17:26.479
are the Turks, the Mongols, and other Steppe peoples

270
00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.519
related to the history of the Muslim world?

271
00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:33.489
Right, they certainly play a large role in it.

272
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.859
And Not so large until the 11th century. And

273
00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:42.000
the main thing down to there is that uh

274
00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:46.920
rulers in the Muslim world import Turkish slaves and

275
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.260
use them as soldiers, because, um, you know, they're

276
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.640
born cavalrymen. Um, BUT in the 11th century, what

277
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.680
we get in a sense, it's a bit like

278
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.900
the dynamites, that these Turks are coming into Iran

279
00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:07.859
and enlisting in the armies of existing states. And

280
00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:10.979
soon they realize that they can take over, and

281
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:14.209
they do that. And we get the Seljuk the

282
00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:18.459
Seljuk Empire, which is a very large state. And

283
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.439
Then in the 13th century, we get the Mongols,

284
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.780
and that is as as the biggest expansion of

285
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.760
a steppe nomad people in the whole of history,

286
00:18:31.219 --> 00:18:36.949
uh, an extraordinary event. Uh, AFTER that, the steps

287
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.670
play less role in the history of the Muslim

288
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.390
world. So it's mainly the Turks and the Mongols.

289
00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:48.020
And in some ways, they're similar, they're step cavalry.

290
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.520
In other ways, they're very different. And one way

291
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.270
they're different is The Turks, when they come into

292
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.239
the, when they invade, they seem to be already

293
00:18:58.239 --> 00:19:02.410
Muslims. So that their conquest, it's always unpleasant to

294
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.089
be conquered, but their conquest was less traumatic because

295
00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:10.459
they were fellow Muslims. Whereas by contrast, the Mongols

296
00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:13.579
arrived as pagans. And so that was much more

297
00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:18.219
traumatic. Um, ANOTHER contrast kind of goes the other

298
00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:22.140
way, that is, um, You know, the the Mongols.

299
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.810
Left no ethnic legacy in the Middle East. That's

300
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.380
to say, there's no population in the Middle East

301
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.510
that speaks Mongolian. For that we'd have to go

302
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:44.109
to Afghanistan. And But, um. By contrast, the Turks

303
00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:46.770
have a tremendous ethnic impact in the Middle East.

304
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:52.270
We have several Turkish speaking populations in Iran. And

305
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.550
we have a massive Turkish speaking population in Anatolia,

306
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.599
in what's now Turkey. So that um I mean,

307
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.640
it's very striking that the country called Turkey should

308
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.640
be so far from the original homeland of the

309
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.920
Turks, whereas Mongolia is still where it started. Right.

310
00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:17.839
Do we know if there were any Muslims in

311
00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:18.199
China?

312
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.359
Yes, certainly there were Muslims in China, and they

313
00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:26.800
got there by two routes. One was by sea.

314
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.750
Uh, WE know for a fact that by the

315
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.520
8th century, there were Muslim merchants in the port

316
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.239
cities of southern China. Um, BUT they don't appear

317
00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:41.430
to have made any significant number of local converts.

318
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.339
We don't get any continuing Muslim community through that

319
00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:49.109
commercial route to southern China. The other route, of

320
00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:52.069
course, is over land. And I mean, as we

321
00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:55.540
already know, um, conquest is a great help in

322
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.089
spreading a religion, but there is no Muslim conquest

323
00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:04.180
of China. Uh, Timor in 1405 was planning one,

324
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.459
but he died before he could do it. Um,

325
00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:10.219
BUT the conquest that does matter is the Mongol

326
00:21:10.219 --> 00:21:12.969
conquest, and it's a pagan conquest, it's not a

327
00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:17.660
Muslim conquest, but the Mongols, they like to collect

328
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.949
experts from all sorts of different peoples. And they're

329
00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:24.869
not experts themselves. They need experts and they collect

330
00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:28.750
them. And so there are jobs for Muslims in

331
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.069
China, when the Mongols take over there, particularly as

332
00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:36.180
tax collectors, which makes them very unpopular, of course.

333
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:41.130
Nobody likes tax collectors. But um, You know, this

334
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.560
Muslim presence in China, and for example, um, Yeah,

335
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.780
I think the most successful single Muslim in China

336
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.930
was one who was appointed governor of Yunnan, you

337
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:56.300
know, down in the south southwest. And his descendants

338
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.880
are there to the present day. Um, AND, you

339
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.239
know, formed the sort of a part of the

340
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:10.010
elite of Yunnan down the centuries, um. So what

341
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.729
comes out of this is Muslims who were part

342
00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:17.839
of the political elite under the Mongols. When the

343
00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:20.859
Ming dynasty takes over, that's bad news for them.

344
00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:25.280
But nevertheless, some, many of them do remain part

345
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.680
of the elite. And in contrast to how things

346
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.079
were under the Mongols, if you want to be

347
00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:34.310
part of the elite in China under the Ming

348
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.119
and the Qing, you need to know your Confucian

349
00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:41.839
classics. You need to have that Chinese elite culture.

350
00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:46.270
And a lot of these Muslim families in eastern

351
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:52.209
China, they invest. In getting that elite culture. And

352
00:22:52.209 --> 00:22:55.000
out of that comes a very curious and interesting

353
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.530
phenomenon, a literature in Chinese, which is devoted to

354
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:07.020
saying that Confucianism and Islam are compatible. They basically

355
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.719
say the same thing. That that's, you know, the

356
00:23:09.719 --> 00:23:13.099
Muslim elite trying to feel comfortable in Confucian China.

357
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.339
Mhm.

358
00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:19.920
How did the Muslim world during the so-called Middle

359
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.359
Ages compare to Europe?

360
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:27.130
Right, I think it really depends very much on

361
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.079
which part of the Middle Ages you take. So

362
00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:32.699
I mean, if we take the early Middle Ages,

363
00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:37.599
I mean, say, 8th, 9th, into the 10th century.

364
00:23:38.829 --> 00:23:43.250
I would say that economically, the Muslim world is

365
00:23:43.869 --> 00:23:48.310
much richer than, you know, the, the European Christian

366
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.569
European world. I'd also say that in cultural terms,

367
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:58.290
Uh, the Muslim world, Baghdad, Cairo, is a Baghdad

368
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.209
is a much more interesting place to be culturally

369
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.199
than anywhere in Europe at the time. You know,

370
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.589
in Europe at the time, um, Most culture is

371
00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:09.750
in the monastery, most high culture is in the

372
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.819
monasteries, and mostly what they're doing is copying the

373
00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:17.630
old books. Whereas by contrast in the, in the

374
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.390
Muslim world at the time, say, in Baghdad, you

375
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:26.300
have a very large educated lay population. Um, AND

376
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.739
they're interested in all sorts of things, and people

377
00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:32.839
are writing about all sorts of things and disagreeing.

378
00:24:33.189 --> 00:24:35.979
Um, YOU know, it's a much more lively scene

379
00:24:35.979 --> 00:24:38.650
than you have in medieval Europe at the time.

380
00:24:39.219 --> 00:24:41.339
By contrast, I mean, if you take the late

381
00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:45.119
Middle Ages, we come to the 15th century. And

382
00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:50.140
I don't think it's more the case that the,

383
00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:52.239
you know, certainly the Middle Eastern part of the

384
00:24:52.239 --> 00:24:56.619
Muslim world is richer. India is very rich, but

385
00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:01.390
that's further over. Um, AND I would also say

386
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.709
that culturally, That difference that we had in the

387
00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:09.030
early Middle Ages has been erased. And by the

388
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.810
15th century, you know, we're getting to the printing

389
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.300
press in Europe. And though people try to play

390
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.619
that down, the fact is it does lead to

391
00:25:17.859 --> 00:25:22.260
an enormous cultural efflorescence, and you don't have an

392
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.660
equivalent of that in the Muslim world at the

393
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.339
time. So I think it all depends on when.

394
00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:31.229
I would like to ask you now about the

395
00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:36.560
Ottoman Empire. How was it formed and what territories

396
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.199
did it encompass?

397
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:45.140
Right. So the context for its formation is 14th

398
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.040
century Anatolia, what's now Turkey. And, and what you

399
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.540
have then in Anatolia is one, Muslim Turkish states,

400
00:25:56.839 --> 00:26:00.359
many of them. Politically, the region is very fragmented.

401
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.949
And the Ottoman state is one of those fragments.

402
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.619
And then you have what is left of the

403
00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:12.650
Byzantine Empire. Um, STILL with a little bit of

404
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:17.130
territory in Anatolia and a little bit of Balkan

405
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:23.369
territory. So that's the basic context, and the Ottomans.

406
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.430
They are exactly on the frontier between this Turkish

407
00:26:29.729 --> 00:26:35.670
world and the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine Empire. And they

408
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.569
are extraordinarily energetic, and who knows why or how,

409
00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:43.589
but they embark on a career of conquest that

410
00:26:43.589 --> 00:26:47.790
lasts for centuries. Uh, THEY go east, and they

411
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.729
take over all those Turkish states. You know, they

412
00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:55.729
go as far as um territory that had been

413
00:26:55.729 --> 00:26:58.689
effectively part of Iran and now becomes sort of

414
00:26:58.689 --> 00:27:03.260
Turkish territory. Uh, THEY'RE going west into the Balkans.

415
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.760
CONQUERING large territories up to and including a large

416
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.280
part of Hungary. Um, AND that that's in the

417
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.969
14th, 15, 15th centuries. Uh, AND in the 15th

418
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:21.069
century, they take Constantinople, which becomes the capital, Istanbul.

419
00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:24.979
And then in the 16th century, they go south,

420
00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:27.939
and they take over most of the Arab lands

421
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.020
in Asia and Africa. And now, Morocco remains independent.

422
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.209
Uh, Oman remains independent, but I mean, even Yemen

423
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:43.439
is conquered for a while by the Ottomans. So,

424
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:46.390
I mean, that's the basic picture of this state

425
00:27:46.689 --> 00:27:50.310
that lasts from the 14th century into the 20th.

426
00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:56.630
Did the Ottoman Empire have distinctive features when compared

427
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.859
to other empires in history?

428
00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:04.880
Right I, I think the single most distinctive thing

429
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.329
really is the Janissaries. Um, I mean, the fact

430
00:28:09.329 --> 00:28:12.930
that their infantry is not very distinctive. This is

431
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.849
a period in which the infantry is coming back

432
00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:19.650
in warfare as against cavalry. The fact that they're

433
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.709
slaves is not very distinctive in the Muslim world.

434
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.609
We had that already back in a big way

435
00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:30.520
in the 9th century. Um, BUT what is unique

436
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.520
about them is that the Ottoman state is recruiting

437
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:42.170
the Janissaries by enslaving Christian peasants. They go to

438
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.489
the Christian villages, especially in the Balkans, and they

439
00:28:46.489 --> 00:28:51.369
take boys from there, take them to Istanbul, and

440
00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:53.489
then they, they put them out to learn Turkish

441
00:28:53.489 --> 00:28:57.130
in the countryside, and then they train them, and

442
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.589
they, that becomes the core of the Ottoman army.

443
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:03.449
So that's one thing that's very, that's unique about

444
00:29:03.449 --> 00:29:06.489
the Jansis, I think. And the other thing that

445
00:29:06.489 --> 00:29:08.810
is at least very surprising, I don't know of

446
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.959
a parallel, is that um in religious terms, you

447
00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:16.010
would think that the Janissaries would be very solid

448
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.369
Sunnis. That's how they're brought up, once they're brought

449
00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:25.530
to, to into the empire into to Istanbul. But

450
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:30.280
they're not. They take up with A Sufi order,

451
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.680
the Bektashis. And the Bektashis, they're one of these

452
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.239
Sufi orders that has, they have wild ideas, and

453
00:29:38.239 --> 00:29:41.479
they do wild things, like they have something like

454
00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:44.959
a communion service where they serve wine. You know,

455
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.939
this has strong Christian resonance. It's very un-Islamic. Um,

456
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.920
THEY'RE also very friendly to Christians. Sometimes they will

457
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.479
let Christians join the brotherhood without even converting to

458
00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:03.560
Islam. And the Janissaries take this up. Maybe in

459
00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.640
some way it resonates with their Christian roots. I

460
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.400
don't know. But you have kind of a very

461
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.560
orthodox Sunni state. With a heterodox cop to its

462
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.209
army, which is at least strange and interesting.

463
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.420
So you mentioned Christians very briefly there. How did

464
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.500
Christians relate to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire? How

465
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.400
did the empire treat its Christian subjects?

466
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.260
Right. Well, let's take this first, I mean, in

467
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.339
principle. So in principle you have two completely distinct

468
00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:45.790
communities. Muslims and Christians, the Muslims are on the

469
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.989
inside track because they share the religion of the

470
00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:53.410
state. The Christians are on the outside track, and

471
00:30:53.469 --> 00:30:57.709
a clear indication of that is, well, one indication

472
00:30:57.709 --> 00:31:01.930
would be taxation. Christians pay a tax, the jizya,

473
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.589
that Muslims do not pay. So there's clear fiscal

474
00:31:06.589 --> 00:31:11.660
discrimination, if you like. And another would be that

475
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.729
The janissaries apart. There's no way a Christian could

476
00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:20.329
get a job, say, in the bureaucracy. That's for

477
00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:25.349
Muslims. Um, SO basically, I mean, that's the picture

478
00:31:25.349 --> 00:31:29.150
in principle. In practice, yes, it's a bit like

479
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.619
that, but not completely. So that, uh, for one

480
00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:37.540
thing, um, some Christians are very successful, like, you

481
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.510
can be appointed governor of Christian principalities in Moldavia,

482
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.500
Wallachia, Wallachia in what's now Romania, or close to

483
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:53.219
it. And, you know, these are tributary states. At

484
00:31:53.219 --> 00:31:57.050
first they have their own dynasties, but later the

485
00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.369
Ottomans get rid of the dynasties, and instead they

486
00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:03.540
appoint Greeks from Istanbul to govern them. So if

487
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.339
you become a governor of Moldavia, you're doing very

488
00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:09.020
well as a Christian. And the other thing is

489
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.729
that You know, Christianity and Islam are supposed to

490
00:32:12.729 --> 00:32:16.010
be quite separate, but they bleed into each other,

491
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.670
especially at a popular level. So that you have

492
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.189
things, they're really quite exotic things like, um, well,

493
00:32:23.239 --> 00:32:26.469
the Bektashis are part of that picture. I described

494
00:32:26.469 --> 00:32:30.300
that. And then if you go to Albania, and

495
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:35.520
you find them Albanian clans, where In winter, they're

496
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.329
down in the plains, and they're Muslims. In summer,

497
00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:42.510
they go up into the mountains and they're Christians.

498
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.770
You also have families, which will bring up the

499
00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.130
boys as Muslims and the girls as Christians. You

500
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.329
know, there's a lot of quite exotic sort of

501
00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:57.449
inter intermixing of the two religions at a popular

502
00:32:57.449 --> 00:33:01.449
level. So you have to qualify the in principle

503
00:33:01.449 --> 00:33:02.640
picture. Mhm mhm.

504
00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:06.810
When and how did the Ottoman Empire come to

505
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.390
an end?

506
00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.280
Right, it comes to an end. Well, I mean,

507
00:33:12.439 --> 00:33:17.099
already in the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire. IS

508
00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:22.199
kind of becoming a bit unsustainable. And it's a

509
00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:27.459
poor empire, and it confronts rich and militarily powerful

510
00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:32.150
enemies. And In the 19th century, that is going

511
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.510
to lead to recurrent losses of territory, but actually

512
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.030
it starts in the later 18th century and it

513
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.880
continues into the 20th century. Uh, VERY significantly, in

514
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.150
the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire could well have

515
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.150
disappeared if the British had not been there to

516
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.890
prop it up against the Russians. The, the British

517
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.189
regard it as in their geopolitical interest to keep

518
00:33:56.189 --> 00:34:01.430
the empire in existence. And then we come down

519
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:04.390
to the First World War, and that's really the

520
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:08.000
death blow. I mean, the Ottomans, they have a

521
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.560
horrible dilemma when Europe is moving towards the First

522
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.668
World War. If they stay neutral, they will not

523
00:34:15.668 --> 00:34:19.580
be present at the peace conference. I mean, everybody

524
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.899
expects that the, you know, the European powers are

525
00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:24.060
going to fight each other for a bit, and

526
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.379
then they'll negotiate, and they'll have a peace conference

527
00:34:26.379 --> 00:34:29.458
in some European city. And if the Ottomans are

528
00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:32.379
neutral, they won't be invited. And if they're not

529
00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:35.168
at the table, they'll be on the menu, as

530
00:34:35.168 --> 00:34:38.820
they say in Washington, um, you know, so that

531
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.248
European powers will be taking more Ottoman territory. So

532
00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:46.029
what they do is they want to join in.

533
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.159
No European power is enthusiastic about taking them, but

534
00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:54.050
eventually the Germans take them on, so they become

535
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.500
a German ally. And that turns out very badly

536
00:34:57.689 --> 00:35:00.929
when the war ends 4 years later, with total

537
00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:03.449
defeat on one side, total victory on the other

538
00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:05.909
side, and the Ottomans are on the losing side.

539
00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:10.860
And So then they're going to be carved up.

540
00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:16.070
And what you get then is a remarkable resurgence

541
00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:20.229
of part of the Ottoman elite. The Turkish nationalists,

542
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.949
as we call them, and they managed to carve

543
00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:26.719
out a much larger Bit of the central Ottoman

544
00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:29.919
territory than you could have expected, given the result

545
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:34.100
of the First World War. And And they're able

546
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.780
to secure their boundaries, and the European powers go

547
00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:44.219
away. And they could in principle have continued to

548
00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:47.479
call that the Ottoman Empire. In fact, they don't.

549
00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:49.780
They say this is not the Ottoman Empire anymore,

550
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.260
this is Turkey, and that's how we get the

551
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.260
country of Turkey. Mhm.

552
00:35:55.409 --> 00:35:59.090
So uh in regards to India and the presence

553
00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.850
of Muslims there, I know there's also a very

554
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.729
rich history there, but in the interest of time

555
00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:07.830
I will just ask you a few questions. So

556
00:36:08.409 --> 00:36:12.729
first, how was India like in terms of political

557
00:36:12.729 --> 00:36:15.290
organization before the arrival of Muslims?

558
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.770
Right. I mean, India's not like China, where you

559
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.649
typically have empires most of the time, uh, and

560
00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:25.850
there's no state that rules the whole of India

561
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:30.149
until the British. Um, YOU do have empires from

562
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:33.510
time to time. Uh, BEFORE the rise of Islam

563
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.270
and after. But, um, at the, at the time

564
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.959
when the Muslims first, the Arabs come to India

565
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.929
in the early 8th century, there's no empire there,

566
00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:45.750
so that India is politically fragmented.

567
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.149
Do Muslims relate to the Mughal Empire in any

568
00:36:52.149 --> 00:36:52.449
way?

569
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.840
Certainly, very strongly. I mean, of course, calling the

570
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.389
empire the Mughal Empire, that has a kind of

571
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.209
pagan smell to it. You know, that's the Mughals,

572
00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.669
that's the Mongols. And, you know, you're thinking back

573
00:37:07.669 --> 00:37:10.750
to Chinghiz Khan. But the fact of the matter

574
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.929
is that the Mughal Empire is the most powerful

575
00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:20.439
Muslim state. Ever in India. And the decline of

576
00:37:20.439 --> 00:37:22.899
the Mughal Empire in the 18th century was very

577
00:37:22.899 --> 00:37:27.510
bad news for Muslims. The abolition of the empire

578
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.310
by the British of what was left, the shadow

579
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:34.429
of the empire in 1858, and that was a

580
00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:37.590
very severe symbolic loss for the Muslims of India.

581
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.949
Uh, SO that, I mean, this naturally is a

582
00:37:40.949 --> 00:37:45.600
past with which they identify. And a past in

583
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.139
which they take pride. But um, I mean, here,

584
00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:53.419
we're sort of going beyond our limits, but, um,

585
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.300
you know, in the early 20th century, the Indian

586
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.699
Muslims are making a very big deal of the

587
00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:04.179
Ottoman Caliphate. They become kind of fixated on the

588
00:38:04.179 --> 00:38:09.290
Ottoman Caliphate. And, and they're very upset when the

589
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.800
Ottoman caliphate comes to an end in the 1920s.

590
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.120
And that there's a kind of desperation there, if

591
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.300
they had still had a kind of shadow Muslim

592
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.439
Mughal emperor, maybe that could have been a focus

593
00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:28.219
for political activity against the British. Like in Morocco,

594
00:38:28.459 --> 00:38:30.750
where the French keep the Moroccan Sultan, they don't

595
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.189
abolish the sultanate, and the Moroccan Sultan then becomes

596
00:38:34.189 --> 00:38:37.360
an important figure in the nationalist movement against the

597
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.719
French. Nothing like that in India.

598
00:38:41.429 --> 00:38:45.570
How did Muslims and Hindus relate to one another?

599
00:38:47.169 --> 00:38:50.030
Right. And I think what you have to say

600
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.260
there is that it's extremely varied, but I mean,

601
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:57.850
there are two extremes. At one extreme, the Muslims

602
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.199
may be destroying Hindu temples right and left. And

603
00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:05.959
at the other extreme, everybody is getting along very

604
00:39:05.959 --> 00:39:14.239
happily. And then, you know, the Muslim zealots, they

605
00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:18.919
can of course, quote from Revelation, uh, in a

606
00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:22.260
sense, they have an Islamic rectitude on their side.

607
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.040
Uh, AND you do get a lot of Muslim

608
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.840
zealotry in India. But on the other hand, whenever

609
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.229
you have two populations side by side, I mean,

610
00:39:32.639 --> 00:39:36.199
total hostility is something you can't, you can't live

611
00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:39.840
with that indefinitely. So you're going to get accommodations.

612
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.760
And then these accommodations spring up and, you know,

613
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.889
you have things like just as in the Ottoman

614
00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:51.649
Empire at a popular level, Islam and Christian and

615
00:39:51.649 --> 00:39:55.840
Hinduism are bleeding into each other. Um, YOU know,

616
00:39:55.959 --> 00:39:58.760
so that you have shrines, where both Hindus and

617
00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.639
Muslims worship. And, you have a, a medieval, he's

618
00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:09.330
undateable, but a medieval religious figure, who you can

619
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.959
call him a Sufi Muslim, or you can call

620
00:40:12.959 --> 00:40:16.379
him a Vaishnavite Hindu. It's it's up to you.

621
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.639
Um And he writes poetry in which he trashes

622
00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:26.550
the Koran and he trashes the Brahmins. And when

623
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:32.510
he dies, according to the story, uh, There's a

624
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.709
quarrel between his Muslim and his Christian followers as

625
00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:39.129
to who gets the body to bury or burn.

626
00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:44.780
And miraculously, two bodies appear, and the Muslims take

627
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.699
one and bury it, and the Christians take the

628
00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:53.590
other and burn it. Um, YOU know, so you're

629
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.260
getting a whole spectrum. Mhm.

630
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.560
How about Southeast Asia? How did the Muslims get

631
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.679
there and did they have a very big presence

632
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:04.979
there?

633
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:12.610
Right, now then. They must have been there already,

634
00:41:12.719 --> 00:41:15.840
at least by the 8th century, since we know

635
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.229
that there were Muslim merchants in China, um, who

636
00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:21.229
had come by sea, and there's no way they

637
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:23.870
could come by sea except going through Southeast Asia.

638
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.379
But, well, maybe one thing about merchants is that

639
00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:31.189
while they can lead to conversion to their religion,

640
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.959
it's going to be very slow. They don't have

641
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:39.689
the kind of authority and power of conquerors. Um,

642
00:41:40.169 --> 00:41:42.570
SO maybe that's why it's not until the late

643
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.909
13th century that we first hear about Muslim communities

644
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.610
in Southeast Asia, as opposed to just merchants passing

645
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:54.679
through. But from that point on, they're definitely there.

646
00:41:55.139 --> 00:42:00.679
And Islam keeps expanding. And, you know, initially, what

647
00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:03.719
we're dealing with is a typically Indian Ocean phenomenon

648
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:08.580
of Islam spread by merchants on the coast, but

649
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.919
not spreading to the interior. But then gradually, at

650
00:42:12.919 --> 00:42:14.959
least in some, some of the islands in the

651
00:42:14.959 --> 00:42:18.939
Malay Peninsula, it begins to spread to the interior.

652
00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:23.320
So for example, Java becomes Muslim, you know, all

653
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.000
the way. Um, YOU also, it's, it spreads well

654
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.800
beyond the rim of the Indian Ocean, in fact,

655
00:42:29.879 --> 00:42:32.239
to the rim of the Pacific, so that you

656
00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:37.439
get Muslims in Halmahera and Mindanao, and, you know,

657
00:42:37.479 --> 00:42:43.810
the very extreme western tip of New Guinea. So

658
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.360
we're getting a large Muslim presence. And over time,

659
00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:51.000
it becomes larger and larger, except in the Philippines,

660
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.830
where the Spanish arrest its expansion and promote Catholicism.

661
00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.570
But otherwise, and we're getting a popular, I mean,

662
00:42:59.449 --> 00:43:02.929
It's no accident that at the present day, Indonesia

663
00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:06.770
is the country with the largest Muslim population anywhere.

664
00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:10.250
Mhm. So those merchants in the end had a

665
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.790
very considerable impact.

666
00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:17.300
In Africa, how did things, things play out? How

667
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.500
far did Muslims spread and how did local societies

668
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.270
look like?

669
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.459
Right. So I mean, Africa is a very big

670
00:43:25.459 --> 00:43:30.679
place, so naturally we have diverse scenes. Um, AND

671
00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:33.260
we have the East African coast, I already mentioned

672
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.699
that, uh. You go to the Upper Nilelo south

673
00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:41.510
of that, and you have, at the beginning of

674
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:44.699
our of in the early Islamic period, you have

675
00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:50.060
Christian Nubia and Christian Ethiopia. Christian Ethiopia is still

676
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.169
there, but Christian Nubia is not. That becomes entirely

677
00:43:55.899 --> 00:44:00.840
Muslim territory. And, further west, you have the savannah.

678
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.530
Uh, YOU know, the, um, the grasslands south of

679
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:09.649
the Sahara Desert. Uh, I reckon that, and my

680
00:44:09.649 --> 00:44:12.989
guess is that in before the rise of Islam,

681
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.879
what you had there was Pagan African states that

682
00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:20.850
had little or no contact with the world, the

683
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:24.919
other side of the Sahara. But uh somehow one

684
00:44:24.919 --> 00:44:27.479
of the effects of the rise of Islam is

685
00:44:27.479 --> 00:44:30.310
that the Sahara opens up. I mean, it's a

686
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.790
horrible desert to cross, but merchants now start to

687
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.189
cross it in considerable numbers. And, you know, there

688
00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:39.270
are commercial profits to be made that make it

689
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.459
worthwhile. Um, AND so you get these Muslim merchants

690
00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:46.300
coming down into the savannah. Uh, WE get an

691
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.060
early picture of that from a geographer writing in

692
00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.739
the 11th century. Uh, YOU have a pagan African

693
00:44:53.739 --> 00:44:57.820
kingdom in the savannah. Uh, AND the king has

694
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.540
his pagan capital. But a few miles away, there's

695
00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.040
a Muslim town where the merchants live. And there

696
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.070
they have their own Muslim judges, you know, they're

697
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.889
leading a fully Muslim way of life, and the

698
00:45:10.889 --> 00:45:15.760
two are interacting. And the king also, um, he

699
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.040
values Muslims. Uh, YOU know, it's, again, it's the

700
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.639
question of like, just as the Mongols like experts,

701
00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:27.310
the king of, of Ghana, in this case, likes

702
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:32.389
experts. So that the Muslims, they, they're literate, they're

703
00:45:32.389 --> 00:45:38.709
numerate, they can handle the fiscal administration. And, and

704
00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:42.270
then gradually, Islam spreads more in different ways in

705
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.110
different places until you end up with actual Muslim

706
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:49.709
states, like in Mali, which even Batuta, the, you

707
00:45:49.709 --> 00:45:54.229
know, the Moroccan traveler visited in the 14th century.

708
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:57.959
And the way he describes it, yes, and Mali

709
00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:02.260
is a Muslim state with a Muslim population. In

710
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.790
some ways, he says they're very good Muslims. Like,

711
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.870
for example, er, people force their children to learn

712
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.219
the Quran by heart, and the children are lazy

713
00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:16.459
learning the Quran. They put fetters on them to

714
00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:19.060
punish them. And even Battuta thinks this is very

715
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:23.439
good. On the other hand, you still get uh

716
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:29.070
girls wandering around naked. Uh, SLAVE girls wander around

717
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.399
naked, but it's not just slave girls. Uh, THE

718
00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:36.949
daughter of the ruler of Mali, uh, she goes

719
00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:41.310
around populace, and, and, you know, all that is

720
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.149
extremely shocking to even Batuta. So what we get

721
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:46.870
there is a kind of snapshot of society that

722
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.909
is in some ways very Muslim, and in some

723
00:46:49.909 --> 00:46:54.739
ways still very pagan, you could say. And gradually

724
00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:58.800
things are consolidated until the savannah becomes a solidly

725
00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.760
Muslim territory.

726
00:47:01.149 --> 00:47:04.389
Finally, let me ask you a few questions about

727
00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:08.750
the Muslim world in the present day. Which countries

728
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.280
or areas of the globe does it encompass? Which

729
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.110
parts of the globe and which countries would you

730
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.770
say are part of the Muslim world?

731
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:26.179
Right. Um, Yeah, I would say the Muslim world

732
00:47:26.179 --> 00:47:31.409
is confined to Eurasia. NOT Eurasia and Africa, to

733
00:47:31.409 --> 00:47:34.649
the old world. Uh, OUTSIDE the old world, what

734
00:47:34.649 --> 00:47:38.570
you get is Muslim diasporas, and they, they can

735
00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.530
be quite important and quite large. Uh, BUT we

736
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.860
don't have a Muslim majority country outside the old

737
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.649
world. In the old world, it's a very large

738
00:47:47.649 --> 00:47:51.070
phenomenon, but we have the northern half of Africa,

739
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.030
with the exception of Ethiopia. We have the Middle

740
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:59.459
East, with the exception of some of Transcaucasian, Armenia,

741
00:47:59.669 --> 00:48:04.979
Georgia. Um, WE have Central Asia, but not Inner

742
00:48:04.979 --> 00:48:07.679
Asia. Inner Asia, you know, the Mongols go Buddhist.

743
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:12.649
Uh, IN South Asia, we have You know, significant

744
00:48:12.649 --> 00:48:17.939
territories in the northwest and northeast. Um, AND then

745
00:48:17.939 --> 00:48:21.580
in Southeast Asia, yes, in Southeast Asia, it's the

746
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.540
islands and the Malay Peninsula, maritime Southeast Asia, but

747
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.459
not the mainland. The mainland, it's a matter of

748
00:48:29.459 --> 00:48:34.729
Muslim minorities. And yeah, and that's the basic picture.

749
00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:39.159
Mhm. What are the biggest changes in the Muslim

750
00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:42.949
world that occurred over the past two centuries?

751
00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:49.110
Right. I would say. First and most, perhaps most

752
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:53.790
obviously, you have the rise of non-Muslim power at

753
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.350
the expense of Muslim power in the world. Uh,

754
00:48:57.439 --> 00:49:01.709
WHEREBY, you know, Europe, which mostly in the Middle

755
00:49:01.709 --> 00:49:06.820
Ages It was not a serious threat to Muslims,

756
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.350
certainly, certainly in the early Middle Ages. And by

757
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.179
the time you get to the 18th century, that

758
00:49:12.179 --> 00:49:14.750
has changed, and it's changed even more in the

759
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:21.459
19th century. And At first it's European powers. Then

760
00:49:22.169 --> 00:49:25.449
it's of course the United States of America, an

761
00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:30.560
offshoot of Europe. And now increasingly it's also China.

762
00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:38.209
And all these are large, militarily powerful states outside

763
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.629
the Muslim world. Whereas by contrast, in the Muslim

764
00:49:41.629 --> 00:49:43.909
world, if you think about it at the present

765
00:49:43.909 --> 00:49:47.969
day, There is no giant state. There is no

766
00:49:47.969 --> 00:49:51.449
really large state, uh, nothing like the United States

767
00:49:51.449 --> 00:49:56.010
or Brazil or India, or what have you. Um.

768
00:49:56.979 --> 00:50:00.530
So that there's a very real turning of the

769
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.260
balance of power against the Muslim world. So that's

770
00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.139
one thing. And then the second thing, and it

771
00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:13.040
goes with that, is The need for Muslim states

772
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.860
and societies to take over many aspects of Western

773
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.629
civilization. In the future, it could be whatever the

774
00:50:21.629 --> 00:50:27.429
Chinese do, we'll see. Um And so that, uh,

775
00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:31.469
you know, in the Middle East today. IS more

776
00:50:31.469 --> 00:50:35.110
recognizable visually, so to speak, to a European than

777
00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:36.790
it would be to a Muslim of the 18th

778
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:42.010
century. You know, the architecture, apart from symbolic architecture,

779
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:46.590
the architecture is Western, uh, books look like Western

780
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:54.030
books, not like traditional Muslim manuscripts. Um, ARMIES basically

781
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:58.070
are on the Western model, not on pre-modern Muslim

782
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:05.469
models, etc. ETC. I mean Alongside the invasion of

783
00:51:05.469 --> 00:51:09.189
political and military power, there's been an invasion of

784
00:51:09.189 --> 00:51:13.080
culture. And economics on a large scale. What would

785
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.399
I add to that? Well, two things that are

786
00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:19.929
certainly related to Western dominance of the world, and

787
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.399
the West becoming a kind of model, and Well,

788
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.370
one is. A great increase in the size of

789
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.919
populations. I think that would not have happened without

790
00:51:31.979 --> 00:51:35.820
Western public medicine. So that, I mean, the population

791
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:39.659
of Muslim countries is now typically greater by an

792
00:51:39.659 --> 00:51:42.870
order of magnitude, at least now than it was

793
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.429
in the 18th century. And another thing, the last

794
00:51:46.429 --> 00:51:51.669
thing I'll throw in here is increasing literacy in

795
00:51:51.669 --> 00:51:54.649
the population at large. You know, so far as

796
00:51:54.649 --> 00:51:59.479
we can judge, um, in the 19th century, uh,

797
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:04.169
literacy rates in the Muslim world were mostly in

798
00:52:04.169 --> 00:52:10.560
single figures. Today, I think there's no Muslim country

799
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.699
that doesn't have A majority of the population, at

800
00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:18.580
least somewhat literate. It's a very dramatic change, and

801
00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:23.449
it has, of course, important cultural implications. Mhm

802
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.760
What would you say has been the impact of

803
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.429
Western countries on the Middle East,

804
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:37.850
particularly in the Middle East. So again, Western power

805
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:43.979
is the most conspicuous thing. Uh The British and

806
00:52:43.979 --> 00:52:47.750
the French ruled significant parts of the Middle East,

807
00:52:48.379 --> 00:52:50.300
not for as long as the British ruled India

808
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.540
or the French ruled Algeria, but still for significant

809
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:58.040
periods. You could also say that the, the Russians

810
00:52:58.139 --> 00:52:59.699
took part of the Middle East up in the

811
00:52:59.699 --> 00:53:04.760
north, Transcaucasia, and in the case of Azerbaijan, that's

812
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:14.639
a Muslim territory. Um. Yeah, alongside that kind of

813
00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:20.820
direct rule. By European countries you have indirect hegemony.

814
00:53:21.689 --> 00:53:24.969
And I think For a while, that is something

815
00:53:24.969 --> 00:53:27.800
the British had. In parts of the Middle East,

816
00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:32.770
they didn't actually rule. Um, IT'S now something that

817
00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.929
America has. And what we've recently been seeing in

818
00:53:35.929 --> 00:53:39.570
the Middle East is a rather dramatic example of

819
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.949
that. And And then of course I mean the

820
00:53:43.959 --> 00:53:45.969
the cultural side of it that I was talking

821
00:53:45.969 --> 00:53:51.159
about before. Uh, WHEREBY, um, I mean, if you

822
00:53:51.159 --> 00:53:54.600
go to Lebanon, uh, the elite is still to

823
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.459
a considerable extent French speaking. Whereas the world over,

824
00:53:59.739 --> 00:54:01.979
English has become kind of the second language of

825
00:54:01.979 --> 00:54:05.570
elites. Uh, SO the French stamp is still left

826
00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:10.489
there to a lesser extent in Syria. Um, THE

827
00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:15.530
British in Egypt. But there, of course, the Egyptians

828
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:18.659
got very friendly with the French, just because they

829
00:54:18.659 --> 00:54:21.540
were being ruled by the British. So there's French

830
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.760
influence there too. Yeah, a lot of influence by

831
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.560
European countries.

832
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:30.810
Does the history of the Muslim world help us

833
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.800
understand the current state of the Middle East in

834
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.469
any way?

835
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:37.679
Right, I think if you knew nothing about the

836
00:54:37.679 --> 00:54:40.489
history of the Muslim world, then you would find

837
00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:43.050
the state of the Middle East very puzzling. But

838
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.209
that doesn't mean that, um, knowing the history would

839
00:54:47.209 --> 00:54:50.330
enable you to predict what happens in the Middle

840
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:54.120
East. No, I mean, Uh, there's too much, uh,

841
00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:57.540
that is a matter of accident. Uh, THERE'S of

842
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.729
luck. There is too much that is a matter

843
00:55:00.729 --> 00:55:05.449
of external actors, as we see just now in

844
00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:09.399
the Middle East. Um, I mean, if you ask

845
00:55:09.399 --> 00:55:11.949
the question, why is there a state of Israel

846
00:55:11.949 --> 00:55:15.000
in the Middle East, you can't answer that question

847
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.620
without talking about the Russian Empire in Eastern Europe,

848
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.110
and the British Empire and the Palestinian mandate. And

849
00:55:23.879 --> 00:55:29.110
And certainly, yeah, I'm. The history of the Middle

850
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:33.550
East is fundamentalist background. Is it more than background?

851
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.379
Well, let me give you just one thought here.

852
00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:41.659
Uh, IF we look at the war that's going

853
00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:45.739
on or maybe has stopped, just stopped in the

854
00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:50.209
Middle East at the moment. Um, ONE question you

855
00:55:50.209 --> 00:55:55.250
might ask is, why does Iran regard Israel as

856
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.949
its great as one of its greatest enemies? Because

857
00:55:59.679 --> 00:56:04.600
in geopolitical terms, that makes no sense. In geopolitical

858
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:09.590
terms, unless you're an imperial power like America. You

859
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.570
quarrel with your neighbors. And the people on the

860
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.850
other side of their neighbors are allies against your

861
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:18.850
neighbors. Now that pattern we don't see in the

862
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.800
Middle East. And I think you can't understand it

863
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.199
without the Islamic dimension. That is to say, one,

864
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:34.909
that from, you know, an Islamic viewpoint, Being the

865
00:56:34.909 --> 00:56:38.659
enemy of Israel looks good. So that helps Iran

866
00:56:38.659 --> 00:56:41.620
to look good in the Middle East. And 2,

867
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:47.169
Iran In the 16th century became a Shiite country.

868
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.040
And that means it's liable to be a kind

869
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:56.739
of pariah country. IN a a largely Sunni world.

870
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.040
And one of the ways in which Iran can

871
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.959
try to escape this pariah status. IS by being

872
00:57:05.959 --> 00:57:09.979
against Israel. They can say to the Sunnis, look,

873
00:57:10.479 --> 00:57:12.800
you're not doing a good job against Israel, but

874
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.870
we are. And I think that is at least

875
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:20.149
part of the explanation for this, the hostility of

876
00:57:20.149 --> 00:57:21.469
Iran to Israel.

877
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.000
Mhm. So I have one last question then, and

878
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.159
in our first conversation we started by discussing what

879
00:57:30.159 --> 00:57:32.919
Islam is, and now I would like to ask

880
00:57:32.919 --> 00:57:37.199
you, what are Sunni and Shia Muslims and what

881
00:57:37.199 --> 00:57:39.100
is the divide based on?

882
00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:42.969
Right, so I mean this is a sectarian division

883
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.100
just as Catholics and Protestants is a sectarian division.

884
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.610
In that sense, it's very easily understood. Uh, WHAT

885
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.560
does it actually go back to? Uh, IT goes

886
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.709
back to the succession to the Prophet Muhammad. So

887
00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:02.810
in 632, I mean, looking back on what happened

888
00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:06.010
in 632 when the prophet died, if you're a

889
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:10.570
Sunni, you say, yes, the Muslim community did right

890
00:58:10.879 --> 00:58:14.469
to appoint Abu Bakr as successor to the prophet,

891
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:18.120
and then Omar as his successor, then Osthman as

892
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:24.479
his successor, and then Ali. As Uthman's successor. Whereas

893
00:58:24.479 --> 00:58:29.709
if you're a Shiite, You say no. Abu Bakr,

894
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:33.600
Omar, and Othman were usurpers. They had no business

895
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.840
becoming caliphs. The caliph should have been Ali right

896
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:43.050
from the start, from 632. Not waiting his turn

897
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:48.810
until 6:56. So you have that fundamental disagreement over

898
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:52.290
which a civil war was fought in the 650s.

899
00:58:54.169 --> 00:58:56.689
Now, I mean, that kind of disagreement can either

900
00:58:56.689 --> 00:59:00.739
disappear. Or it can be taken up and elaborated.

901
00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:05.320
And it's elaboration that happens. Um, YOU know, what

902
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.439
happens is that other things then crystallize around this

903
00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:14.159
basic political difference. So, for example, um, you know,

904
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:20.399
Shiite theology is significantly different from Sunni theology. Uh,

905
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.189
I mean, crudely speaking, the Shiites believe in free

906
00:59:26.189 --> 00:59:35.010
will. Whereas the Sunnis believe in predestination. And Shiite

907
00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:39.669
law is significantly different from Sunni law. For example,

908
00:59:40.129 --> 00:59:44.610
in Sunni law, a man cannot have a free

909
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.010
concubine. He can have a slave concubine, but not

910
00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:50.250
a free woman as concubine. If he wants a

911
00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:53.129
free woman, he has to marry her. By contrast,

912
00:59:53.209 --> 00:59:57.290
in Shiite law, you can have free concubines. So

913
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:02.790
that say an elite Member, a member of the

914
01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:08.370
elite in Iran. As a Shiite. Could take a

915
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:14.679
concubine from the lower class. Uh, AND in English,

916
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.560
people sometimes call this temporary marriage. Um, IT'S a

917
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.919
temporary arrangement and it's not actually marriage. So I

918
01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:25.459
mean, that's a significant difference that affects everyday life

919
01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.120
between Sunni and Shiite law. And then perhaps most

920
01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:39.510
important is Mm And Sunniism and Shiism. Have very

921
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:44.449
different, if you might say, emotional repertoires. And what's

922
01:00:44.449 --> 01:00:49.600
striking about Shiism is a sense of loss, of

923
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:56.209
injustice, of of having been oppressed and repressed. Um,

924
01:00:56.459 --> 01:00:58.620
A sense of feeling sorry for yourself, you could

925
01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:02.370
say. And, and that whole emotional repertoire is really

926
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:03.649
not part of Sunniism.

927
01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:10.060
Right. OK, so the book is again a history

928
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.199
of the Muslim world from its origins to the

929
01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:16.469
dawn of modernity. Of course, I'm leaving a link
