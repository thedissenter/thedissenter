00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.950
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.969
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.329
today I'm joined by Doctor Jennifer Nagle. She's professor

4
00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.079
in the department of philosophy at the University of

5
00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.409
Toronto. Her research focuses on knowledge, belief, and our.

6
00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:20.795
Capacities to track these states in ourselves and others,

7
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.915
and today we're going to talk mostly about epistemic

8
00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:29.764
intuitions, knowledge, common knowledge, and some other related topics.

9
00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:31.954
So Dr. Nagle, welcome to the show. It's a

10
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:32.845
pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.639
Pleasure to be here. Thanks very much for the

12
00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:36.349
invitation.

13
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.020
So, I've already had many interviews on the topic

14
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.299
of epistemology on the show, but I don't think

15
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.819
I've ever talked at least directly about epistemic intuition.

16
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.220
So could you start by giving us, um, a

17
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.229
definition? What are epistemic intuitions?

18
00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:03.220
Epistemic intuitions are these sort of immediate, uncalculated, spontaneous

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.279
impressions we have. Of whether somebody does or doesn't

20
00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:11.610
know something. Um, THERE'S actually a broader category of

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.290
epistemic intuitions where we're not just looking at impressions

22
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.250
of states of knowledge itself, but also related states,

23
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.129
like maybe the state of being justified in thinking

24
00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.489
something, even if you don't know it. Uh, MY

25
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:31.690
own work focuses primarily on impressions of knowledge, um,

26
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.849
because, in part because I think those other impressions,

27
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.650
like whether somebody's justified. ARE, um, kind of downstream

28
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.610
from knowledge, and, um, they depend ultimately on our

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.910
capacity to track what is and isn't known. Um,

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.459
SO I think that's the, that's the best, um,

31
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.849
point of departure. Uh, AND I think it's just

32
00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.389
amazing, um, that we have these impressions at all.

33
00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.529
They're not something you get just when you're, you

34
00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:01.190
know, reading a philosophy article or something like that.

35
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.129
You can have the impression when you're talking to

36
00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.529
somebody on the street, um, maybe that they know

37
00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.369
something or that they don't know something, um, in

38
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.850
everyday conversation, as you're bouncing back and forth, asking

39
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.559
people questions, reacting. Um, YOU have to have a

40
00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.440
sense of what they do and don't know, even

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.360
just to decide, look, am I going to tell

42
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.559
this person this thing or ask them. Um, AND

43
00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.080
even in interactions where you're not even talking, uh,

44
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.039
you're just walking down the street, uh, you make

45
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.800
judgments. Um, IS this person who's coming towards me

46
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.080
like completely absorbed in their phone? I don't assume

47
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000
that they know that I'm, I'm, I'm gonna have

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.539
to step out of their way. Um, SO how

49
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.479
we're interacting with each other, deeply connected to our

50
00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.990
impressions of whether they do or don't know. And

51
00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.460
knowledge itself is like, it's just kind of abstract.

52
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.520
You might think it's kind of like an invisible,

53
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.860
um, uh, condition out there in the world. It's

54
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.139
not like, you know, when someone knows a fact,

55
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.940
it's not like them running or jumping, um, that

56
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.119
has really obvious surface level. Um, CHARACTERISTICS that you

57
00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.759
could just pick up with ordinary sense perception, um.

58
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.449
It's possible to know things in a lot of

59
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.690
different ways, and there are so many different things

60
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.570
that someone might or might not know. So it's

61
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.449
just a really interesting question. How do we get

62
00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.889
these impressions of knowledge and its absence, and how

63
00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.130
do we in real time, uh, calculate what's going

64
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.669
on? And then, you know, once you have a

65
00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.009
an idea of how this is working, you can

66
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.610
ask, well, how good are those impressions? How, how,

67
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.850
how, how accurately are we, are we tracking the

68
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.610
presence and absence of knowledge? Cause of course, sometimes

69
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.580
you think someone Know something and you discover they

70
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.240
don't or, or vice versa.

71
00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:55.660
And so how do philosophers approach epistemic intuitions? How

72
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.919
do they approach these sort of impressions of knowledge?

73
00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.259
Uh, I mean, I'm asking you that because later

74
00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.309
I'm also going to ask you about scientific approaches

75
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.979
to epistemic assessments like the ones coming from linguistics

76
00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.059
and psychology, for example, but how do philosophers do

77
00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.419
it?

78
00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.048
So it It really depends on the philosopher. Um,

79
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.579
PHILOSOPHERS have approached epistemic intuitions in all sorts of

80
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.510
different ways. Um, THE nature of knowledge itself is

81
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.029
a huge philosophical question across all traditions. And philosophers

82
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.549
from multiple historical traditions have used impressions of knowledge,

83
00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:39.470
pre-theoretical impressions of knowledge as a guide for the

84
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.829
construction of their theories. So in Plato, for example,

85
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.480
Um, you see, uh, his great dialogue, the Theattas,

86
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.760
struggling with this question of the nature of knowledge,

87
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.140
and, um, and there's a, there's an issue at

88
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.510
some point whether knowledge is just true judgment. Uh,

89
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.100
AND, uh, Socrates gives a great example of a

90
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.500
true judgment that isn't knowledge. So you have somebody

91
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.649
who is actually innocent of a crime. Um, BUT,

92
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.929
uh, their lawyer doesn't have much time to convince

93
00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.549
the jury. Um, AND the lawyer, it seems actually

94
00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.850
doesn't even really care whether the guy is innocent.

95
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.559
Um, BUT if Plato says it's the kind of

96
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.290
thing that you would really have needed an eyewitness

97
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.709
there to know the truth of it. Um, BUT

98
00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.429
actually it doesn't matter for, for this particular innocent

99
00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.029
man because his, his lawyer is just great with

100
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.829
the rhetoric and persuades the jury, not through evidence

101
00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.140
at all, um, that the client is an innocent,

102
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.910
innocent man, and the jury acquits. And, and then

103
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.149
the question is, if, if a member of the

104
00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.609
jury. Believes that or judges that this man is

105
00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:53.170
innocent. Do they actually know that he's innocent, just

106
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.619
on the basis of that beautiful speech that the

107
00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.160
lawyer gave, which had nothing to do with evidence.

108
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.100
And if you're like Plato, you get the feeling,

109
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.660
no, this guy doesn't know. There's a gap between

110
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.279
just judging truly and, and knowing and um And

111
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.679
That there's a gap there is actually one of

112
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:19.160
the few things that Socrates says he knows to

113
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.079
be the case. He says this in Mino, in

114
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.799
the Mino, he says, yeah, he's famous for, for

115
00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.720
claiming not to know a lot of stuff, but

116
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.519
one thing he does know, he says, is that,

117
00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.600
um, knowledge is not the same as just true

118
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.959
judgment, seems to demand something kind of more. So

119
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.420
you have, you have in that tradition. Um, uh,

120
00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:41.760
THE use of these pre-theoretical, you know, you're just

121
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.250
rolling on your gut sense, yeah, that juryman doesn't

122
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.809
know that the guy's innocent. Um, AND you see

123
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:49.690
it in other traditions too, so you see it

124
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.690
in the South Asian tradition as well. Um, SO

125
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.130
can I tell you another quite different example from,

126
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.579
from that tradition? OK, so, um, uh, this example

127
00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:03.670
is from an 8th century philosopher called Dharmutara, and,

128
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:12.339
um, He, he considers uh. A character who. SEES

129
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.940
in the distance what looks like a cloud of

130
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.179
smoke rising from a hillside. And um and he

131
00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:25.040
says, Yeah, there's a fire burning at that spot.

132
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.709
And, and actually what he says is true, um,

133
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.130
there is a fire burning there, and this guy's

134
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.329
actually kind of justified in making his, in making

135
00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:38.450
his, his judgment, right? Because judging that there's a

136
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.649
fire burning from smoke is a pretty rational thing

137
00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:44.989
to do, that's pretty good evidence. However, Demater says,

138
00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:50.440
if you zoom in, Um, at this spot. Um,

139
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.950
Some meat has been placed over a fire, and

140
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.929
the meat has attracted a great swarm of insects,

141
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.480
um, and there's no smoke at all. The fire

142
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.019
has just been lit a few, a few seconds

143
00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:05.750
ago. Um, SO what our guy is seeing from

144
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.989
the distance is actually not smoke at all, which

145
00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:09.790
is a sign of fire. It's a swarm of

146
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.690
insects, which is not a sign of fire. Um,

147
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:15.429
AND therm asks, like, does this person know that

148
00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:18.549
there's a fire burning at the spot? And maybe

149
00:08:18.549 --> 00:08:21.829
you have the impression, no, he doesn't. Um, AND

150
00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:23.269
that's something that actually is a bit of a

151
00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:26.109
clue, uh, to the nature of knowledge. It, it

152
00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:29.809
indicates that knowledge might not be just true judgment

153
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.869
that's based on pretty good evidence. Seems like there

154
00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:34.510
has to be something more to it than that.

155
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.109
Um, SO, philosophers have used epistemic intuitions as, um,

156
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.599
sources of initial evidence, and then there's different ways

157
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.520
you can go on this, depending on what kind

158
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.700
of philosopher you are. Some philosophers try to use

159
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.400
all of our impressions of knowledge and really sculpt

160
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.239
a theory of knowledge that will fit all of

161
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:58.919
those data points. The trouble we've discovered in the

162
00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:02.760
20th century is that the data points are really

163
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.349
bizarre. Um, SO you can also sometimes have intuitive

164
00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:10.869
impressions of knowledge that end up being paradoxical, and

165
00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:13.820
end up driving the construction of sort of peculiar,

166
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:20.299
um, uh, uh, sometimes really counterintuitive theories. Uh, SO,

167
00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:24.140
so there's theories, um, that are quite skeptical in

168
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.619
nature, because, you know, sometimes if you think twice

169
00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:28.820
and really focus on it, it seems like you

170
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.140
can't even really know, you know, that there's a

171
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.250
hand in front of your face, uh, cause you

172
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.210
might be dreaming. Um, AND, uh, it's very hard

173
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.530
to have an elegant theory of knowledge that respects

174
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.650
all those data points. So my own work kind

175
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.890
of tries to steer a middle course. I take

176
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.809
some evidential support from, from intuitions, but at the

177
00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:51.250
same time, I also try and figure out, are

178
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.690
some of these data points, um, sort of the

179
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.750
equivalent of perceptual illusions? Are they being generated by,

180
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.059
um, features of our knowledge tracking capacity? Um, THAT

181
00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:05.500
are not guaranteed to get you to the truth

182
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.380
about knowledge.

183
00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:11.219
And uh I mean, what are the main philosophical

184
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.739
views of epistemic intuitions? I mean, are there different

185
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:19.299
kinds of theories or how does it work in

186
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:20.080
philosophy?

187
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.549
I mean, again, that's just like a really huge

188
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:26.299
question. I mean, Plato thought that, you know, before

189
00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:28.960
your birth, your soul is exposed to the forms,

190
00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:32.210
and you are actually like remembering the forms. um,

191
00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:35.239
PEOPLE are all over the map on this. Um,

192
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.859
SOME people want to have um very much sort

193
00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:41.900
of usage driven views so that knowledge just is

194
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.380
whatever our senses employing the word knowledge might be

195
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.619
picking out. I think that that approach ends up

196
00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:50.440
being kind of incoherent. Um, I think there's, there's

197
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.830
just a great diversity of different ways you can,

198
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.549
you can, you can approach, um, epistemic, uh, epistemic

199
00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.799
intuitions, epistemic judgments. Um, I mean, one big thing

200
00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:05.539
to say is that these judgments are pre-theoretical. Um,

201
00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:09.260
THEY concern particular cases. I'll tell you a story

202
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.719
about a guy, I'll tell you a story about

203
00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:13.080
a stopped clock. Um, I could bring you into

204
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.460
the lab and um have you. Uh, READ the

205
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.900
story on screen and I can do eye tracking

206
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.580
to see, you know, which details of the story

207
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.039
you focus on and whether that has an impact

208
00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:28.179
on, uh, on your judgment. But, um, but all

209
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:32.510
these pre-theoretical particular cases then have to be brought

210
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.940
together in some way to serve as data or

211
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.419
a constraint on your theory of what knowledge is,

212
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.320
which is going to be something ideally much simpler

213
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.650
and, uh, and, and more unified. Uh, THERE are

214
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.349
some people who say that. Um, WE don't actually

215
00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:54.030
rely on intuitions at all. I think these are

216
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.090
usually, so the Herman Capellan is in this category.

217
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.210
I think these are usually people who have, um,

218
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.190
uh, uh, a very strange idea of what an

219
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.190
intuition would have to be. So, for example, if

220
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.789
you thought that intuitions have to be, you know,

221
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:12.049
absolutely Um, flawless touchstones of the truth, uh, then

222
00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:14.570
yeah, maybe we don't, we don't have any intuitions.

223
00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.070
I don't think that's the best read on, uh,

224
00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:20.390
on what they are. Um, I think, uh, I

225
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.940
think, uh, intuition is a real category psychologically, uh,

226
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.590
and, um, and we can have a sort of

227
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.309
philosophically defensible use of that category and sculpting theories

228
00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:34.049
of knowledge.

229
00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:38.650
And uh I mean, in what ways does the

230
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.690
philosophical approach to epistemic intuitions differ from a scientific

231
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.830
approach, like, for example, what we can get from

232
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.010
linguistics and psychology. I mean, in what ways do

233
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.690
they differ and do you think that the scientific

234
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.669
research can inform epistemology?

235
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.869
So I think, uh, scientific and philosophical research in

236
00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:07.190
this domain are ultimately somewhat continuous, but, um, but

237
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.830
there might be different ambitions of, of, of these

238
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.750
various programs. So if you're a philosopher, uh, like

239
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.200
me, Uh, maybe not all philosophers are trying to

240
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.429
do this, but, um, but you're interested in the

241
00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:20.510
ultimate question of actually what is the right thing

242
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.690
to say about knowledge? How is knowledge itself most

243
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.390
appropriately characterized? Most of the psychologists who are working

244
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:29.770
on epistemic intuitions aren't looking at that question. They

245
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.599
are taking for granted. Granted, some kind of background,

246
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.260
philosophical view about what knowledge is. And they're really

247
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.979
focused on the question of how do human beings

248
00:13:38.979 --> 00:13:42.039
detect this, or how do non-human primates or corvids

249
00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.820
in the lab detect this state in each other,

250
00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:48.940
which they can do, interestingly enough. So, um, chimpanzees,

251
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.440
for example, react differently to knowledgeable and ignorant competitors.

252
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.159
Um, AND really interesting question, how they are doing

253
00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:00.419
that, um, and what commonalities we might have with

254
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:03.080
them. But I think even just to set up

255
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.799
the experiment, um, whether it's with a chimpanzee or

256
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:09.539
developmental psychologists do a lot of work with babies.

257
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.900
Um, YOU'RE checking whether, I don't know, an 18

258
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.299
month old baby can tell the difference between somebody

259
00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:16.840
who does and doesn't know what's in the box.

260
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.940
Um, EVEN to set up the experiment, you've got

261
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.010
to have some kind of pre-theoretical grip on what

262
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.340
does the situation look like when someone knows what's

263
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.380
in the box. Um, SO you have some, you

264
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.414
know, perceptual access. THE contents or something like that.

265
00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:34.775
Well, that's actually like a bit of a philosophical

266
00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.614
theory behind that, that if somebody's direction of gaze

267
00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:39.775
is down into the box, uh, they know what

268
00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:41.755
it, they know what it contains. So, I think,

269
00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:45.775
uh, psychologists are typically taking philosophy for granted in

270
00:14:45.775 --> 00:14:49.515
running their experiments. Um, AND in another weird way,

271
00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:53.309
philosophers are kind of taking psychology for granted. Intrusting

272
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.140
their intuitions about particular cases, right? Like I'm, I'm

273
00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.469
thinking, these feelings that I have that Plato's juryman

274
00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:03.229
doesn't know, that Thermodera's distant viewer doesn't know, they're

275
00:15:03.229 --> 00:15:07.510
coming, they're not just random noise, um, they're coming

276
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.590
from something systematic, uh, within me. And uh that's

277
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.609
a way of taking, taking the psychology for granted.

278
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.390
So I think ideally you'd want to kind of

279
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.270
bring these things together and um I should say

280
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.750
in the psychological investigation of epistemic intuitions, there's a

281
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.469
lot of struggle and confusion, right? There's results that

282
00:15:29.469 --> 00:15:33.830
are hard to replicate, there are um uh theoretical

283
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.510
roadblocks that people have run into. In particular, trying

284
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.409
to figure out Whether when I react to somebody

285
00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.469
else, I'm reacting to what I think they believe

286
00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:48.799
or to what I think they know. And, um,

287
00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:51.609
and I think a lot of the troubles in

288
00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:56.489
the psychological literature are coming from a failure to

289
00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:01.849
think hard enough about the philosophical relationships between conditions

290
00:16:01.849 --> 00:16:05.070
like believing and knowing. Um, SO people are sometimes

291
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.809
making, I think, philosophical mistakes, uh, in their theorizing

292
00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:14.770
in psychology. I think they're making sometimes psychological mistakes,

293
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:20.409
uh, in their philosophical theorizing about, about knowledge. Um,

294
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.299
SO, so I, so I myself think there's a

295
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:27.090
difference of ambition. Um, BUT there's a lot of

296
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.289
commonality. You mentioned linguistics too, so linguists have a

297
00:16:31.289 --> 00:16:37.219
lot to say about um the difference between Verbs

298
00:16:37.219 --> 00:16:39.979
that attribute states of knowledge and verbs that attribute

299
00:16:39.979 --> 00:16:44.359
states of belief, there's a really big contrast, splitting

300
00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:47.809
two big classes of what are called proposition embedding

301
00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:51.599
verbs. So proposition embedding verbs are verbs like hope,

302
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:57.070
um, think. Um, EXPRESSIONS like be sure that those

303
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.320
can always link a particular subject, like me or

304
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.069
um Obama or Drake or whatever, to a particular

305
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.069
proposition, like um where the proposition is some fact.

306
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:15.618
I can specify the fact directly, um, like, uh,

307
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.368
you know, that the window is open, or um

308
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.838
uh that Drake has a house in Toronto. And

309
00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:26.798
I can also express it indirectly by using a

310
00:17:26.798 --> 00:17:29.019
sort of WH term, so I can talk about

311
00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:32.489
um whether the window is open or where Drake

312
00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:36.519
has a home. Either of these constructions can be

313
00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:41.310
um can be embedded under a proposition. Uh, A

314
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.060
propositional attitude verb like hope, believe, think, no. Here's

315
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.469
the big contrast. Anything that's in the family of

316
00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:52.010
the verb no, is called factive. A factive verb

317
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.469
can only properly take a true compliment. Um, SO

318
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.770
if you, um, know whether the window is open,

319
00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:05.310
your attitude on the question of whether the window

320
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.930
is open has to be true. Um, AND verbs

321
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.890
like believe, hope, be sure that, those are called

322
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.859
nonfactive, so they can take either true or false

323
00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:19.130
compliments. You could believe that the window is open

324
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.619
when in fact it's closed. Um, IT'S closed behind

325
00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:24.650
you, and that breeze you're feeling is coming from

326
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.130
a fan. Um, YOU could be sure that Drake

327
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.569
has a house in Toronto, but maybe he's just

328
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.920
sold it, you know, this morning, and he no

329
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.229
longer has a house in Toronto. Uh, SO, so

330
00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:40.760
be sure that is non-factive. It's the kind of

331
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.280
attitude that could stick you with either a truth

332
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.630
or a falsehood. Now, the amazing thing about knowledge,

333
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.770
and this is from linguistics, the amazing thing about

334
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.969
knowledge is, it's not just a factive verb sticking

335
00:18:52.969 --> 00:18:55.729
you only to truths, it's the mother of all

336
00:18:55.729 --> 00:18:59.290
factive verbs. It's the thing that is entailed by

337
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.109
all factive mental state constructions, I should say. So,

338
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:09.729
um, so there are other, um, factive mental state

339
00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:12.569
constructions like seeing that or being aware of that.

340
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.530
Um, RIGHT? So I could see that there are

341
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.290
some coins on my desk, I could be aware

342
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.650
that there are some coins on my desk, I

343
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.530
could close my eyes and remember that there are

344
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.849
some coins on my desk. Um, ALL of those

345
00:19:23.849 --> 00:19:26.329
entail that I know that there are some coins

346
00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:29.260
on my desk. Um, SO knowing is like the,

347
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.329
the common thread that runs through all of these

348
00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:36.329
active constructions. Um, AND that's something very special about

349
00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:38.130
it that linguists have found. And I think that's

350
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.170
actually the key to understanding the nature of knowledge

351
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.380
itself. Mhm.

352
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.770
Yes, and let's talk about knowledge then. I know

353
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.170
that this is, I know that this is, if

354
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.089
not the biggest, at least one of the biggest

355
00:19:53.089 --> 00:19:57.849
questions in epistemology, but what, what is knowledge? What

356
00:19:57.849 --> 00:19:59.750
constitutes knowledge?

357
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:06.300
So here my position is um. I informed by

358
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.270
Timothy Williamson's approach. So Timothy Williamson is an Oxford

359
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.109
philosopher who's argued for what's called the knowledge first

360
00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:19.209
approach in epistemology. Williamson characterizes knowledge as the most

361
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.949
general factive mental state. Um, THAT'S a characterization of

362
00:20:23.949 --> 00:20:26.510
what knowledge is. It's not a reduction of knowledge

363
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:31.369
into components like, well, knowledge is true belief plus

364
00:20:31.369 --> 00:20:34.430
a bunch of other conditions, um, where these other

365
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.160
conditions are maybe causal conditions or conditions that aren't

366
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.770
themselves defined in terms of knowledge. Um. And, uh,

367
00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:45.250
and I think that's actually the right approach, um,

368
00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:49.060
but maybe it takes some explaining what exactly that

369
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.979
amounts to, to say that knowledge is the most

370
00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:55.619
general factive mental state, um, but, uh, but I

371
00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:59.050
think it's actually ultimately very intuitive. So, so you

372
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.349
could think of knowledge as just being A way

373
00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:06.109
of being latched onto the truth. That's pretty generic,

374
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.150
it's pretty open. It's open, for example, that we

375
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:12.109
have multiple such ways that, for example, um, sound

376
00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:15.430
deduction in mathematics, that's a way of being latched

377
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.910
onto the truth. Um, PERCEPTUAL awareness of something in

378
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.150
your immediate vicinity, that might be a way of

379
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.430
being latched onto the truth. Testimony, whereby testimony I

380
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.380
mean, um, Instruction from someone who knows a fact,

381
00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:35.400
themselves, so it's sort of secondhand knowledge, that could

382
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.000
also be a way of being latched latched onto

383
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.709
a truth. So you can, you can get it,

384
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.599
you can get it secondhand. So there could be

385
00:21:42.599 --> 00:21:45.959
a variety of different ways of knowing, um, but

386
00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:50.619
the commonality is that you are, um, you're in

387
00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:54.680
the kind of state of mind, um, that can

388
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.439
only unite you to a truth. Um, NOW one

389
00:21:57.439 --> 00:21:59.000
of the things that makes it super tricky is

390
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.760
you can't always tell from the inside whether or

391
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.400
not you're in that state of mind, right? So

392
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.280
you might actually, um, be experiencing an illusion even

393
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.959
though you think, um, that you're in a state

394
00:22:09.959 --> 00:22:12.920
of knowledge. Um, SO it's an immediate consequence of

395
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.510
this way of thinking about knowledge that, um, Uh,

396
00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:20.630
that the question of whether you are or are

397
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.390
not in a state of knowledge is one that's

398
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.910
not always going to be transparent to you. Um,

399
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:28.550
BUT I think that, that actually fits very intuitively

400
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.829
with how we typically think of knowledge. We typically

401
00:22:30.829 --> 00:22:33.430
think of knowledge in a sense, the same way

402
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.189
we think of gold, right? Um, THERE'S a fact

403
00:22:36.189 --> 00:22:38.430
of the matter about whether something is or isn't

404
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.619
gold. Sometimes you can be mistaken about whether, um,

405
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.339
some The object that's in front of you is

406
00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:48.020
or isn't made out of gold, right? Um, THE

407
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.859
essence of gold is always the same, it's the

408
00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:53.140
element with atomic number 79, um, you can be

409
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.780
mistaken about whether it's there, you know, knowledge is,

410
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.339
is the gold of the cognitive realm, right? It's,

411
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.380
it's that condition that you've got when you're in

412
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.060
the type of mental state that latches you only

413
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.449
onto the truth, um, and, and that condition is

414
00:23:06.449 --> 00:23:09.060
something you could be mistaken about, but, but, but

415
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.260
that is the essence of it.

416
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.239
And about the risk of us being mistaken about

417
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:19.640
something, when is knowledge reliable? I mean, is there

418
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:25.760
any set of necessary and sufficient conditions to make

419
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.219
knowledge reliable?

420
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.170
Knowledge is. RELIABLE. Knowledge is definitionally reliable. So, so,

421
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.459
um, there's no such thing as false knowledge and

422
00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:37.540
mistaken knowledge. Um, IT'S inherent in the character of

423
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.010
knowledge that, um, that what is known is true.

424
00:23:40.329 --> 00:23:42.800
Now, you might be asking a related question, which

425
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.579
is, you know, well, how in general can we

426
00:23:44.579 --> 00:23:47.959
obtain knowledge? And um I think one of the

427
00:23:47.959 --> 00:23:50.959
bitter lessons of epistemology is, there's no shortcuts, there's

428
00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:53.619
no like, oh, follow this one weird trick, and,

429
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.400
uh, and your state of mind is guaranteed to

430
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.319
be one of knowledge. Um, IN particular domains, there

431
00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:01.839
are algorithms that we can follow. So, so we

432
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.359
can, we can within certain domains of mathematics, you

433
00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:07.069
know, um, follow the A star algorithm and you'll

434
00:24:07.069 --> 00:24:09.199
have the optimal path for you, you, you know,

435
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.839
but Uh, but there's no general recipe, and that's

436
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:15.380
just because how the world in general is, is,

437
00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:19.739
is hard to know, um, and we have to

438
00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:21.680
sometimes do a great deal of trial and error,

439
00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:24.020
um, within a domain before we come up with

440
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.140
a generalizable strategy or kind of way of knowing,

441
00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:32.420
um, within that domain that, uh, will, will get

442
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.500
us to the truth there.

443
00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:38.599
And uh we talked about intuitions. What happens when

444
00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:43.479
our intuitions clash with established knowledge? I mean, what

445
00:24:43.479 --> 00:24:47.400
happens uh in terms of how we approach it

446
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.520
or how we should approach it philosophically? How, how

447
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.380
can we resolve that clash?

448
00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:58.750
So when your intuition is, when your intuitions clash

449
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:03.510
with established knowledge, then your intuitions are wrong, and

450
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.310
you can absolutely have that, um, because, just because

451
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.109
knowledge is fact and knowledge always has to be,

452
00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:10.780
has to be, uh, locking on to the truth.

453
00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.689
You can have that, um, so for example, um,

454
00:25:14.949 --> 00:25:19.829
the gambler's fallacy can seem, uh, can seem very

455
00:25:19.829 --> 00:25:24.280
attractive, right? Yeah, I've, I've, I've, um, you know,

456
00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:28.310
You, you, you think that, for example, um, because,

457
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:31.479
because you've, um, lost a certain number of times

458
00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:33.479
in roulette, you're, you're, you're due to win on

459
00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:35.069
this next, on this next round, that can feel

460
00:25:35.069 --> 00:25:38.839
very attractive even though, you know, mathematically it's, uh,

461
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.670
it's, it's, it's not right at all. Um, SO

462
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.280
when your intuitions clash with established knowledge, the intuitions

463
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.810
are wrong, and, um, and you're gonna need to,

464
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.359
if, if you want to get on the right

465
00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:52.959
path of, um, epistemically. Um, TRY to figure out,

466
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.380
uh, uh, try to figure out a better way

467
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.459
of thinking. Which may or may not always be

468
00:25:58.459 --> 00:26:00.510
possible, right? There might be some intuitions that we

469
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.020
just suffer from persistently. The way that we suffer

470
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.630
from certain perceptual illusions persistently, right? Like, like, you

471
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.109
can know that um there are no spots at

472
00:26:11.109 --> 00:26:13.229
the intersections of the Herman grid illusion, but your

473
00:26:13.229 --> 00:26:15.060
eyes, your lying eyes are going to keep telling

474
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.109
you that they're there. Um, SO we have some

475
00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:20.229
cognitive illusions, but I think you might also have

476
00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:22.089
been wondering about what do we do when our

477
00:26:22.089 --> 00:26:26.670
intuitions conflict not with established knowledge, but with established

478
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.209
theory. So there might be, there might be some

479
00:26:29.869 --> 00:26:33.550
theory that is really dominant in your area, but

480
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:39.989
you keep feeling some sense that for particular cases,

481
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.880
Um, the right answer is not in line with

482
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.569
that theory, and I think, I, I think when

483
00:26:47.569 --> 00:26:50.969
you have that, um, that's, that's often gold, right?

484
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.030
That's often an indication that there's something wrong with

485
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.589
the theory. Um, AND, and like more precisely, I

486
00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:03.089
think if you've got a theory that generates contradictory

487
00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:07.829
intuitions or contradictory predictions for particular cases, that's a

488
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:10.630
sign something's really wrong with the theory, and um

489
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.109
you can take inspiration from that and try to

490
00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:15.209
build a better, try to build a better theory,

491
00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:15.849
for sure.

492
00:27:16.689 --> 00:27:20.969
Yeah. And is knowledge a mental state or is

493
00:27:20.969 --> 00:27:23.810
it something different from a mental state?

494
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.989
So I characterize knowledge as a mental state, and

495
00:27:26.989 --> 00:27:29.319
in that again, I'm following Williamson. So what is

496
00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:31.239
a mental state? I mean, it's a state of

497
00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:37.890
the subject um that guides action and, um, uh,

498
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.040
you know, governs how that subject will behave in

499
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.040
the world. There's been some resistance to characterizing knowledge

500
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.010
as a mental state because it has that objectivity

501
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.260
condition, right? That it's an essential part of knowledge

502
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.010
that Um, that it's content, the propositional content that

503
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.219
is known must be true of the world. And,

504
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.829
uh, and some people think mental states can't involve

505
00:28:04.489 --> 00:28:08.650
conditions that lie outside, for example, the brain of

506
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:13.089
the subject. Um, I think that's actually a mistaken

507
00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:15.250
view of what mental conditions are and a mistaken

508
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.250
view of what we are as agents. We as

509
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.880
agents are in an interesting way. Integrated with the

510
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.239
environments in which we find ourselves. So, for example,

511
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.680
when you form a representation of something like, I'm

512
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.959
gonna show you a pen, see this pen? Um,

513
00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:34.329
It actually matters that you have some kind of,

514
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.619
this is true for the viewers of the video

515
00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:38.180
as well, you have some kind of causal impact

516
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.339
with this particular pen, now you can have thoughts

517
00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:43.660
about this pen and so on. Um, BEFORE this

518
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.859
came into your, um, causal path, when it was

519
00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:50.729
still just on my desk, uh, and you hadn't

520
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:54.640
seen it, you couldn't have a mental state that

521
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.260
involved that particular pen. Uh, IN its content. So,

522
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.670
so, when we think about things or form representations

523
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.439
of things, we're very much reliant on our interactions

524
00:29:06.439 --> 00:29:11.160
with the world to populate, um, the representations that

525
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.479
we're forming. And, um, you might think, well, no,

526
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.829
maybe the representation is really just ultimately about Um,

527
00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:22.770
activation in my retina or it's about cortical activity.

528
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.109
But I think that way of proceeding really denies

529
00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:28.209
the ultimate fact of what you are as an

530
00:29:28.209 --> 00:29:30.829
agent. What you are as an agent isn't just

531
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.744
um contained inside your skin, it's Something that really

532
00:29:35.744 --> 00:29:38.954
happens in relation to an environment. So as a

533
00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:42.074
knowing agent, you have a whole bunch of capacities

534
00:29:42.074 --> 00:29:45.625
with to act in your environment and with respect

535
00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:48.625
to the environment. So I think it's completely legitimate

536
00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:53.780
to build um Uh, to build conditions involving the

537
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.260
external world into the characterization of what you are

538
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.900
as an agent. The more you know, the more

539
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.619
effective you are as an agent. If you take

540
00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:04.180
a non-factive mental state like belief, just being really

541
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.939
opinionated doesn't necessarily make you an effective agent in

542
00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:10.910
the world. Um, SO if mental states are supposed

543
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.109
to explain the effectiveness of our agency, no reason

544
00:30:14.109 --> 00:30:16.349
not at all, not to be thinking of them

545
00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:18.869
in terms of this stronger condition of knowledge and

546
00:30:18.869 --> 00:30:22.430
not just um the condition of belief. That said,

547
00:30:22.469 --> 00:30:24.469
like, I'm not denying that belief is a mental

548
00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:27.829
state too, and it's a fact about us that

549
00:30:27.829 --> 00:30:29.459
some of our beliefs, some of our our false

550
00:30:29.459 --> 00:30:32.030
beliefs, um, will make us act certain ways as

551
00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.709
agents, absolutely. Um, BUT the fact that belief is

552
00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:38.430
in the picture doesn't mean that we should never

553
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.050
think of this stronger condition of knowledge as being

554
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.770
one of the keys, um, to our agency.

555
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.219
Right, and what is the difference between knowing something

556
00:30:49.219 --> 00:30:52.959
and just happening to be right about it? So

557
00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:56.359
let's say that for example, I'm doing a quiz

558
00:30:56.359 --> 00:31:00.119
or playing a trivia game, and in one of

559
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:04.560
the questions, I mean, I don't actually know the

560
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.270
correct answer, but I just uh luckily pick the

561
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.869
correct one. I mean, what's the difference between that

562
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.680
and actually knowing the correct answer?

563
00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:20.209
So I think just happening to be right about

564
00:31:20.209 --> 00:31:25.010
something isn't necessarily a state of mind. Um, JUST

565
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.369
happening to be right, being right about something, um,

566
00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:31.719
has something in common with knowledge actually. So, um,

567
00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:34.599
if you're right about P, where P is just

568
00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:37.400
any old proposition like that the door is open

569
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.810
or something like that, um, then P has to

570
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.989
be true. Um, SO linguists call this a veridical

571
00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:48.319
construction. Um, AND, and so it's got that in

572
00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:50.160
common with knowledge, right? Cause if you know the

573
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.449
door is open, then the door is open, right?

574
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.640
So it's, it's, it's factive. But being right about

575
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.520
something isn't a mental state, um, and there's a

576
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.390
bunch of, there's a bunch of reasons why. Here's

577
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.859
kind of the cheapest reason, reason why, which is

578
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:06.400
mental states have the characteristic that only things with

579
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.560
minds can happen, right? So like being happy, I

580
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.339
can be happy, you can be happy, and inanimate,

581
00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:15.579
and that happiness is a mental state. An inanimate

582
00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:17.739
object like, I don't know, like a desk or

583
00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:20.560
a clock can't be happy, right? Cause it doesn't

584
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.060
have a mind. Being right, however, um, now that's

585
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.250
something, you know, the stopped clock is right twice

586
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.000
a day, uh, it doesn't have a mind. Um,

587
00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:36.020
THAT kind of, that kind of example, um, has

588
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.650
led linguists to think, what's going on with being

589
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.699
right is that it has to do more with

590
00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:46.010
communication. Um, THAN with the mental state side of

591
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.449
things. So you can think of, you know, uh,

592
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.800
a report can be right about something. The report

593
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.920
was right that the mayor was being bribed. Um,

594
00:32:54.079 --> 00:32:56.630
A person can be right about something too, uh,

595
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.949
you know, Sarah was right that the mayor was

596
00:32:58.949 --> 00:33:01.680
being bribed. For Sarah to be right that the

597
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.520
mayor is being bribed, she just have to basically

598
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.560
say that, or maybe even think that the mayor

599
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.170
is being bribed. Um, WE don't have any further

600
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.150
conditions on her, how she got to that state,

601
00:33:13.229 --> 00:33:16.459
right? So maybe she's actually a conspiracy theorist, and

602
00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:19.180
she thinks every single government official is being bribed,

603
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.979
and she goes around saying, oh, the mayor is

604
00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:23.810
being bribed, um, and she's never done any homework,

605
00:33:23.989 --> 00:33:26.750
right? And um she actually doesn't know that the

606
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.510
mayor is being bribed, she just says that about

607
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.000
everybody. That's really different from the investigative journalist who

608
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
has really pursued the paper trail, and she's been

609
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.380
doing the tape recordings and talking to everybody, and

610
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.560
I, you know, she found out about the Swiss

611
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.839
bank account. That journalist might know that the mayor

612
00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:45.459
is being bribed because the way that she arrived

613
00:33:45.459 --> 00:33:49.939
at her judgment. Um, WAS the kind of way

614
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.400
that can only generate true states of mind. So

615
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.280
it's the right kind of way of thinking about

616
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.239
it. Um, SO that would be the kind of

617
00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:58.869
contrast I'm looking at when I'm looking at the

618
00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:03.239
difference between being right, uh, and knowing. Also, there's

619
00:34:03.239 --> 00:34:06.160
a relationship between being right and knowing. Um, IF

620
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.978
you know, Then you gotta be right about it,

621
00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:10.879
but it doesn't go the other way. You can

622
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:14.110
be right about something without knowing. So knowing is

623
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.320
that stronger state, um, sort of the ideal state

624
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.250
in epistemology. Mhm.

625
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.879
So another kind of question, what is the epistemic

626
00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:26.320
value of reflection? I mean, what kind of epistemic

627
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.120
value can we get from it?

628
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.469
This is a really interesting question, I think, especially

629
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.139
lately with large language models. I've done a little

630
00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.520
bit of uh writing in connection with that. Um,

631
00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.550
REFLECTION is usually the contrast category with intuition. So

632
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.469
intuition you can think of as, um, a spontaneous

633
00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.120
judgment that's not arrived at through explicit consideration of

634
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.445
steps. Um, WHEN you just judge that. Now, that

635
00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:54.844
guy in the jury didn't know that the man

636
00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:57.745
was innocent. It's not like you're working from some

637
00:34:58.324 --> 00:35:01.114
theoretical understanding of knowledge and doing a bunch of

638
00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:03.705
calculations, you just have that kind of gut sense.

639
00:35:04.004 --> 00:35:07.584
Um, REFLECTIVE cognition, on the other hand, does go

640
00:35:07.584 --> 00:35:11.070
through. Uh, A series of steps that are accessible

641
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.209
to you, um, introspectively if you want. So, so

642
00:35:15.209 --> 00:35:17.770
you can think of, um, the contrast in terms

643
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.149
of maybe something you could draw from arithmetic. So,

644
00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:24.949
um, so if I ask you to multiply 9

645
00:35:24.949 --> 00:35:28.189
by 11, um, the answer pops into mind immediately,

646
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.530
um, but if I ask you to divide 9

647
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.330
by 11, maybe you have to do a bunch

648
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.370
more steps, um, and, uh, and like the process

649
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.419
of long division. Um, YOU'RE doing a series of

650
00:35:39.419 --> 00:35:41.500
steps, each one of which, each digit by digit

651
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.850
calculation might be intuitive, but that whole process of

652
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.419
stringing them together, which you're running in something like

653
00:35:46.419 --> 00:35:51.179
working memory, um, uh, it, that whole process is

654
00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:56.739
called, is called reflective. Um, AND, and so reflection

655
00:35:56.739 --> 00:35:59.899
is also a great way to achieve knowledge in

656
00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:02.300
a bunch of different domains. When you do explicit

657
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.310
mathematical reasoning, you're engaging in reflection. Um, THERE'S some

658
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.020
really interesting questions about cases in which you could

659
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.439
get the answer either through intuition or through reflection.

660
00:36:12.899 --> 00:36:15.979
Um, AND, uh, I mean, even that very simple

661
00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:19.100
case, multiplying 9 by 11, um, you probably just

662
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.780
got the answer in a snap, but if you

663
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.379
didn't, or even if you did, you could go

664
00:36:23.379 --> 00:36:25.739
through, you know, a slow step by step procedure

665
00:36:25.739 --> 00:36:30.060
to, um, to generate that same answer. And, um,

666
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.780
a lot of philosophers have thought that reflection is

667
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.989
always better. Um, I think that's actually wrong, cause

668
00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:39.570
if reflection is just characterized as that step by

669
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.790
step process, there are actually a bunch of cases

670
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:46.959
in which, um, reflection can lead you astray, right?

671
00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:51.169
Thinking through things explicitly and carefully doesn't always outperform,

672
00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:54.790
uh, going with your gut. So, so I think

673
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.590
that's, uh, I think that's something we have to

674
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.429
note, um, but that said, in a lot of

675
00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:05.510
complex areas, if you add some reflective cognition. To

676
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.300
your thinking, uh, you will tend to do better.

677
00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:12.120
Um, SO we see this with large language models,

678
00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:14.899
when you prompt them to think step by step,

679
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.679
um, or if you're working with one of the

680
00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:19.820
new reasoning models like our one from Deep Seek,

681
00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:23.580
um, you will see a whole chain of thought

682
00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:27.689
before the production of an answer. Um. Answers that

683
00:37:27.689 --> 00:37:30.370
you arrive at that way are often better, and

684
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.870
uh really interesting question, question why that is and

685
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.510
how similar their ways of thinking are to ours.

686
00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:39.689
Um, ONE idea we might have here is that

687
00:37:39.689 --> 00:37:43.429
maybe the individual little steps that you take, um,

688
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:48.729
are, uh, connecting, um, features either within the neural

689
00:37:48.729 --> 00:37:50.610
network or features within the scope of your own

690
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.530
knowledge that are relatively close to each other, so

691
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.290
it's easier to see the connections step by step.

692
00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:02.510
Uh, AND making them explicit, um, really brings to

693
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.310
bear, uh, a great deal of the power of

694
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.310
your mind. Um, BUT it's, or, or, of, of,

695
00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:09.189
of the neural network to sort out a good

696
00:38:09.189 --> 00:38:11.949
path to the answer. But, but things are, things

697
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:13.870
are complicated, I think both for us and for

698
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.270
the neural networks, there's questions of the sort of

699
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.679
fidelity of these chain of thought. Reasoning reports to

700
00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:21.919
the actual processing that's going on, both for them

701
00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:23.639
and for us. So, I think that's actually a

702
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:27.320
really, uh, really interesting open area. I don't think

703
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.239
that knowledge has to be reflective in order to

704
00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:31.679
count as knowledge. So some people do, some people

705
00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:33.439
think you have to sort of give some kind

706
00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:36.760
of proof of what you know. Uh, IN order

707
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.560
to really count as knowing it. I think that

708
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.639
can't possibly be right, not least because it's going

709
00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:43.320
to lead right away to some kind of horrible

710
00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.199
regress, right? So, so I have to give some

711
00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:48.280
kind of little proof in order to count as

712
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.840
knowing. But then, what's the status of those individual

713
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.550
claims that I made in the course of my

714
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.909
individual proof? Do I have to give a proof

715
00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:58.120
for each of those? Um, THIS, this ends up

716
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.439
leading to, I think, something pretty self-destructive. So that's

717
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.939
not a direction I'd want to go in.

718
00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:07.179
Mhm. And what is common knowledge? I mean, what

719
00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:11.610
is it and um why is it important for

720
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.739
us to study it as an epistemic phenomenon and

721
00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:18.270
does it connect in any way to other kinds

722
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.419
of epistemic phenomena?

723
00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:25.020
Common knowledge is such an exciting area. So, um,

724
00:39:26.429 --> 00:39:28.270
So when we look at common knowledge, we're moving

725
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.550
beyond the individual, um, and I think we have

726
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.629
intuitively, um, some kind of strong sense of what

727
00:39:35.629 --> 00:39:38.169
it is for something to be commonly known, and

728
00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:41.350
I think it's actually something that's guiding our conversational

729
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:46.159
interactions, for example. So, um, discussions of common knowledge

730
00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:48.989
often start with a kind of intuitive contrast between

731
00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:52.229
two different situations, um, both of which involve, let's

732
00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:55.040
say just two people, let's keep this simple. Um,

733
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.959
SO we've got two people, Alice and Bob. And

734
00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:02.520
in situation A, there's some secret, call it P.

735
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.000
And Alice knows the secret, and Bob knows the

736
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
secret. Um, BUT neither one of them knows that

737
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.310
the other one knows, right? Um, THIS is a

738
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.739
situation in which it's true that Alice and Bob

739
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.560
both know the P, um, but it's not like

740
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.689
out in the open between them, right? Um, THEY

741
00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:22.810
do not have common knowledge in this case. They

742
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.520
have just what's called individual knowledge. For them to

743
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.560
have common knowledge, they've got to have something more.

744
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.729
So in a, in a situation where Alice and

745
00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:32.449
Bob have sat down face to face and they've

746
00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:36.320
talked to each other about the secret, um, it's,

747
00:40:36.399 --> 00:40:39.169
it's considered to be common knowledge now between Alice

748
00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:42.530
and Bob. And having, they're having common knowledge enables

749
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.090
them to do a bunch of things that they

750
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.800
couldn't have done before. Um, SO for example, maybe

751
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.429
P is the fact that their friend Charlie is

752
00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:53.050
having a surprise party on Friday or something like

753
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.320
that. Um, WHEN each of them just knew this

754
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.080
fact individually, but didn't know that the other one

755
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.139
knew. Um, THEY can't, Alice and Bob can't, for

756
00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:06.879
example, coordinate their actions and book a taxi together,

757
00:41:07.219 --> 00:41:09.020
um, to get to the party. But if it's

758
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.659
out in the open between them, they can, they

759
00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:15.780
can rationally coordinate. And, um, and so what is

760
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.760
and isn't common knowledge among a group of people

761
00:41:18.939 --> 00:41:21.899
has big impacts on what they can do collectively,

762
00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:24.379
what they can do together. Uh, AND so for

763
00:41:24.379 --> 00:41:27.979
this reason, it's a very important concept in economics,

764
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.219
in political science. The thing that's amazing philosophically is

765
00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:37.540
it's actually really hard, um, to characterize what changes

766
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.379
or what's different, um, between that situation of individual

767
00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:43.600
private knowledge and the situation where something's out in

768
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.600
the open between them. Um, AND a lot of

769
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.979
the first steps that you think would work here

770
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.959
don't work, right? So you might think, oh, what's

771
00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:55.639
different is when something's out in the open between

772
00:41:55.639 --> 00:42:00.040
people, then Alice knows that Bob knows and Bob

773
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.979
knows that Alice knows. That state, and there's, it's

774
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:07.389
still just as individuals, that state is not common

775
00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:12.020
knowledge. That state's called mutual knowledge level 2. So

776
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.939
if Alice knows that Bob, you can just do

777
00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:16.139
the counting. Alice knows that Bob knows, you get

778
00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:19.419
to 2, and Bob knows that Alice knows, 2

779
00:42:19.419 --> 00:42:22.760
on each side. Um, THAT state still doesn't allow

780
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.479
them to rationally coordinate. So you can just imagine,

781
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.000
what if they don't interact on the point with

782
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.959
a face to face conversation, but what if Alice

783
00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:34.959
finds out in some backhand manner that Bob knows

784
00:42:34.959 --> 00:42:38.080
about the secret. Maybe she, you know, finds his

785
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.959
phone and, and Bob knows that Alice knows because,

786
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.439
uh, you know, he installed some kind of video

787
00:42:44.439 --> 00:42:48.429
camera and sees her learning about it. Um. At

788
00:42:48.429 --> 00:42:50.469
this point, like there's kind of no reason for

789
00:42:50.469 --> 00:42:52.120
them not to coordinate, but you can make the

790
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.830
secret something kind of dangerous or toxic, uh, in

791
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.659
which case, uh, in which case coordination could be

792
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:00.750
difficult. So, for example, imagine that they're both in

793
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:05.189
a motorcycle gang together, and P is the fact

794
00:43:05.189 --> 00:43:08.179
that, um, you know, some new member of the

795
00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:10.989
gang, uh, we'll call him Charlie again, uh, is

796
00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:15.229
actually a police informant. Uh, RIGHT? And maybe Alice

797
00:43:15.229 --> 00:43:18.620
and Bob are struggling with the decision. Should I

798
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.949
leave this gang, or, uh, or, or not. They

799
00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:26.189
might have a question about whether to immediately report

800
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:28.669
Charlie to the gang boss, or maybe they want

801
00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:32.830
to go seek Charlie's protection. Um, WHEN each of

802
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:36.879
them finds out individually that Charlie is police, uh,

803
00:43:36.949 --> 00:43:39.510
neither of them knows that the other knows. Uh,

804
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.679
IT'S kind of dangerous for either of them to

805
00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:44.679
act on that, uh, potentially dangerous for either of

806
00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:47.040
them to act on that information. If, for example,

807
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.040
you imagine a situation where they can only get

808
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.199
police protection if at least two gang members, um,

809
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.310
go to the police, uh, you know, but each

810
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.185
of them discovering. That the other has already found

811
00:43:57.185 --> 00:43:59.425
out the secret, still can leave them in that

812
00:43:59.425 --> 00:44:02.735
kind of ambiguous position. And the crazy thing is,

813
00:44:03.064 --> 00:44:05.745
level 3 mutual knowledge, level 4 mutual knowledge, level

814
00:44:05.745 --> 00:44:08.504
5 mutual knowledge, all of these are demonstrably not

815
00:44:08.504 --> 00:44:11.304
equivalent to that common knowledge state of having something

816
00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:13.665
out in the open between people. Um, SO a

817
00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:15.304
lot of my work lately has been just trying

818
00:44:15.304 --> 00:44:18.064
to figure out, oh, how is that common knowledge

819
00:44:18.064 --> 00:44:20.985
state built, if it's not just built out of

820
00:44:20.985 --> 00:44:26.560
iterations or repetitions of individual knowledge. So I can,

821
00:44:26.649 --> 00:44:27.979
I can tell, I can tell you something about

822
00:44:27.979 --> 00:44:29.800
how that state is built actually if you're curious.

823
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.379
00

824
00:44:30.379 --> 00:44:31.419
yes, please go ahead.

825
00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:37.120
Yes, OK, so, um. So, this conversation we're having

826
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.399
right now is a little unusual, because it's not

827
00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:42.320
like the conversation you have with a friend, right?

828
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.639
Because I'm just going on and on and uh

829
00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:46.360
you're not saying very much. This kind of conversation

830
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.679
called storytelling, right? I as a speaker, I'm taking

831
00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:51.000
an extended turn. Usually when you're chatting with a

832
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.750
friend, it's a lot more back and forth. And,

833
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.199
and actually you get a bigger sense of common

834
00:44:55.199 --> 00:44:57.780
ground, common knowledge, uh, just chatting with a friend,

835
00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:00.840
um, than you do in an interview. Partly because

836
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.719
your job as an interviewer isn't to build common

837
00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:06.290
ground with me. Your job as a, as an

838
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.330
interviewer is to ask me questions to prompt me

839
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.760
to tell my story, right? But if the two

840
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.489
of us were actually sitting down together and trying

841
00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:14.610
to figure something out, like, just a second, do

842
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.250
you think the mayor is taking bribes? We'd be

843
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.489
feeling a lot more common ground formation. But I

844
00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:21.290
think maybe we're feeling a bit like you're giving

845
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.510
me a little bit of uh there. So, uh,

846
00:45:23.689 --> 00:45:25.689
so, so I think, you know, you're following what

847
00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:30.629
I'm saying. Um, I think it's actually really crucial

848
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:34.610
to face to face conversation that it's two-way. And

849
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.800
it's two-way, not just in that, in a conversation,

850
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.750
people have to take turns, right? We know that.

851
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:46.449
Um, IT'S two-way in a deeper way, um, which

852
00:45:46.449 --> 00:45:49.629
is that at any given moment in the conversation,

853
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.889
You've got two roles. You've got the speaker and

854
00:45:52.889 --> 00:45:55.409
the addressee. I'm right now the speaker, you're the

855
00:45:55.409 --> 00:45:58.620
addressee. As a speaker, I get to use the

856
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.419
whole vocabulary of the language. As addressee, you're very

857
00:46:02.419 --> 00:46:06.850
restricted. You can just basically, mhm or huh? What?

858
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.000
No? Yeah. You're basically restricted to this on what

859
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.179
I'm saying, right? The two of us together are

860
00:46:15.179 --> 00:46:17.600
a kind of dyad, we're a kind of system.

861
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.100
I'm the generator, you're the evaluator. We as a

862
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.979
dyad, haven't bought into anything, we haven't commonly made

863
00:46:24.979 --> 00:46:28.699
a judgment, unless I propose it and you accept

864
00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:32.340
it. If you're sitting there, mm, we haven't got

865
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.659
that ground as a dyad, right? But if you,

866
00:46:34.739 --> 00:46:37.120
if you buy in, um, then we have. So,

867
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.439
so, so there's this condition involving both of us

868
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.899
in dyadic judgment. Of course, not everything we judge

869
00:46:45.899 --> 00:46:48.100
as a dyad is something that we come to

870
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.860
know, right? I might say something that's kind of

871
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.169
nonsense and you're like, yeah, right. Um, AND, and

872
00:46:54.169 --> 00:46:56.659
then we've judged something together, but we've judged it

873
00:46:56.659 --> 00:46:59.780
falsely. So there's a big question like, how do

874
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:05.139
you explain specifically the emergence of not just dyadic

875
00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:09.540
judgment, but dyadic knowledge. Um, AND I think there

876
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.060
it turns out there's like a really interesting sort

877
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.699
of evolutionary process in the way in which we

878
00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:20.830
supply back channel signals. Um, SO one of the

879
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.629
things we're doing when we supply back channel signals

880
00:47:23.629 --> 00:47:25.669
is we're indicating what we do and don't know.

881
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.110
So I have a question for you. Can I

882
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:27.909
ask you a question?

883
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.159
Yes, of course.

884
00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.449
OK, so what does it mean when you say,

885
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:36.600
oh, In response to something that someone said, what

886
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.780
do you think that means?

887
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.209
What does

888
00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:42.419
that mean? What does it mean? Yeah, if you

889
00:47:42.419 --> 00:47:45.139
say, oh, when someone says, says something to you,

890
00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:47.300
what does that mean? Or what does that signal

891
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.899
do, would you say?

892
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.679
Uh, I mean, at least you're acknowledging that you

893
00:47:56.729 --> 00:47:58.419
received the information, right, because,

894
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:03.219
oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's,

895
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.979
it's, it's an acknowledgement, it's a receipt signal. It

896
00:48:05.979 --> 00:48:07.899
actually means something a little bit more than that

897
00:48:07.899 --> 00:48:11.899
though, which is kind of cool. So, um, there's

898
00:48:11.899 --> 00:48:14.979
some situations in which when you, when someone tells

899
00:48:14.979 --> 00:48:20.389
you something, you don't produce an, oh. Um, SO

900
00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:25.709
for example, um, if you are a teacher, and

901
00:48:25.709 --> 00:48:28.949
you ask your students a pretty easy question, one

902
00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:31.350
of them gives you the answer, you would not

903
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:35.270
usually say, oh, You would say, yes, that's right,

904
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.010
um, right? So on the basis of that sort

905
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.889
of thing, people have formed a theory, this is

906
00:48:40.889 --> 00:48:43.250
going back to John Heritage's work in the 1980s,

907
00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:46.229
people have formed the theory that, oh, is an

908
00:48:46.229 --> 00:48:50.590
epistemic change of state marker. So what you're signaling

909
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.510
when you say, oh, is, I did not know

910
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.750
that, and now I do, right? That's what you're

911
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.459
signaling. You can send a deceptive signal, right? Like,

912
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:00.590
so if somebody's telling you like some old gossip

913
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.989
that you already knew, you can fake it and

914
00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:06.030
go, oh wow, you're pretending that you're gaining knowledge,

915
00:49:06.149 --> 00:49:09.030
you're not really. Um, BUT that's sort of, that's

916
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.129
a fake signal and that's parasitic on the ordinary

917
00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:15.889
evolved meaning of, oh. And if you think about,

918
00:49:15.929 --> 00:49:18.290
like, in some cases, like, suppose I tell you,

919
00:49:18.449 --> 00:49:21.370
Charlie's having a party on Friday night, you could

920
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.409
respond, Oh, are you going? That would kind of

921
00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:26.889
indicate you didn't know about the party before. Or

922
00:49:26.889 --> 00:49:28.689
say, Charlie's having a party on Friday night, you

923
00:49:28.689 --> 00:49:32.209
go, Yeah, are you going? That second time with

924
00:49:32.209 --> 00:49:34.969
the, yeah, you're indicating maybe you already knew, or

925
00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:36.810
it's not surprising to you. So we're kind of

926
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:40.370
indicating surprise. Now that fact that we're doing it,

927
00:49:40.399 --> 00:49:42.530
and we're doing it without thinking that we're doing

928
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.290
it, right? So if you look at um sort

929
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.600
of older histories of English or of other languages,

930
00:49:48.649 --> 00:49:50.810
and you see what people say about these interjections,

931
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.919
like, oh, they don't get it, they don't get

932
00:49:52.919 --> 00:49:55.330
what the function is. So Wittgenstein thinks it's, oh,

933
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.699
it's just like a sigh. It's not really doing

934
00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:01.489
anything or saying anything. Um, uh, Heritage points out

935
00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:04.239
Charles Carpenter Fries, who wrote The Structure of English,

936
00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:09.929
he says both O is non-communicative. And he also

937
00:50:09.929 --> 00:50:13.429
says it's a signal of continued attention. I think

938
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:16.929
there's a contradiction there. Something can't be both non-communicative

939
00:50:16.929 --> 00:50:19.570
and a signal, but, um, but also it's not

940
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.090
strong enough. Like I do think it's a marker

941
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.760
of knowledge gain. The fact that in conversations with

942
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.760
each other, we're actually constantly sending out these little

943
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.949
markers of knowledge gain, for example, um, that's something

944
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:36.729
that really helps us map out what other people

945
00:50:36.729 --> 00:50:40.919
do and don't know. And um as we get

946
00:50:40.919 --> 00:50:43.040
better and better maps of what other people do

947
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.959
and don't know, we gradually get better and better

948
00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:49.959
at forming common knowledge um with them. Um, SO,

949
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.040
so these signals can go astray and they can

950
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.040
be misused, but sort of in the course of

951
00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.439
time, we get sculpted towards being better and better

952
00:50:57.439 --> 00:51:00.879
at, uh, at forming common ground. Maybe we're actually

953
00:51:00.879 --> 00:51:03.120
better at this in face to face conversation than

954
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.780
we are on Zoom or the internet, for sure.

955
00:51:06.169 --> 00:51:08.739
Um, BUT that's, that's the sort of rough sketch

956
00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:10.820
of, uh, the kind of process that we go

957
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.399
through. And, and so the way I look at

958
00:51:13.399 --> 00:51:16.100
it, common knowledge is something that happens when two

959
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.610
minds are actually really working together on a problem

960
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.330
as a system. It's not something that's just happening

961
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:24.060
when you've got two individuals who are forming impressions

962
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.219
of each other and that higher order impressions of

963
00:51:26.219 --> 00:51:28.419
what this other person. He knows that I know

964
00:51:28.419 --> 00:51:30.010
that he knows that I know, right? I don't

965
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:31.949
think that's how it's working. I think it's working,

966
00:51:32.129 --> 00:51:37.169
um, really dyadically. It's, it's common knowledge is a

967
00:51:37.169 --> 00:51:38.969
situation in which knowledge gain has become a team

968
00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:42.209
sport, um, uh, that's, that's the way I look

969
00:51:42.209 --> 00:51:42.610
at it.

970
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.449
Yeah, so I have just a couple more questions

971
00:51:46.449 --> 00:51:49.379
on the same topic. So I know that you've

972
00:51:49.379 --> 00:51:54.580
written about um experimental philosophy. So how do you

973
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:59.389
look at the relationship between experimental philosophy and traditional,

974
00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:03.175
or perhaps we could call it also. So armchair

975
00:52:03.175 --> 00:52:06.534
philosophy. I mean, is it hostile or

976
00:52:06.534 --> 00:52:10.135
not? Sometimes, sometimes. Uh, INITIALLY, I think it was

977
00:52:10.135 --> 00:52:12.495
quite hostile. So first just say something about what

978
00:52:12.495 --> 00:52:15.935
experimental philosophy is. Um, SINCE the time of, at

979
00:52:15.935 --> 00:52:18.054
least the time of Plato, philosophers have been sort

980
00:52:18.054 --> 00:52:20.745
of consulting their gut to see, yeah, is it,

981
00:52:20.885 --> 00:52:24.495
is it, is it just or unjust to, you

982
00:52:24.495 --> 00:52:27.600
know, Um, return a weapon that you borrowed to

983
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.419
a friend who's now out of his mind. God,

984
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.379
that's, that's not a good thing to do. Uh,

985
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.679
SO philosophers have been consulting like intuitions about particular

986
00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:37.399
cases for a really long time, uh, maybe from

987
00:52:37.399 --> 00:52:40.280
the armchair, from the gut. What the experimental philosophy

988
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.879
movement started doing was formal data collection on those

989
00:52:43.879 --> 00:52:47.679
kinds of cases. Uh, AND, and so that instead

990
00:52:47.679 --> 00:52:50.270
of just letting a philosopher make a judgment about

991
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.245
a case, um, They took it to the street

992
00:52:53.245 --> 00:52:56.725
and had, you know, usually a large batch of

993
00:52:56.945 --> 00:53:00.264
undergraduates or crowd workers on the internet make judgments

994
00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:02.745
about a case, and those judgments are sometimes, but

995
00:53:02.745 --> 00:53:04.824
not always in line with things that the philosophers

996
00:53:04.824 --> 00:53:08.985
say. I think a lot of experimentalists were worried

997
00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:11.294
about the fact that if I've got my big

998
00:53:11.294 --> 00:53:13.104
theory of knowledge, I'm going to think about a

999
00:53:13.104 --> 00:53:15.665
particular case and say, oh yeah, this person doesn't

1000
00:53:15.665 --> 00:53:17.864
know that fact. I'll be really kind of swayed

1001
00:53:17.864 --> 00:53:20.669
or pushed by what my own theory. Um, WOULD

1002
00:53:20.669 --> 00:53:24.070
predict for that case, and it's much fairer practice,

1003
00:53:24.149 --> 00:53:26.750
it's better practice to go, uh, look at what

1004
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:30.129
a bunch of randomly selected individuals will say. Um,

1005
00:53:30.469 --> 00:53:33.409
AND there were some kind of surprising findings early

1006
00:53:33.409 --> 00:53:36.580
in this process, so a very famous paper around

1007
00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.709
the turn of the century by Weinberg, Nichols, and

1008
00:53:38.709 --> 00:53:45.090
Stitch seemed to suggest that, um, Ordinary people's intuitions

1009
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.530
about cases like that one I described with Dharmatara

1010
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:50.129
and the cloud of insects, those are now known

1011
00:53:50.129 --> 00:53:53.929
as Gettier cases in Western philosophy after a 1963

1012
00:53:53.929 --> 00:53:57.050
paper by Edmund Gettier. Um, AND so, so this

1013
00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:00.050
paper seemed to suggest that ordinary people's intuitions on

1014
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:03.729
Gettier cases are not the same as philosophers. That

1015
00:54:03.729 --> 00:54:06.610
result ended up not replicating and in fact, um,

1016
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.330
much bigger studies with bigger populations and so on

1017
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:13.590
showed that. Um, THAT, that, uh, intuition is pretty,

1018
00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:17.330
uh, it's pretty strong, it's pretty cross-culturally robust. Um,

1019
00:54:17.689 --> 00:54:22.159
SO, I think, um, Uh, you know, my feeling

1020
00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:24.729
is always like all roads lead to the sea,

1021
00:54:25.169 --> 00:54:26.840
ultimate, oh sorry, all rivers lead to the sea.

1022
00:54:26.959 --> 00:54:28.679
Not all roads do, that's just a false claim.

1023
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.840
All rivers lead to the sea ultimately. Uh, AND

1024
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.679
so, you know, if we've got various paths to

1025
00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:36.239
try and figure out the nature of knowledge, the

1026
00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:38.760
nature of intuitions, and so on, let's, let's, let's

1027
00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:41.320
take them all and see, see, see where they,

1028
00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:44.360
where they lead us. Um, I think that philosophy

1029
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.350
ultimately has nothing to fear from. Uh, EXPERIMENTAL methods,

1030
00:54:48.409 --> 00:54:50.449
um, but I think, you know, the other thing

1031
00:54:50.449 --> 00:54:54.510
is experimental methods aren't always, uh, aren't always necessary.

1032
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:57.709
Uh, uh, I think a lot of times your,

1033
00:54:57.879 --> 00:54:59.659
uh, seat of the pants intuition can be pretty

1034
00:54:59.659 --> 00:55:02.080
good. That's something that's sort of held up pretty

1035
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.209
well in linguistics, so there's sort of a similar

1036
00:55:04.209 --> 00:55:06.159
worry in linguistics that a lot of linguists were

1037
00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:07.989
looking at minimal pairs of sentences and kind of

1038
00:55:08.449 --> 00:55:10.290
Judging in a gut way which one was and

1039
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:13.770
wasn't uh acceptable, and there's a worry about whether

1040
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.469
people on the street would feel the same way.

1041
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.169
I think that worry has been largely put to

1042
00:55:18.169 --> 00:55:22.250
bed at this point and, uh, um, and there

1043
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.649
are still definitely cases where it's, it's eye-opening to

1044
00:55:25.649 --> 00:55:27.879
go out and see what ordinary people think, but,

1045
00:55:27.899 --> 00:55:30.780
um, but I don't think that that is always,

1046
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:33.449
uh, always necessary. So I don't think experimental philosophy

1047
00:55:33.449 --> 00:55:38.250
has to be. Um, HOSTILE to traditional philosophy. I've

1048
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:41.149
done both, so I've done experiments with, uh, colleagues

1049
00:55:41.149 --> 00:55:43.969
in psychology, uh, and I certainly do a lot

1050
00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:45.270
of traditional work too.

1051
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.689
And uh and this will be my last question.

1052
00:55:48.909 --> 00:55:53.810
How do you think experimental philosophy could be reconciled

1053
00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.949
with traditional philosophy? Do you think it would be

1054
00:55:56.949 --> 00:56:01.510
possible for us to have uh an armchair friendly

1055
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:05.949
experimental philosophy, and if so, what would it be

1056
00:56:05.949 --> 00:56:06.389
like?

1057
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.719
Sure. I mean, I think that's the kind of

1058
00:56:09.719 --> 00:56:11.739
approach that I've been pursuing in my own work.

1059
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.030
And I think one big thing we can do

1060
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:19.040
is not just look at people's intuitions about particular

1061
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.560
cases, but we can look at scientific work much

1062
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.419
more broadly as epistemology. So I think it can

1063
00:56:25.419 --> 00:56:28.600
be very instructive to look at work in comparative

1064
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.340
and developmental psychology. If you're trying to figure out

1065
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.820
like, how do human beings ever get to a

1066
00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.010
place where we can detect states of knowledge in

1067
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.300
each other, um, a great way to do that

1068
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.419
is to look at the sort of strange steps

1069
00:56:44.419 --> 00:56:48.290
that children go through, um, as they're, as they're

1070
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.820
developing. We're not born being able to detect these

1071
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:56.020
states, and um Along the way, there's some very

1072
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.419
interesting milestones in our development. So I think we

1073
00:56:58.419 --> 00:57:02.320
can, we can maybe learn something about knowledge detection

1074
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.159
and maybe indirectly about the nature of knowledge itself,

1075
00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:10.139
um, by, uh, by proceeding in that way, by

1076
00:57:10.139 --> 00:57:12.979
looking at the findings of sort of multiple sciences

1077
00:57:12.979 --> 00:57:15.020
that might be relevant to what we're doing. I

1078
00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.939
think we can now also gain a lot from

1079
00:57:16.939 --> 00:57:20.739
looking at work in artificial intelligence research. Um, SO

1080
00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:24.219
there's a lot of relevant work in Um, common

1081
00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:26.979
knowledge, there's relevant work on the nature of curiosity

1082
00:57:26.979 --> 00:57:30.860
and surprise, uh, in artificial intelligence research as well.

1083
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:34.899
So, so that, that observation we just had that

1084
00:57:34.899 --> 00:57:37.209
when someone tells you something you didn't already know,

1085
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.739
you, you, you might react with an oh, might

1086
00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:42.580
send that kind of signal. There's this really interesting

1087
00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.300
thing that, that is something that seems to be

1088
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.219
desirable in conversation. It seems to be something that

1089
00:57:48.219 --> 00:57:53.139
we're struggling towards, right? Conversations get very boring. If

1090
00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:56.300
people are always just telling you things that you

1091
00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:58.979
already knew, right? Conversations are fun if there's some

1092
00:57:58.979 --> 00:58:02.459
surprising twists and turns. And so there's a question

1093
00:58:02.459 --> 00:58:05.580
like, why do we push towards those moments of

1094
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:11.260
unexpected discovery? Um, FOR me, figuring this out was

1095
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.300
really a matter of looking at what's going on

1096
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:19.419
in artificial intelligence research with simulated reinforcement learning agents.

1097
00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:23.330
Uh, YOU can make them curious, you can make

1098
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:26.899
them behave in ways that look like the curiosity

1099
00:58:26.899 --> 00:58:31.030
of humans or animals, by giving them reward for

1100
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.959
that state of, Oh, I did not see that

1101
00:58:33.959 --> 00:58:38.570
coming, right? And I think, uh, so, so basically

1102
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.530
what you're doing is you get them to always

1103
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.370
try to predict what's coming next, and they gain

1104
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:50.030
reward from prediction error. Which is really interesting. It's

1105
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:52.070
sort of, it's a little bit counterintuitive because you

1106
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.429
might think, ah, we're, what we really want is

1107
00:58:54.429 --> 00:58:56.629
for everything to be really predictable. No, if you're

1108
00:58:56.629 --> 00:58:59.590
a curious agent, you want that moment of, oh,

1109
00:58:59.709 --> 00:59:02.219
wow, didn't see that coming. So you could think

1110
00:59:02.219 --> 00:59:06.969
of, oh, as a marker for an educational situation.

1111
00:59:07.429 --> 00:59:09.459
It's part of being curious that you have an

1112
00:59:09.459 --> 00:59:14.469
appetite for that marker. And of course, the more

1113
00:59:14.469 --> 00:59:17.669
curious you are, the more you find out and

1114
00:59:17.669 --> 00:59:20.389
the harder you are to surprise. So somebody who

1115
00:59:20.389 --> 00:59:22.389
knows a great deal, it's actually kind of hard

1116
00:59:22.389 --> 00:59:24.669
to get, oh wow, out of, out of them,

1117
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:27.989
they've heard it before. Um, BUT curiosity makes you

1118
00:59:27.989 --> 00:59:33.669
constantly antagonize your world model to look for spots

1119
00:59:33.669 --> 00:59:35.550
where you're not sure how this is gonna turn

1120
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:37.860
out. I think this works in conversation too, like

1121
00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.110
we ask each other questions where you're not sure

1122
00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.629
in advance what the answer is gonna be. Uh,

1123
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:46.429
THOSE are the more interesting kinds of questions. Even

1124
00:59:46.429 --> 00:59:49.389
better is if you have some kind of expectation.

1125
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:53.790
Um, BUT you have enough to generate that feeling

1126
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.189
of surprise if someone gives the answer. It's not

1127
00:59:56.189 --> 00:59:57.750
interesting to ask somebody a question where you have

1128
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:59.820
just zero expectation of the answer. Like, I'm not

1129
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.389
going to ask you for the telephone number of

1130
01:00:02.389 --> 01:00:05.149
the largest department store in Russia or something like

1131
01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:06.629
that, cause I don't have feelings about that at

1132
01:00:06.629 --> 01:00:09.189
all. I don't really care about it. Um, IF

1133
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.709
I ask you a question where I think, I'm

1134
01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.790
kind of 50/50 on this, uh, that's a little

1135
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:18.370
bit more interesting, and that's the maximum expected surprise.

1136
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.310
Uh, SO I think there end up being connections

1137
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:26.229
between what sciences are finding in some disciplines and

1138
01:00:26.229 --> 01:00:30.270
what we as philosophers want to say. Uh, SO,

1139
01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:32.750
so the way I see curiosity, for example, is

1140
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.629
very much the way Aristotle saw it, that it's

1141
01:00:35.629 --> 01:00:39.469
an intrinsic desire for knowledge, and I think you

1142
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:44.270
can use findings from the sciences, um, to explain.

1143
01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:47.320
How that's so and how it works, even in

1144
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.560
the context of just ordinary conversations between people. I

1145
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.169
think they're curiosity driven most of the time. Some

1146
01:00:54.169 --> 01:00:58.360
conversational time is instrumental, it's about 10% is used

1147
01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.639
for um for, for planning practical things. But most

1148
01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:04.719
of the time we're just, uh, you know, trying

1149
01:01:04.719 --> 01:01:08.600
to figure things out together. And, um, and I

1150
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.000
think working both as a philosopher and as somebody

1151
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.709
who's empirically informed. Uh, YOU can make some progress

1152
01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:15.590
on how that's going.

1153
01:01:17.239 --> 01:01:20.629
Great. So, where can people find you and your

1154
01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:22.129
work on the internet?

1155
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.209
OK, I have a website at University of Toronto.

1156
01:01:25.669 --> 01:01:28.550
Um, SO, I'm there. And I also wrote a

1157
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:33.030
very short introduction to this field called Knowledge, a

1158
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:36.270
very short introduction, uh, and that's available from Oxford

1159
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.929
University Press.

1160
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:40.830
OK, great. So thank you so much for taking
