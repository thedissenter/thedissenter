00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.410
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.489
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:09.770
today I'm joined by Doctor Adam Saffron. He's research

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.649
fellow at the L and Discovery Institute at Tufts

5
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.959
University, and he is also leading an interdisciplinary research.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.690
Program at the Institute for Advanced Consciousness Studies. And

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.680
today, we're going to talk about consciousness, intelligence, psychedelics,

8
00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.690
the self, and some other related topics. So Evan,

9
00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.450
welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure to

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.650
everyone.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.360
So happy to be talking with you.

12
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:42.240
So before we get into specific topics, let me

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.750
just ask you because it seems to me that

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.279
the research you do is very multidisciplinary and you

15
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.669
have many different kinds of approaches for some topics,

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.360
you have, for example, developmental and evolutionary approaches, then

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.310
you also apply neuro phenomenology or neuroscience plus phenomenology,

18
00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:08.169
and then you also have embodied cognition. So, Um,

19
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.099
what is the sort of framework that you adopt

20
00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:14.580
in your work when it comes to studying the

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.819
mind, exactly?

22
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:20.440
I guess some of my biggest influences would be

23
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.279
um uh. It's like people like uh Nietzsche, um

24
00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:32.680
George Lakoff, um, many others, but basically, um, you

25
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.680
might call it um heterarchical perspectivism. And it's like,

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.809
you know, um, all models are wrong, some models

27
00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.809
are useful, and all analogies are wrong, some analogies

28
00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:45.849
are useful. And basically, um, trying to like view

29
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.529
different frameworks as different ways of getting purchase on

30
00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:53.180
this like crossword puzzle, each one constraining the other,

31
00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:57.199
each one having um different uh constraints and affordances,

32
00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.970
which are non-overlapping and so their strengths and weaknesses,

33
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.209
you can kind of compliment them. And the goal

34
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.559
being to try to be as precise as possible.

35
00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:06.889
WHILE also trying to be a little bit, but

36
00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.399
not too playful about it. So it's like, you

37
00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.449
know, so this model, you know, so here's one

38
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.190
perspective and it gets you this far. Here's another

39
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.410
perspective, it gets you this far, and they both

40
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.130
converge in these ways and they don't converge in

41
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.289
that ways and just bootstrapping, filling in the crossword

42
00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.279
puzzle, moving around places where I have more or

43
00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.089
less purchase and trying to understand things. Um, THE

44
00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.529
other thing I would say would be something I

45
00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:35.979
call um Uh, Marian bio phenomenology, which is a

46
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.929
terrible name. But basically, like David Mar said, like,

47
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.729
you can understand like any like um cognitive system,

48
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.179
uh, on these like three supervenient levels of analysis

49
00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.080
of like. A functional computational level, like what is

50
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.399
a system like trying to do or the computations

51
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.240
it performs like what, what's its purpose, um, and

52
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.559
implementation slash mechanistic level of like the physics of

53
00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.279
how it gets it done, and some sort of

54
00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.270
like algorithmic abstraction layer in between. And so, um,

55
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.000
so that I butchered a little bit, but like

56
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.789
roughly like this is, um, this idea of like

57
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.279
looking at these multiple compatible levels of analysis and

58
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.720
cross-referencing across those and using those as sources of

59
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.389
constraints, and then pointing those at the at the

60
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.839
phenomena of interest and the explanum you want to

61
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.460
explain. So like, uh, so basically, taking on multiple

62
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.500
points of view from different frameworks, um, trying to

63
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.300
stay faithful to them, but not too faithful, but

64
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.279
faithful. And then, um. And at any given point

65
00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.190
recognizing that there are always multiple levels of analysis

66
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.059
which are All true in their own domains and

67
00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.130
their own scopes, um, and all wrong and true

68
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.139
within their scopes, and then, um, moving in and

69
00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.550
out, uh, based on what's most useful. It's kind

70
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.500
of um Eric Cole, I think, like talks about

71
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.429
this well with some of his work on like

72
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.449
a causal emergence of like, it's like almost like,

73
00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.660
what's the right course screening of a system like

74
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.660
you have an aperture that you sort of move

75
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.029
in and out so you get the most purchase

76
00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.970
and explanation. So that was a lot, but like,

77
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.759
I don't know quite how I sum it up,

78
00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:19.358
but it's like, um, Uh Whatever works while trying

79
00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.160
to be principled.

80
00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:28.079
Yeah. OK, fair, fair enough. So, uh, and with

81
00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.440
that in mind, how do you approach the study

82
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.709
of consciousness?

83
00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.029
USING this like taking on multiple points of view,

84
00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.220
uh, zooming in and out at different course screenings

85
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.700
and considering multiple levels of analysis as, um, potentially

86
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.489
being supervenient or um compatible or complementary. Um, I

87
00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:53.209
basically have tried to over the years, like just

88
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.220
like everyone else, I'm interested in my own consciousness,

89
00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.799
interested in theories of consciousness. So just reading widely,

90
00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:03.459
and um I did an apparently strange thing, uh,

91
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.929
which I find to be strange that more people

92
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.190
have done like I'm meeting more people who have

93
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.250
done it, but it's like surprisingly few. It's like,

94
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.540
what if instead of just like taking like one

95
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.899
perspective, saying this is the one, and then like,

96
00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:22.619
like digging in your heels and defending turf, the

97
00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:26.220
standard academic thing. Uh, WHAT if you took the

98
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.420
multiple perspectives and you try to like cross reference

99
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.059
them and like use and then bring in multiple

100
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.420
points of view, you know, you have to be

101
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.260
careful, obviously, because, you know, It's not, I don't

102
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.109
want to go, you know, postmodern fully on this.

103
00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.260
It's like, it's not everything is everything here. And

104
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.059
you, you know, there's like really like, you can

105
00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.459
break the thing if you like relax assumptions and

106
00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:47.420
things like that you can, you can end up

107
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.260
in BS territory if you're not careful in a

108
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.649
hurry. So it's like, but that being said, um,

109
00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:55.850
what if like all of these brilliant people are

110
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.579
actually all brilliant and actually seeing different sides of

111
00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:00.700
the elephant? And what if they should just talk

112
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.500
to each other more and listen to each other

113
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.829
more. Just saying. And so, like, for instance, um,

114
00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.399
when it came to consciousness, like, OK, um, there's

115
00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:10.410
this like group like in great information theory, like,

116
00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:13.880
this is very compelling in some respects. I don't

117
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.480
know about that, but yeah, yeah, yeah, amazingly brilliant

118
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.929
people. He's like, you know, I have points of

119
00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.760
agreement, discrimin same thing like uh the global neuron

120
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.519
workspace uh crowd. Yep. Absolutely, um, and I would

121
00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.239
say that for actually almost all the theories of

122
00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.239
consciousness and, you know, I even get weird, you

123
00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:35.119
know, like, I personally, for instance, like, uh, to

124
00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.640
go most exotic, like I go all the way

125
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.089
to like, you know, um, orchestrated reduction and like

126
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.119
Quantum consciousness, like, I personally don't believe in that

127
00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:49.630
because like I think actually like Tegmark. I believe

128
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.910
his proof that like, or his, his claims that

129
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.070
like the thermal conditions aren't right. It isn't quantum

130
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.829
physics giving ground to consciousness, but the idea that

131
00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:59.309
there's something deep about the quantum intuition when it

132
00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:02.179
comes to consciousness, and we should take it seriously,

133
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.510
and this should be one of our like constraints

134
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.040
and sense making like. Like a very qualified thumbs

135
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.720
up. And then like, so, but to like, the

136
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.079
main focus though would be trying to focus on

137
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.559
the theories that they have the largest communities around

138
00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:20.839
them and have the strongest synergies and then moving

139
00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.119
out from there as the goal being basically a

140
00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:29.869
common like nexus of Uh, collaborations and sense and

141
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:33.190
sense making. So the, the big dogs of like

142
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.029
integrated information theory, global normal workspace theory, it's like,

143
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.549
you know, they're in this like adversarial collaboration, like

144
00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:44.410
who's right. It's like, um, guys, um. You're not

145
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.209
even using words the same way. So like no

146
00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:50.880
one listens to anyone. So it's like, so integrated

147
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.910
information theory, they're talking about, um, consciousness, uh, uh,

148
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.440
qua experienceuala. They're talking about like, what would it

149
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.230
take to have something like a Quala generator? Like

150
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.000
what it feels like in all the particulars of

151
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.209
the fields. Uh, WORKSPACE theory, like sometimes it's like

152
00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:10.529
practically illusionist. They're talking about conscious access. They're talking

153
00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:14.079
about the ability to report on experience, to, you

154
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.010
know, to have access to manipulate, to be aware

155
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.529
of it, you know, and then everything's like, you

156
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:21.679
know, things like metaverse. Like people are basically, um,

157
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.890
I guess engaging in something I call like the

158
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.170
Humpty Dumpty fallacy, and it kind of brings us

159
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.230
back to like naturesche, like assuming there's like one,

160
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.290
like, I think people are just confused about language.

161
00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:32.270
They think words are these like 1 to 1

162
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.270
mappings on the pointers in the platonic forms like

163
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.349
it's just like gifted to us by God. It's

164
00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.380
like, no, no, we had to like negotiate this.

165
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.539
It's a hot mess. These language games are playing.

166
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.049
And but there's a, so basically, Um, like, the

167
00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:47.599
words have multiple meanings we're getting confused, but like,

168
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.979
um, The way people tend to use language though

169
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.549
is also a guide to how we ought to

170
00:08:53.549 --> 00:08:57.700
proceed. So for instance, I'm rambling, but like the

171
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.690
idea, for instance, it's like, OK, so, um, It's

172
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.320
important that like IT is talking about phenomenal consciousness

173
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.570
and GMWT is talking about conscious access. And so

174
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.929
like, they're talking, there's no need for them to

175
00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:14.650
even argue necessarily because they're talking about different things

176
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.010
of like consciousness potentially being understandable as this set

177
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.590
of like Um, phenomenon that you can unpack at

178
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.669
different levels. And you can use the same word,

179
00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:29.880
and, and the common use is informative. But the

180
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.450
differences are also informative. So for instance, OK. So,

181
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.900
but, um, OK, so. So something like, like the

182
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.450
stream of experience, like basically you might say like

183
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.219
creature consciousness or like, um, the what it feels

184
00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:50.000
like being unpacked from moment to moment, the appearance

185
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.200
of a lived world to you of appearance of

186
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.340
a world to you from a point of view

187
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.359
with a lived body at its center. Like, OK,

188
00:09:57.549 --> 00:09:59.080
that's one thing and that's like the thing I

189
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.039
tend to focus on. Like what is it about

190
00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:05.400
a biological system understood in terms of its biophysics,

191
00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:09.969
in terms of a, um, and also in terms

192
00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:12.940
of, um, uh, principles from like machine learning and

193
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.409
probability theory as an abstract understanding of them, what

194
00:10:15.409 --> 00:10:18.580
is it that might allow a physical system. To

195
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.450
give you basically a first-person ontology from a 3rd,

196
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.020
lets you move from a third person to a

197
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.140
first-person ontology, get a subjective point of view on

198
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.049
a lived world and specifically a world of experience.

199
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.450
But then there's other ways that um we we

200
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.359
want to talk about consciousness, like, for instance, like

201
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:39.309
uh like like the phenomenologists say like, um, in

202
00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:42.090
time consciousness, like the speech is present. That's, that's

203
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.260
an important explanum too. Um, THERE'S also things like

204
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.979
Um, consciousness in terms of, um, uh, meta-awareness and

205
00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:51.539
to be aware of your own experience and be

206
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:55.659
self-reflexive. That's its own beast. And so it's basically

207
00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:57.900
like there's a, it makes sense that there's a

208
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.539
common word that's pointing at all these things, but

209
00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:01.940
it's kind of like an onion that you can

210
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.299
unpack at different levels or like a, like a

211
00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:07.700
tree that grows. So anyways, so the basic idea

212
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.299
is what I do is I try to basically

213
00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:14.200
take all the theories seriously. Um Cross reference them.

214
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.739
And keep cross referencing them to basically create like

215
00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:22.059
a kind of Venn diagram slash tree of and

216
00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.700
use and keep adding words while trying to use

217
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.580
words as consistently as possible to say, here's roughly

218
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.469
the range of phenomena of the things that are

219
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:31.940
interesting to us about consciousness that we want to

220
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.890
explain and how can we do it. OK.

221
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.630
So, so I, I mean, but you mentioned the

222
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.750
integrated information theory and global net neuronal workspace theories

223
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.190
of consciousness, but in your work, you also integrate

224
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.260
them or try to integrate them or combine them

225
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.059
with the free energy principle and the active inference

226
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.099
framework.

227
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.869
And so, um, yeah, so that brings to the

228
00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:02.549
table its own set of perspectives, for instance, on,

229
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.380
um, so for instance, like, um, things like, um,

230
00:12:07.549 --> 00:12:11.309
life mind continuity, like the nature of like, um,

231
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:17.270
how intelligence systems are cybernetic systems, um, and living

232
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.030
systems and like the minds that we think of

233
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.750
now and like cognitive processes, we think of, these

234
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.030
are, um, fruits of the tree of evolution, and

235
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.340
they evolve and they develop. And so that's oftentimes

236
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.049
neglected within the theories of consciousness. It's like, um,

237
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.250
You know, each one's own view on the elephant,

238
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.530
but the, the developmentalist perspective, the evolutionist perspective. And

239
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.130
so basically I focused on the free energy principle

240
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.369
and active inference framework, IT and GMWT as a

241
00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:47.280
starting like place of like, bring these things together

242
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.979
as basically like an inner kernel and then I

243
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:52.969
elaborate in a series of papers, trying to basically

244
00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:55.809
unfold the various phenomena that different theorists talk about.

245
00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:58.200
Within this like inner kernel as a kind of

246
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.280
minimal unifying model for understanding consciousness and basically like

247
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.440
a scaffolding which you can just keep layering on

248
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.760
things, because we want to avoid like a, like

249
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.960
a, like a postmodern like morass, you know, it's

250
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.250
like it has to be like a precise structure

251
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.679
to work with. And so the idea was like

252
00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:17.479
focusing on these three theories and they like, they're

253
00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:20.440
different complementary features. So for instance, like the free

254
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.609
energy principle has aspirations of being a theory of

255
00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:26.039
everything. So does IT in a way, but there

256
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:29.049
they have differences. So it's like IT has, it's

257
00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.450
like the view of a system from its own

258
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.010
point of view and kind of it's like intrinsic

259
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.609
ontology. Well, the energy principle is also a theory

260
00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.809
of everything, but it's more of like both intrinsic

261
00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:43.250
and a relational ontology, and they have like similar

262
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.530
scopes and then like basically say, OK, how do

263
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.330
these theories talk to each other? How can they

264
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.400
talk to each other? Where do they overlap? And

265
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.280
so then, uh, global workspace theory entering specifically this

266
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.320
idea that so cognitive systems of um Of the

267
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.320
of they have many of the properties that we

268
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.989
would, uh, talk about it in terms of consciousness.

269
00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:10.520
Uh, AND, and some of the reasons we think

270
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.450
brains are able to do the job of, um,

271
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.719
Uh, potentially of, uh, giving rise to something like

272
00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.479
consciousness. The idea is that, um, the brain might

273
00:14:21.479 --> 00:14:24.250
have a certain type of, uh, structure or architecture,

274
00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:27.640
which is particularly good for allowing for a particular

275
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.039
kind of, uh, computation or, um, emergent functioning to

276
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:35.760
happen. So from a global workspace perspective, um, they

277
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.119
talk about having a bunch of specialist systems which

278
00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:40.760
each has their own particular point of view in

279
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.849
the world. And that these can come together for

280
00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:46.200
a whole experience in their parts in a workspace

281
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.159
where they can become mutually legible to each other

282
00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:52.169
and they can, you can get this informational synergy

283
00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:57.510
by all these specialist processes can, um, uh, project

284
00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.969
or broadcast or can send their information this like

285
00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:03.510
blackboard system. And these, these ideas originally came from

286
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.200
computer science and like ways of like constructing like,

287
00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:09.570
uh, complex cognitive systems, but these then inspired theories

288
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.950
of consciousness. And so, so global workspace theory, um,

289
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.760
the idea is that you're looking for a kind

290
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.359
of architecture that allows you to have, um, local

291
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:22.070
specialist processes that can coordinate within the shared workspace

292
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.159
and then give you a kind of informational synergy,

293
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.159
a whole that's greater than some of its parts.

294
00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.599
Now, I don't think on its own, this is

295
00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:32.719
an adequate theory of consciousness. I think it's like

296
00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:35.000
there's many aspects of neural functioning and, and like

297
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.179
there's It engages very deeply, like, for instance, with

298
00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:42.090
like, um, uh, the neuroscience, the cognitive neuroscience literature,

299
00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:44.489
um, much more so than ingrained information theory does.

300
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.299
And so that's like the virtue of it is

301
00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:49.340
it's actually engaging with psychology and it's engaging with

302
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.460
some computer science concepts. So that's the workspace theory.

303
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.419
Um, INTEGRATED information theory brings something different to the

304
00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:57.900
table, and it, it, it gets us in a

305
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.650
way closer to like the physics and the biophysics

306
00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.940
and more in terms of like what kind of

307
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.909
specific network properties might you need. To be able

308
00:16:05.909 --> 00:16:08.400
to um pull off the trick of a different

309
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.520
type of informational synergy. So it's going to be

310
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.440
hard to summarize both IAT and GWT here, but

311
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.880
it's like, um, and I like a series of

312
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.320
talks where I try to go into them, their

313
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.020
different shapes, but like, you know, really the theorists

314
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.409
should just speak to themselves. And then what I've

315
00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:23.869
tried to do is basically, I claim these theories

316
00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:27.239
are actually legible to each other. And you just

317
00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:28.880
have to have like, I try to basically provide

318
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.830
a guide to this to say, OK, Now, like,

319
00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:33.500
let's just read the theorist of what they're saying,

320
00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:35.789
and now let's cross reference and here's the mapping

321
00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:38.869
I think that works. And then we move from

322
00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:41.460
there. And so, so the free energy principle, um,

323
00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:44.700
basically brings in something else in addition to basically,

324
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:47.950
hard to explain, but the free energy principle, um,

325
00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:50.960
These ideas like the Bayesian brain or perception is

326
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.880
a kind of inference. So like, you know, Anil

327
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.030
Seth talks about this very well. It's like, um,

328
00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:58.549
your conscious experience is a kind of um grounded

329
00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:02.760
hallucination or like, um, um, or it goes back

330
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.160
to say like Helmholtz or your perceptions kind of

331
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.640
inference to the best guess of the cause of

332
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.270
what's there, like, like you're if you actually look

333
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.150
at the sense that you're getting. When I look

334
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.969
out into the world, to the extent I'm not

335
00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.069
just like imagining things, but like when you look

336
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.510
out into the world, like, you only have a

337
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.459
thumbnail arm's length, and you move your hand around,

338
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.219
and that's all the actual data is coming in.

339
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.109
But you're actually getting the experience perhaps of this

340
00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:31.310
more complete sensorium. So it seems like some sort

341
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.989
of filling is happening. It doesn't seem like you're

342
00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:36.349
just getting this like really sparse thing. So the

343
00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:38.939
free energy principle basically works with these ideas and

344
00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:42.739
it's in some ways, it's, um, I think these

345
00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:44.989
intuitions, you don't even need to talk about the

346
00:17:44.989 --> 00:17:47.689
energy principle now, like where we're at in terms

347
00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:51.969
of things like, um, you know, transformers or current

348
00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:54.920
space space models like like the current like like

349
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.729
place where more generative AI. The idea is basically,

350
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:04.869
um, Uh your experience like this competition like what

351
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:08.630
a consciousness generator would be, would potentially be the

352
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.599
entailment of some sort of generative model or if

353
00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:13.479
we get some devils and details like who I

354
00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:15.640
call it like an energy-based model, but still, the

355
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.150
idea being that like, um, the way that like,

356
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.280
for instance, like a, a deep fake, like you're

357
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.040
like filling in like pixel arrays on a screen

358
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.719
like to show you like an image, the idea

359
00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:31.739
is that basically The If you look at what

360
00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:34.050
the biophysics is doing and and you and you

361
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.180
find the right course screening to look at the

362
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.699
right tracking structures, it will entail a kind of

363
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:42.369
computation, which could be thought of as the inversion

364
00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:44.500
of a generative model or the output of an

365
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.500
energy-based model, but that basically This fill like the

366
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.900
same way like you look at these images that

367
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.430
don't exist. Like your experience is basically being computed

368
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.750
by biophysics in that way. Instead of filling in

369
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.060
a pixel array, you're filling in all of your

370
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.930
modalities in different combinations at any given moment. And

371
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.410
that basically you could say like, um, like, you

372
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.689
know, you are a deep fake, like you are

373
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.250
a strangely deep fake, being filled in all these

374
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.699
different ways. From moment to moment and that basically

375
00:19:15.699 --> 00:19:17.099
what people might have been looking for for the

376
00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:19.410
hard problem and I think I have a couple

377
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.229
of options we might actually be quite close to

378
00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:26.180
is some sort of computational description. Of biophysics, where

379
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.089
you say, yep, that there is the quality generator.

380
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.770
That there is the thing which can account for

381
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.199
a stream of experience, to what it feels like

382
00:19:35.199 --> 00:19:38.530
in all of the particular fields. And so the

383
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.599
free energy principle I've worked with is in terms

384
00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:45.489
of like Looking for this mapping to probability theory

385
00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:47.780
and machine learning, but you can also just go

386
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.819
straight to probability learning, uh, probability theory machine learning.

387
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.869
You can say like, you know, we basically are

388
00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:57.790
in possession now, I believe, of a set of

389
00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.459
architectures and a lexicon and, and we have like

390
00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:04.300
an algorithmic abstraction layer that's rich enough that I

391
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.109
think like, basically like the hard problem is it's,

392
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.339
it's on the ropes. I think it's just like

393
00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:11.290
a matter of like, we just kind of like

394
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.880
I like shove it around a bit, give it

395
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.640
a hug, and then like have a few more

396
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.189
conversations. I wouldn't be surprised actually if this like,

397
00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:22.800
like seemingly impenetrable mystery. If we just remembered that

398
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.069
we had bodies. And then we found like what's

399
00:20:28.069 --> 00:20:31.939
the explanation we're looking to explain. Like, for me,

400
00:20:31.949 --> 00:20:35.140
it's, I'm trying for conscious, I'm trying to explain

401
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.030
what I focus on is why is it that

402
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.989
the world appears to me with a live body

403
00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:40.790
at its center. And for me, that's the core

404
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.949
explanator, but And the hard problem. And so that

405
00:20:44.949 --> 00:20:46.930
is these various theories we're all pointing the way.

406
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.079
And so right now I'm basically struggling with having

407
00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:53.160
like, um, I need to learn more about modern,

408
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.790
like the latest advances in machine learning. But like,

409
00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:59.000
I think we're basically close to this is, I

410
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.359
know it's a crazy claim, but like, to basically

411
00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:04.719
nailing down the computational object, that is the quality

412
00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:07.599
generator and being able to say, here it is.

413
00:21:08.239 --> 00:21:11.819
You know, in the language of like what we

414
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:14.979
transformers or current space space models, maybe some reservoir

415
00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:16.739
computing in there for kicks, some geometric deep point,

416
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.780
like, here's how it is done that you could

417
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.560
get something computationally that does. Gives me experience machine.

418
00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:27.770
And then here's how the biophysics does it. And

419
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.050
now we account for the core features of our

420
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.449
phenomenology. And you know, it just depends, you know,

421
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.219
and just, you know, both like the generation of

422
00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:40.640
this lived body. Move on to things like um

423
00:21:40.939 --> 00:21:44.729
like time consciousness, we then like include like richer

424
00:21:44.729 --> 00:21:48.250
dynamic perspectives and maybe get the hippocampal system into

425
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.790
the loop that's a whole other story. But like,

426
00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:53.689
and this like we, I think we're actually close

427
00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:55.489
to being able to talk about these things where

428
00:21:55.489 --> 00:21:59.569
the enduring problems of consciousness. Um, MIGHT just start

429
00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:03.550
to be, um, sensible, and we can start to,

430
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.469
um, actually, uh, do a new kind of psychology

431
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.880
and engineering and AI about it.

432
00:22:12.569 --> 00:22:16.930
So you mentioned AI there, uh, would this approach

433
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.410
to consciousness also apply to AI?

434
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.780
I believe so. And I believe actually the current

435
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.579
debates about AI, um, needed to be informed by

436
00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:33.180
richer understandings of consciousness. And right now, I think

437
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.219
a lot of the thought leaders in AI need

438
00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:37.790
to be more patient and read more widely on

439
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.119
theories of consciousness because right now it's sort of

440
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:42.530
like they're engaging with like theories as they were

441
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.719
like so like Hinton, for instance, is just like

442
00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:47.859
a Dennettian and I don't think that's adequate for

443
00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:49.540
actually like being able to reason about what a

444
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.540
language model could do. It's just saying like Dennett

445
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.579
was right about consciousness, nothing to see here, folks.

446
00:22:53.949 --> 00:22:56.140
Or for instance, like Benjio, like he's doing some

447
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.109
like really interesting like global workspace, um, ideas and

448
00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:02.489
like connecting that to dynamics, but even then it's

449
00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:07.239
like, um, I just think we need more details

450
00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:09.760
to be able to talk about this in the

451
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.939
right way. Um. And we're just not having the

452
00:23:12.939 --> 00:23:15.810
right kinds of conversations because no one's being patient

453
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.209
enough. But the answer to your question is yes,

454
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.579
I think actually, um, even though intelligence and consciousness

455
00:23:23.579 --> 00:23:27.390
are separable, Um, in principle, in practice, they're not.

456
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.560
And in practice, um, consciousness is, depending on how

457
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.109
you want to define intelligence is immensely powerful for

458
00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:40.670
as a means of extending the capabilities of a

459
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.609
cybernetic system of an intelligent goal seeking system. Like

460
00:23:44.959 --> 00:23:46.599
if you have like, like, let's say you have

461
00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:51.359
like an agent in the world trying to realize

462
00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:58.520
it's a Value, it's semantic. INFORMATION for itself and

463
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.910
To basically have like this moment to moment estimation

464
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.359
of A field of experience that has some things

465
00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:11.560
in the foreground and background based on like um

466
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.920
affordance potential and history of salience and gives you

467
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.119
like a compositionality where you can track things and

468
00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:20.839
assign things. It's OK, this thing is here, this

469
00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:22.800
thing's there, this thing is more important, this thing's

470
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.250
less important, cloud of affordances like this is like

471
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.030
just very useful for the um being intelligent with

472
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.680
respect to the goal of surviving. And or the

473
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.020
goal of autonomy. And so like, um, I currently

474
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.819
like also in conversation like, um, actually people from

475
00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:42.449
the US Air Force who are actually, they're looking

476
00:24:42.449 --> 00:24:45.020
to, um, you should probably talk to Kevin at

477
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.900
some point. They're actually, um, he's less ramply than

478
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.270
I am. Um, THEY'RE looking to, um, basically, uh,

479
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.339
he's also a guest center on these special issues

480
00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:57.300
that I'm organizing at Royal Society, um, on AI

481
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.579
capabilities and the nature of also the nature of

482
00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:05.109
consciousness. But like, they're looking to basically, um, Create

483
00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:11.180
artificialquaa for the purpose of creating next-generation warfighters. It's

484
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.469
like that's actually their mandate. And so, um, dual

485
00:25:15.469 --> 00:25:18.270
use technologies, you know, it's scary stuff, but the

486
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.839
idea is like, is consciousness related to intelligence? Yes.

487
00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:24.229
Is it functional? Yes. The other way I would

488
00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:26.040
say is with respect to something like System 2

489
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.790
AI. Like, you know, again, we, we run into

490
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.869
the issue of like multiple uses of consciousness and

491
00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:33.650
which ones we're talking about. Are we talking about

492
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.550
phenomenal consciousness or conscious functions and conscious functions of

493
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.510
what kind. But this idea of like, agents and

494
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.680
what we're looking for in these systems like We're

495
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.040
looking for basically a system that can plan with

496
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.030
depth into the future, explore counterfactuals and coherent ways,

497
00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.439
and being able to be like flexibly pivot and

498
00:25:52.439 --> 00:25:57.130
remember and like self-reflect like. All these things would

499
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.170
be related to some things like we might say

500
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.849
as conscious functions in the sense of things like

501
00:26:01.849 --> 00:26:05.530
meta-awareness, metacognition. Um, AND so that's a whole other

502
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.930
way in which consciousness studies, as diverse as it

503
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.689
is, is relevant to AI. And so, like, I

504
00:26:11.689 --> 00:26:13.959
think so we'll get like, oftentimes like, you know,

505
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.280
a kind of like sneering dismissal like from people

506
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.800
like Hinton of like the relationship between like consciousness

507
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.810
and intelligence, and I think that's completely inappropriate. I

508
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.010
just, it's wrong. Um, IT'S, it's actually an embarrassment

509
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.170
of riches. The problem is, there's actually too many

510
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.810
ways in which consciousness is related to intelligence. There's

511
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.050
an important point there in that there is a

512
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.569
separability and that you can get very high degrees

513
00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:37.689
of intelligence without consciousness, and that's the important point

514
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:40.329
to be made. Um, BUT, and the claim that

515
00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:42.329
I would make is that though if you're looking

516
00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:46.650
for something like artificial general intelligence, something like a

517
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.180
Um, and we can get into like argue about

518
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.449
what we mean by general, but still something that's

519
00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:53.260
like us, that can do the range of things

520
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.540
we can do and more a a lifelong learner

521
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.219
capable of navigating and guiding themselves and others in

522
00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:05.619
a world of this kind inhabited by agents like

523
00:27:05.619 --> 00:27:08.010
us. I think we're going to need something like

524
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.760
consciousness to bring that one home. And I think,

525
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.729
um, uh, we might actually be um in some

526
00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:18.050
ways closer than we think to getting there, but

527
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.089
not with the current approaches.

528
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.310
Right, but do you think that AI would need

529
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.550
to be embodied in any way if it were

530
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.020
to develop consciousness, for example?

531
00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:40.250
Yes, it would need at the very least a

532
00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:44.349
rich virtual body. And so there's right now, one

533
00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:46.979
of the companies I mentioned is actually starting to

534
00:27:46.979 --> 00:27:52.780
like simulate virtual embodiments for artificial life agents. They

535
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.699
are basically of increasing degrees of sophistication and giving

536
00:27:55.699 --> 00:27:59.619
them neural networks for rich like bodies modeled with

537
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:03.319
rich physics and teroceptive states exteroceptive states. And all

538
00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:06.349
the ways that like, for instance, bodies play into

539
00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:09.520
this. I have this one paper, um, uh, forgive

540
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.790
the title, the radically embodied cybernetic, uh, basing brain

541
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.920
from free energy to free will and back again.

542
00:28:17.189 --> 00:28:18.589
I try to lay out like what I think

543
00:28:18.589 --> 00:28:21.020
like embodied cognition means. And so one of the

544
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.140
things is like, um, uh, I, I think actually

545
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.660
the body provides, um, a certain type, it has

546
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.780
many features, but it allows for a certain type

547
00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.449
of learning curriculum that makes us extremely data efficient

548
00:28:32.699 --> 00:28:34.979
and allows us to engage in the process, process

549
00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.459
of, um, structure learning of a world model, of

550
00:28:38.459 --> 00:28:41.380
a system world model that if you bootstrap off

551
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.229
of a valuing body, you get many things for

552
00:28:44.229 --> 00:28:47.079
free. And you, you actually need them to handle

553
00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:50.229
things like, like, like, um, the, the frame problem

554
00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:56.579
and to handle things like, like, um. IMPOVERISHED stimuli,

555
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.180
it gives you um But yes, uh, I, I

556
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.479
personally think, uh, there's no. Sidestepping, not just embodiments,

557
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.930
but actually I think fairly rich embodiments and embodiments

558
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:16.619
that actually, um, require Uh, certain types of informational

559
00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:21.640
closure. With a certain kinds of tightness that basically

560
00:29:22.579 --> 00:29:26.719
Situates you in the world. As an actor, as

561
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:31.910
a cause, among other causes, engaging with physics. And

562
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.500
being able to model the physics and the causation

563
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.780
of your own body and the other bodies around

564
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.680
you. And that's the kind of embodiment we need

565
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.650
to actually have symbols be grounded and actually have

566
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.560
systems that can actually have robust inference and don't,

567
00:29:47.689 --> 00:29:51.010
um, like we're all confabulation engines, but confabulations that

568
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.109
don't like, um, Uh, basically we, we, we trust

569
00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:56.489
them up to the point. I mean, this is,

570
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.390
I guess obviously so we trust them about the

571
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.630
point of catastrophe where like they just don't make

572
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.109
any sense at all. You're in like a cursed

573
00:30:02.109 --> 00:30:04.910
AI world, they start just like, like, like sore

574
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.949
on these other things like you go for long

575
00:30:06.949 --> 00:30:09.150
term coherence and they just start getting weird on

576
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.109
you. And you know, it happens to us to

577
00:30:12.109 --> 00:30:14.459
some degrees, but actually like, but, but it doesn't

578
00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:16.469
like we know something's off when you look at

579
00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:18.709
like this Gen AI like it's impressive if you

580
00:30:18.709 --> 00:30:21.239
look at like these short snippets. But the ability

581
00:30:21.239 --> 00:30:26.890
to actually like get to um Yeah, the ability

582
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.660
to like Actually look, actually have a system that

583
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.260
can, you could trust. To account for the causes

584
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.469
of the world, to model them, to predict them,

585
00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:40.099
to make decisions based on them in coherent ways.

586
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.819
I think actually you need to have a system

587
00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:44.900
that is bootstrapped off of its body in a

588
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.739
certain way. And so we're seeing, you know, I

589
00:30:47.739 --> 00:30:49.500
don't know how much of it's overhyped, but we're

590
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.579
seeing this like revolution robotics right now, you know,

591
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.890
so just like for instance, do like multimodal AI,

592
00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.300
that's not going to be enough. I don't think

593
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.699
it has to be itself a cause in the

594
00:30:56.699 --> 00:30:58.969
world. It has to be its own acting agent.

595
00:30:59.219 --> 00:31:00.859
And so maybe robotics gets us there, but then

596
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:03.140
the question is how close are we to having

597
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.849
robots of sufficient capabilities that they could actually um

598
00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:11.719
give you like the data you need. To basically

599
00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:12.890
engage in the kind of learning you would need

600
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.680
to train up a system world model. And so,

601
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.689
um, one of the, one of the companies I'm

602
00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:20.930
looking into is actually applied AI company for elder

603
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.930
care, and there's an interest in going into robotics

604
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.680
and also developmental robotics and actually like exploring that.

605
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.959
But this other company that is getting going is,

606
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:35.390
um, it's in a life. AI simulation platform and

607
00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:39.680
a video game company and like, uh, scientific benchmarking

608
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.319
like place-based system that basically creating these AI agents

609
00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:47.310
of increasing sophistication where they actually have, um, uh,

610
00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:51.319
rich rich bodies, but, um, they're in a, um,

611
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.160
a 2D environment. And so it's like easy to

612
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.560
implement them, but you can still get like a

613
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.270
lot of the physics and principles going and it's

614
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.199
a way of doing it in a way that's

615
00:32:00.199 --> 00:32:04.300
like, um, compute efficient. But still like, um, it's

616
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.270
not clear how far you can get with it.

617
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.550
We're also exploring like 3D options, but basically like,

618
00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:10.750
um, seeing how far we can get with basically,

619
00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:15.219
um, rich virtual embodiments that actually get the richness

620
00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:18.709
of the kinds of bodies that we have. That's

621
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.319
Mhm.

622
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.380
So, so, uh, let me just uh change topics

623
00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.579
now because I am also looking at the time.

624
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.780
So, um, tell us about the work you've been

625
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.900
doing on psychedelics, how it relates, how it relates

626
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.459
to your other research interests, and I mean, start

627
00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:41.449
by telling us what psychedelics are.

628
00:32:43.449 --> 00:32:49.579
So Um, Again, I'll go, I might verge a

629
00:32:49.579 --> 00:32:52.369
little postmodern in terms of it's always like, um,

630
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.979
which psychedelic in which context. And so like part

631
00:32:55.979 --> 00:33:00.089
of the work is like, um. Uh, WHAT'S the

632
00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:02.729
diversity range of like psychedelic phenomena, but still the

633
00:33:02.729 --> 00:33:06.969
through line also among all the psychedelics, or rather

634
00:33:06.969 --> 00:33:14.900
the, the clustering like classic psychedelics. Um, Psilocybin, LSD,

635
00:33:15.609 --> 00:33:17.630
the ones that tend to generate like mystic experiences

636
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.150
reliably of a kind that um for many people

637
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:27.660
are life transformative. Um So those I've done most

638
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.109
of my work so far focusing on that class

639
00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:34.069
of psychedelics and their mechanisms for how they might

640
00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:36.630
work, and I just published a paper on Albus

641
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.829
or altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics. It's kind of a

642
00:33:40.829 --> 00:33:44.130
response paper to an earlier theory called Rebus, relaxed

643
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.530
beliefs under Psychedelics by Robin Harris and Carl Frisson.

644
00:33:46.939 --> 00:33:49.469
And it's basically trying to take on those ideas

645
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.030
and basically iterate on them and like embed them

646
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:59.790
and like, um, basically. Apply more principles from um

647
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.719
uh. From basically added more details to try to

648
00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:07.989
make a more comprehensive theory. But for psychedelics, so

649
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:09.800
like in terms of like, I guess in terms

650
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.409
of the use of language is some uh what

651
00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.810
it says in the tin of like, um, psychedelic

652
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.850
or mind manifesting. Um, SO like there's these compounds

653
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:22.918
that allow, um, uh, when they're ingested or produced

654
00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:25.600
endogenously in some way, you know, whether like heavy

655
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.639
breathing, potentially even like endogenous DMT, um, basically alters

656
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.110
your consciousness, your experience in a way that's notable.

657
00:34:34.438 --> 00:34:36.949
And oftentimes it's it's not just your, your what

658
00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.228
is altered by your consciousness. Usually it's both like

659
00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:43.320
things like not just like, like the dream-like character

660
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.760
of it, the vividness, the detail, but also your

661
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.520
sense of self and the relationship to the world.

662
00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:52.870
And so basically, a changing in the um nature

663
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:57.939
of uh Your call, like in terms of like,

664
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.070
you know, usually, um, not always like an increasing

665
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.790
of like vividness and texturing in detail, things are

666
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.909
manifesting more readily and an alteration of yourself and

667
00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:11.229
relation to the world. That seems to be like

668
00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:13.550
one of the core things that like makes them

669
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.179
so powerful. It's like you're experiencing something very intensely,

670
00:35:17.389 --> 00:35:20.389
but you are different and now everything's different. And

671
00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:22.149
so now that's like part of how it's like

672
00:35:22.149 --> 00:35:24.189
so meaningful to people and so beautiful to people.

673
00:35:24.459 --> 00:35:27.120
And so it's such an opportunity, as you can,

674
00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:29.570
you, you have this thing which can um change,

675
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.719
which can like basically ah anneal you or or

676
00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:35.649
or or canalize you differently. Like it's like so

677
00:35:35.649 --> 00:35:37.290
there's some models like an opening of a critical

678
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.530
window. Um, AND it can also just, um, or

679
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.459
also just in the moment though, it can let

680
00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:46.639
you like by like, cranking like the, like turbocharging

681
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:49.449
the, the turbo code by like cranking the gas

682
00:35:49.449 --> 00:35:51.889
on consciousness, you can like reach states that like

683
00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:54.489
you couldn't reach otherwise and have like peak experiences

684
00:35:54.489 --> 00:35:57.090
and flow experiences you might have otherwise. And this

685
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.350
seems to be like the range of things we're

686
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.689
trying to account for, we're trying to count for

687
00:36:00.689 --> 00:36:03.610
psychedelics. And so in the papers I've been working

688
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.409
on over the years, um, I've been trying to

689
00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:10.239
say, OK, Using these like multiple perspectival, um, informed

690
00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:14.080
by like biology and computer science approaches, how can

691
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.750
we make sense of these range of phenomena? What

692
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.080
neural systems we have to look to, what computational

693
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.149
principles do we need? And so that would be

694
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:22.969
the Shape of that.

695
00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:26.689
Mhm. But do we have a good understanding of

696
00:36:26.689 --> 00:36:30.050
their mechanisms of action in the brain and do

697
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:36.639
we understand neuroscientifically how they produce, for example, mystic

698
00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:41.330
experiences and the other kinds of mental experiences uh

699
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.250
that are a result of their uh

700
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:49.530
consumption. Um, I guess it depends like how ambitious

701
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.840
we are and like how much we're trying to

702
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.320
explain. So it's like, and and also I guess

703
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.790
like the It's like the question we is interesting.

704
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:01.989
Actually, like, I feel like like academia is like,

705
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.040
it's failed so much on its own terms, and

706
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.719
like, we're always like talking past each other so

707
00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:09.129
much and no one's listening to each other. I

708
00:37:09.129 --> 00:37:11.060
like, I don't even know if there's a we.

709
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.159
Like even me, like, for instance, like you're getting

710
00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:14.439
ready for this interview, I was like, I had

711
00:37:14.439 --> 00:37:16.830
to like reread my own papers to be like,

712
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.639
wait, which thing do we have to dig into

713
00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:20.399
now? So, but, but so I, so I think

714
00:37:20.399 --> 00:37:24.659
it's like, um, uh, I think that you're getting

715
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:26.419
like, like, which is what I love about you

716
00:37:26.419 --> 00:37:29.739
like, you always get the deepest question, and I,

717
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:35.330
I think we can, we can. Get at some

718
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.820
aspects of this experiences to some degree. Um, HOW

719
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.239
satisfying it is, I'm not sure. But, um, Yeah.

720
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.639
So how close are we to that? So basically,

721
00:37:46.649 --> 00:37:48.469
I give it my best shots in this like

722
00:37:48.469 --> 00:37:50.409
recent paper that just came out in neuroscience of

723
00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:52.929
consciousness of like, you know, I'm not claiming to

724
00:37:52.929 --> 00:37:55.570
have like accounted for all the things, but I

725
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.929
was like, OK, so like, uh, so let's say

726
00:37:57.929 --> 00:38:01.810
like, we tried like really freaking hard for a

727
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.489
long time. Here's what it might look like to

728
00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:06.540
try to make a dent in it. And so

729
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.610
I do like approach it so like the the

730
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.439
dream-like character, the alterations of selfhood. What it's like

731
00:38:12.439 --> 00:38:16.080
with like different like levels of substance ingestion and

732
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.080
why, based on like different like neuroscientific details and

733
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.350
seeing if a coherent account could be there, but

734
00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.689
you have to unfold details like, it's a long

735
00:38:25.689 --> 00:38:27.679
conversation and it has to be like, you have

736
00:38:27.679 --> 00:38:30.120
to talk about things like, OK, is there a

737
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.760
common cortical algorithm or not? Like, you know, going

738
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.239
back to Mountcastle and Jeff Hawkins and all these

739
00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:38.879
ideas of like, you know, prediction memory frameworks and

740
00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:41.929
then, you know, hypredictive coding, OK. And now how

741
00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:45.929
might psychedelics impact that? And also, how, how might

742
00:38:45.929 --> 00:38:47.649
we need to complexify that story because that's on

743
00:38:47.649 --> 00:38:50.330
account of account of subjective experience. So now we

744
00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.689
need to start to unfold theories of consciousness. And

745
00:38:52.689 --> 00:38:56.489
wait, now we're talking about, wait, psychedelic cognition and

746
00:38:56.489 --> 00:38:59.209
like the way like the psychoommimetic paradigm and the

747
00:38:59.209 --> 00:39:02.770
ways in which like, um to be like a

748
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.080
trend, like one of the interests of psychedelics like

749
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.889
I guess back in the 50s was like giving

750
00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:09.449
psychiatrists more like empathy for like their psychotic patients.

751
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.530
And so there's like transient psychosis quality. OK, so

752
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.399
now we're talking about cognition. So now we're not

753
00:39:14.399 --> 00:39:17.070
just talking about quality generators. We're talking about things

754
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.949
like mental time travel, the nature of subjective time,

755
00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:24.159
the nature of like, um, imagination, and it's your

756
00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:27.330
ability to distinguish imagination from reality. And then, you

757
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.840
know, so now you have to do like really

758
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.280
complex systems neuroscience, and then it just gets, you

759
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.889
know, And so I, I, I do my best,

760
00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:39.229
like in this paper to like Try to accomplish

761
00:39:39.229 --> 00:39:40.770
such things and that I had to leave a

762
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.159
lot on the cutting room floor, but the, um,

763
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:49.870
I think we are actually quite close. I think

764
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.379
it's, it's, it's, you know. I I don't know

765
00:39:53.379 --> 00:39:55.770
if it's, it's satisfying enough for like a meal.

766
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.340
Yeah, I want more, but it's like enough, it's

767
00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.120
like, uh. Yeah, maybe, and keep going. Like I,

768
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.300
I wouldn't say like, um, We're at like fully

769
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.969
satisfying explanations. And I also like always feel like,

770
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.739
I always feel actually kind of like weird about

771
00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:13.780
it because it's like, like approaching it with the

772
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.620
scientific instrument. I feel like it's like, there's like

773
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.100
a duty to do so because it's like, you

774
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.620
know, we have to get these details right because

775
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.979
like, these these are medical interventions. This is like

776
00:40:22.979 --> 00:40:25.979
these are deep threads into like microscopes for mind,

777
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.139
like, you know, like uh that was part of

778
00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:29.780
like the psychedelic center at Hopkins, like the hope

779
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.850
was we would, you know, Understand the secrets of

780
00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.770
consciousness by studying psychedelics and I think there is

781
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.919
something there to it in terms of like, in

782
00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:37.449
like constructing these theories they have to like call

783
00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:39.770
shots and like it really like a lot of

784
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.810
things are revealed like, like core like cruxes and

785
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:46.300
issues. But like also there's like uh an element

786
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.100
of like humanity and spirit and like verbal overshadowing

787
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.899
and like scientism and like, like overreaching and it's

788
00:40:52.899 --> 00:40:55.429
like. Like there's like, there's also a sense in

789
00:40:55.429 --> 00:40:58.189
which these are sacred things to people and you

790
00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.870
know and like very meaningful and it's like the

791
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.280
way you talk about them also matters. I know,

792
00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.350
so it's like um Yeah they're not like, yeah,

793
00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:10.989
it's like the theories are not like possessions to

794
00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:12.800
like, like put on your shelf and be like,

795
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.820
yeah, I did it, it's like. Anyway, so, um,

796
00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:21.399
I think progress is being made by us, more

797
00:41:21.399 --> 00:41:22.969
progress will be made by us if we listen

798
00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:26.530
to each other better. Um, AND I think there's

799
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.649
some satisfaction, um, but I continue to be dissatisfied.

800
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.780
So. I'm sorry, this is

801
00:41:38.449 --> 00:41:40.729
OK, then let me ask you a different kind

802
00:41:40.729 --> 00:41:45.570
of question. What are the modern applications of psychedelics?

803
00:41:47.989 --> 00:41:51.620
It seems like the main places where they are

804
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.419
being explored at the moment. Primarily would be, I

805
00:41:56.419 --> 00:41:58.699
guess, um, you know, on the streets in the

806
00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:01.100
homes in the underground is like where most of

807
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.020
it's happening. It's just everyone using their own, you

808
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.610
know, parties, but then Um, It's the next place

809
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.169
to mention, just I guess maybe as a matter

810
00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:13.290
of principle would be, you know, the, the deep

811
00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.649
history of psychedelics and things like connections to like

812
00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:18.889
shamanism and places where like, it's still involved in

813
00:42:18.889 --> 00:42:22.340
people's cultures like, um, I was on a ayahuasca

814
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.610
retreat not too long ago at this place called

815
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.129
the Temple of Way of Light, and they try

816
00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:27.939
to like preserve like the tradition of psychedelics and

817
00:42:28.449 --> 00:42:32.149
man, that was rough. Um THERE was um I'm

818
00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:36.770
still recovering. Um, THERE was a Might be part

819
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.830
of why this is a slightly chaotic interview. I'm

820
00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:43.760
sorry. Oh, the um Uh, there's also the ways

821
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.000
in which, you know, I would argue I guess

822
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.989
the next one also as a matter of principle.

823
00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:50.120
Um, I'm working on like a paper with um

824
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.129
Sue Carter on trying to like explore like, um,

825
00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:55.820
endogenous psychedelic states and we're exploring whether like, for

826
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.300
instance, like, Um, connections between social peptide and psychedelic

827
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:05.679
mechanisms with the idea that basically, um, uh, sex,

828
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:09.870
orgasm, birthing, like these might have in some sense

829
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.070
has been like the original psychedelic states, um, maybe

830
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:18.649
also like near-death experiences, um. I just don't know,

831
00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:23.080
like If you got to that point Like, could

832
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.350
you have enough like selective pressure from that as

833
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.780
a source because like in nature, it's like you,

834
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.830
you're almost dead, or you're probably dead. But still,

835
00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:32.270
you know, it's not a really, it's not a

836
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.409
contest, but it is like near death experience. I

837
00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:35.629
just don't know quite how to think about them

838
00:43:35.629 --> 00:43:38.070
is like, how much selection came from that. But

839
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.229
it's like, let's say you almost died, or like

840
00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:42.830
you came close, that might be or you're coming

841
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.580
close. That's a whole other conversation. But basically, um,

842
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.709
psychedelics, I would say like, we enter into psychedelic

843
00:43:50.709 --> 00:43:52.879
states almost in like a, like a stoned ape

844
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.229
theory. I'm working on a paper on that with

845
00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:57.590
Mat Johnson of like, like part of human uniqueness

846
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.870
is like we're like a psychedelic ape, and we're

847
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.500
moving in and out of like. STATES to different

848
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.370
degrees, maybe including things like, you know, hyperventilation, carbon

849
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:11.409
dioxide, agonizes the 5 HC2A receptor or potentiates it

850
00:44:11.409 --> 00:44:15.300
endogenous DMT or just like states of neurosynchrony, moving

851
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.060
in and out of like alterations of consciousness and

852
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.459
self-consciousness. And then finally, uh, I will say I

853
00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:23.500
don't like, like I'll say medicine just because like

854
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.179
the state of it is rough, like places like

855
00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:27.899
Hopkins, like they're doing great work in terms of

856
00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:31.540
like these interventions potentially can like save people's lives.

857
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.050
Like you give someone a mystic experience and like,

858
00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.500
it'll be one of like 5, top 5 most

859
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.500
meaningful experiences in a person's life and it could

860
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.969
like turn things around, overcoming addiction, overcoming like depression,

861
00:44:43.979 --> 00:44:45.760
those things that like have plagued them as like,

862
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.709
like born again experiences. And, um, and so, you

863
00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:51.510
know, I don't want to like, like, I, I

864
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.229
just put a last because like these other things

865
00:44:53.229 --> 00:44:54.550
I think are kind of like too like they're

866
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.659
weird and neglected, and I think they provide an

867
00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:59.719
important backstory. But I, but, but there, there's an

868
00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:03.629
immense promise there. Uh, I guess the um reason

869
00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:06.860
I might put less, I feel like that, um,

870
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.229
endeavor is doing just fine on its own and

871
00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:13.429
might, um, uh, uh, I think maybe could benefit

872
00:45:13.429 --> 00:45:16.909
from getting a little bit weirder and um maybe

873
00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:23.000
incorporating like things like, uh, um, uh, self-compassion and

874
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.709
like and like, like other elements in terms of

875
00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:27.020
like the way they approach the questions and also

876
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.790
they have an issue of like, they don't have

877
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.379
a business model for scaling it. Because like this,

878
00:45:31.459 --> 00:45:34.540
it's just like, um, so hard to like, uh,

879
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.419
like it costs so much to do like an

880
00:45:36.419 --> 00:45:38.939
eight hour like psilocybin session, like a doctor on

881
00:45:38.939 --> 00:45:40.709
call. Like I was trying to do a study

882
00:45:40.709 --> 00:45:42.149
at one point and I was like I had

883
00:45:42.149 --> 00:45:44.580
this $900,000 grant. I was like, I've never seen

884
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.500
so much money and I was like, that's not

885
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.189
pilot data. It was like nothing. So, so how

886
00:45:49.189 --> 00:45:51.330
do you actually scale this like heal people? Like

887
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.060
what's the model of healing? So you could do

888
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.500
like a group therapy thing and maybe like scale

889
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.620
it that way. There's some interesting things that are

890
00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.100
happening with um uh short acting psychedelic compounds that

891
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.540
people are engineering that might change that. So it's

892
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.179
like someone could have like an like an MDMA

893
00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:10.169
like, like ecstasy like thing, and like it lasts

894
00:46:10.169 --> 00:46:13.340
only for an hour. And then like, maybe like

895
00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.689
the mainstream medicine effort will like be more relevant

896
00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:18.760
to helping more people. But right now it's kind

897
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.760
of like it's very interesting, promising cutting edge research

898
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.379
happening in this medical context. And I guess the

899
00:46:24.379 --> 00:46:26.540
final one, which is something I'm working on is

900
00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.350
this I'm trying to uh basically this actually going

901
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:32.580
to relate to the, the video game project is

902
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.389
something called psychedelic machine learning, which I know sounds

903
00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:37.449
like it's like a sensational thing, but it's not.

904
00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:40.209
The idea is like, like, if part of what

905
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.699
makes systems intelligent, well, one, if like part of

906
00:46:43.699 --> 00:46:46.419
like ways of interpreting psychedelics is like changing the

907
00:46:46.419 --> 00:46:49.419
states of consciousness and self and if self and

908
00:46:49.419 --> 00:46:52.810
consciousness are both functional. Then you can think of

909
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.810
psychedelic mechanisms as in cybernetic terms, as order parameters,

910
00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.530
control parameters, they have functional significances. And so if

911
00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.969
you talk about like psychedelics modifying you to imagine

912
00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:06.010
differently, to dream differently, like, um, so for instance,

913
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.560
like with respect to uh like a like a,

914
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.959
like a driverless car, you're going to change lanes,

915
00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:12.449
you do like a roll out into the future

916
00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:14.810
like what would happen if I switched lanes? How

917
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.949
vivid is that imagining, how creative you get? Or

918
00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:18.419
like when you take it back to the Tesla

919
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.340
dojo and you're looking for like the edge cases

920
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.939
and you're doing the dreaming, like, what's the nature

921
00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.459
of the dreaming? How weird do you get? You

922
00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:27.580
know, so the idea is like psychedelics basically in

923
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.659
multiple ways can inform machine learning both through neuro

924
00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:33.409
AI and through some of the problems that are

925
00:47:33.919 --> 00:47:37.979
addressed in AI like, um, making for flexible learning,

926
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:47.250
imaginative systems, uh, um, On simulate parameterizing simulation slash

927
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:51.610
like offline learning, and, and then potentially being like

928
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.010
a virtuous cycle where this machine learning interpretation of

929
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:57.969
psychedelics actually gives you a coherent way of talking

930
00:47:57.969 --> 00:47:59.770
about it, which I guess in a way brings

931
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.689
us full spiral back to like the approach of

932
00:48:01.689 --> 00:48:03.729
consciousness. IS this idea of going for like a

933
00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:07.330
virtuous cycle, like Dennis Save actually talked about this

934
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.689
really well in a 2017 paper of a virtuous

935
00:48:09.689 --> 00:48:12.489
cycle between like neuroscience and machine learning, of like

936
00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.810
each one is forming the other and keeping you

937
00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.610
grounded. So it's like, you can do better neuroscience

938
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.770
from like the machine learning lens, and then the

939
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.939
machine learning lens. And then like the neuroscience lens

940
00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:27.659
like gives you ideas for machine learning. And so

941
00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:29.860
same thing like psychedelic machine learning. I think there's

942
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.979
basically, um, an academic field that's about to take

943
00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:35.860
root there. And I'm working with some people who

944
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.219
made that happen and for advance studies with paper

945
00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:41.379
coming out, and also, um, then to actually try

946
00:48:41.379 --> 00:48:42.580
to be, it's going to be part of the

947
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.090
research. So for instance, these a-life creatures like giving

948
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:49.479
them psychedelics. One more thing Mike Levin, Mike Levin,

949
00:48:49.699 --> 00:48:51.699
uh, he also did really interesting work with like

950
00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:55.239
generalized psychedelics in ways that they can parameterize morphogenesis,

951
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.820
like the, the development of like the, the phenotype

952
00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.889
and the morphotype as a kind of inference process,

953
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.699
and then like what happens when you give drugs

954
00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:06.580
to the embryo. And so there's all sorts of

955
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.659
like psychedelics. It's like it's, um, it's, it's it's

956
00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:12.100
too rich, like all the ways like it it

957
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.860
applies to like, um, The mind sciences, it's like

958
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:19.929
the question is the problem I guess I generally

959
00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:23.239
have is like, where do you begin? To have

960
00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:26.000
like a coherent conversation about this and how can

961
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.199
like, we all be comfortable with getting as weird

962
00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:30.699
as we need to be to actually talk to

963
00:49:30.699 --> 00:49:33.129
the weirdness that is nature. And ourselves

964
00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:38.479
Yeah, I understand. So let me ask you one

965
00:49:38.479 --> 00:49:39.919
last question at a certain

966
00:49:39.919 --> 00:49:44.649
point in your. I think you might be the

967
00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:46.000
only person who understands.

968
00:49:47.169 --> 00:49:51.040
Well, I, I don't think so. So. And anyway,

969
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:53.010
let me ask you one last question.

970
00:49:53.129 --> 00:49:55.090
You understand better than I do, I think like

971
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.689
from all these conversations you've been having, like, I

972
00:49:57.689 --> 00:49:58.800
can tell you some things.

973
00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:04.370
Yeah, OK, so, uh, at a certain point there

974
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:09.479
you mentioned the self. So the psychedelic experiences relate

975
00:50:09.479 --> 00:50:12.530
to the self in any way, and what is

976
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:13.969
the self, really?

977
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.179
So, yeah, I wouldn't place probably if you're looking

978
00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:22.860
for a like unifying definition of psychedelics, you know,

979
00:50:22.939 --> 00:50:25.860
not in terms of like what it is that's

980
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.260
manifesting in mind differently that makes us like find

981
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.969
notable, um. CHANGING in the quality of consciousness and

982
00:50:33.969 --> 00:50:38.889
particularly self-consciousness. And so like, uh, and this being

983
00:50:38.889 --> 00:50:42.129
part of what makes these experiences particularly notable in

984
00:50:42.129 --> 00:50:44.830
their, um, the difference from other types of experiences

985
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.370
makes them meaningful in the ways they are and

986
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.610
potential, um, to be transformative. And so I guess

987
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.969
I would think of the self, um, I actually

988
00:50:52.969 --> 00:50:56.090
have um a series of papers that just came

989
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:01.639
out, um, pre-prints, um, collaborator, uh, grad student at

990
00:51:01.639 --> 00:51:04.439
Indiana University, Victoria Clama, and actually getting into like

991
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:07.159
the nature of selfhood with respect to like biotic

992
00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:09.320
systems and AI and we have like a series

993
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.209
of three papers digging into specifically, um, This issue

994
00:51:13.209 --> 00:51:16.429
of how we think of cell phone. But, you

995
00:51:16.429 --> 00:51:19.050
know, once again, it's using the methods. It's um

996
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:22.719
I like Almost all the ways I've seen self

997
00:51:22.719 --> 00:51:24.689
talked about. I like Dennett when he says it's

998
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:27.399
a center of narrative gravity. I like it like

999
00:51:27.399 --> 00:51:30.679
when people talk about like minimal embodied selfhood. I

1000
00:51:30.679 --> 00:51:33.169
like it when like people like Jordan Peterson and

1001
00:51:33.169 --> 00:51:35.719
Colin de Young talk about selves as like cybernetic

1002
00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:41.070
controllers and like um types of data structures. Um,

1003
00:51:41.919 --> 00:51:46.159
YOU know, I also um like mystic perspectives on

1004
00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:48.479
selves that consider the ways that selves also have

1005
00:51:48.479 --> 00:51:51.500
to be non-self. Although I, I, I have actually

1006
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.060
a book chapter coming out where I actually take

1007
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.229
some aim at that, like, uh, pushing back against

1008
00:51:56.229 --> 00:51:59.429
people like Sam Harris, because I think actually self-illusionism

1009
00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:02.899
is wrong and dangerous. Uh, SELVES are quite real.

1010
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.310
Um, THEY'RE terrifyingly real. They're also empty, but they're

1011
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.659
also real. And so like, um, I think that's

1012
00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:13.979
sort of what Buddhists would generally say actually, um,

1013
00:52:13.989 --> 00:52:19.330
the, but Uh, there's some interesting, uh, work. Um,

1014
00:52:21.139 --> 00:52:22.100
SO for instance there's one person you might want

1015
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.860
to talk to, um, has a paper on cell

1016
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.899
phones, which I think you'll find interesting in terms

1017
00:52:26.899 --> 00:52:29.719
of like a through line. Um, I, I invited

1018
00:52:29.719 --> 00:52:31.219
them, I have to reach out to them as

1019
00:52:31.219 --> 00:52:34.449
like part of this collection of world I'm organizing,

1020
00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:36.979
and, um, they're they're also, I think collaborating with

1021
00:52:36.979 --> 00:52:40.260
Mike. And it's basically generalizations of the default mode

1022
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.510
network across scales. And actually finding like analogs of

1023
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:47.659
it going like, like in the hydra and actually

1024
00:52:47.659 --> 00:52:51.030
potentially, um, uh, and other systems like even like

1025
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:55.270
plants or like potentially even individual cells, but a

1026
00:52:55.270 --> 00:53:02.989
kind of like, um, Uh a metastable, attracting structure,

1027
00:53:03.679 --> 00:53:06.719
uh metastable in terms of being at the edge

1028
00:53:06.719 --> 00:53:11.399
of chaos or like um poise the criticality that

1029
00:53:11.399 --> 00:53:17.040
allows basically, um, the system to you'll have like

1030
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.580
a sensory motor interface, and then this basically, uh,

1031
00:53:21.649 --> 00:53:25.600
and some sort of inner salience type network, some

1032
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.209
sort of evaluator of how good or bad it

1033
00:53:27.209 --> 00:53:30.459
is for the conditions of life. And then intermit

1034
00:53:30.459 --> 00:53:34.459
within them, this structure of, um, a model of

1035
00:53:34.459 --> 00:53:37.540
the system and its relationship to the world. And

1036
00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.489
it has certain properties usually they're interesting like it's,

1037
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.300
it's, um, uh, seems to be important for it

1038
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.860
to be like, um, flexible, but not too flexible

1039
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.939
at the edge of chaos, poise has properties of

1040
00:53:47.939 --> 00:53:51.199
self-organized criticality. And, um, one of the things that

1041
00:53:51.199 --> 00:53:55.239
psychedelics do potentially is like they disrupt, among many

1042
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:57.679
things is, um, the default mode network and allow

1043
00:53:57.679 --> 00:54:00.760
for different types of creative reconfigurations, change the nature

1044
00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.320
of the cyberne control allows you to break up

1045
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.070
the old regime and explore new ones. And so,

1046
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.679
um, if you're looking at things like generalized psychedelics,

1047
00:54:08.879 --> 00:54:12.040
um, basically for all systems like the self of

1048
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.040
the system, the, the core features of it, um,

1049
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.540
There's like some tractor network that has the ability

1050
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:25.040
to autopoetically um And then that reconsiturate itself through

1051
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:30.260
its inaction. And that um This system that it

1052
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.020
can be potentially uh has connections to like basically

1053
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.129
gives it coherence across time as it allows like

1054
00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:42.250
the past to inform the future for adaptive behavior

1055
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.540
and that this structure, this attracting structure, it can

1056
00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.260
be too loose or it could be too rigid.

1057
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.580
So like right now, for instance, coming off my

1058
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.739
Ayalaska retreat, it might be a little too loose

1059
00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:55.100
right now, but like, um, it could also be

1060
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.370
too rigid. And you might be stuck in like

1061
00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.629
a psychotic depressive state or just like a loveless

1062
00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:04.709
job or a loveless marriage just like annihilism, or

1063
00:55:04.709 --> 00:55:06.790
you can just be like locked into this perception

1064
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:09.060
box and this one frame of things. And so

1065
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.830
they, so, but for any system, it seems like

1066
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:15.060
there's this essential inner tracking structure that defines it,

1067
00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:16.879
that allows you to say there's a system there

1068
00:55:17.389 --> 00:55:20.429
and that gives it coherence, gives it a coitus,

1069
00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:23.590
if you will, or, um, allows it to have

1070
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:27.959
intention. Allows it to like basically buffer entropy and

1071
00:55:27.959 --> 00:55:29.399
be a be a cause in the world, be

1072
00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:32.000
a difference maker, and not just get like wiped

1073
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.149
out by the second law and become maximally probable

1074
00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:37.159
and ground up in the meat grinder existence, like

1075
00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:40.199
something that it's something that that resists and climbs

1076
00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:43.760
gradients, but also gives and and integrates. So what

1077
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:48.949
is the self It's like so many things and

1078
00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:51.189
there's like a it's just like, but there's also

1079
00:55:51.189 --> 00:55:53.679
a through line. And like, and I think language

1080
00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:56.510
is both like confusing and wise in terms of

1081
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:58.669
like, there's a reason we have this these common

1082
00:55:58.669 --> 00:56:01.110
like words for these different things. And it's just

1083
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:03.179
like we need to add a couple more words

1084
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.750
when we're talking, which do we mean in which

1085
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.669
context? And what's the interrelation of these different senses

1086
00:56:08.669 --> 00:56:10.709
for the different sides of the elephant. And so,

1087
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.010
you know, what is self, what is consciousness. What's

1088
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.840
intelligence, what is for all of us kind of

1089
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.370
like that same term move. I'd say is needed,

1090
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.770
so I'm going meta though instead of answering your

1091
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.459
question. So.

1092
00:56:27.139 --> 00:56:30.659
Uh, YEAH, but look, if people are interested, where

1093
00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:33.429
can they find your work on the internet?

1094
00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:37.159
Um, SO if they're interested, um, I have a

1095
00:56:37.159 --> 00:56:40.459
poorly curated, um, YouTube channel that has a lot

1096
00:56:40.459 --> 00:56:43.729
of my workout videos or where I pray, um,

1097
00:56:43.739 --> 00:56:47.239
and work out my issues. Um, AND I have

1098
00:56:47.239 --> 00:56:49.629
a, I also have like a lot of conversations

1099
00:56:49.629 --> 00:56:52.360
with different people. Um, I'm about to put up

1100
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.719
some new playlists there of like different like uh

1101
00:56:54.719 --> 00:56:57.760
interviews I've given, but, um, I guess maybe my

1102
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.949
Google Scholar would be a good place to go,

1103
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:05.110
or, um, Uh, I use Facebook as like a

1104
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.350
kind of science journal, and I have like this

1105
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.590
weird memory palace in there. Um, AND I sometimes

1106
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:14.360
see the same thing with Twitter, um. And I

1107
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.189
guess I'll start, I'm starting to use LinkedIn. So,

1108
00:57:17.479 --> 00:57:20.429
um, and I guess I have a website now

1109
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.679
and Email also works. There's a via that website,

1110
00:57:25.719 --> 00:57:28.280
there's a submission form, but happy to talk to

1111
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:34.050
people, um. Yeah, so probably my website that's getting

1112
00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.090
polished and those other standard places that people go

1113
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.610
to find out about people. They're all, they're all

1114
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:39.929
fine.

1115
00:57:41.239 --> 00:57:43.850
OK, great. So I'll be leaving some links to

1116
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.649
