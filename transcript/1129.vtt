00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.519
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.600
today I'm Jane by Doctor Agnes Galar. She is

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.640
an associate professor in philosophy at the University of

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.520
Chicago, and she is the author of Open Socrates

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.040
The Case for Philosophical Life, the book we're going

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.360
to talk about today. So, Doctor Collard, welcome to

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.260
the show. It's a huge pleasure to have you

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.790
everyone. Thank you. So, uh let me ask you

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.029
first, what does Socrates represent? What kinds of questions

11
00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:37.509
does he invite us to ask and try to

12
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:38.040
answer?

13
00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:46.099
I think he invites us to ask. The kinds

14
00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:50.889
of questions that we're already using the answers to

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.819
in the living of our lives. So as you

16
00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.659
go through your life, um, you know, you make

17
00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.380
choices, small ones, big ones, those choices are predicated

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.259
on a sense of like who you are, what

19
00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.099
your goals are, what it is to be a

20
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.199
good person, and Socrates wants to ask you about

21
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.739
all that.

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.819
And what is it that in the book you

23
00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.900
call Socrateism? What, what is that exactly?

24
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.769
So I use that word in a variety of

25
00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:29.910
ways, but maybe um. Um, Maybe I'll, I'll give

26
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.150
one of the ways that I use it, um,

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.029
that is one way I use it is to

28
00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.989
talk about a different form of ethics, um, but

29
00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:39.709
maybe we're going to get there later in the

30
00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.949
interview and I'll contrast it with other forms. But,

31
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.949
um, you know, another, another way to think about

32
00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:50.910
Socrateism, um, is just a kind of optimism about

33
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.760
the project of answering these questions. Um, THAT is

34
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.480
that this is something that we can do. It's

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.760
possible for us, we can make progress on it.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.760
We can get better at it. Um, THAT'S one

37
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.160
way to think about Socrateism at the most general

38
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.629
level.

39
00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:13.248
Why are why questions so important? Can't we just

40
00:02:13.248 --> 00:02:16.158
avoid them as much as possible or not?

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.440
We already do try to avoid them as much

42
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.279
as possible, and we are somewhat successful at that.

43
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:29.410
Um, And so, yes, that strategy works. Um, IT

44
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.050
works, uh, some of the time for everybody, and

45
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.089
maybe it works all of the time for some

46
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.089
people, and I think the people for whom it

47
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.410
works all of the time are not really gonna

48
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770
make it very far in my book. They're basically

49
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.050
gonna get like halfway through the introduction and put

50
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.210
the book down and that's fine. Um, BUT I

51
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.720
think that there are quite a lot of people.

52
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.399
Who are haunted by these why questions of why

53
00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.500
am I doing what I'm doing, and my book

54
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.520
is for them. Uh, AND they are the people

55
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.839
for whom the avoidance strategy has stopped working.

56
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.380
Right. So in the book you talk about uh

57
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.949
to toys and timely questions. What does he have

58
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.190
to say about them?

59
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.949
So I opened the book by um describing something

60
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.110
that happened to Tolstoy when he was about 50

61
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.270
and you know, it's taken from my description is

62
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.470
taken from something that he wrote about this time

63
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.130
period called confession. Uh, WHERE he Um, you know,

64
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.169
this time period in his life, he had already

65
00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.210
written War and Peace and Anna Karenina. He was

66
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.619
living in this kind of big estate. Um, He

67
00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.899
had a wife, a bunch of children, um, he's

68
00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.020
an aristocrat, he is kind of a cult hero

69
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.539
in Russia. So pretty much the paragon of human

70
00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:59.330
success, and he enters into this crisis period where

71
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.179
he cannot figure out whether his life is worth

72
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.110
living. In fact, he decides it isn't, uh, and

73
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.240
he becomes suicidal and the Um, what precipitates this

74
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.440
crisis is the thought that there are these questions

75
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.559
he's been putting off his whole life, and now

76
00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.510
is the time to turn himself to the questions.

77
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.640
And uh and so he decides to do it

78
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.519
and as soon as he confronts the questions, as

79
00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.420
soon as he allows himself to articulate them to

80
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.489
himself. He finds they're unanswerable, they're impossible, he'll never

81
00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:33.929
make any progress. This is hopeless. And because these

82
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:35.929
are questions about sort of the meaning of his

83
00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:38.609
own life or the point of the very activities

84
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:41.130
that he's been engaged in, why write novels? Why

85
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.820
care about the education of your children, and so

86
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.769
on. Um, HE decides that what he has exposed

87
00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.570
is the meaninglessness of his own life, and that's

88
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.649
why it um makes him suicidal. And so one

89
00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.940
way to think about. Sort of the Tolstoyan approach

90
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.619
is just that it's the opposite to Socratetism. If

91
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.100
Socratetism is the idea, there's a hope that we

92
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.579
can make progress on these questions. That's Tolstoy for

93
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:12.859
me serves as a foil or a contrast, where

94
00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.630
Tolstoyan despair is the despair that these are, although

95
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.100
they're the most important questions and although life is

96
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.540
meaningless without answers to them, we can't actually inquire

97
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.019
into them.

98
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.119
So that, that is the main difference between the

99
00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:35.269
Socratic approach and the Tolstoyen approach to untimely questions.

100
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.880
Yes, and I also, though I, I, I try

101
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.519
to go a little further to explain why, why

102
00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.040
did Socrates end up so optimistic and Tolstoy so

103
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.100
pessimistic. Socrates, it's not just that he thinks you

104
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.660
can make progress. It's that he thinks trying to

105
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.299
do so is the happiest way to spend your

106
00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:58.739
life. In fact, it's even the happiest way to

107
00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:01.500
spend your death. So when he is on trial

108
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.260
for his life in the apology, he says, look,

109
00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:06.220
if you guys put me to death and I

110
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.059
go down to Hades, I'm just gonna keep doing

111
00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.089
what I've been doing. I'm gonna, I'm gonna start

112
00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.170
interrogating, you know, Odysseus and Sisyphus, it's gonna be

113
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.640
amazing. Um, SO Socrates has this, it's not, it's

114
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.890
not just that like Socrates thinks something is possible,

115
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.100
it's that he has this really, um, Uh, kind

116
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.559
of profoundly cheerful, optimistic approach to what Tolstoy took

117
00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.779
to be, um, kind of despairingly pointless. So it's

118
00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.209
a really stark contrast, and what I try to,

119
00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:39.649
uh, argue is that the explanation for this contrast

120
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.140
is just that Socrates realized that you have that

121
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.489
this is an activity to do with other people,

122
00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:50.700
so that Tolstoy's philosophical despair is actually the correct

123
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.869
response to a situation in which you presuppose that

124
00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.070
these inquiries would have to be done alone. You

125
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.059
actually can't do them alone, so he's right um

126
00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:01.220
uh about something.

127
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.100
Mhm. How does one approach a question such as

128
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.540
how should I live?

129
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.070
Um, WELL, so I think most people approach it

130
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.899
by, um, avoiding it. That's one approach, um, and,

131
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.980
um. One thing I try to do in a

132
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.339
way is explain that that's not crazy. It's not

133
00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:29.320
crazy to avoid that question because If you say

134
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.760
to yourself, how should I live, but you already

135
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.920
are living in some way, and you clearly think

136
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.720
you should be living in that way, otherwise you

137
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.619
wouldn't be, then it's sort of like you're mouthing

138
00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:44.390
some words. Um, YOUR mouth, it's like I, I

139
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.829
could say, what is 2 + 2? I can

140
00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:48.869
say that. I mean, I can make those sounds

141
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.670
and I can make it sound like a question

142
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.959
by raising my voice at the end. Um, BUT

143
00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.320
I'm not actually asking a question. The reason I'm

144
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.440
not asking a question is that I think I

145
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.359
know the answer, and so I can't, I can't

146
00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:02.309
ask questions when I think I know the answer.

147
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.839
And so since we think we know the answer

148
00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:06.640
to the question, how should I live, we must

149
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.820
think we know the answer because we're doing stuff,

150
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.609
we can't pose the question to ourselves. And so

151
00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:16.079
that's why I called these untimely questions. What I

152
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.839
mean by untimely is just that they come at

153
00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.880
the wrong time because it's supposed to go like

154
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.359
this question and answer. It's not supposed to go

155
00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:24.869
answer that question. But on timely questions, it does

156
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:27.029
go like that. We get the answers before we

157
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.750
get the questions, and that means that when the

158
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.369
questions show up, they are in some way impossible.

159
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:35.710
That is, they're impossible for us to pose to

160
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.150
ourselves. But I think we can pose them to

161
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.669
other people. How should you live? Um, THAT'S a

162
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.590
possible question. And so the Socratic answer to how

163
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.789
should you approach that question is ask it to

164
00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:50.989
somebody else or be receptive of somebody else asking

165
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:51.549
it to you.

166
00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:57.869
Right. Did Socrates have an ethics? I mean, can

167
00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:01.549
we find an ethics in Socrates in any way

168
00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:02.270
or not?

169
00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:08.640
So I think that um. Many people who read

170
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.119
Socrates would answer no, that is they read him

171
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:15.719
sort of um negatively as a purely critical or

172
00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:19.039
destructive thinker, as somebody who went around showing that

173
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640
the people that he interacted with didn't know as

174
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.289
much as they thought they did. And that that's

175
00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:27.710
all that he did. Um, Cicero reads him that

176
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.710
way. Lots of lots of people have read Socrates

177
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.549
that way. I think Kierkegaard, I think also reads

178
00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:39.900
Socrates that way. Um, And um maybe a way

179
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.179
to describe the project of the book is to

180
00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:44.820
offer an alternative reading of Socrates, where he has

181
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.979
a positive view. That is, he's not just trying

182
00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:50.299
to show that nobody around him knows anything, he's

183
00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:52.820
actually trying to make progress towards knowledge and to

184
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:59.239
propose his own. Um, FORM of ethics, and I

185
00:09:59.239 --> 00:10:02.200
think the way to see that is to think

186
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.419
about the sort of um, menu of ethical theories

187
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:09.650
that is out there, um, and here I'm referring

188
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.450
to, you know, from this, uh, western tradition originating

189
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.489
in, uh, ancient Athens. So if you think about

190
00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:20.849
the menu of ethical theories that we have today

191
00:10:20.849 --> 00:10:24.489
in the West, I think most people would agree

192
00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:28.450
that um the main items on the menu are

193
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:35.239
first, utilitarianism. Um, WHICH says that you should act

194
00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:38.419
in such a way that the consequences of your

195
00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:42.080
action are going to bring about the best kind

196
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.239
of you know, expected results. So, um, that'll often

197
00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:50.950
be in terms of pleasure or happiness or utility

198
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.679
if we want to be neutral about whatever the

199
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:55.669
good state of affairs is, you're trying to bring

200
00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:57.799
that about, you're trying to bring as much of

201
00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:03.210
it about as possible. That's utilitarianism. Um, SO that's

202
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.859
one item on the menu. It's still a popular

203
00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:08.890
ethical theory. You see it very, um, you know,

204
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:14.520
explicitly espoused by effective altruists, by economists more generally,

205
00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:20.400
um, but, um, also by, um, you know, People

206
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.159
who are have to think about the things like

207
00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:28.940
medical ethics or whatever, right? Another uh ethical theory

208
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.299
that is, I think, a real contender today is

209
00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:38.489
Kantianism or deontology. Um, WHICH says that what you

210
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:43.690
should do is treat people with respect or fulfill

211
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.760
your duty or follow the moral law. Irrespectively of

212
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.679
whether that brings about the best kinds of consequences.

213
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.369
Um, AND, um, you know, this kind of ethical

214
00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:58.849
theory says, look, there are principles that we should

215
00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:02.450
follow, um, that is, we should behave in a

216
00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.559
certain kind of law-like way, the rationality of our,

217
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:13.820
um, Uh Of our uh behavior, it should be

218
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.099
the rationality of law, and we adhere to that

219
00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:19.159
law even if it doesn't bring about the right

220
00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:23.940
the the most um desired consequences. OK, and, and

221
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.020
we can think about if we go back to

222
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.979
utilitarianism for like the rationality there is the calculative

223
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:32.179
rationality of maximizing. So both Danology and utilitarianism are

224
00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:33.900
telling you to be rational, but they mean different

225
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.010
things by the word rational. The one means maximize

226
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.679
um. A certain kind of calculative maximization and the

227
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.919
other says um follow a law that we can

228
00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:50.549
all um apply to ourselves. There's a third ethical

229
00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:53.070
theory that's um I think less prominent than either

230
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.299
of those two, and in a way more recent,

231
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.630
um, which is neo Aristotelian virtue ethics, and it

232
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.869
tells you don't maximize good consequences, don't try to

233
00:13:02.869 --> 00:13:09.229
follow moral laws, instead, exercise the virtues. So behave

234
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:16.119
as the just, generous, witty, moderate, etc. PERSON would

235
00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:19.830
behave. Um, THIS person, um, Aristotle calls the Fronomos,

236
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.320
the wise person. So, so, um, exemplify the virtues.

237
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.960
OK. Has a long digression, but I think it's

238
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.710
um it's useful to see Socratic ethics in that

239
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.859
field. That is, those are some those are the

240
00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:37.250
ethical theories, but that's what we've got. Um, AS

241
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.770
far as I know, again, at least in the

242
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.330
west, there's nothing else. There are no other suggestions

243
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.770
as to what could be the goal that you're

244
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.210
aiming for in your actions. Uh, SOME people want

245
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.210
to mix and match them, OK, but these are

246
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.090
the, these are the options. Um, I think Socratic

247
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.159
ethics can claim to be a positive ethical theory

248
00:13:57.159 --> 00:13:59.890
insofar as it gives you an alternative goal to

249
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.250
those three goals, and I think it does. Um,

250
00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:04.489
SO Socratic ethics as I understand it is an

251
00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:07.890
inquisitive ethics, which is to say it's directed at

252
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.489
knowledge. So it says, doesn't say maximize utility, doesn't

253
00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:14.409
say um treatable with respect, doesn't say exercise virtues,

254
00:14:14.489 --> 00:14:18.469
it says acquire knowledge, uh, and it says that's

255
00:14:18.469 --> 00:14:22.429
what you should have in mind. In everything that

256
00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:22.830
you do.

257
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.739
And uh what is a bad life for Socrates?

258
00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:33.780
So, um, uh, we can, what we can do

259
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.070
is we can, we can even spell out the

260
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.489
contrast, right? So a bad life for the utilitarian

261
00:14:37.489 --> 00:14:39.900
is one that like brings about bad consequences for

262
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.739
you and for others, it like brings about lots

263
00:14:41.739 --> 00:14:45.070
of pain. Um, A bad life for the Kantian

264
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.590
is one where you violate the moral law, say

265
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.510
you're lying or you make lying promises. A bad

266
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.549
life for the virtue ethicist is one where you

267
00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:56.140
are ignoble, where your behavior is sort of ugly,

268
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.909
um, in the, in the distinctively that it's not

269
00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:02.239
Kaon, it's Iron, it's shame you behave shamefully. A

270
00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.080
bad life for the Socratic is an ignorant life.

271
00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:12.570
Uh, AND is happiness for Socrates different from morality?

272
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.760
No. Uh, SO that's in fact, that's not a

273
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.840
special thing about Socrates. Um, I think that, um,

274
00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:29.250
Um, The idea that happiness could come apart from

275
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.690
morality is a Christian or post-Christian idea. I don't

276
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.250
think you see it um in the ancient world

277
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.940
at all. So this is not just Um, Socrates,

278
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.419
it's also Plato, it's also Aristotle, it's also the

279
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:46.500
Stoics, it's the epicure. They all had just one

280
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.219
concept there where we have two, so he's, yes,

281
00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:51.020
if they're the same for Socrates, but they're also

282
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.299
the same for lots of other thinkers.

283
00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:55.369
So in the book at a certain point you

284
00:15:55.369 --> 00:16:00.239
talk about the values of inquiry, open-mindedness, and truth

285
00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:04.169
seeking, and you also explain how and why they

286
00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:08.929
are also paradoxes. So, first tell us about the

287
00:16:08.929 --> 00:16:12.530
values themselves and then perhaps we can get into

288
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.729
why they are also paradoxes.

289
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.669
Yeah, so, um, What I say in the book

290
00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:23.440
is that the Socratic method, like if you say

291
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.239
you want to be Socratic, what should you do?

292
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:30.280
Um, THE answer is you should inquire open-mindedly, seeking

293
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.510
the truth and avoiding falsity. Yeah. And um that

294
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.390
sounds easy. That sounds like that sounds obvious, like

295
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.109
you didn't need Socrates to tell you that, but

296
00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:39.950
it turns out that that's not easy or obvious,

297
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.549
that actually there's a paradox about inquiry, there's a

298
00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:46.109
paradox about open-mindedness, and there's a paradox about truth

299
00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:48.630
seeking, and I'll, I'll sketch each of them. There's

300
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.229
a lot that goes into the articulation of these

301
00:16:51.229 --> 00:16:53.030
paradoxes in the book, so I'm gonna like sketch

302
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.270
them each and you can ask me follow up

303
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.190
questions if you want, but The paradox of inquiry

304
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.559
is Mino's paradox. So it is, how can you

305
00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:04.280
inquire into what you don't know. I feel like

306
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.790
Tolstoy is very compelled by this, that is. Say

307
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.479
I don't know what virtue is and I want

308
00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:12.698
to look for virtue, um. How do I even

309
00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.589
get started? And if I, if I found it,

310
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.030
how would I know that I found the thing

311
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.108
I was looking for? I mean, if I don't

312
00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:20.348
know what I'm looking for, how am I going

313
00:17:20.348 --> 00:17:23.578
to find it? Um, THAT'S, that's the paradox about

314
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:28.208
inquiry. The paradox about open-mindedness is, it's open mindedness.

315
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:36.410
Um, Looks like being willing to um acknowledge that

316
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.489
you're wrong, that's open-mindedness. And if we distinguish that

317
00:17:41.489 --> 00:17:44.520
from being willing to acknowledge that you were wrong,

318
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.530
or that you might be wrong in the future,

319
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.900
Um, it looks like something very, very difficult because

320
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.819
it looks like seeing that I am wrong, is

321
00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:58.050
seeing that I have a false belief, but that

322
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.939
means that I have the belief and then I

323
00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:03.540
think it's false. But it looks like part of

324
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.020
what it is to have a belief is to

325
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.619
think that that belief is true. If I think

326
00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:09.500
it's sunny outside, then I also think it's true

327
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.140
that it's sunny outside. If I think that belief

328
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.979
of mine is false, then I have to stop

329
00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:16.760
thinking that it's sunny outside. So it looks like

330
00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:23.469
Um, you can't really Um, Have a belief, but

331
00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:26.680
think that belief is false. Uh AND um this

332
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.510
is uh often goes by the name of Moore's

333
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.229
paradox, OK, because GE Moore most famously called attention

334
00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:37.310
to it. And then, um, the final paradox is

335
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.349
pursue the truth and avoid falsehood, and the paradox

336
00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:42.900
there is sort of one of my own articulation.

337
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:46.150
I call it the gadfly midwife paradox. So what

338
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:52.869
I say is that Um, Socrates. Sometimes he seems

339
00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:55.550
like a gadfly, that is, uh, he's often described

340
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.670
that way, especially by his interlocutors. What they say

341
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.589
is that he's a critical negative person, that he

342
00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:04.310
is trying to destroy all of their claims to

343
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.989
wisdom, and that all he's ever doing is sort

344
00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:13.010
of avoiding falsehood. Um, AND, um, making them feel

345
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.250
lost, making them feel numb, like they can't, their

346
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.680
mouth is numb, they can't speak, their words go

347
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.180
around in circles, so he's a kind of fundamentally

348
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.040
destructive character. Um, BUT then in other places, Socrates

349
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.599
presents himself as a midwife as this kind of

350
00:19:28.599 --> 00:19:35.839
positive, truth oriented, um, person who is, um, building

351
00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:42.719
theories and being constructive. And the, the difficulty there

352
00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:45.989
is, how can you be destructive and constructive at

353
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:50.189
the same time? How can you um pursue the

354
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.469
truth and avoid falsity at the same time?

355
00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:58.739
OK, and so according to Socrates, how can we

356
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.189
solve these paradoxes? What are the solutions to each

357
00:20:02.189 --> 00:20:02.640
of them?

358
00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:11.560
So, um, the The solution to um the inquiry

359
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:18.280
paradox involves distinguishing between questions and problems, and um

360
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:24.979
seeing that Um, we have, um, a special kind

361
00:20:24.979 --> 00:20:31.180
of Inquisitive attitude, um, namely a question where, um,

362
00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:35.339
to have a question is already to have Um,

363
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.219
the thing that will grow up into the answer.

364
00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:40.829
So a question relates to an answer differently than

365
00:20:40.829 --> 00:20:44.069
a problem relates to a solution. Um, THE solution

366
00:20:44.069 --> 00:20:46.589
dissolves the problem, whereas the question sort of becomes

367
00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:49.510
the answer. And so the question itself is kind

368
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.979
of a guide that you follow like a thread

369
00:20:51.979 --> 00:20:54.560
that leads you to the answer. Um, THAT'S a

370
00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:57.189
metaphor because I don't want to go very deep

371
00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:59.069
into the details of the arguments of that chapter,

372
00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:04.729
but um. The um the way in which you

373
00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.010
can see that you're wrong about something, so this

374
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.959
is the solution to Moore's paradox. Is that another

375
00:21:10.959 --> 00:21:14.079
person can serve as a mirror, so they can

376
00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:16.640
show you that you're wrong. And you can see

377
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.319
that you're wrong, as Socrates says in the mirror

378
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.550
of their soul. So he says that, you know,

379
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.030
it's hard to see yourself. Like I can see,

380
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.000
um, you know, this pencil or something, I can

381
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.199
look at it, but it's not so easy for

382
00:21:31.199 --> 00:21:34.609
me to see myself. Um, AND in order to

383
00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:38.010
see myself, I need a reflective surface, um, and

384
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.160
he says, well, the way you should think about

385
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.050
inquiry is that another person is like a reflective

386
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.119
surface for you, and you get to see now

387
00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:50.170
not your physical appearance, but your soul reflected in

388
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.130
theirs. Um, AND then the final one, how do

389
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.000
you seek the truth and avoid falsity? Socrates's solution

390
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.609
is that you give those two jobs to two

391
00:22:02.609 --> 00:22:08.949
different people and have them coordinate that activity. Um,

392
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.010
SO Socrates's job is to avoid falsehood, but his

393
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.719
interlocutor's job is to have a truth, and It's,

394
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.589
you know, it's to answer the question, even if,

395
00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:20.239
if you don't know the answer, just guess. You're

396
00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.280
supposed to have some truth, if you're the person

397
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.959
Socrates is talking to, and then his job is

398
00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:29.069
to examine what you say, and by examining it,

399
00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:36.260
um, Uh To be helping you develop it in

400
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.300
the direction of improving it, and together you're inquiring.

401
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.209
So, what is then the importance of dialogue and

402
00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:47.930
working with other people? I mean, I guess that

403
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.920
dialogue is very well illustrated in Plato's works where

404
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.609
Socrates plays one of the characters, but what is

405
00:22:55.609 --> 00:22:56.920
the importance of it?

406
00:22:58.589 --> 00:23:02.130
So all three of these paradoxes are in fact

407
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.449
at some deeper level resolved in the same way.

408
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.329
I didn't make it so clear about the questioner,

409
00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:07.939
but it's like the one with the question, it's

410
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:09.979
crucial that someone else plays the role of answer,

411
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.260
right? So, namely that you have to, um, you

412
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.699
need another person, the other person who will be

413
00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:18.819
the answer of your questions or the person who

414
00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:21.140
poses questions to answer, the person who will serve

415
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.219
as the mirror, the person who will adopt either

416
00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:26.099
the role of um having choose the role of

417
00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:31.719
avoiding falsehoods. So, um. The, um, you know, maybe

418
00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:36.030
the most Um, efficient way to put the thesis

419
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.030
of my book is that it argues that the

420
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.989
kind of thinking that is at stake in these

421
00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:45.910
untimely questions is one that you actually can't do

422
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.709
by yourself. That is, there are problems you have

423
00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:49.910
you cannot think about by yourself, and you need

424
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.170
other people in order to think about them. So

425
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.949
the, the importance of other people is that they're

426
00:23:53.949 --> 00:23:55.880
unnecessary condition on this process.

427
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.380
So, uh, toward the end of the book, you

428
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.229
talk about three different domains where Socrates claims expertise,

429
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.500
namely politics, love, and death. I mean, before we

430
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.540
get into each of them, because I have a

431
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.619
question for each of them later, um, let me

432
00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:21.339
ask you a more general question. How is it

433
00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:26.180
that someone like Socrates who expressed ignorance so often?

434
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.560
Uh, CAN claim himself to be an expert in

435
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.719
such important domains of human experience. I mean, how

436
00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:38.989
can the practice of Socratic ignorance be a kind

437
00:24:38.989 --> 00:24:42.630
of mastery of the deepest of things?

438
00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:50.449
I think that Um, The key here is that

439
00:24:50.449 --> 00:24:55.900
Socrates thinks that in these domains. What is tripping

440
00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.930
us up is our assumption of knowledge. So, um,

441
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:04.579
the reason why we do so badly in the

442
00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:08.449
domains of love, death, and politics is that we

443
00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:10.339
think we know a bunch of things that we

444
00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:14.270
don't know. And so if you contrast some areas

445
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:19.150
of human endeavor that um where this might not

446
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.699
be true, let's say um technology, right? We don't

447
00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:24.989
tend to think we know how to create forms

448
00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:28.250
of technology that we don't yet have. That's pretty

449
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.920
important to innovation. Um, AND so if you look

450
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.239
at like human progress over the past 2500 years,

451
00:25:35.329 --> 00:25:40.089
we've made tons of progress with technological innovations. There

452
00:25:40.089 --> 00:25:42.839
was very little in the ancient world. I mean,

453
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.770
they had certain, you know, rudimentary farming stuff and

454
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.800
I mean, yeah, they had like wheels and stuff,

455
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.050
and armor and weapons and writing some stuff for

456
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.719
writing. But not even like printing press, which is

457
00:25:56.719 --> 00:26:02.199
not that complicated. Um, SO they were um very

458
00:26:02.199 --> 00:26:05.050
backwards in relation to us from the point of

459
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.040
view of technology, and so humanity has been able

460
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.920
to make a lot of progress in an area

461
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.449
where it didn't assume that it already knew. But

462
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:17.369
in the areas where we have persistently assumed that

463
00:26:17.369 --> 00:26:19.890
we know the answers, love, death, and politics, I

464
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.930
think we have not made so much progress. We're

465
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.569
not doing that much better than people in Socrates'

466
00:26:25.569 --> 00:26:31.800
world at Um, conducting ourselves in these three domains

467
00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:36.250
well, um, and, um, we, I think continue to

468
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.930
realize that we routinely screw up our love lives,

469
00:26:40.089 --> 00:26:42.329
our politics, and how we deal with that.

470
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.500
What is the socratizing move that you talk about

471
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.359
in the book?

472
00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.640
Yeah, so, um. The way that I introduced it

473
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.239
is to contrast it with a certain kind of

474
00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:58.640
move that resembles it but goes in the opposite

475
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.400
direction, which is the sort of reductive move that

476
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.989
became popular sort of in the 19th and 20th

477
00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:13.550
century, um, with thinkers like um Freud and Marx

478
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:20.079
and Foucault and Nietzsche and um. Um, I mean

479
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:21.560
you can go back further, you can even maybe

480
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.709
go to all the way back to Hobbs, um,

481
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.469
where they say something like, A bunch of stuff

482
00:27:28.469 --> 00:27:33.229
that you thought was really elevated and noble is

483
00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:37.890
actually nothing other than something that you kind of

484
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.569
despise. So, uh for Ford, it's like everything that

485
00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:43.449
you didn't think was all about sex actually is

486
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:46.250
all about sex, or, um, you know, for Foucault

487
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.449
it might be power for Nietzsche, it's gonna be

488
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:55.140
rezontima for Marx, it's gonna be class. um. So

489
00:27:55.229 --> 00:28:00.439
you get a certain um. Uh, REDUCTIVE analysis of

490
00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:05.189
um the human domain. And where at least a

491
00:28:05.189 --> 00:28:08.109
bunch of things sort of point downward. And what

492
00:28:08.109 --> 00:28:11.150
I argue is that Socrates makes a move like

493
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.390
that. In fact, he's the kind of originator of

494
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.260
this move, but his version of it goes up.

495
00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:18.469
So he thinks that a bunch of things that

496
00:28:18.469 --> 00:28:22.630
you didn't think were all about knowledge and inquiry

497
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.069
actually are, um, that is, uh, sort of all

498
00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:31.869
roads point upward to the pursuit of knowledge and

499
00:28:32.329 --> 00:28:34.729
Um, you know, so for instance, you might think

500
00:28:34.729 --> 00:28:37.089
that you care about the health of your body,

501
00:28:37.219 --> 00:28:40.859
you might be upset that you're sick, but really

502
00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:42.540
what that is is a concern for the health

503
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.699
of your soul, and what makes your soul healthy

504
00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:46.939
is knowledge. So health of the body points to

505
00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:48.660
health of your soul because that's the kind of

506
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.739
health that's um that's even a condition on the

507
00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:53.609
significance of the health of your body. That would

508
00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:54.380
be one example.

509
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.989
So let's take a each of the three domains

510
00:28:58.989 --> 00:29:03.569
I mentioned earlier, love, politics, and death intern. What

511
00:29:03.569 --> 00:29:06.589
did, what did Socrates have to say about the

512
00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:10.989
art of love and what does this method demand

513
00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:12.699
from her, from us here?

514
00:29:14.199 --> 00:29:18.949
So Socrates thought that what we were looking for

515
00:29:18.949 --> 00:29:27.239
from another person in um a Um, in a

516
00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:33.189
scenario of love, is a certain kind of, um,

517
00:29:33.199 --> 00:29:39.459
transcendent, wonderful, perfect goodness. On the one hand, that

518
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.709
would never leave us. So, um, we want someone

519
00:29:43.709 --> 00:29:48.500
who's, you know, Amazing, incredible, inspiring, has all the

520
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.420
good properties. And we want them to like commit

521
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.520
to us and stick with us. Mhm. And I

522
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.489
think he thought those things do not, um, Do

523
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:01.569
not go together when it comes to humans. That

524
00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:04.050
is, if what you want is a really good

525
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.250
human being, then you're gonna have to be willing,

526
00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:09.890
for instance, to trade up when you meet a

527
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.969
better one, and for also have them to trade

528
00:30:12.969 --> 00:30:14.810
up since that's also what they're looking for if

529
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.849
they meet someone better than you. Um, AND if

530
00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.489
what you really want is someone who will stick

531
00:30:19.489 --> 00:30:21.449
to you no matter what, well, then you're gonna

532
00:30:21.449 --> 00:30:24.880
have to settle for someone who's not necessarily perfect,

533
00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:28.880
and they're gonna settle for you. Um, SO attachment,

534
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.920
Socrates thinks goes along with settling and idealization goes

535
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.209
along with substitution. He thinks the solution is to

536
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:40.050
recognize that you don't really love other people. Other

537
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.589
people aren't the proper objects of your love. Other

538
00:30:42.589 --> 00:30:44.890
people are like a vehicle by which you love

539
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.660
something. That really is ideal, and you can be

540
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.729
attached to it as an ideal, namely the ideal.

541
00:30:52.219 --> 00:30:56.020
Um, AND, uh, so Socrates thinks the proper way

542
00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.459
to understand. The art of love is to understand

543
00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:04.770
that the other person is a participant in both

544
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.619
of your shared quest for this ideal, rather than

545
00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:09.380
trying to identify with them with the ideal.

546
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.449
How about the craft of politics? How do we

547
00:31:14.449 --> 00:31:17.339
approach it through the Socratic method?

548
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:21.650
So I think the key, I talk a lot

549
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.369
about different aspects of politics, um, that's the longest

550
00:31:24.369 --> 00:31:27.569
part of this section, but maybe the key point

551
00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:34.010
to make is that um The, the fighting that

552
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.369
we do in politics, um, that is the sort

553
00:31:37.369 --> 00:31:43.250
of characteristic way in which people politically experience other

554
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.010
people as their enemies who they have to defeat.

555
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:54.030
That that's actually um In distortion, it's a misplaced

556
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:58.069
desire to argue with them. So this is another

557
00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:01.550
instance of the socrateizing move. Fighting is really nothing

558
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.989
but arguing, that is, it's a bad version of

559
00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:08.709
an imperfect version of argumentation. And what we really

560
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:10.939
deeply want to do with our political enemies is

561
00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:13.349
not defeat them, but refute them or have them

562
00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:18.780
refute us, prove them right. Um, AND that politics

563
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:23.069
is never going to work until people understand that

564
00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:26.339
what lies at the heart of it are not

565
00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:28.390
conflicts of interest, but disagreements.

566
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:33.930
So, and finally to tackle the less domain, how

567
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.819
can we prepare for death through his method? I

568
00:32:37.819 --> 00:32:41.849
mean, how should we think about death, approach death

569
00:32:41.849 --> 00:32:43.979
and also prepare for it?

570
00:32:44.849 --> 00:32:47.949
So one thing that I think Socrates, one kind

571
00:32:47.949 --> 00:32:52.349
of reorientation that Socrates encourages in relation to death

572
00:32:52.349 --> 00:32:54.510
is even to rethink what it means to prepare

573
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.439
for death. So prepare for death doesn't mean prepare

574
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:59.910
for the last 5 minutes of your life. The

575
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.349
last 5 minutes of your life in the world

576
00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:07.310
we live in are not likely to be very

577
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:13.069
conscious, for example, um. Uh, AND so, um, what

578
00:33:13.069 --> 00:33:16.469
preparing for death really means from a Socratic point

579
00:33:16.469 --> 00:33:20.630
of view is living your whole life in the

580
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.069
light of and in the under with the understanding

581
00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:25.109
that you're going to die and not living with

582
00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:28.969
a kind of avoidance of it. And um what

583
00:33:28.969 --> 00:33:30.729
I argue in the book is that what that

584
00:33:30.729 --> 00:33:34.680
really means is confronting one specific fear of death.

585
00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:35.930
So in the book I say there are two

586
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.130
fears of death, or two ways you could fear

587
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.270
death. The maybe more standard one is what I

588
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.989
call FOMO. It's a fear of missing out on

589
00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:49.270
all of the joys and pleasures and goods that

590
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.229
you have experienced during your life and that you

591
00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:53.750
would like to keep experiencing. So you would like

592
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.069
life as you've known it to keep going and

593
00:33:56.069 --> 00:33:58.760
to get more and more of the same. And

594
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.359
you're upset that you're not gonna get more and

595
00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.359
more of the same, that's FOMO. I think Socrates

596
00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:06.079
has relatively little to say about that. Though I

597
00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:09.580
think other philosophers, the epicureans, Lucretius, they have stuff

598
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.889
to say. So turn to them if you're interested

599
00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.929
in that. But I think what he does is

600
00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.010
call your attention to another fear of death, a

601
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.889
different fear. I call this onehona, fear of never

602
00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:25.179
arriving, which is the fear that um You could

603
00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.270
be right now engaged in a project that will

604
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.938
be cut off by your death, so that it's

605
00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:32.620
not that you're not gonna get a good that

606
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.429
you've already had, you're not gonna get a good

607
00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:38.179
you've never had because you're working towards it. And

608
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.719
this kind of fear should be familiar to anyone

609
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:47.188
who takes on a significant project. Um, A significant

610
00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:50.909
project is one that might take years or decades

611
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.590
or it might take centuries. Um, IF you want

612
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.590
to be part of, you know, the cure for

613
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.030
cancer or even the cure for some particular kind

614
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.550
of cancer, that's not gonna be completed in your

615
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.429
lifetime, and you might think, well, why should I

616
00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:05.110
even do it? I'm not gonna see the end.

617
00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:09.139
I'm not gonna see the solution. Um, uh, LOTS

618
00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:12.219
of scientific projects are just bigger than a human

619
00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:17.709
life, and, um, The fear of never arriving could

620
00:35:17.709 --> 00:35:21.520
inhibit you from kind of hurling yourself down the

621
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.199
road of those projects. And so Socrates thinks that

622
00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:28.889
philosophy is a practice of death and dying. It

623
00:35:28.889 --> 00:35:31.649
prepares you for death because you're practicing, dying every

624
00:35:31.649 --> 00:35:33.520
day as a philosopher, and the way that you

625
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.840
practice is That you start to embark on some

626
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.620
conversation with somebody and You know you only have,

627
00:35:42.689 --> 00:35:45.370
say, an hour, and you know that the conversation

628
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.800
is gonna end before you arrive at the answer,

629
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.060
but you still have the conversation, you still try,

630
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.850
and then it gets cut off and you have

631
00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.010
to stop and you go home and you go

632
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.489
to bed and you wake up and next get

633
00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:01.090
up the next morning, you do it again. That's

634
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:06.239
like experiencing death. Every day, um, that's practicing for

635
00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:12.530
death. Um, IT'S practicing for not allowing your Um,

636
00:36:12.689 --> 00:36:18.370
kind of energy and optimism and inquisitive, um, hopefulness

637
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.330
to be inhibited by the fact that you yourself

638
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.969
won't see the answers to your questions.

639
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:30.199
OK, so one final question then, uh, what would

640
00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:34.030
you say are the main messages of your book?

641
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.239
I mean, on what grounds do you make your

642
00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:39.590
case for a philosophical life?

643
00:36:41.149 --> 00:36:47.129
So I think that um my main message is

644
00:36:47.129 --> 00:36:51.389
just that it's possible. Um, THAT is, I think

645
00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:54.070
a really reasonable response to my book might be.

646
00:36:55.989 --> 00:36:58.060
OK, so I could do this. I could live

647
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.889
a life of inquiry, and um it's, it's realistic,

648
00:37:02.989 --> 00:37:06.939
etc. BUT why should I? Um, AND I think

649
00:37:06.939 --> 00:37:10.419
that that's a reasonable response because my book is

650
00:37:10.419 --> 00:37:12.860
really trying to trying to add an item to

651
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.310
a menu. Um, IT doesn't take up the project

652
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.820
of defending this item as better than the other

653
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.500
items that are on the menu. The other ethical

654
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.379
theories, I think, really still are on the menu.

655
00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:28.550
Um, BUT I think that Even just showing that

656
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:34.469
it's possible is very powerful because most people don't

657
00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:36.830
respond the way that I just did. Almost everybody

658
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.350
has responded to this book saying like, no, no,

659
00:37:38.429 --> 00:37:40.350
you can't, you can't actually make any, just like

660
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.510
Tolstoy did, right? You can't make any progress. This

661
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.310
is impossible. You can't do it. This is not

662
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.709
a life. Um, IT'S uh it's, it's impossible, which

663
00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:50.310
is almost like conceding to me, look, if it

664
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.340
were possible, of course everybody should do it. Um,

665
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.229
SO I've been struck by the degree to which

666
00:37:56.229 --> 00:37:58.870
people will concede to me the big point that

667
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.949
I haven't even argued for and push me on

668
00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:04.300
the point that I think I do a lot

669
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.669
to try to establish, which is this is perfectly

670
00:38:06.669 --> 00:38:08.669
realistic and something that everyone could do and you're

671
00:38:08.669 --> 00:38:11.379
just choosing not to do it every day. Um,

672
00:38:11.429 --> 00:38:13.189
THE reason it's not happening is because of your

673
00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:16.030
choices, not because of anything impossible about it.

674
00:38:17.919 --> 00:38:21.679
Great. So the book is again open Socrates, the

675
00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:25.120
case for a Philosophical Life. I'm leaving a link

676
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.199
to it in the description of the interview. And

677
00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:31.800
Doctor Collard, just before we go apart from the

678
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.139
book, where can people find you and your work

679
00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:36.330
on the internet?

680
00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:40.110
I used to say Twitter, but I'm spending less

681
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.389
and less time there these days. Uh, I don't

682
00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:44.429
have a website, I guess I should. I don't

683
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:46.030
know if you Google me, I'm always writing new

684
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.229
things, but they're all in different places, so I

685
00:38:48.229 --> 00:38:49.939
think if you Google me you'll see the last

686
00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:52.699
thing I wrote. That's probably the best strategy.

687
00:38:53.469 --> 00:38:56.830
OK. So thank you so much for taking the

688
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.830
time to come on the show. It's been a

689
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.810
real pleasure to talk with you. Thank

690
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:01.949
