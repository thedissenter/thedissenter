00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.809
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lop and

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.649
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Joshua

4
00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.609
Glasgow. He's professor in and chair of the philosophy

5
00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.450
department at Sonoma State University. I'm leaving a link

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.000
to our first interview. In the description of this

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.909
one, which was about the solace, the, his book,

8
00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:27.120
The Solace, and today we're talking about his latest

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.200
book, The Significance Impulse on the importance of our

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.819
cosmic and importance. So, Doctor Glasgow, welcome back to

11
00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:36.729
the show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.069
Thank you, Ricardo. It's a pleasure to be here.

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.880
I'm, I'm looking forward to our conversation.

14
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.659
So, what is it that you call the significance

15
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.840
impulse? What does that mean?

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.500
So that's a label that I use to um

17
00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.529
capture the instinct that a lot of people have,

18
00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.849
not everybody, and I do think that it's probably

19
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:03.470
culturally um shaped. But the basic idea is the

20
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.230
instinct a lot of people have that it's good

21
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.540
for us to be important, that if in some

22
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.389
way I can be significant, that that's in my

23
00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.029
interests, like, it'll make for a better life than

24
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.150
if I'm just ordinary.

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.099
Mhm. And uh you mentioned you use the word

26
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.599
ordinary there. What does it mean to be ordinary

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.769
and what does it mean to be important?

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.139
Yeah, that's a really important piece of the puzzle.

29
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.589
Um, SO I think that we, we actually use

30
00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:36.510
the word important in various ways. So, you know,

31
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.589
sometimes we use it to just refer to something

32
00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:41.589
that matters, like, um, you know, it's important that

33
00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:43.589
we think about the food we put in our

34
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:46.389
bodies, for example. And that just means it's something,

35
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.029
you know, that's worthy of our consideration. But the

36
00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.900
sense that interests me in the book is, um,

37
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.559
to strive to be In uh of particular importance.

38
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.230
Um, SO one of the people that I use

39
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.360
is an American baseball player named Ted Williams, who

40
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000
famously said, I want to be the greatest hitter

41
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.639
of all time. Um, HE was striving to be

42
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:11.279
the best, the most important baseball player ever. And

43
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:12.759
I think a lot of people can relate to

44
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.220
that. And, uh, you know, whether it doesn't have

45
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.080
to be baseball necessarily, maybe you want to be

46
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.539
the best chef, or the best philosophy professor, or

47
00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.699
the best, you know, or or US president or

48
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.889
some other powerful position like that. There's a lot

49
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.919
of ways that people might strive to be important.

50
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.009
So in that sense, where you're trying to stand

51
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.690
out from everybody else, the sense of importance that

52
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.259
matters for this book. I, um, trying to be

53
00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.699
important in such a way that you have extraordinarily

54
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.899
high value, and where it's very rare, you know,

55
00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.179
like going back to Ted Williams, only one person

56
00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.899
can be the greatest hitter of all time in,

57
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.380
in a sport. And um he wanted to stand

58
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.660
out in that sense and be exceptional. So the

59
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.860
sense of being important or significant that I'm working

60
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.339
with is where you want to have rare and

61
00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.149
high value. And so to be ordinary then, Is

62
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.300
uh or to be unimportant, to be insignificant. Again,

63
00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.339
we can mean those, we can use those phrases

64
00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:13.449
with different. So sometimes we mean something's unimportant doesn't

65
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.410
matter at all. But that's not what I mean,

66
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.479
as you, as you, you know, recognize the key

67
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.759
word there is more ordinary, where what we, most

68
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.009
of us still matter, even though we're not the

69
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.220
greatest hitter of all time, or in a really

70
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.000
powerful position, or the, you know, winning a Nobel

71
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.889
Prize or something like that. But we still matter.

72
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.960
So to say that we're ordinary is to say

73
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.529
we still have value, but it's not particularly, particularly

74
00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.369
rare, and it's not particularly high value. You know,

75
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.919
we all have like equal moral status, for example,

76
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.009
and there are other ways that we matter, but

77
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.960
they don't make us stand out as particularly important.

78
00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.619
So this idea about or the the importance people

79
00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.919
give to being important or an important person, why

80
00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.199
do we care so much about distinguishing ourselves from

81
00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.169
other people? Where do you think that comes from?

82
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.589
You know, that's a great question. I don't honestly,

83
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.350
I don't really have any good answers, I don't

84
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.429
think. I think we could speculate a little bit.

85
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.630
Like, there are probably good evolutionary reasons why we

86
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.309
do it. We're just trying to explain where this

87
00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.390
comes from. Again, I think part of it is

88
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.470
cultural. So I think, you know, I'm from the

89
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.440
United States, and we seem to really celebrate it.

90
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.899
In fact, a lot of Americans like to claim

91
00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.109
that America is the greatest country in the history

92
00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:31.670
of the planet. Like, that's something that's important to

93
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670
Americans to stand out in that way, whereas you

94
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.170
don't see that in all the other countries of

95
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.489
the world, of course. And, uh, within this country,

96
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.850
a lot of people want to seem to stand

97
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.299
out from the crowd. Whereas there are other societies

98
00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:45.690
where standing out from the crowd is actually looked

99
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.850
down upon, where you don't want to be, you

100
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.730
know, the nail that stands out from the plank.

101
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.730
You want to be along the same line as

102
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.690
all the other nails in the plank. Um, SO

103
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.399
I do think there's a cultural aspect. That said,

104
00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:59.369
you could imagine that there might be some, uh,

105
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.940
evolutionary reasons why we might have this drive to

106
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.299
stand out from the crowd and be more important.

107
00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.179
For example, it might attract more, um, reproductive partners.

108
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.140
So maybe there's something about that that is appealing

109
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.260
for reproductive purposes, and therefore maybe it confers some

110
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.670
sort of Evolutionary advantage. But I just want to

111
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.609
say this is just guessing. I don't really know

112
00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:22.230
where it comes from. I don't have a good

113
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.989
story to tell. And when you read around as

114
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:28.279
to what psychologists have to say about it, um,

115
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.109
it's hard to find a deep-seated explanation for where

116
00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:32.989
this comes from. But it does seem to be

117
00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:36.029
really common. And so it's coming from somewhere powerful,

118
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.480
obviously.

119
00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:41.660
Fair enough. So, I, I mean, earlier you mentioned

120
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.339
that ordinary people or people who live ordinary lives

121
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:50.700
can still matter, but particularly in these modern scientific

122
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.640
world, I mean, looking more at the nihilistic end

123
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.579
of the spectrum here for a second. Is there

124
00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.670
any way that we can have some sort of

125
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.739
uh of objective intrinsic value as humans?

126
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.500
OK, so this is, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

127
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.200
give you a frustrating answer, I think, but I'm

128
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.140
like, here's my answer. So, I, I am not

129
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.739
a nihilist. um I don't, I do believe that

130
00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.100
there is objective value. Um, I, I'm not a

131
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.660
skeptic about value. I'm not a subjectivist about all

132
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.459
value, but I don't really have a good argument

133
00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.119
for that position. Instead, in this book, the, the

134
00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.480
position that I'm keen to argue against is this

135
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.000
view that, again, that somebody like Ted Williams, the

136
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.040
baseball player, um, holds, which is that it's good

137
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.429
for us to be important. And again, many people,

138
00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.559
you know, tell this to their children. I think

139
00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.119
we communicate this to um to society and, and

140
00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.440
how we glorify certain people and pursuits. Um, SO

141
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.769
I think we're really communicating, um, You know, how

142
00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:54.890
to be important, and that that's valuable. And so

143
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.489
my stance is to say, well, I want to

144
00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:59.890
argue against that, but I wanna give that side

145
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.130
of the debate as much of a head start

146
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.209
as I can in order to, you know, make,

147
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.399
make my argument against it all the more powerful.

148
00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.385
And for those people who think I think that

149
00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:10.385
we can be important and that that's good for

150
00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:13.265
us. They are already assuming a certain kind of

151
00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.105
objective value. They're assuming that there's value in the

152
00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:18.304
world and just arguing, hey, it's really good if

153
00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.864
we have even more of it. If I can

154
00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:21.744
be more important than everybody else, or if I

155
00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:23.584
can be the most important thing in the cosmos

156
00:07:23.584 --> 00:07:26.399
or something like that. So, because they're assuming that

157
00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.559
there is value, they're already assuming that nihilism is

158
00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:32.079
false, and I'm just gonna grant that to them

159
00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.480
for the purposes of argument. So I don't really

160
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.839
have a good argument against nihilism as much as

161
00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.720
I think for the purposes of this book, we

162
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.279
should grant it to the opposition, so that then

163
00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:45.079
when we argue, even still, it's not really in

164
00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.790
our interest to be important, and we can't be

165
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.730
important. Um, THAT'S a more powerful argument once we've

166
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.260
granted to, to the people who are in favor

167
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.899
of being significant that, um, you know, there is

168
00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:00.420
objective value in the world. I, I just to

169
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.459
add one other thought to that. Although I don't

170
00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.790
argue against nihilism, I do think that there's some

171
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.299
Relief from it. Um, IF, if, if we take

172
00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:13.630
nihilism really seriously, you know, a lot of people

173
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.739
react to nihilism with fear or panic, or skepticism.

174
00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:20.589
And in my view, if nihilism is true, if

175
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:23.359
there is no objective value, there's absolutely no reason

176
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.160
to respond with fear or anxiety or anything like

177
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.589
that, because there's no reason to have any reaction

178
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:30.989
whatsoever to anything if nihilism is true. There's no

179
00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:35.450
reasons in a world without value. And so, um,

180
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.500
in my view, although we can't say it's a

181
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.820
good thing that, you know, nihilism is true if

182
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.979
it's true, um, it would be kind of a

183
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.219
relief. You wouldn't have to worry about anything ever

184
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:47.020
again. It would feel nice, even if it's not

185
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.770
good in an objectively valuable sense. Um, SO I'm

186
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.609
not totally scared by nihilism, I think that actually

187
00:08:54.609 --> 00:08:58.570
there's kind of a, a, a nice, it somehow

188
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.090
leaves some other kinds of anxiety and the kinds

189
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.450
maybe we'll talk about later about what I'm called

190
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.630
the the. You know, value in our lives. Um,

191
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.539
BUT In terms of your question of, can, do

192
00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:12.820
I have an argument against nihilism? No, not really.

193
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.500
It's more of a dialectical point that my opponent

194
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.099
is, is assuming that nihilism is false, so I'll

195
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.340
assume that with them so that we can get

196
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.419
down to business of of what we're investigating.

197
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.989
But in terms of philosophy, there's another set of

198
00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:29.590
people who in this case they agree with you

199
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.710
that there's objective intrinsic value to human life, but

200
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.789
they tend to attribute a negative value to it.

201
00:09:36.869 --> 00:09:40.710
And I'm talking here about the pessimists. So what

202
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.109
do you think about them?

203
00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:46.409
Yeah, great. I, again, I'm not a pessimist. I'm,

204
00:09:46.489 --> 00:09:48.919
I'm, I'm, in fact, the book I say is

205
00:09:49.049 --> 00:09:51.369
meant to be a book for optimists. It's meant

206
00:09:51.369 --> 00:09:54.130
to provide a, a positive way of thinking about

207
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.690
the human condition. Um, NOW, what the argument against

208
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:03.340
pessimism. It depends on what kind of pessimism. So,

209
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.390
somebody like um Arthur Schopenhauer, who famously argued that,

210
00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:10.270
you know, we're always seeking some goal, which means

211
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.789
that either we're frustrated because we haven't reached our

212
00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:15.429
goal, or we're bored because we have reached it,

213
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.590
and now we don't have anything to do with

214
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.575
our lives. Um, THAT kind of skepticism. Um, YOU

215
00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:23.094
know, I'm really actually um sympathetic with the counterargument

216
00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:27.414
from Kieran Setia, that, um, not all, uh, value

217
00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:29.684
in life is goal-oriented, but a lot of it

218
00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:32.135
is what he calls at like, where it's not

219
00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:33.895
aiming at a goal, but it's just, you know,

220
00:10:34.094 --> 00:10:37.575
spending time with loved ones, or, um, you know,

221
00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:39.695
going for a hike or something like that. These

222
00:10:39.695 --> 00:10:42.734
are activities that we do without necessarily trying to

223
00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:44.775
achieve something, but just for the sake of the

224
00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:47.335
activity itself. And I think that's a great response

225
00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:51.780
to Schopenhauer's. Kind of pessimism. But there's other kinds

226
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.659
of pessimism that are more directly related to the

227
00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:57.859
concerns of the book. So, um, Blaise Pascal famously

228
00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:00.340
is one of those panicky people who, so let

229
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.419
me back up a second and say, you know,

230
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.140
as you know, one of the things I'm trying

231
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.640
to argue in the book is that on a

232
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.520
cosmic scale, we are unimportant. So you might matter

233
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.380
a lot to your family or your friends or

234
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.820
your community in some way. And maybe some of

235
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.659
us matter more to broader communities, like maybe my

236
00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:20.510
university or my students, I matter to them. And

237
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.780
then, of course, some people, not me, but some

238
00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:26.739
Some people are really important on a global historical

239
00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:29.780
scale, you know, somebody like Einstein or somebody who

240
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.030
really is going to make an important difference in

241
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.109
the world. But even that, even the most important

242
00:11:35.109 --> 00:11:37.369
people, the argument of the book is, they're not

243
00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:39.469
that important on a cosmic scale. They might be

244
00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:42.109
important to get into our communities, or even to

245
00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:45.510
the whole planet, but not to the cosmos. That's

246
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.349
that kind of significance is missing. So somebody like

247
00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:50.349
Pascal responds to that with a different kind of

248
00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:54.590
pessimism than what Schopenhauer um is concerned with. Pascal

249
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.539
says, when I think about how I don't matter

250
00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:57.989
much to the cosmos, you know, I look up

251
00:11:57.989 --> 00:11:59.630
at the stars and I realize I just don't

252
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.239
matter to the universe. Um, IN any significant way.

253
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.059
Uh, HE says, you know, I'm fearful, I'm frightened.

254
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.150
And so that's the kind of pessimism I do

255
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.510
want to respond to. And that's where that idea

256
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.479
about the tyranny of value comes in. So, um,

257
00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:16.469
if I can just, you know, elaborate for a

258
00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.539
minute, the, the basic idea is supposed to be

259
00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:23.559
that, uh, while It does mean that we're small,

260
00:12:23.729 --> 00:12:25.969
and we're weak, and we're powerless on a cosmic

261
00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:28.929
scale, you know, we can't smash planets together. Uh,

262
00:12:28.989 --> 00:12:31.169
WE can't even just run around our planet and

263
00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:32.820
save all the lives on our planet or end

264
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.320
global hunger or anything like that. We really struggle

265
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.409
to make a huge difference. Um, IT does mean

266
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.159
that we're small and weak and and relatively, um,

267
00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:44.679
you know, we're short-lived, um. And so there's all

268
00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:47.119
these limitations we have, and that's what Pascal freaks

269
00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:49.039
out about. But that's where I want to say

270
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:52.039
it's not worth having any fear about that. To

271
00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.960
be small isn't have to have anything to be

272
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.520
afraid of, it's just to be small. And in

273
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.669
addition, I think it's actually really good for us,

274
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.950
that we're not more important. And this is, um,

275
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.919
you know, one of the culminating arguments of the

276
00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:07.229
book, but the basic idea is supposed to be

277
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.320
that, whereas You might really want to be important

278
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.239
to the cosmos. If you did, that would crank

279
00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:18.440
up the stakes on every choice you make. It

280
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.320
would mean that how you spend your weekend is

281
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.469
now all of a sudden really high stakes because

282
00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:27.080
you're the most important thing in the universe. And

283
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.270
that comes with a tremendous amount of pressure. Um,

284
00:13:30.349 --> 00:13:32.229
AND, and, you know, we're, we're filled in a

285
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.549
moment right now. I think, I think it's fair

286
00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:36.429
to call this like an age of anxiety that

287
00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:38.340
we're in right now, where people are feeling pressure

288
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.950
from all sorts of different angles. And, um, being

289
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.669
unimportant really cranks down the pressure that comes with

290
00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:50.469
those anxieties. If we can say we don't matter

291
00:13:50.469 --> 00:13:52.719
that much, then it doesn't really matter that much

292
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:55.440
if I'm making the right choice about Uh, what

293
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.549
vacation to take next, or what to have for

294
00:13:57.549 --> 00:13:59.309
dinner, which is something that people really spend a

295
00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:02.070
lot of time worrying about sometimes, uh, let alone

296
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.390
life's bigger questions, you know, like, what career should

297
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.960
I choose, or is this the right life partner

298
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.429
for me? Or is this the right time to

299
00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:11.190
have a kid or start a business or something

300
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.599
like that. Those are all really heavy choices. And

301
00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.950
again, we do matter to our communities, so these

302
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.030
things do still matter on my view, but they

303
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.229
really have a lot less pressure um on them

304
00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:26.890
if we're not um That important. And so that's

305
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.609
where I call this, this is a kind of

306
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:30.690
freedom that we should really enjoy, that I call

307
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.640
the freedom from the tyranny of value. This idea

308
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.640
that, you know, good and bad, and pros and

309
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.609
cons, and right and wrong are gonna dominate our

310
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:40.650
thinking, you know, has a lot of sense to

311
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.809
it. And all of those categories still make sense

312
00:14:42.809 --> 00:14:44.400
on my view. There still is right and wrong

313
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.809
and good and bad. It's just that it doesn't

314
00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:48.809
matter as much if we get it wrong. If

315
00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.809
we get the wrong answer to these things, if

316
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:53.859
we're unimportant. Whereas if you were the most important

317
00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.530
thing in the cosmos, it would matter tremendously that

318
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.570
you get the right answers to these questions. And

319
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.729
I find it, I want to tell Pascal, enjoy

320
00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:03.969
your smallness, don't have fear of it. Enjoy the

321
00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:06.200
fact that you can, you know, just enjoy your

322
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.690
weekend and not have to put too much pressure

323
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.770
on yourself that you're spending it exactly the best

324
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.010
way.

325
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.729
So I asked you about the nihilists, the pessimists.

326
00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:18.979
There's uh one particular flavor of existentialist that I

327
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:21.059
would like to ask you about as well before

328
00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:23.979
we move on to other topics. What do you

329
00:15:23.979 --> 00:15:26.659
think about the absurdists? Do you think that their

330
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:29.969
philosop? If he can have a positive psychological effect

331
00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:33.179
on people and where, uh, I mean, how do

332
00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:34.960
you look at it from the point of view

333
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.690
of uh where you come from in terms of

334
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.169
how you approach the questions you explore in your

335
00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:42.530
book?

336
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.559
Right, um, yeah, I mean, absurdism is such a

337
00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.219
wonderful and interesting view. Um, PART of it, of

338
00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:50.979
course, depends on what we mean by, you know,

339
00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:53.340
the absurdists. The one I guess that I take

340
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.219
the most, um, direction from is Thomas Nagel and

341
00:15:56.219 --> 00:15:59.849
his famous paper, The Absurd, and his, um, his,

342
00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:02.219
uh, book, The View From Nowhere, where he's sort

343
00:16:02.219 --> 00:16:04.460
of his view is that our, our, the human

344
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.219
condition is absurd because on the one hand, we

345
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:09.409
go around as if things matter, you know, we

346
00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:12.239
wow. We walk around life as if there is

347
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.320
objective value and um we have to make the

348
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.640
right choices and all that sort of thing. But

349
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.010
he also thinks that, uh, sorry, so that's our

350
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.609
sort of subjective stance is that these things matter.

351
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.309
But then when we try to objectively justify it,

352
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:27.119
we have a really hard time, you know, of

353
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:30.679
course, as philosophers are fond of noting, of justifying

354
00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:34.080
that position of finding some good justification for this

355
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.210
belief and objective value. And so he thinks we're

356
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.450
absurd because we're, we have these pretensions, this, this

357
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.840
aspiration to live a life that is objectively worthy.

358
00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.729
And at the same time, deep down, we know

359
00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:48.330
that that's really not even something that we can

360
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.289
justify to ourselves. And then that's kind of an

361
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:54.320
absurd position. Um, SO, when I think about Nagle,

362
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.450
um, one of the, you know, really interesting pieces

363
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.080
of his view is that he recommends that we

364
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.239
be ironic about it, that we kind of accept

365
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.300
both halves of that. And I, well, I like

366
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.160
a lot of Nagle's arguments and find them very

367
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.739
compelling and powerful, I struggle with that recommendation on

368
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:13.069
two levels. One is more of a psychological level,

369
00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.729
that when I'm in this position of philosophical skepticism,

370
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.618
I can't really maintain my grip on this belief

371
00:17:19.618 --> 00:17:21.780
that things objectively matter. I start to lose my

372
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.858
grip on that. So holding those two at the

373
00:17:23.858 --> 00:17:26.219
same time is really hard for me. And similarly,

374
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.949
when I'm in my engaged Um, things matter perspective,

375
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.979
where, where I am, you know, going about life

376
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:34.869
as if everything I'm doing matters and this world

377
00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:37.069
around me matters. I have a really hard time

378
00:17:37.069 --> 00:17:39.900
taking philosophical skepticism seriously. I have to kind of,

379
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:42.229
um, put it in its own little box and

380
00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:45.334
contextualize my life. In a way that is separate

381
00:17:45.334 --> 00:17:48.755
from that box. So I, I struggle with Nagel's

382
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.925
recommendation to have, uh, to reconcile myself to both

383
00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.655
stances simultaneously. I can kind of bounce from left

384
00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:56.454
to right, but I can't be going left and

385
00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:58.175
right at the same time. I'm that struggle with

386
00:17:58.175 --> 00:18:01.775
that. That's the psychological point. In terms of, of

387
00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:06.290
um of a more philosophical piece of it. The

388
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.290
one, the one hesitation or or or reservation I

389
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.530
have about Nagle's argument there is that he's recommending

390
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.959
irony. But of course, we can't recommend anything if

391
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:18.849
if it's true that there is no you know,

392
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.209
there is no ultimate justification for our recommendations, which

393
00:18:22.209 --> 00:18:24.719
is part of his argument. So he can say,

394
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.229
you know, enjoy being ironic, or he can say,

395
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.760
this is what I'm going to do, is to

396
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.329
be ironic, but to recommend it as a wise

397
00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.839
choice, doesn't really make sense in the context where

398
00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:38.160
we're abandoning wise choices. So, I mean, my own

399
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.439
view is to uh remain in that objectively engaged

400
00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:45.630
perspective where I believe that there is objective value

401
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.160
and and and hope that somehow we can vindicate

402
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.880
that. Um, BUT, um, I, I can't recommend irony

403
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.750
or any other stance, or pessimism or defeatism, or

404
00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:59.479
anything else, um, without, you know, believing that there's

405
00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:02.000
some sort of value out there, um, to, to

406
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.459
base that recommendation on. So, to tie it back

407
00:19:05.459 --> 00:19:07.359
to the themes of the book, you know, I'm

408
00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:09.469
not really, again, to go back to your earlier

409
00:19:09.469 --> 00:19:12.510
question, since I'm not tackling nihilism, I'm instead saying,

410
00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.319
well, my opponent who believes that the significance impulse

411
00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:18.084
is a good thing, already assumes nihilism, so. Is

412
00:19:18.084 --> 00:19:20.285
false. So I will assume that it's false too,

413
00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:22.885
just to get the conversation going. So I can

414
00:19:22.885 --> 00:19:25.285
kind of sidestep, you know, there's really hard questions

415
00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:29.645
about nihilism and absurdity, um, because I'm, I'm, I'm

416
00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:31.645
jumping ahead in the conversation, so to speak. I'm,

417
00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:34.324
I'm working at a different level. But I do

418
00:19:34.324 --> 00:19:37.395
have that reaction against the absurdism that it's hard

419
00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:39.094
for me, you know, absurdists are kind of saying,

420
00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:41.604
I just celebrate the absurdity of life. And I

421
00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:43.405
have a hard time celebrating it if there's no

422
00:19:43.405 --> 00:19:46.525
reason to celebrate anything, or to despair about it.

423
00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:50.910
Mhm. So I have now a set of questions

424
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.000
related to importance and the kinds of things that

425
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.359
we tend to associate with important people or being

426
00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:02.449
someone important. Uh, EARLIER you mentioned, for example, Einstein

427
00:20:02.449 --> 00:20:06.359
and talking about uh exceptional people, I mean, it

428
00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:09.199
is one thing for us to attribute some sort

429
00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:14.280
of exceptionalism to certain particular individuals, but wouldn't you

430
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.589
agree that even when it comes to humanity. His

431
00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:22.099
biggest achievements that uh that they all are, or

432
00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:25.300
at least most of them are the result of

433
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.310
collective work instead of being breakthroughs made by particular

434
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.560
individuals that then tend to get all the credit

435
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.640
for them. I mean, do, do you agree with

436
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.270
that or

437
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.630
not? I do agree, 100%, I agree. I think,

438
00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.810
um, you know, at least in my country, we,

439
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:49.589
we overemphasize individual contribution and downplay the collective. Um,

440
00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:52.560
YOU know, this is where somebody like, oh, let's

441
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.160
let's say John Rawls, um, with his theory of

442
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.650
justice, you know, one of the beautiful points of,

443
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.959
of that book is that, you know, the people

444
00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:02.599
who achieve the most, uh, wealth or any other

445
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:05.599
sort of material well-being. Um, ARE doing it in

446
00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:08.479
a social context where it takes everyone's participation to

447
00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:11.319
make that wealth possible. And we often lose sight

448
00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:13.239
of that, at least in the United States, and

449
00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:16.469
think that, um, you know, there's just a context

450
00:21:16.469 --> 00:21:18.719
that was sort of handed down by nature or

451
00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:22.410
something, and individuals come along and discover some scientific

452
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.739
discovery or produce some wonderful economic development or beautiful.

453
00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:32.979
And don't pay attention to the sort of effort

454
00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:34.540
that you're talking about. And really that's on two

455
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.979
levels, right? There's the historical fact that all of

456
00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:38.819
us are standing on the shoulders of the giants

457
00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:41.859
before us, right? That we are building on a

458
00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:43.739
lot of work that's been done before us. But

459
00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:47.020
also, the communities and social structures in which we

460
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.300
live, concurrently right now, are a huge piece of

461
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.619
us being able to do. What we do. So

462
00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:55.939
even the Einsteins of the world, you know, they

463
00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:59.930
need an economy, they need scientific equipment, they need,

464
00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:02.780
um, you know, the artists need paintbrushes, and roads

465
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.680
to drive on, and markets to sell their Their

466
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.949
artwork on. And all of that takes the work

467
00:22:07.949 --> 00:22:10.750
of everybody in the community. And in that sense,

468
00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:13.040
it is really just the individual is sort of

469
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.079
the last piece of the of a very, very

470
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:17.439
large puzzle. And it's an important piece. I don't

471
00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:20.119
think we should um say that it's exactly the

472
00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:24.079
same as what everybody else is doing. Um, BUT

473
00:22:24.079 --> 00:22:25.839
we should recognize you're absolutely right that we need

474
00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:28.599
to recognize that there's, it's really a communal product

475
00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:31.430
in every single case. It's hard to imagine. Uh,

476
00:22:31.469 --> 00:22:36.619
HARD to think of any actual historical, um, Achievement

477
00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:40.699
of any kind that's worthwhile, that was created by

478
00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:43.819
somebody who wasn't relying on a humongous network of

479
00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:45.089
support in the in the world.

480
00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:50.699
So one thing that we attribute to many people

481
00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:54.459
who we consider important is fame, their fame, the

482
00:22:54.459 --> 00:22:58.660
fact that they are famous people, particularly when it

483
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.420
comes to fame, is that something that people should

484
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.939
strive for? I mean, is fame really something that

485
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:07.449
matters that much?

486
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.150
Yeah, it's a good question. In my view. So,

487
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.199
I do want to just say that I, I

488
00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:15.390
do think we should discuss fame and importance separately.

489
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.189
Because you can imagine somebody doing something really important,

490
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.479
um, like, like creating artwork, or, uh, maybe they

491
00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:24.430
did a scientific, made some scientific discovery, but their

492
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.280
boss took credit for it, or something like that.

493
00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:28.060
I mean, that's actually happened many times in the

494
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.630
history of science. And with very, you know, like,

495
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.719
um, Um, in, in many, in many cases. And

496
00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:36.890
so, um, I'm more concerned about importance than fame,

497
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.760
but let's talk about fame for a second, because

498
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.479
it is obviously closely related. You know, in my

499
00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:44.109
view, the reasons, some people seem to really want

500
00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:46.369
adoration. They seem to want to be famous just

501
00:23:46.369 --> 00:23:49.079
for the sake of being famous. And I struggle

502
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:50.479
to relate to that. I mean, I guess there's

503
00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:53.160
a piece of me that gets that you want

504
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.694
everybody that you. To you. But, uh, I don't,

505
00:23:57.805 --> 00:24:00.005
I'm not totally drawn to that. I am, however,

506
00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:01.885
drawn to a lot of the side benefits of

507
00:24:01.885 --> 00:24:03.844
being famous. So, you know, like a lot of

508
00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.484
money can, a lot of wealth can come from

509
00:24:05.484 --> 00:24:08.125
being famous. And I think it's perfectly rational to

510
00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:09.564
want that, or other things, you know, it can

511
00:24:09.564 --> 00:24:12.594
give you access to social networks that you wouldn't

512
00:24:12.594 --> 00:24:14.714
have access to. Famous people like to, you know,

513
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:17.285
eat dinner with other famous people. And, uh, if

514
00:24:17.285 --> 00:24:19.290
you want to interact with Famous people, it helps

515
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.609
to be famous yourself. So I think that there's,

516
00:24:21.689 --> 00:24:25.969
you know, there are important downstream knock-on effects of

517
00:24:25.969 --> 00:24:29.329
fame that are worth remembering. But fame as a

518
00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:30.849
good in itself is really hard for me to

519
00:24:30.849 --> 00:24:33.650
relate to. And fame has a ton of downsides

520
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.420
that I personally, not everybody, but I personally find

521
00:24:36.729 --> 00:24:39.209
um distasteful. Like, I really value my privacy, and

522
00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:41.560
I really value my alone time. I really value.

523
00:24:41.935 --> 00:24:44.295
Being able to walk down the street anonymous. I

524
00:24:44.295 --> 00:24:45.895
can't imagine what it would be like to be

525
00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:47.974
one of these very famous people who have to

526
00:24:47.974 --> 00:24:51.175
give up that entire piece of life, and they

527
00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:53.295
trade that for fame. That's, that's a really hard

528
00:24:53.295 --> 00:24:56.454
calculation for me to understand, especially when you then

529
00:24:56.454 --> 00:24:58.574
add in, you know, it can compromise your mental

530
00:24:58.574 --> 00:25:01.175
health and your safety. Um, YOU know, there there's

531
00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:02.854
really a lot of risks in fame, but I

532
00:25:02.854 --> 00:25:04.795
do see some of the instrumental benefits like wealth

533
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:06.574
and access and whatnot.

534
00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:11.079
Uh, WHAT about wealth? I mean, is that something

535
00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:15.489
that goes associated with being an important person and

536
00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:20.449
does it matter from the kind of cosmic perspective

537
00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:24.530
we're looking at uh things in your book, for

538
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.530
example, or not?

539
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.439
Um, SO, let's take that last question. No, it

540
00:25:29.439 --> 00:25:32.270
does not matter for cosmic importance. The wealthiest person

541
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.099
on the planet, Elon Musk, it's still not important

542
00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:37.520
on a cosmic scale, um, on my argument. And

543
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.719
the argument why, let me just briefly, um, you

544
00:25:40.719 --> 00:25:42.800
know, try to sum that up real quickly. The

545
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.410
argument why we're not important on a cosmic scale

546
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.599
is that in terms of what we could be,

547
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.920
you know, when we look up at the stars

548
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.199
and think about how tiny we are and how

549
00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:52.569
little of a difference we can make to them,

550
00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:55.314
you know. Universe. What we're doing essentially is we're

551
00:25:55.314 --> 00:25:58.694
we're we're not denying our value entirely. Um, Guy

552
00:25:58.694 --> 00:26:01.834
Kahane has a really powerful and important argument that

553
00:26:01.834 --> 00:26:04.005
if we're the only sentient or conscious creatures in

554
00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:06.805
the universe, then we're really important. We're adding maybe

555
00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:08.724
all of the value to the universe. I mean,

556
00:26:08.805 --> 00:26:10.604
I would disagree with that, but you can see

557
00:26:10.604 --> 00:26:12.084
where he's coming from, that if it's a, if,

558
00:26:12.114 --> 00:26:13.885
if the rest of the universe is just an

559
00:26:13.885 --> 00:26:16.435
empty field out there with some rocks floating around,

560
00:26:16.765 --> 00:26:19.750
um, then we matter a lot. But I want

561
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.550
to push back against stopping there. I wanna say,

562
00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:24.589
well, even though we matter a lot in terms

563
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:27.550
of what's in the universe, we still are tiny

564
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.790
and weak, and very short-lived in a universe like

565
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.109
ours. And so there's a sense in which you

566
00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:35.550
say, I'm not what I could have been, you

567
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.630
know, I'm not a god or a hero. And

568
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.912
so, going back to your question about wealth, You

569
00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:42.302
know, the most wealthy people, the most famous people.

570
00:26:42.593 --> 00:26:45.432
Somebody like Elon Musk has a lot of um

571
00:26:45.432 --> 00:26:47.512
stature, right now, he's got a lot of power

572
00:26:47.512 --> 00:26:49.633
in my country. Um, HE also has a lot

573
00:26:49.633 --> 00:26:52.833
of power globally, but he has very, very little

574
00:26:52.833 --> 00:26:55.233
power to change anything in the universe. I mean,

575
00:26:55.312 --> 00:26:58.152
even if he succeeds at, you know, having a

576
00:26:58.152 --> 00:27:02.676
very successful space exploration. Company. It still barely scratches

577
00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:05.395
the surface of a tiny, tiny, tiny corner of

578
00:27:05.395 --> 00:27:08.985
the galaxy, which itself is just one tiny piece

579
00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:12.365
of the broader universe. And, um, in that sense,

580
00:27:12.635 --> 00:27:15.076
um, yeah, all the money in the world literally

581
00:27:15.076 --> 00:27:17.836
doesn't make us cosmically significant, even if it makes

582
00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.436
you globally significant or significant in your community.

583
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.540
Something that some people worry about is that they

584
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.819
are remembered forever. But is that even possible? Is

585
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:34.140
it possible for anyone to really ever be remembered

586
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.770
forever?

587
00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:37.369
Um, I, that's a great question. I'm curious to

588
00:27:37.369 --> 00:27:38.819
hear what you think. Let me, let me, let

589
00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:39.900
me give you an answer, then you tell me

590
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.280
what you think. So I don't think so. I'm

591
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.680
skeptical about that. For one thing is, if we

592
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.040
really mean forever, every single person is gonna get

593
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.060
swamped by all the noise there. There's gonna be

594
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.599
a lot of, you know, over the eons, there

595
00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:54.199
will be a lot of people who contribute a

596
00:27:54.199 --> 00:27:57.319
lot, and no one nobody will be remembered literally

597
00:27:57.319 --> 00:28:01.040
forever, um, assuming that somehow there are rememberers to

598
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.005
go on. Forever, um, that there's, you know, sentient

599
00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:07.255
consciousness of some kind. I can't imagine that, um,

600
00:28:07.344 --> 00:28:09.584
people will be remembered, except maybe in some trivial

601
00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.464
sense, like, their data is stored somewhere. And so

602
00:28:12.464 --> 00:28:15.025
there's a record of them. But nobody is actually

603
00:28:15.025 --> 00:28:18.385
cognizant of them, uh, on this argument. And the

604
00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:19.944
other piece of it is that I think we

605
00:28:19.944 --> 00:28:23.650
should remember is that We could never have proof

606
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.729
that somebody can be remembered forever because anybody who's

607
00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:29.849
been forgotten, has been forgotten. And so by definition,

608
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.609
we don't know about that. Like there's no way

609
00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:34.890
to say we've remembered everybody who was important in

610
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.010
human history, because we don't know the people that

611
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.489
have been forgotten because they've been forgotten. I don't

612
00:28:39.489 --> 00:28:40.729
know. What do you think? Is that is that

613
00:28:40.729 --> 00:28:41.599
plausible to you?

614
00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:44.500
Yeah, I agree with that. And I also think

615
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.459
that at least according to the best predictions we

616
00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:50.670
have from physics, I don't think that any of

617
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:55.380
the possible future scenarios for the universe accommodates the

618
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.619
possibility of there being sentient life forever. So I

619
00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:02.859
don't think it's even physically possible for someone to

620
00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:04.260
be remembered forever.

621
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.930
Right, you'd have to have some sort of uh

622
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.770
religious view, right, that has a God out there

623
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.339
who, who lives out a sentience outside of that

624
00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:14.209
that physical world that you're talking about, right?

625
00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:20.400
Mhm. Yes. So, are the lives of important people

626
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.520
better than ordinary lives?

627
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.439
OK, so this is where they're trying to take

628
00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:28.630
a strong stand and that stand is no. Now

629
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.829
I mean something specific by that. I mean, it

630
00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:34.060
doesn't benefit the person who's important to be important.

631
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.420
Um, IT does benefit society. We should be very

632
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.109
grateful that there are Einsteins and, you know, amazing

633
00:29:39.109 --> 00:29:43.630
musicians, and amazing political leaders. Um, ALL of that

634
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.630
is something that society benefits from. But does it

635
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.750
benefit the leader or the politician or the scientist

636
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.949
who makes this amazing contribution? I argue no, and

637
00:29:52.949 --> 00:29:54.670
this is where I'm really pushing back against the

638
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.469
Ted Williams side of the debate. And by the

639
00:29:56.469 --> 00:29:58.719
way, I'm, I'm following. You know, in the book

640
00:29:58.719 --> 00:30:00.849
I, I, I purposely say I'm following the artist

641
00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.930
Frida Kahlo, who said everybody wants to be the

642
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.410
grand coa the, you know, the, the, the big

643
00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.209
shot, and um she, she does not attracted to

644
00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:12.459
that. Uh, AND so I'm with her on this

645
00:30:12.459 --> 00:30:15.380
one. And, and so, let's talk about why for

646
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.920
a minute. I mean, you might think that being

647
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.819
important, in fact, many people say that many people

648
00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:22.300
who work on meaning in life, do think that

649
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.089
being important contributes to meaning in life. But I

650
00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:27.540
argue that it doesn't. It doesn't contribute more, I

651
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.300
should say, than ordinary pursuits. So a scientist who

652
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.810
makes an amazing discovery, you know, an Einstein or

653
00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:37.650
or Or Newton or somebody like that, is not

654
00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:41.689
um benefiting their own life more than the scientists

655
00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:44.910
who um It's just doing ordinary run of the

656
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.510
mill work that nobody cares that much about. And

657
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.430
it's, it's fine work, but it's not, you know,

658
00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:53.300
world-changing like an Einstein or a Newton would be.

659
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.430
Now, again, a lot of people disagree with this,

660
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.069
but I want to insist that there's not more

661
00:30:57.069 --> 00:30:58.390
meaning in life, and I have a whole, of

662
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.829
course, set of arguments why. But just to go

663
00:31:00.829 --> 00:31:02.869
big picture for a second, in addition to not

664
00:31:02.869 --> 00:31:05.150
adding meaning in life, I also argue that it

665
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.030
doesn't contribute to um our well-being, the other aspects

666
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.790
of our own personal interests that we care about.

667
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.829
It doesn't, so for example, a lot of people

668
00:31:13.829 --> 00:31:15.829
think that there's value in achievement. And so you

669
00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:20.359
might think, well, Einstein achieved more than the ordinary

670
00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:23.750
scientist, and so he um benefited more than the

671
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:27.430
ordinary scientists in terms of achievement value. But as

672
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.969
people who work on achievement note, that's not actually

673
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:33.339
accurate. The value that we get from achievement isn't

674
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.910
correlated with the size of the achievement or the

675
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.030
importance of it. So if you just, you know,

676
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.670
run a marathon or you build a cabin, or

677
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.790
you raise a child, all of those achievements can

678
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.540
be as rationally demanding, can be as challenging as,

679
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.989
you know, curing cancer or Figuring out the puzzles

680
00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:56.339
of quantum mechanics. So, in terms of just um

681
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.839
the value we get out of achievement, or flourishing,

682
00:31:59.949 --> 00:32:01.390
or all the other things we seem to want

683
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.060
out of life, um, the argument of the book,

684
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.670
one of the two main arguments of the book

685
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.150
is that we actually don't advance those self-interests, those

686
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.550
personal values by being important, um. More than we

687
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.589
do by doing the same things in an ordinary

688
00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:18.310
way. So you can't advance your values through important

689
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.630
projects, but you can just as well advance them

690
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.709
through ordinary projects as well. So, in my view,

691
00:32:23.869 --> 00:32:25.819
no, it is not good for us to be,

692
00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:27.349
it's not bad for us, but it's also not

693
00:32:27.349 --> 00:32:29.430
good for us to be important. And this is

694
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.469
one of its supposed to be one of the

695
00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:35.910
liberating things of the book. Is that, you know,

696
00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:38.719
we walk around to be important and people really

697
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:41.189
even hurt others because they're trying to be important.

698
00:32:41.239 --> 00:32:43.540
They create injustice because they're trying to be important.

699
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.869
Uh, AND all of that is pointless if this

700
00:32:46.869 --> 00:32:49.119
argument is right. If the argument's right, we shouldn't

701
00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:51.069
be striving for importance any more than to be

702
00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.790
ordinary, except for when there are rewards attached, like

703
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.949
more wealth maybe or more access to other goods.

704
00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.869
Um, THEN there's that kind of reason. But just

705
00:32:57.869 --> 00:32:59.790
being important itself isn't all it's cracked up to

706
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.229
be, no.

707
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.489
And what good is there to be found in

708
00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:06.219
an ordinary life?

709
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.859
Well, that's where we get back to the tyranny

710
00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:11.060
of values. So if we assume against the nihilist,

711
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.739
but with our opponents who believes in significance and

712
00:33:13.739 --> 00:33:16.589
being significant, if we assume that there is value.

713
00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:20.849
Um, THEN a whole range of options opens up,

714
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.540
right? Do we want to try to be really

715
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.369
important? Do we want to be small? Um, SO

716
00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:27.930
like Saul Smolansky has these wonderful arguments about how

717
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.010
you, you don't want to be a tiger, you'd

718
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.089
rather be a house cat, because the tiger gets

719
00:33:32.089 --> 00:33:34.819
hunted. The tiger's perceived as a threat. The house

720
00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:37.589
gets pampered and fed and everybody takes care of

721
00:33:37.589 --> 00:33:39.869
it, and that's it. And so, um, there's a

722
00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:42.109
lot of reasons to think that on a, on

723
00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:45.189
a social level, you would rather be, um, ordinary,

724
00:33:45.329 --> 00:33:48.890
as opposed to important. The additional piece that I'm

725
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.869
trying to add to that in this book is

726
00:33:50.869 --> 00:33:55.209
that freedom from the tyranny of value. That we,

727
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.979
we stock ourselves. We hunt ourselves when we're worried

728
00:33:58.979 --> 00:34:01.939
about how good of a choice we're making, when

729
00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:03.939
we worry about whether we have the wrong priorities

730
00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:06.339
or not. And it really can be a relief

731
00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:08.300
to say, well, I might be making a mistake

732
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.340
here, but I'm not that important, so it just

733
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.899
doesn't matter that much. And the more important I

734
00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:15.610
get, it's actually gonna matter more. So somebody who

735
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.010
has a lot of power on it, so they

736
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.010
have global importance. Like, I have a little bit

737
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.489
of importance in my community. I don't have global

738
00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.889
importance. Somebody who does had better worry that they're

739
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.600
making the right choices, much more than I need

740
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.739
to, because I'm just, you know, a, a small

741
00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:33.590
All time person, an ordinary person, and the stakes

742
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.790
aren't high. And so I think we all need

743
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.270
to recognize that having those stakes reduced is to

744
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.750
our benefit. It provides us with freedom, and I'm

745
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.550
a huge believer in all the various kinds of

746
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.149
freedom. I want freedom from government tyranny. I want

747
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:49.310
freedom from algorithms that tech companies are putting upon

748
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.149
us. I want freedom from others coercing me, but

749
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:55.020
I also want freedom from value dominating my life.

750
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.925
I want some liberation from that. Because it can

751
00:34:56.925 --> 00:35:00.044
be really um exhausting and powerful. And I think

752
00:35:00.044 --> 00:35:02.445
it's wonderful to, to get some distance from that.

753
00:35:02.554 --> 00:35:04.284
Now, in saying that, you can't run away from

754
00:35:04.284 --> 00:35:06.604
it entirely if we assume against the nihilists that

755
00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.604
there is value, you still have to worry that

756
00:35:08.604 --> 00:35:10.844
you're making morally right choices, and you still wanna

757
00:35:11.245 --> 00:35:13.725
be, you know, having true beliefs instead of false

758
00:35:13.725 --> 00:35:16.084
beliefs, and you still want to make the right

759
00:35:16.084 --> 00:35:18.324
choice, even about something small, like what to have

760
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:22.969
for dinner tonight. But it just doesn't matter. But

761
00:35:22.969 --> 00:35:24.610
if you get it wrong when you are an

762
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.159
ordinary person. And that's what I think that even

763
00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:29.560
the most powerful people in our society should remember

764
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.250
is that, you know, they're not cosmically important and

765
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.850
that can reduce the stakes um and the amount

766
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.080
of pressure they walk around with.

767
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.060
So at a certain point in your book, you

768
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.780
claim that there are things that are worthwhile in

769
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.939
themselves. What does that mean for something to be

770
00:35:47.939 --> 00:35:52.580
worthwhile in itself? And could you give us examples

771
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.179
of things like that?

772
00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.699
Sure, again, I don't really have a built out

773
00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.179
theory about this that's gonna be very exciting, but

774
00:36:02.179 --> 00:36:04.020
I do think, so for example, if we assume

775
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.979
that value is real, I think that human beings

776
00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:09.340
have a moral status in themselves. I think, you

777
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.939
know, I'm a, I'm a conscient about this sort

778
00:36:10.939 --> 00:36:13.379
of thing, but even if you're a utilitarian, and

779
00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:16.100
you think that, um, you know, each person counts

780
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.540
towards the hedonic calculus of some of the utilitarian

781
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.120
calculus of some kind, um. You know, that's acknowledging

782
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.659
that we matter in and of ourselves. Um, I

783
00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:26.719
guess some people would argue against that with utilitarianism

784
00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:28.840
and say, well, that just makes the individual person

785
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.000
serving that greater happiness total, um, whereas a robust

786
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.439
you would say more that, um, it's truly in

787
00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:37.239
ourselves that we have value and, and maybe that's

788
00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:39.745
part of why. I'm a contian. But, um, I

789
00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:41.745
think that a wide range of ethical views will

790
00:36:41.745 --> 00:36:45.665
acknowledge that we have the, um, some standing, and

791
00:36:45.665 --> 00:36:47.745
we deserve some sort of consideration just by virtue

792
00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:49.905
of who we are. Um, I also think that

793
00:36:49.905 --> 00:36:52.225
there's a wide range of value out there. So

794
00:36:52.225 --> 00:36:54.735
I think there's aesthetic value. I think that, you

795
00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:56.935
know, there's I, I, I live in the American

796
00:36:56.935 --> 00:36:59.304
West where one of my favorite ways to spend

797
00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:01.314
my free time is to go out in nature

798
00:37:01.314 --> 00:37:03.784
and, you know, stare at the Pacific Ocean or

799
00:37:03.784 --> 00:37:05.425
hike up in the, in the beautiful mountains that

800
00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:08.540
we have in the West. And um that has

801
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.060
aesthetic value to me. And so does the music

802
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.570
that I listen to, and so on. And, um,

803
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.810
pursuing that, I think can be worthwhile in itself.

804
00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:17.459
And I think this is important back to the

805
00:37:17.459 --> 00:37:19.860
meaning of life question, because I think, you know,

806
00:37:19.939 --> 00:37:21.659
I'm one of, I'm, I'm one of these people

807
00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:23.820
who's a hybridist about meaning in life in the

808
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.699
sense that I think to get meaning out of

809
00:37:25.699 --> 00:37:27.270
some project, like going for a hike in the

810
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.479
mountains or working on your Your job or whatever

811
00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:33.719
it is, your relationships, um, that we need to

812
00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:37.979
have both subjective attraction to that, and, um, you

813
00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:40.800
know, Susan Wolff memorably says it's where subjective attraction

814
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.919
meets objective attractiveness, that there's something objectively worthwhile about

815
00:37:44.919 --> 00:37:47.820
the pursuit we're doing, whether that's hiking or spending

816
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.080
time with a loved one, or working on some

817
00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.270
project. So, in all these cases, I think that

818
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.189
there is objective value, and it's, you know, it's

819
00:37:56.189 --> 00:37:58.350
our opportunity that we get to latch on to

820
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.629
that whenever we can. That's the optimist in me.

821
00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:02.189
Um, SO those are the kinds of things I

822
00:38:02.189 --> 00:38:04.479
have in mind, um, when I, when I talk

823
00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:06.479
about, you know, something being valuable in itself.

824
00:38:07.929 --> 00:38:14.290
And does our cosmic insignificance impact life's most important

825
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.719
values in any way?

826
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:19.750
Uh, NOT, I don't know, not when it comes

827
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.229
to, uh, uh, again, prudential value, to what's in

828
00:38:23.229 --> 00:38:25.860
your own interest. It does not affect your well-being,

829
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.149
it does not affect your meaning in life, and

830
00:38:28.149 --> 00:38:30.270
that's one of, you know, the maybe the most

831
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.870
important piece of the argument to me in the

832
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.030
book, is that I want to, you know, I

833
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.870
want, I want to make the case that we

834
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:41.949
can all get maximally served with our personal value.

835
00:38:42.469 --> 00:38:45.310
Whether we're, you know, ordinary or important, and remember

836
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.669
we're all cosmically unimportant, but that doesn't degrade our

837
00:38:48.669 --> 00:38:51.750
meaning in life at all, or our well-being at

838
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.310
all, I argue. Now, of course, again, many people

839
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.590
disagree. Many people think that there's importance, uh, that

840
00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.389
importance contributes to meaning in life. Other people think

841
00:39:00.389 --> 00:39:03.250
importance has its own final. THAT it's just another

842
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.399
thing that's good for us. In addition to well-being

843
00:39:06.399 --> 00:39:08.850
and meaning, we should want importance for its own

844
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.370
sake. Um, I think that's wrong. I also think

845
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.639
it doesn't really engage the debate I'm interested in,

846
00:39:13.649 --> 00:39:16.209
which is, what do you say when you meet

847
00:39:16.209 --> 00:39:19.199
Frida Kahlo and she's arguing with Ted Williams about,

848
00:39:19.409 --> 00:39:21.129
you know, should we care about being important or

849
00:39:21.129 --> 00:39:24.260
not? I, I think once we engage that debate,

850
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.969
we have to provide some reason for being important.

851
00:39:27.179 --> 00:39:29.100
And so we can't just say it's, it has

852
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.379
final value, it's, it's, it's like pleasure or knowledge

853
00:39:32.379 --> 00:39:35.060
or something, and that we can't really explain why

854
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.090
it has value because it's final value. So, um,

855
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.419
yeah, I, I think that all the value we

856
00:39:41.419 --> 00:39:44.010
should care about can be had in the totally

857
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.580
ordinary, unimportant life.

858
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.429
You mentioned meaning there. What is meaning when we're

859
00:39:51.429 --> 00:39:55.209
talking about life? What makes life meaningful?

860
00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:00.129
Right, so this is where I side with Susan

861
00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:02.120
Wolf and a bunch of other people and think

862
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.489
that it's uh life is meaningful when we have

863
00:40:04.729 --> 00:40:07.770
a sufficient amount of subjective draw to things that

864
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.409
are actually objectively valuable. You know, a number of

865
00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:12.449
people only care about the subjective piece. They think

866
00:40:12.449 --> 00:40:15.969
if you're engaged and fulfilled. Emotionally or some other

867
00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:18.810
way by your projects and your relationships, then that's

868
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.729
enough for meaning in life. But I and a

869
00:40:20.729 --> 00:40:22.800
lot of other people think that that doesn't account

870
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.969
for all the mistakes people can make, including myself,

871
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.530
by the way, about what's important and what's not.

872
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.810
When you look back on your life and you

873
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.739
think, oh, I was wasting my time with that,

874
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.689
um, or, or I overvalued that project, or some

875
00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:36.689
or I spent too much time on my career,

876
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.199
not enough on my relationships, or something like that.

877
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.860
Um, THAT'S conceding that it's not just about subjects.

878
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:49.169
FULFILLMENT. It's also about um having uh tapping your

879
00:40:49.169 --> 00:40:52.770
subjective attractions into the right objective values. Now, I

880
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.120
also think the objective values is not enough by

881
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.409
itself, because um I think that, you know, John

882
00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:00.689
Stuart Mill is is a much discussed example of

883
00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:02.610
somebody who went through a meaning of a crisis

884
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.370
and meaning, because he had all these ends that

885
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.010
he thought were really important, and he was really

886
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.389
trying to do these. Important works like lifting people

887
00:41:09.389 --> 00:41:12.629
out of poverty and whatnot. And, um, at one

888
00:41:12.629 --> 00:41:15.260
point, he'd lost his, he, he didn't care about

889
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.189
it, but he still thought it was an important

890
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:20.270
project, objectively speaking, but he said the end ceased

891
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.110
to charm. It no longer motivated him, and no

892
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.429
longer excited his emotions or his cares. And that

893
00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:27.870
was a real crisis for him. And I think

894
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.830
that that, I mean, I and a number of

895
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.750
other people think that the best way to To

896
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.870
characterize what Mil was going through was he he

897
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.669
was lacking meaning in his life, not just a

898
00:41:35.669 --> 00:41:38.159
feeling of meaning, but he was missing meaning. So

899
00:41:38.159 --> 00:41:41.070
I think we really need to connect subjective attractiveness

900
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.709
to objective value, and that that's when we will

901
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:46.350
get meaning in life. Now, one thing that I

902
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:48.469
add to that, so that's the hybrid view of

903
00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:52.209
meaning in life, objective and subjective put together. Um,

904
00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:54.959
ONE question that that view faces is how to

905
00:41:54.959 --> 00:41:57.729
balance the two. So Cheshire Calhoun has this argument

906
00:41:57.729 --> 00:42:00.000
against the hybrid view that, you know, how do

907
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.919
you, how do you rank the subjective and the

908
00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:04.840
objective. And I have um a very specific answer

909
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.679
to that question. In my view, there's a minimal

910
00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:11.229
threshold of objective value. You that something has to

911
00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.550
reach to contribute to meaning in life, whether that's

912
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.510
a relationship or a work project or an AT

913
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.739
like activity of some kind, um, whatever it is,

914
00:42:19.989 --> 00:42:22.830
uh, it has to meet this minimal threshold of

915
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.760
objective value. But then how much meaning it contributes

916
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.870
to your life, once it's at that level, doesn't

917
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.790
go up or down with more or less objective

918
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.070
value. Instead, it goes up or down with how

919
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.739
much subjective attraction you have to it. So if

920
00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:39.050
I have a pretty ordinary low stakes, um, project,

921
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:40.620
you know, I'm, I'm a, I'm a cook at

922
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.139
a local restaurant and I enjoy making food for

923
00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:47.020
people. And I really enjoy it. That can actually

924
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.050
provide my life with more meaning than Mil got

925
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.820
from doing much more consequential work, but that he

926
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.520
wasn't subjectively attracted to at all for that period

927
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.510
of. His life. That was lacking meaning for him

928
00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.860
because of the subjective value missing. And so really

929
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.500
subjective attraction, even though I'm, I'm a hybridist who

930
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.540
values both the objective and the subjective, the subjective,

931
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.250
in my view, does a lot of the work

932
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.929
in determining how much meaning we get out of

933
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.929
the objectively valuable, um, um, projects that we, um,

934
00:43:15.939 --> 00:43:16.750
immerse ourselves in.

935
00:43:18.449 --> 00:43:22.330
If our lives are an important, can't that be

936
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.879
psychological, psychologically liberating, for example, if that's the case,

937
00:43:27.929 --> 00:43:30.879
we do not really have to worry much about

938
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.330
what we are able to achieve in life. Right.

939
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.070
Yeah, and that's exactly freedom from the tyranny of

940
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.389
value. That's one aspect of it. And yes, I

941
00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:43.229
think that's a tremendous value that you, nobody out

942
00:43:43.229 --> 00:43:45.550
there should worry that, you know, I'm just an

943
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.229
ordinary. Most of us are working ordinary pursuits, right?

944
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:50.590
We, and not just in our work, but in

945
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.070
our hobbies and our relationships. We're not out there

946
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.149
doing extraordinarily important things. We're doing important things in

947
00:43:56.149 --> 00:43:59.350
our communities, maybe you're teaching. Um, YOU know, young

948
00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.489
people, or you're a nurse, or you are fixing

949
00:44:02.489 --> 00:44:05.510
people's cars, or, you know, building homes or whatever

950
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.149
it is, and that's contributing something. But to, to,

951
00:44:09.229 --> 00:44:12.750
to be upset by that as not making a

952
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.310
humongous difference in the world is uh a a

953
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.215
mistaken reaction, I, I believe. I believe that we

954
00:44:19.215 --> 00:44:22.094
should look at those ordinary pursuits as as beneficial

955
00:44:22.094 --> 00:44:25.614
for us as the more important pursuits. And of

956
00:44:25.614 --> 00:44:29.014
course, remember always that even the most important pursuits

957
00:44:29.014 --> 00:44:32.534
on this planet aren't really cosmically important, and they

958
00:44:32.534 --> 00:44:34.975
can't be because of the size of the cosmos.

959
00:44:35.094 --> 00:44:37.175
And so, and and the and the smallness of

960
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:41.760
us. And so, We're really not ever going to

961
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.439
achieve the kind of importance that we would want

962
00:44:44.439 --> 00:44:48.639
to, if we thought that being important was crucial

963
00:44:48.879 --> 00:44:52.199
to our, our, our well-being or our personal interests.

964
00:44:52.479 --> 00:44:55.110
So that's out of reach for starters, that goal,

965
00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:59.699
and, and more importantly, It's really not in our

966
00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:02.739
interest. It advances nothing for us individually to be

967
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:05.659
important. Again, I do think society should reward important

968
00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:08.179
endeavors. It's good that we're getting cures for diseases.

969
00:45:08.909 --> 00:45:12.560
And beautiful works of art and justice movements, like

970
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.080
all of that is improving the world. And so

971
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.000
society should reward those people with maybe wealth or

972
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.280
some other kind of rewards so that we incentivize

973
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.860
that. Although I think it's really tricky. There are

974
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.320
um other books out there that talk about the

975
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.479
pitfalls of those kinds of rewards, so we have

976
00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:30.580
to be careful. Um, AT the same time, just

977
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.469
in terms of, of our personal interests, the only

978
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.800
reward that comes with being important are the socially

979
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.639
attached benefits. Importance itself is not going to benefit

980
00:45:39.639 --> 00:45:41.790
us, and so yes, it's, it is beneficial to

981
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.159
us to walk around and remember that. It just

982
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.050
doesn't matter that much what we choose to do.

983
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.870
And also an ordinary life allows for us to

984
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.840
relieve ourselves of the anxiety and worry and and

985
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.389
worry of becoming someone important.

986
00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:01.719
Correct. That's right. That's right. That's a huge amount

987
00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:04.449
of pressure to take off your shoulders. Absolutely. I,

988
00:46:05.879 --> 00:46:08.639
yeah, absolutely, great point that we, that, that also,

989
00:46:08.729 --> 00:46:10.040
you know, I mean, I think a lot of

990
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.669
people, at least a lot of people in high

991
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:18.379
Uh, achieving high ambition, uh, social networks really do

992
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.929
worry about that and are constantly comparing themselves to

993
00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:25.129
their peers and rivals, and, uh, trying to achieve

994
00:46:25.129 --> 00:46:28.850
some ideal that's probably unachievable. And if it turns

995
00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:31.169
out that it wouldn't even benefit you to achieve

996
00:46:31.169 --> 00:46:33.290
it if you could get it, that can be

997
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.209
a tremendous relief to not have to worry about

998
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:36.290
that anymore, for sure.

999
00:46:37.689 --> 00:46:41.000
So one last question then, do you think that

1000
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:46.850
there could be a risk here of promoting mediocrity

1001
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.320
instead of just an ordinary life?

1002
00:46:51.399 --> 00:46:53.260
I do think that's a risk, and that's why

1003
00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.780
I think society should remember to um reward uh

1004
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.590
people who achieve great things beyond mediocrity. Because again,

1005
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.050
we as a society, we all benefit from extraordinary

1006
00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:09.739
value contributions, and we should try to uh promote

1007
00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:13.020
those as much as possible. But in terms of

1008
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.260
celebrating mediocrity, I think we should be really careful

1009
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.699
about that because in my view, you still should

1010
00:47:18.699 --> 00:47:20.750
try to find meaning in life. And you still

1011
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.310
should try to achieve all you can achieve, and

1012
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.350
you still should try to flourish as much as

1013
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.629
you can flourish. And so, for the in if

1014
00:47:28.629 --> 00:47:31.189
by mediocrity we mean you're only gonna contribute half

1015
00:47:31.189 --> 00:47:33.550
of what you can. No, that is not my

1016
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.189
view. I don't think that my view would would

1017
00:47:35.189 --> 00:47:37.669
license that. My view just says that if the

1018
00:47:37.669 --> 00:47:40.629
most you can achieve is ordinary, and maybe you'd

1019
00:47:40.629 --> 00:47:43.830
say mediocre on some other standard, um, that that's

1020
00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.580
not bad for you. Uh, IF that's your, that's

1021
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.379
the ceiling on your capacity, whether that capacity is

1022
00:47:49.379 --> 00:47:52.060
innate to us, or it's because of luck or

1023
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.899
social circumstances, or what whatever the the origin story

1024
00:47:55.899 --> 00:48:01.699
of the limits on our capacities, uh. Yeah, it's,

1025
00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:04.340
it's not celebrating mediocrity in the sense that it's

1026
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.060
giving us license to, you know, sit around and

1027
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.500
watch cartoons for the rest of our lives. It's,

1028
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.340
it's still telling us, you know, go out and

1029
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.580
achieve what you can. It's just remember that it

1030
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.860
doesn't matter what your achievements end up being in

1031
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.540
terms of your personal value, as long as you

1032
00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.139
are achieving something, as long as you're securing some

1033
00:48:22.139 --> 00:48:23.620
achievement that's within your grasp.

1034
00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:28.790
Great. So, the book is again the significance impulse

1035
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:32.399
on the importance of our cosmic and importance. I'm

1036
00:48:32.399 --> 00:48:34.590
leaving a link to it in the description of

1037
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.580
the interview. And Doctor Glasgow, just before we go,

1038
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.189
where can people find your work on the internet?

1039
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.500
Well, it's, you know, the books are available at

1040
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.610
all reputable bookstores, um, so find the books there,

1041
00:48:48.939 --> 00:48:51.310
um, and also just by googling my name, Joshua

1042
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.300
Glasgow, it'll take you to my web page which

1043
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.620
has links to my books and other articles that

1044
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:56.969
I've written.

1045
00:48:58.479 --> 00:49:00.879
Great. So I'm also leaving a link to that

1046
00:49:00.879 --> 00:49:03.399
in the description of the interview and thank you

1047
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:05.479
