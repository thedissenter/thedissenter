00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.049
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.960
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.050
joined by Doctor Jeff mcdonald. He's a professor in

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.880
the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.670
in Canada. And today we're focusing mostly on his

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.750
research on the psychology of singlehood. He's been working

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.889
on the intersection of single hood and sexuality and

8
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.469
he is also trying to understand what predicts well

9
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.670
being in single hood. And so we're going to

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.439
talk about those topics and some other related things

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.189
associated with the topic of single hood. So Dr

12
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.860
mcdonald, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

13
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:39.389
have you on.

14
00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:40.869
Uh Thanks for having me.

15
00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.080
So let's perhaps start with the most basic question

16
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.750
here because maybe it would perhaps seem to be

17
00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:51.479
an obvious one, but maybe it's not so obvious.

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.349
So, what is singlehood or at least how do

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200
you define it in your research? And by the

20
00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:02.599
way, do you approach it mostly as involuntary and

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.389
unwanted or as a voluntary phenomenon or both?

22
00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:10.870
Yeah. So in terms of the definition of singlehood,

23
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.529
I mean, I wouldn't say it the, the field

24
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.690
of single hood studies is very young, you know,

25
00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:17.550
like maybe five or 10 years or something like

26
00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.489
that. And so, you know, I wouldn't say that

27
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.269
we've reached a consensus necessarily. Um But I would

28
00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:26.220
say that, you know, probably the most important distinction

29
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.959
to be thinking about is that sometimes when people

30
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.120
talk about single people, what they mean are unmarried

31
00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:33.470
people who could still be in a dating relationship

32
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.639
or something like that. Generally speaking in my lab,

33
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.269
we define single people as people who are not

34
00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.830
in a committed romantic relationship. Um You know, in

35
00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:45.069
terms of how we do that in our research,

36
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.660
we let people define that for themselves. I mean,

37
00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:50.260
obviously there's some gray area there. I think the

38
00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.839
kids like to talk about situationships now, for example,

39
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.800
you know, there's friends with benefits, there's that kind

40
00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.870
of thing. And so there's definitely gray area between

41
00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.519
being single and not being single. And so at

42
00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.250
least for the time being, we just, when we

43
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.309
ask people to sign up for studies, you know,

44
00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.229
do you define yourself as single? Um We do

45
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.949
typically in our research, uh ask people to only

46
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.270
sign up if they've been single for six months.

47
00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.350
So that like some of that gray area has

48
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.770
worked itself out, maybe people think they're broken up

49
00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.699
but it's not really broken up or whatever. Um

50
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.229
So yeah, I mean, I think it's perfectly valid

51
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.679
to be studying unmarried people. Typically we do it

52
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.339
as like people who are not in a committed

53
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.190
uh romantic relationship. I mean, in terms of, in

54
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.619
terms of voluntary or involuntary, I mean, like you

55
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.059
suggested in our lab, we very much want to

56
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.580
study it as both. Um I think that, you

57
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.240
know, like I said, because this is something that

58
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.139
hasn't been studied for very long. I don't think

59
00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.380
we really know much about, you know, what's the

60
00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.639
percentage of like voluntary versus involuntary when I talk

61
00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.259
to people about my research, um you know, we

62
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.360
do a lot of descriptive research in my lab,

63
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.639
um which is we kinda just wanna see what's

64
00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.059
going on. Uh And so I often use the

65
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.919
analogy of like, you know, in our lab, what

66
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.309
we're trying to do is we're trying to draw

67
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.169
a map. And so maybe if we do a

68
00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.009
good job of drawing this map of where all

69
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.300
the single people are, we'll get a sense of

70
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.279
like, who are the happy, single people, who are

71
00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.580
the less happy single people who's more voluntary versus

72
00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.869
less voluntary. So I, I really try to approach

73
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.229
it as both and, and hopefully in, you know,

74
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.899
a few years, we'd be able to have better

75
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.490
data to say, you know, which is more common

76
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.630
and how common it is.

77
00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.910
This is very interesting because uh I mean, you

78
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.259
started your answer by saying that many people tend

79
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.679
to think about single people or classify single people.

80
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.320
Uh All the ones that are unmarried. But of

81
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.679
course, there are people in committed romantic relationships that

82
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.160
are not married are just living together or even

83
00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.916
not living together at all, but in a still

84
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.255
in a committed romantic relationship. But then even apart

85
00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.255
from that, uh, I mean, there are people that

86
00:03:56.266 --> 00:04:00.776
are in relationships but not really committed relationships, they

87
00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.776
might just prefer casual relationships. They might just have,

88
00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.555
I don't know, friends with benefits, they might have

89
00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:12.761
just exclusively sexual relationships are what now people call,

90
00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:15.871
as you mentioned, their situations are and I guess

91
00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:19.002
that would also include people that in their social

92
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:22.191
media, in their relationship status would put something like

93
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.231
it's complicated or something like that.

94
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.611
Yeah. Yeah, I know, there's definitely a lot of

95
00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:29.171
gray area there. And I mean, even as we're

96
00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:31.529
talking, I'm thinking like, you know, there, there, there

97
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.519
would be, it would be really beneficial to have

98
00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.209
like a, like a good qualitative study sometime where

99
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.429
we just go and ask people, you know, you

100
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.459
say you're single, like, what do you mean by

101
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.790
that? And we've done a little bit of that.

102
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.179
We've asked people like, what kind of romantic and

103
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.799
sexual stuff do you have going on? And so

104
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.679
we're starting to look into that. Uh So yeah,

105
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.709
I mean, let's, let's just say we're starting with

106
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.480
the easy question by trying to make it sort

107
00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:55.119
of binary to start with. Uh But for sure,

108
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.559
for sure. And I, you know, I hear from

109
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.450
and read about a lot of people who feel

110
00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.000
like they're somewhere in between those. So that's, that's

111
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.459
definitely a thing, you know.

112
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.359
But, but then, I mean, we have to keep

113
00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.239
in mind but that it's not necessarily the case

114
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.670
that if someone is classified as single, they are

115
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.959
not in any kind of relationship at all, they

116
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.600
might be.

117
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.739
Yeah. Exactly. And in fact, we, we on that

118
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.450
front, we have done a little bit of research.

119
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.640
I'd be happy to talk about that, that we've

120
00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:25.489
tried to get a sense of like, you know,

121
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.980
what do they have going on? But I will

122
00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.609
say like, at least in the data that we've

123
00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.089
got, um, the majority of people who tell us

124
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.910
that they're single have no sexual or dating relationships

125
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.149
going on. I do think that sometimes you get

126
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.130
this kind of like sex in the city image

127
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.730
of what single people's lives are like. And that's

128
00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:48.440
great trauma, television and true for some people's lives.

129
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.029
Um, BUT for the majority of people, uh who

130
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.820
are single, they don't have something like that going

131
00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:56.420
on. So it does happen and it's an important

132
00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.070
part of the phenomenon. But I do feel like

133
00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:02.119
culturally, we sometimes overestimate how much people are kind

134
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.559
of like casually dating or having these casual sexual

135
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.359
affairs. Yeah.

136
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.010
Right. And then related to that another question, there's

137
00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.079
short term, single and long term single. So at

138
00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:17.649
what point how much time does someone need to

139
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.470
be, uh, in a, uh, single for them to

140
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.730
be classified as long term single?

141
00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:26.959
Yeah. You know, again, it's one of these things

142
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.630
where I wouldn't say that there's a field wide

143
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.059
definition of that. Um, SO, I mean, in terms

144
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.529
of like, the, the research that we've done, we've

145
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.290
used three years as a marker of long term

146
00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:41.160
singlehood. Um, BUT I mean, you know, honestly we

147
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.350
just kind of made that up, right. Um And

148
00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:46.200
so that's something else that like, again, I think

149
00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:48.119
it would be really important to collect some data

150
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.929
and ask people, you know, when did you start

151
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.940
defining yourself as a long term, single person, you

152
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.079
know, anecdotally, I mean, one of the most interesting

153
00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:58.359
things about doing this work is that there's so

154
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.700
many more people writing and talking about single hood

155
00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.010
that there's no shortage of people's narratives about this

156
00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.760
kind of thing. Um And anecdotally, it kind of

157
00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:08.200
sounds like people just, it's like people have an

158
00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:10.859
epiphany at some point, you know, that that's along

159
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.100
the lines of like, I guess this is it,

160
00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:15.279
you know, and, and for some people that's, you

161
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.929
know, that they've been trying out dating for a

162
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.859
long time and they're like, but I'm never happy

163
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.730
in a relationship. So I guess that's not what

164
00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.470
I wanna do, you know, other people are just

165
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.535
unsuccessful on the dating market and they're like, I

166
00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.614
guess I'm gonna have to make peace with this.

167
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.065
And so there does seem to be something again

168
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.135
just anecdotally. This is not like hard data or

169
00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:35.385
anything but like people themselves kind of come to

170
00:07:35.394 --> 00:07:37.174
that conclusion at some point. And I think it

171
00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:39.454
would be really interesting to study that more formally.

172
00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:41.005
But yeah, I know that we don't really have

173
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:43.475
a formal definition. We've kind of used three years

174
00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:45.575
as a, you know, as a one marker

175
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:49.744
but a and the reason at all for three

176
00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:50.954
years or

177
00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:56.750
no, you know, just vibes, I guess. Um Yeah.

178
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.089
No, I mean, you know, we just needed to

179
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.250
define it for a particular study. Um Yeah, I

180
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.850
mean, because that's the thing too, right is that

181
00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:05.630
we don't even have a lot of good data

182
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.750
on like how people, how long people typically stay

183
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.350
single for, you know, like it's, it's one of

184
00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:13.079
the challenges of this kind of work. And I

185
00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:15.440
think it's why, for example, there's a lot more

186
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.429
research on marriage than there is on getting into

187
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.980
a relationship that like if you want to study

188
00:08:20.989 --> 00:08:22.760
marriage, you get a bunch of people who are

189
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.390
already in romantic relationships and a pretty good chunk

190
00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:26.790
of them are going to end up getting married

191
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.420
with single people. You need thousands of people. Like

192
00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:32.380
we were in one study recently where I think

193
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.039
we had like 4000 people to start with. And

194
00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.599
six months later, I think it was about 43

195
00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:41.679
or 400 of them were in relationships. Um, SO,

196
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.778
um, you know, it's challenging, it's challenging to, to

197
00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:46.869
get that kind of data. So we don't even

198
00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:49.039
know, like, what is the typical length of single

199
00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:51.299
hood for people who do end up in romantic

200
00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:52.299
relationships? Yeah.

201
00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:57.369
So let's get more specifically into the psychology or

202
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.090
what we know for, uh, for, at least for

203
00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:04.169
now about the psychology of single people and their

204
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.719
psychological well being and some of the aspects of

205
00:09:07.729 --> 00:09:11.469
some of their lifestyles, let's say. So when it

206
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:14.840
comes to their traits, do they have anything to

207
00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:19.580
do with attachment with attachment style? Because I would

208
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.760
imagine that for someone that is uh at least

209
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.909
familiar with psychology, that would be one of the

210
00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:30.250
first things that that would pop into mind that

211
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.429
maybe people who are single and the ones who

212
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.900
want to be single or like to be single.

213
00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:40.489
Uh But they would possibly have some sort of

214
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.390
insecure attachment style, like a fearful and anxious attach

215
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:49.729
attachment style, some or an avoidant attachment style, something

216
00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:50.250
like that.

217
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.229
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's so, I mean, it's,

218
00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:55.260
it's worth starting this answer by saying, um you

219
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.869
know, there are significant differences and it does look

220
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.820
like insecurely attached. People are more likely to be

221
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.390
single. I mean, having said that and this has

222
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.669
kind of been one of the thrust of the

223
00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:07.030
work in my lab is that there's so much

224
00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:10.030
variability among single people, right? So, you know, iii

225
00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.500
I, I'll go down this road. I just don't

226
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.750
want to make it seem like there's no such

227
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.299
thing as a secure, single per person. There definitely

228
00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:18.270
are, you know, there definitely are people who um

229
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.400
you know, they choose being single because they enjoy

230
00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.890
it and they meet their social needs in ways

231
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.659
other than romantic relationships, for example. But I would

232
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:28.590
say that the data has suggested that insecure attachment

233
00:10:28.739 --> 00:10:32.159
um is one factor that leads people to be

234
00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.919
more likely to be single. So, um you know,

235
00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:38.719
with, with insecurely attached or sorry, with anxiously attached

236
00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:41.500
people. So, you know, these are the people that,

237
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.690
that in everyday language, you would talk about them

238
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.030
as like the more sort of like needy and

239
00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:48.929
clingy types. They, you know, they tend to experience

240
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.250
a lot of a lot of negative emotion and

241
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.059
that leads them to feel like they need a

242
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.830
lot of support. Um You know, they tend to

243
00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.440
feel like um they, uh uh you know, can't

244
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.159
really do life on their own, for example, they,

245
00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:04.840
they really feel strongly in need of other people.

246
00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:07.400
And so one of the places that they feel

247
00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:09.489
strongly compelled to turn to, with that is to

248
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.520
romantic relationships. So anxiously attached, people really want to

249
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.130
be in romantic relationships. But one of the things

250
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.400
that's come out of our work that I think

251
00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:20.359
is important to keep in mind is that anxious

252
00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:23.130
attachment isn't just wanting a bit more closeness in

253
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.000
romantic contexts. They want to be closer to their

254
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.159
family, they wanna be closer to their friends. Like

255
00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:30.460
it tends to be something that, like pervades all

256
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:34.239
of their relationships. But the trouble that anxiously attached

257
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.140
people have in romantic relationships and in other types

258
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.179
of relationships is that, you know, that neediness puts

259
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.200
a strain on the person that they're in a

260
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.280
relationship with because they tend to have these behaviors

261
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.320
when they get insecure, they, they feel like they're

262
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.640
gonna lose that person. And you know, what people

263
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.320
do when they feel like they're gonna lose something

264
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.880
is they try to lock it down, they try

265
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.280
to control it, right? And so this is where

266
00:11:57.289 --> 00:11:59.890
you start to see like jealous kind of behavior

267
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.520
where you see like angry behavior or you see

268
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.169
controlling behavior. I mean, in general, you could say

269
00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:07.739
that their goal is to try to limit the

270
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.969
other person's choice and autonomy in a way that,

271
00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.169
you know, in the short term makes it more

272
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:14.729
likely that that other person is going to be

273
00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:16.690
with them. And in the law, I mean, you

274
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.489
know, we all like to be in relationship with

275
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.510
people who give us choice and freedom and autonomy.

276
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.250
And so it just wears people down over time,

277
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.000
right? So, you know, with the anxiously attached people,

278
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.909
I think that the data do suggest they're more

279
00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:29.789
likely to be single, it's not for a lack

280
00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:32.789
of wanting a relationship. I mean, they of, of,

281
00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.969
uh all of the different attachment styles want a

282
00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:39.150
relationship the most. They just have these patterns that

283
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.109
make it challenging that for them to keep their

284
00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:44.890
relationships together again, romantic and otherwise this is a

285
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.809
challenge across relationships. You know, I think it's with

286
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.659
anxious people. One of the things I find interesting

287
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:52.010
too is that when they're single they feel like,

288
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.440
oh, if I just had a relationship, I would,

289
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.640
you know, I would feel better. Right. But the

290
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.530
data from romantic relationships also shows that when anxiously

291
00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:02.469
attached people get in a romantic relationship, they're also

292
00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:05.479
less happy in romantic relationships. You know. So I

293
00:13:05.489 --> 00:13:08.700
think that what anxious people on a healthy path

294
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.299
often do is they'll kind of notice that like,

295
00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:13.140
oh, I thought a relationship would make me happy

296
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.039
and I'm kind of just not happy. Maybe I

297
00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:18.869
should take singlehood as an opportunity to, like, learn

298
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.340
to live life with, you know, with on my

299
00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:22.760
own, get solid on my own. Um, SO, you

300
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.669
know, in that sense, yeah, I mean, anxiously attached

301
00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.429
people are more likely to be single. I do

302
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.169
think of singlehood as a real opportunity for anxiously

303
00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:32.789
attached people to, you know, learn that they don't

304
00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:34.409
need other people as much as they think they

305
00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:37.849
do, um, with the avoidant people. So the avoidant

306
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.539
people, um, you know, these are the people who

307
00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:42.609
in everyday life, they they tend to keep more

308
00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:45.419
of an emotional distance from other people. Um, YOU

309
00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:48.530
know, they, they don't value being close to people

310
00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:51.700
all that much. They really like being independent. They

311
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.510
don't like people, you know, getting in their space

312
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.729
and taking up their autonomy. I mean, I always

313
00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:59.655
joke for example that, like, you know, if, if

314
00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:01.664
you and your partner come home with like eight

315
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.614
bags of groceries and you want to carry all

316
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.934
the groceries in by yourself, you might just be

317
00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:08.755
anxiously attached. They, they don't like relying on other

318
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.695
people. It makes them feel like they're giving up

319
00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:13.354
some of themselves, like they're giving up some of

320
00:14:13.364 --> 00:14:16.215
their autonomy, right? So they like independence. They, they,

321
00:14:16.224 --> 00:14:18.494
they're not particularly, you know, they're not high in

322
00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:23.830
expressing themselves emotionally. Um And so they are also

323
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.650
less likely to be, uh, in romantic relationships. Uh

324
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.409
And again, it's not that there's no such thing

325
00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:32.239
as avoiding people in a romantic relationship. There are

326
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.349
lots of them, but statistically they're more likely to

327
00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.979
be single. Um And, you know, this is because

328
00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:41.559
they do prefer emotional distance. There is an extent

329
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.419
to which, you know, I think that with avoiding

330
00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:46.039
people in singlehood, they sort of get two things.

331
00:14:46.049 --> 00:14:49.770
One is that they don't get other people, you

332
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.710
know, giving them a hard time and getting them

333
00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:55.200
in their, in their face and they do like

334
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.750
to be alone, you know, and so I think

335
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.479
that they I think that they get those advantages.

336
00:14:59.489 --> 00:15:02.539
But the thing with avoiding people is that just

337
00:15:02.549 --> 00:15:05.440
like with anxious people, like, it's not just something

338
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.559
that affects the romantic relationships that this kind of

339
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.979
like more emotionally distant way of connecting with people.

340
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:15.179
And this kind of like de prioritization of relationships

341
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.929
with other people. It also affects their friendships and

342
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.510
their family relationships and that kind of thing. And

343
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.460
so, you know, what we find is that avoiding

344
00:15:22.469 --> 00:15:24.909
people, they say that they like being single, they

345
00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:27.260
like being single just as much as secure people

346
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.869
do, but they're less happy than secure people when

347
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.309
they're single. And, you know, our best guess is

348
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.840
that, um, you know, when you're not connecting romantically,

349
00:15:36.849 --> 00:15:39.010
but you're also not connecting with your family and

350
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.830
your friends, you know, even if there's a part

351
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.039
of you that feels relieved, not being around other

352
00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:47.640
people, um, just human beings get lonely, you know.

353
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.820
And so I think that what avoiding people do

354
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.109
is they kind of end up isolating themselves and

355
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.700
putting themselves in a situation where, you know, they

356
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.960
get a relief from what they think of as

357
00:15:56.969 --> 00:15:59.750
the problems with social connection. But on those days

358
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.900
when they really want somebody, nobody's there for them,

359
00:16:01.909 --> 00:16:02.460
you know.

360
00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:06.919
But then, I mean, would it be fair to

361
00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:11.500
say then that, uh whenever we know that someone

362
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.739
is single or even long term single, because that's

363
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.539
the, usually the cases that people tend to frown

364
00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:23.570
more on and be more worried about. Uh WE

365
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.469
shouldn't assume necessarily that that person as sort of

366
00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:33.119
insecure attachment style. I mean, they may be securely

367
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.340
attached, but for some reason or another that we

368
00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:39.700
might get into here, they are just not that

369
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.099
interested in romantic relationships, for example.

370
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.190
Yeah, I mean, this is like, so again, like,

371
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.400
first of all, I think what you said is

372
00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:48.719
really important is that uh again, there's all kinds

373
00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:50.429
of reasons for being single. And I would say

374
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.440
that like, you know, statistically someone who's single is

375
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.820
more likely to have attachment insecurity, but that's not

376
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.250
the same as like everyone who is single is

377
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.479
single because they've got some kind of like personal

378
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:05.579
or emotional problem or something like that, right? Um

379
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:07.900
And there's also so there's that one layer, right?

380
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.979
Which is that it's, it's not necessarily the case

381
00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:11.550
that people are doing it because of that kind

382
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.839
of an issue. The other thing is you'll, you'll

383
00:17:13.848 --> 00:17:18.630
hear interesting narrative from more avoidant people that float

384
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.839
the idea and obviously people are free to agree

385
00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:23.025
with this or disagree with this, right? But, you

386
00:17:23.035 --> 00:17:25.885
know, the argument is often that, well, you think

387
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:27.285
that it's a problem that I'm not in a

388
00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:31.334
romantic relationship. But actually, I think the problem is

389
00:17:31.344 --> 00:17:36.785
that society overvalues uh romantic relationships, right? That they're

390
00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:39.324
uh that I don't need relationships as much as

391
00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:41.760
other people do. Um And you know, I would

392
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.800
say, for me, you know, I'm kind of so

393
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.060
so on that argument. But like I would say

394
00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:48.869
the argument that I find the most compelling is

395
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.540
that, you know, there are other ways to live

396
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.920
meaningful lives and contribute to society, for example, than,

397
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.989
you know, having a relationship. And so I always

398
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.819
use the example of is I remember thinking about

399
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.380
this when uh the pandemic first started and the

400
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.890
rush was on to find a vaccine. Like that's

401
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.140
not a time for work life balance, right? Like

402
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.739
we actually need people in society who are, for

403
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.939
example, willing to devote themselves entirely to their job,

404
00:18:14.949 --> 00:18:16.890
right? And I do think, you know, I come

405
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.260
from a background of romantic relationship researchers and I

406
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.040
think that we tend to judge people's value based

407
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.599
on how much they're interested in and good at

408
00:18:25.609 --> 00:18:29.619
intimacy in relationships. And there's all kinds of other

409
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.400
things that we need people to be interested in

410
00:18:32.729 --> 00:18:35.959
um and engaged in in life. And so that

411
00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:38.079
is an argument that would hear from avoiding attached

412
00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:40.790
people is that the problem isn't that I'm not

413
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.020
in a romantic relationship. The problem is you're not

414
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.050
realizing the ways that I get meaning and contribute

415
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.530
to society in ways other than connecting to people

416
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.250
emotionally.

417
00:18:49.989 --> 00:18:52.420
Uh I mean, this is actually something that just

418
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.969
recently I talked with Doctor Bella de Polo on

419
00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:58.489
the show because she's been also doing lots of

420
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.939
work on singlehood and she told me about different

421
00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:06.810
ways that people who are single, uh, basically make

422
00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:11.204
their lives meaningful by engaging socially in other ways,

423
00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:15.935
by committing to their whatever work they're committed to

424
00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:21.135
and sometimes even, uh, charity volunteer works, uh, stuff

425
00:19:21.145 --> 00:19:23.625
like, I mean, many things that people might get

426
00:19:23.635 --> 00:19:27.775
involved in that do not, uh, entail being in

427
00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:29.464
a romantic relationship.

428
00:19:30.209 --> 00:19:32.160
Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree with that. I totally

429
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:32.750
agree with that.

430
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.150
Uh, AND what about their well being? Uh I

431
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.239
mean, and again, connecting a little bit to attachment,

432
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.400
I guess that you've already touched a little bit

433
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.280
on that when in my first question about attachment.

434
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.780
But uh I mean, do single people usually have

435
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.560
uh high levels or low levels of well being?

436
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:57.560
And does that connect in any way to their

437
00:19:57.609 --> 00:20:00.410
specific attachment style or not?

438
00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:03.239
Right. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that the

439
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.609
data are pretty clear that if you look at

440
00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:08.160
the average person in a relationship and you compare

441
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.640
them to the average person who is single and

442
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.640
again, this is single, defined as like not in

443
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.489
a committed relationship. I think that the, I think

444
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.890
the question of whether marriage brings happiness is a

445
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.349
different question than like does initially getting in a

446
00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:23.670
romantic relationship bring happiness? And I think this question

447
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.630
about getting in a romantic relationship, the data are

448
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.310
more clear on that. So unequivocally, the data say

449
00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:33.180
that people in romantic relationships are happier on average

450
00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:36.930
than uh, people who are single. Um, AGAIN, you

451
00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:39.229
know, it's not to say that everyone who's single

452
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.949
is miserable. And so, you know, there was a

453
00:20:40.959 --> 00:20:43.459
study by Lisa Walsh, for example, and found that

454
00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:45.939
there are absolutely single people who are just as

455
00:20:45.949 --> 00:20:48.900
happy as the happiest people in relationships. You know,

456
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.689
there's less of them in Lisa's data. It was

457
00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:53.689
something like there was 1/6 as many single people

458
00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:55.280
in the top band as there was people in

459
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.400
relationships. But it's, you know, it's, it's a, it's

460
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.670
a common thing, right? Um But I mean, if

461
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.189
we're going to talk average differences, uh it's quite

462
00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:07.560
clear. Um I think that the questions that are

463
00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:10.459
um you know, harder to answer but are coming

464
00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:13.250
into focus more is, well, why is that right?

465
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.739
Uh And so, you know, an average difference doesn't

466
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.339
necessarily mean that relationships are causing people to be

467
00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:22.099
happier. Um And, you know, in our lab, for

468
00:21:22.109 --> 00:21:25.359
example, we found evidence that one of the reasons

469
00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.579
that there's differences between people who are single and

470
00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:30.719
people in relationships is personality. Like there's certain types

471
00:21:30.729 --> 00:21:33.150
of people who are more likely to get into

472
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.050
relationships. I mean, one of them we just talked

473
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.430
about and we'll come back to in a second

474
00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:39.000
is attachment uh in our lab. My amazing grad

475
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.050
student, Elaine Hone has been looking at big five

476
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.770
personality variables and we find, for example, that extroverts

477
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.290
are more likely to be in romantic relationships. Um,

478
00:21:48.329 --> 00:21:49.449
AND I mean, I think it, I think it

479
00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:52.180
makes a lot of sense. Right. Like extroverts and

480
00:21:52.189 --> 00:21:54.650
this is the thing, it's not that introverts enjoy

481
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.109
social contact less than extroverts. It's just that they

482
00:21:58.119 --> 00:22:01.380
like less amount of it. Right. Like, avoidance, need

483
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.219
more time to themselves. And so in terms of

484
00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:05.859
finding a romantic partner, I mean, this gives a

485
00:22:05.869 --> 00:22:08.819
couple of advantages to extroverted people. One is that

486
00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:11.630
they're probably just more motivated to have somebody around

487
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.900
all the time, right? And so they're more motivated

488
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.380
to be in a relationship, they also just tend

489
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.800
to be more social. And so there's more opportunities

490
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.650
for them to meet people. The thing about extroverted

491
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.109
people is that whether you're in a relationship or

492
00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:27.349
not, they're just happier people on average, right? And

493
00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:29.410
so we think that one of the reasons why

494
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.569
um partnered people are uh happier is that they

495
00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:36.660
start out happier, right? And so that's part of

496
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.680
it, it's not relationships causing happiness. If anything, it's

497
00:22:39.689 --> 00:22:43.290
like happiness causing relationships. But there's also been some

498
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.359
really good longitudinal studies like the, the way that

499
00:22:46.369 --> 00:22:48.199
you really need to get at this is you

500
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:50.540
track people's level of well being before they get

501
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.819
in a relationship, you know, and then track it

502
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:55.430
again after they get in a relationship. Um And

503
00:22:55.439 --> 00:22:57.479
again, it's been very hard to do, but it's

504
00:22:57.489 --> 00:22:59.920
just in the last year really that there's a

505
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.099
bunch of studies that have been doing this. And

506
00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:05.290
it is true when people go from being single

507
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.339
to being in a relationship, their levels of life

508
00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:11.160
satisfaction go up. We have one study that we're

509
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.459
writing up in my lab right now where, you

510
00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:15.770
know, we didn't just measure life satisfaction. We also

511
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.199
measured, for example, sexual satisfaction. And, you know, we

512
00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:22.839
found that people's life satisfaction went up a small

513
00:23:22.849 --> 00:23:25.439
degree when they got in a relationship, their sexual

514
00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:27.689
satisfaction went way up when they got in a

515
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:30.339
relationship. Right? And so the way that we tend

516
00:23:30.349 --> 00:23:32.739
to think about it is the more that a

517
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.520
domain of happiness is directly tied to being in

518
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.979
a relationship, like life satisfaction can come from your

519
00:23:38.989 --> 00:23:41.260
relationship, but it can come from your work, it

520
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.890
can come from your hobbies. You know, sexual satisfaction

521
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.219
is much more directly tied to like, do you

522
00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:49.959
have a romantic partner or not? Um, AND that

523
00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:51.959
really seemed to strongly go up when people got

524
00:23:51.969 --> 00:23:54.800
in a relationship. So, um, yeah, you know, I,

525
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.079
I think at this point it's very clear that

526
00:23:58.089 --> 00:24:02.650
relationships increase people's happiness. I think that the really

527
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.920
important caveat to that, right? Is that in longitudinal

528
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.859
research, you don't randomly assign people to be in

529
00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:14.130
a relationship, right? And so you can't say that

530
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.729
people who don't want to get in a relationship

531
00:24:16.739 --> 00:24:19.369
would actually be happier if they did because they

532
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.209
haven't been in our studies. The people who didn't

533
00:24:21.219 --> 00:24:23.160
want to be in a relationship, don't get in

534
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.069
a relationship, right. So, you know, I feel very

535
00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:28.459
confident that for people who are motivated to get

536
00:24:28.469 --> 00:24:32.670
into romantic relationships, their life satisfaction, their sexual satisfaction,

537
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.609
that kind of thing will go up. Um But

538
00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:36.930
I can't, you know, I can't say that that's

539
00:24:36.939 --> 00:24:40.400
gonna apply to everybody. So uh in terms of

540
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.239
uh the well being and its relationship to attachment,

541
00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:48.420
um attachment has definitely uh in our data, proven

542
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.630
to be something that is uh linked to well

543
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.290
being and singlehood. So with anxiously attached people, and

544
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.510
you're right, we kind of, we kind of talked

545
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.380
about this a bit already, but like with anxiously

546
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:03.209
attached people, they just have more difficulty maintaining their

547
00:25:03.219 --> 00:25:05.935
connections with people, whether that's friends or family or

548
00:25:05.944 --> 00:25:08.905
whatever. Um And so, you know, they really, really

549
00:25:08.915 --> 00:25:11.265
want to be in a relationship, they're having trouble

550
00:25:11.275 --> 00:25:14.625
making it happen, they're having trouble having relationships stick

551
00:25:14.635 --> 00:25:17.175
when they do happen. All of that neediness when

552
00:25:17.185 --> 00:25:19.584
they're single is going to be directed towards other

553
00:25:19.594 --> 00:25:21.255
people and those issues are going to come out

554
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:24.344
elsewhere, right? So, um that's really the struggle for

555
00:25:24.354 --> 00:25:26.704
anxiously attached to people is wanting something that they

556
00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:29.265
can't get. And, and again, ultimately, and this is

557
00:25:29.275 --> 00:25:31.025
the thing, right? I mean, if people are listening

558
00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:33.469
to this and they, you know, find like, oh,

559
00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:35.969
I'm actually this like anxiously attached kind of person,

560
00:25:36.189 --> 00:25:38.680
I mean, it is, it is definitely resolvable. There's

561
00:25:38.689 --> 00:25:41.250
lots of good literature. There's like good therapeutic practices

562
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.079
that can help people with this. So it's not

563
00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:45.099
a death sentence at all. And in fact, I

564
00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:47.729
think that what anxious people will find is as

565
00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:50.609
they do whatever they need to do to become

566
00:25:50.619 --> 00:25:52.819
more comfortable with themselves. One of the things they'll

567
00:25:52.829 --> 00:25:56.199
find is that desperation to be in a romantic

568
00:25:56.209 --> 00:25:58.869
relationship will start to fade away. You know, like

569
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.430
that's my sense of like the healthiest singles, like

570
00:26:01.439 --> 00:26:04.150
the singles who are high and secure attachment, who,

571
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:08.130
you know, they, um you know, have, uh they

572
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.349
don't worry about being rejected by other people. Like

573
00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:13.329
anxious people. Do they trust other people, sort of

574
00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.160
unlike avoidant attached people, they tend to have this

575
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.790
attitude of like, you know, what my life is

576
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.040
pretty good as a single person. If someone comes

577
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.390
along who can make it better, great. But if

578
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.439
nobody comes along, who can make it better, who

579
00:26:26.449 --> 00:26:28.140
ma who can make it better? I'm already making

580
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.079
it better. Right. So, whereas the anxious people kind

581
00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:32.719
of have this, like, desperation to be in a

582
00:26:32.729 --> 00:26:35.859
relationship, secure people are kind of chilled about it.

583
00:26:35.869 --> 00:26:37.500
And then that seems to be a associated with

584
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.859
more well being in singles. Um, YOU know, for

585
00:26:39.869 --> 00:26:42.920
avoiding people. Yeah, they, they have of all of

586
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.459
these groups, the lowest desire for romantic partner. Um

587
00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:49.170
And so they, they, I think, you know, they

588
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.020
find themselves when they're single. I think that they're

589
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.979
in a bit of a bind. It's almost like

590
00:26:52.989 --> 00:26:55.349
they're like, look, I'm happy being single and I

591
00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:58.689
don't want to change that, but I'm not super

592
00:26:58.699 --> 00:27:01.380
happy overall. Like, what do I do about that?

593
00:27:01.939 --> 00:27:03.500
And it is, you know, there's research with avoiding

594
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.800
attached people that suggests that they benefit from relationships

595
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.949
more than they realize. And so, you know, to

596
00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:14.910
avoid people, I always suggest that they're the group

597
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.699
that might benefit from putting themselves in some uncomfortable

598
00:27:19.709 --> 00:27:22.574
social situations. Like I always use the analogy that,

599
00:27:22.584 --> 00:27:26.494
that for avoiding people, uh, intimacy is like exercise

600
00:27:26.505 --> 00:27:29.244
where like, you know, often exercise feels bad in

601
00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:32.415
the moment, but you actually feel better afterwards, right?

602
00:27:32.425 --> 00:27:34.484
And so I think that's what often happens for

603
00:27:34.494 --> 00:27:36.944
avoiding people is they feel uncomfortable when they start

604
00:27:36.954 --> 00:27:39.425
to get close to somebody. Um, YOU know, they,

605
00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:41.204
they don't fully trust people. They worry that they're

606
00:27:41.214 --> 00:27:43.094
going to get taken advantage of like that kind

607
00:27:43.104 --> 00:27:46.469
of stuff and yet something very human in them

608
00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:49.369
just feels better because they've spent time with people,

609
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.839
you know. And so I think that's the trouble

610
00:27:50.849 --> 00:27:53.489
that avoiding people have not just in singlehood, but

611
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.969
in relationships in general is that like, they just

612
00:27:55.979 --> 00:27:59.069
kind of have this profile of pushing away something

613
00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:00.510
that's good for them. You know,

614
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.280
I, I mean, what I'm about to say, please

615
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.780
correct me if I say anything wrong here. But

616
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.550
I would imagine that also for the anxiously attached

617
00:28:10.642 --> 00:28:14.392
people, the ones that are desperately trying to get

618
00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:19.302
into new relationships whenever they're single, they also might

619
00:28:19.312 --> 00:28:23.542
get themselves into a bit of a, a messy

620
00:28:23.552 --> 00:28:28.422
relationship situation because, I mean, it might just happen

621
00:28:28.432 --> 00:28:32.343
that they come across someone that, uh, accepts to

622
00:28:32.353 --> 00:28:35.662
get into a romantic relationship with them. But then

623
00:28:35.753 --> 00:28:39.375
if they just are open to having a relationship

624
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:43.125
with almost anyone just to fill that void, let's

625
00:28:43.135 --> 00:28:46.765
say, then they might get into relationships with people

626
00:28:46.776 --> 00:28:49.995
that are not really very compatible with them. And

627
00:28:50.005 --> 00:28:54.125
then it's even worse than just staying single for

628
00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:55.936
a longer while. I guess

629
00:28:56.436 --> 00:28:58.816
that's, I mean, you're exactly right. I mean, we

630
00:28:58.826 --> 00:29:01.666
have, uh, there, there's some research that my former

631
00:29:01.676 --> 00:29:05.010
phd student, Stephanie Spielman did. Uh, AND she's a

632
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.609
professor at Wayne State University now. And so she

633
00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:09.410
did and continues to do a lot of work

634
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.810
on the fear of being single and we have

635
00:29:10.819 --> 00:29:13.810
data on exactly this point, which is that, um,

636
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.839
you know, it was interesting because in this study,

637
00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:20.170
when you just asked people, um, you know, basically,

638
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.609
like how high or low your standards, the, the,

639
00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:25.530
the people were high in fear of being single,

640
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.949
which is strongly related to anxious attachment. They didn't

641
00:29:28.959 --> 00:29:31.510
say my standards are lower. Right. So I'm not

642
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.060
sure that they consciously realize on a day to

643
00:29:34.069 --> 00:29:36.609
day basis that their standards are lower. But then

644
00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:38.589
we had other studies where we actually put them

645
00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:41.329
in a situation where they could, they thought actually

646
00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:44.099
meet somebody. Uh And then what we did is

647
00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:46.770
we gave them dating profiles that we had written

648
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.079
ourselves. And so, for example, in one of the

649
00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:51.969
studies, we purposely had one of the people they

650
00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:55.359
could meet was not a very nice person. Um

651
00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:56.829
So, you know, he was, you know, making it

652
00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:59.520
clear, like I'm not gonna emotionally support you and

653
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.589
like, you know, exactly the kinds of things that,

654
00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:03.969
that in relationship science were like, that's a bit

655
00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:06.719
of a red flag, you know. Um But even

656
00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:08.930
though they say that they're not interested in lowering

657
00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:13.310
their, lowering their standards, they were more interested in

658
00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:16.130
this person who is not a particularly nice person

659
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.189
than the people who are less in the fear

660
00:30:18.199 --> 00:30:19.660
of being single. And it's we, you know, we

661
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.900
worry about exactly the process that you're talking about

662
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.229
is like, if you lower your standards like that

663
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.469
to just get in a relationship with anybody, I

664
00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:28.949
mean, what is gonna provide a short term relief,

665
00:30:28.959 --> 00:30:31.140
right? Like that sense of like being alone will

666
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.790
disappear in the short term. But if you keep

667
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.770
getting this feedback from your romantic partner that you're

668
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.680
not someone worth loving, it just reinforces those messages

669
00:30:40.689 --> 00:30:44.050
that anxiously attach to people already believe. Um So

670
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.780
yeah, I mean, I think you're 100% right on

671
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.069
that.

672
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.959
A and by the way, talking about relationships uh

673
00:30:49.969 --> 00:30:53.729
in your studies, in your research did you find

674
00:30:53.739 --> 00:30:58.780
that reps experiences that people might have had in

675
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:04.160
uh, older relationships in past relationships might also influence

676
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.829
them being decided to remain single? And if so

677
00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:12.800
are there aspects of how people function in romantic

678
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.839
relationships that perhaps would be useful to try to

679
00:31:16.849 --> 00:31:21.430
understand, uh, single people and why they make the,

680
00:31:21.439 --> 00:31:24.479
the, the relationship decisions that they make?

681
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.109
Yeah. I mean, I think it's a, I think

682
00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:29.780
it's a great question and it's one of the

683
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.890
ones that, because singlehood studies is so young, we

684
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.089
really don't have good answers for at this point.

685
00:31:34.229 --> 00:31:36.630
You know, there's one researcher Amy Rauer who has,

686
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.790
you know, published the first paper I've ever seen

687
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.170
kind of going in this direction. Um But I

688
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.900
wouldn't say that we know. Um YOU know, I,

689
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.760
I certainly, again, like just reading spaces where single

690
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.050
people talk about their lives, there's a lot of

691
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.979
narratives like this, right? Like, there's a lot of

692
00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:54.839
people who feel like the relationships have just gone

693
00:31:54.849 --> 00:31:57.209
so badly that they feel like they can't trust

694
00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.369
people anymore or they don't get enough out of

695
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.589
relationships. Um So there's a lot of narratives like

696
00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:06.880
that. Um But yeah, so, so people have those

697
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.040
kinds of stories, but it's very, again, it's very

698
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.660
tricky to do these kinds of studies if you

699
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.959
want to see, like, how do relationships uh events

700
00:32:13.969 --> 00:32:16.290
actually affect people because then you've got to track

701
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.859
people and, you know, kind of hope that they

702
00:32:18.869 --> 00:32:21.000
get into a big conflict or something like that.

703
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.459
Right. So that you can, like, follow them afterwards.

704
00:32:23.709 --> 00:32:27.709
Um, AND certainly those kinds of studies tracking people

705
00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:30.959
from a relationship to singlehood haven't been done. So,

706
00:32:30.969 --> 00:32:33.579
you know, I, I think it's a great direction

707
00:32:33.589 --> 00:32:35.170
for research to go in. I also think it's

708
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.380
understandable that hasn't been done yet because it's, uh,

709
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.770
kind of, uh, tricky. Um, BUT I will say,

710
00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.050
I mean, one of the things and this comes

711
00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.339
from the lab of uh my colleague, Ya Gourmet.

712
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.130
Um There is one type of person who finds

713
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.609
uh singlehood relatively satisfying and that's the kind of

714
00:32:51.619 --> 00:32:55.290
person who likes avoiding social conflict. Um So she's

715
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.770
measured this like how, you know, how much do

716
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.719
you like avoiding conflict. Um And if you, if

717
00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:01.869
that's really high on your priority list, you tend

718
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.380
to be about, you know, you, you tend to

719
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.410
be one of the happier groups of singles. And,

720
00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:07.880
you know, it makes sense like getting into a

721
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.910
romantic relationship. I think oftentimes people only think about

722
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.229
it in terms of the benefits and they're obviously

723
00:33:13.239 --> 00:33:16.219
in intimacy and sexual and all kinds of benefits

724
00:33:16.229 --> 00:33:18.920
that people can get out of romantic relationships, but

725
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.500
you're not signing up for no conflict, you know.

726
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.099
So if that's something that's really important for you,

727
00:33:24.109 --> 00:33:26.459
then maybe single hood is the better choice, you

728
00:33:26.469 --> 00:33:26.900
know,

729
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.310
uh about that point. Let me just ask you,

730
00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:32.339
I don't know. If you studied this specifically or

731
00:33:32.349 --> 00:33:36.319
if your colleagues studied this specifically, but uh avoid

732
00:33:36.329 --> 00:33:39.819
wanting to, or liking to avoid conflict. Does it

733
00:33:39.829 --> 00:33:43.709
have anything to do with trade agreeableness or?

734
00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:46.839
That's a good question, you know, I, I don't

735
00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:50.680
have a database to answer to that. Um I,

736
00:33:50.689 --> 00:33:52.310
you know, I don't know, I'm just gonna have

737
00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:53.729
to take an, I don't know on that one.

738
00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:54.439
That's a good question.

739
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.140
OK, no problem. So uh let me just ask

740
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:02.180
you just to close off the section about well-being.

741
00:34:02.189 --> 00:34:05.800
Um APART from the factors that you mentioned, are

742
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:11.860
there any other, for example, interpersonal or interpersonal factors

743
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.879
that play a role in the well-being of single

744
00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:15.510
people?

745
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.728
Yeah. So, I mean, you know, I feel like

746
00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:18.879
I feel like with a lot of these, we've

747
00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.530
kind of been like touching on them as we

748
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.790
go, right? But in terms of the uh and

749
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.030
so you're asking about the interpersonal,

750
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.370
yes, the intra and the inter

751
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:30.040
oh the intra and the inter. OK. Yeah. OK.

752
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.679
So in terms of like in terms of intra,

753
00:34:32.688 --> 00:34:36.159
like, um you know, just basically factors that are

754
00:34:36.168 --> 00:34:39.320
about the individual uh and how that predicts whether

755
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.620
they're happy being single or not. I mean, one

756
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:44.370
of them is having low desire for a romantic

757
00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:47.279
partner. And I feel like this has been uh

758
00:34:47.289 --> 00:34:49.148
i in a way it's very basic, but I

759
00:34:49.158 --> 00:34:51.489
think it's been one of the important advances of

760
00:34:51.498 --> 00:34:54.678
singlehood studies is that I would say there are

761
00:34:54.688 --> 00:34:56.958
a number of spaces in society and even in

762
00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:59.999
academia that just assumes that everybody wants a partner

763
00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:02.059
that this isn't even a variable, that this is

764
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:04.079
a constant and everybody wants it and wants it

765
00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:06.858
the same amount and it's absolutely not. It's, it's

766
00:35:06.868 --> 00:35:09.810
a variable and it's a useful variable um for

767
00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.780
predicting. So, yeah, people who have less desire for

768
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.860
a romantic partner are happier being single. It makes

769
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.679
sense if you don't want something and you don't

770
00:35:17.689 --> 00:35:19.800
have it, you're not upset about not having it.

771
00:35:20.169 --> 00:35:24.090
Um So there's that one, you know, another one

772
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.889
is gender and so this is uh some work

773
00:35:26.899 --> 00:35:29.189
that we've published and some that we also have

774
00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:32.010
in the works right now that on average, uh

775
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.969
women tend to be happier in single hood than

776
00:35:34.979 --> 00:35:38.439
men do. Um Yeah. So, you know, and we

777
00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:41.459
don't 100% know why that is. Um YOU know,

778
00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:42.840
there's a, there's a few things that we tend

779
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.919
to think about. Uh YOU know, one of which

780
00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:48.000
is that, that uh men are not as good

781
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:50.760
as women on average. Again, all kinds of like

782
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.199
overlap between the distributions. There's all kinds of like

783
00:35:53.209 --> 00:35:55.939
highly social men out there. Um But on average

784
00:35:55.949 --> 00:35:58.520
women are better at keeping their friendships together and

785
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.929
keeping their family relationships and um you know, I'll

786
00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:03.050
talk about it in a minute. I mean, that's

787
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.989
another important factor with being a happy single person,

788
00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:08.530
you know, women on average are lower in sexual

789
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.699
desire than men. And one of the big things

790
00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:12.790
that happens when you get in a romantic relationship

791
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.550
is your frequency of sex goes up. And so

792
00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:17.620
in a sense more there for, for men than

793
00:36:17.629 --> 00:36:19.909
for women. Um YOU know, there's also a lot

794
00:36:19.919 --> 00:36:22.270
of traditional roles that get played out in romantic

795
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.620
relationships where, you know, oftentimes women, for example, even

796
00:36:25.629 --> 00:36:27.310
though they're working just as many hours as the

797
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.030
man is, are still expected to do like the

798
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.219
cooking and the cleaning and the childcare and stuff

799
00:36:31.229 --> 00:36:34.429
like that. And so, you know, structurally, there is

800
00:36:34.439 --> 00:36:37.179
arguably more for men to gain by getting into

801
00:36:37.189 --> 00:36:39.790
a relationship. And so, um you know, gender is

802
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.810
one that we started to think about um in

803
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.179
terms of like interpersonal things and, and again, this

804
00:36:45.189 --> 00:36:46.570
is one that we've touched on a number of

805
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.449
times is um having other social relationships in your

806
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:54.010
life. So having, you know, family and friend relationships,

807
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.850
having good social support that might come from your

808
00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.050
friends or a therapist or something like that. Um

809
00:37:00.199 --> 00:37:01.520
I mean, the way that I tend to think

810
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.239
about it is, um you know, I think it,

811
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.310
I think a useful way to think about happiness

812
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.340
since in singlehood versus relationships is to think about

813
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.669
like what are all of the things that you

814
00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:14.919
get out of being in a romantic relationship and

815
00:37:14.929 --> 00:37:17.000
the more of those things that you can get

816
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.600
being single, the less motivation there is to get

817
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.750
into a relationship. Like it's absolutely my frame of

818
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.560
thinking in all of this is that generally speaking,

819
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.780
people are making rational decisions based on the conditions

820
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.770
that are in front of them. Right? And so

821
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.320
if you're getting your social support needs met by

822
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.010
your friend and friends and family, there's like one

823
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.439
less reason for you to get into a romantic

824
00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:41.959
relationship if you're getting your social support needs met.

825
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.129
Um You know, one thing that again comes out

826
00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:46.189
of you a gourmet's lab that looks like is

827
00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:49.949
useful for predicting whether people are happy being single

828
00:37:49.959 --> 00:37:53.350
is not just being socially integrated, but having more

829
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.560
single people in your social network. And so you

830
00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.760
definitely will get these narratives from single people where,

831
00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:02.189
you know, they start to feel excluded from the

832
00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:05.199
couples nights, for example, right? Or even just the

833
00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:07.570
implicit pressure of like when everyone else is in

834
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.159
a couple, like maybe I should be in a

835
00:38:09.169 --> 00:38:11.889
couple too. So I think that single people find

836
00:38:11.899 --> 00:38:15.949
it validating and useful for a connection. Um You

837
00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:17.310
know, because I mean, that's the other thing too,

838
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.620
right? Is I think that I think that sometimes

839
00:38:19.629 --> 00:38:22.570
couples get a bad rap for like excluding single

840
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.870
people, but similarity is just something that happens in

841
00:38:25.879 --> 00:38:28.530
people's friendships, like people like hanging out with other

842
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.860
people, like them, right? Um And it's definitely not

843
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.419
unheard of for single people to exclude people in

844
00:38:34.429 --> 00:38:36.330
relationships. You know, I've heard of, you know, lots

845
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.370
of like party nights where the people in relationships

846
00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:42.159
are not invited, for example. Right. Um, SO anyways

847
00:38:42.169 --> 00:38:43.830
having more single people that comes out of, you

848
00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:46.580
think's work is, is, uh, is something that's helpful.

849
00:38:46.649 --> 00:38:48.790
Um, AND I guess the last thing I'll talk

850
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.439
about here is, is sexual satisfaction. And so, you

851
00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:53.800
know, again, as I was saying, like you make

852
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.469
that list of things that you get in a

853
00:38:55.479 --> 00:39:00.479
romantic relationship, um that, you know, if you're getting

854
00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:02.600
in it, when you're single, it would take the

855
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.620
edge off of wanting to be in a relationship.

856
00:39:04.629 --> 00:39:07.159
And you know, what we found is that um

857
00:39:07.169 --> 00:39:10.870
like friend and family relationships are great, but people

858
00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:13.280
that's not where people obviously go to get their

859
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.560
sexual needs met, right? And so even when people

860
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.340
have really good social support and emotional support networks,

861
00:39:19.459 --> 00:39:22.245
they often still feel like there's that one thing

862
00:39:22.254 --> 00:39:25.455
that's missing and in our data, it's, that's one

863
00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:27.135
thing that gives them a bit of an itch

864
00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:29.415
to be in a romantic relationship. But, you know,

865
00:39:29.425 --> 00:39:31.804
as we talked about before, I mean, some people

866
00:39:31.814 --> 00:39:34.445
have these casual sexual relationships or, you know, they're

867
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:37.195
meeting their sexual needs in other ways. It is

868
00:39:37.205 --> 00:39:39.004
a little bit funny on that front though because

869
00:39:39.014 --> 00:39:40.584
we found this in a couple of our data

870
00:39:40.594 --> 00:39:42.685
sets that if you ask the people who are

871
00:39:42.695 --> 00:39:46.014
happy with their sex lives as single people. Um,

872
00:39:46.274 --> 00:39:48.044
YOU know, are you interested in being in a

873
00:39:48.054 --> 00:39:51.540
romantic relationship or not? On average? They're more likely

874
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.129
to say like, no, I'm not interested. You check

875
00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:55.860
back in with them six months or a year

876
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.929
later and they're actually more likely to be in

877
00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:02.510
a romantic relationship. And so what, you know, my

878
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.560
best guess with that, this is uh some work

879
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.300
that I did with a former student of mine

880
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.580
who's now a professor at University of Western Ontario,

881
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.750
Samantha Jewel. We did something called the progression bias.

882
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.189
And the idea there is that, you know, the

883
00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:16.110
simplest way to put it is that people catch

884
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.479
feelings, like, even when they think that they're in

885
00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:21.379
something casual, like it's just kind of the way

886
00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:23.770
that the human heart works. Like it's not like

887
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.239
it's not like, you know, you go to the

888
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.050
department store and buy a TV, you don't develop

889
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.729
an attachment to the TV. And so if you

890
00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:31.669
need to take it back, it's like, really not

891
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:34.030
that big of a deal, right? But we develop

892
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.489
care for the people that we, you know, are

893
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.850
even in casual relationships, obviously individual differences on that

894
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.629
front. Um But these casual relationships start to become

895
00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:45.520
a little bit sticky and, you know, all of

896
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.929
a sudden you find you miss them after a

897
00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:49.540
couple of days and, you know, all of a

898
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.370
sudden it's like, well, I'm over there two nights

899
00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:53.129
a week anyways I might as well leave some

900
00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:55.520
clothes and then, like, you know, next thing it's

901
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.060
like I'm here every night. Why don't I just

902
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.659
move in? Like, why don't we just make this

903
00:40:58.669 --> 00:41:01.169
a thing? Right. So, yeah, sexual satisfaction is an

904
00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:04.699
interesting one. And that sexually satisfied singles, um, they're

905
00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:07.090
happier as singles but they're sort of like as

906
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.139
it were at risk of getting into a committed

907
00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:09.909
relationship.

908
00:41:10.709 --> 00:41:13.949
So, you, you've, you've ended up mentioning or touching

909
00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:17.189
on a, on a bit there that, uh, I

910
00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:20.219
had perhaps saved for another question, but since you've

911
00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:23.040
already mentioned it, let me ask you then directly,

912
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.040
uh, I mean, then when it comes to perhaps

913
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.750
trying to understand whether individuals report a preference for

914
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.080
staying single, might have really completely closed off the

915
00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:41.469
possibility of getting romantically involved with anyone or if,

916
00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:44.909
for example, someone just comes along that they think

917
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:48.750
might make for a good partner they can, or

918
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.629
they might fall in love with them. Then the

919
00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:56.179
second possibility is usually the correct one. I mean,

920
00:41:56.189 --> 00:41:58.300
or is the most likely?

921
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.280
Yeah. I mean, you know, it, it touches on

922
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.209
something I've been thinking about a lot lately, which

923
00:42:03.219 --> 00:42:05.879
is that, um, you know, a lot of the

924
00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:09.580
people in the single who studies, uh, uh, sort

925
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:13.719
of domain, uh, I think I've been talking about,

926
00:42:13.729 --> 00:42:16.030
like, you know, there's definitely a growing group of

927
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.350
people who identifies people who don't want to be

928
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.449
in a relationship. Uh, BUT I've been really thinking

929
00:42:22.459 --> 00:42:25.129
lately about how, like, one way to put it

930
00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:27.699
simply is, it's like there's two camps in all

931
00:42:27.709 --> 00:42:29.510
of that. Right. And so, like, one of these

932
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.709
camps and this shows up in our, in our

933
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:35.110
sexual satisfaction data is that, I mean, in essence,

934
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.370
there's two different ways for singles to be sexually

935
00:42:38.379 --> 00:42:41.550
satisfied. And so one of them is, uh, the

936
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.110
group of singles that has relatively low sexual desire.

937
00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:48.354
And so, like, low sexual, higher in singlehood is

938
00:42:48.364 --> 00:42:51.385
associated with higher well being. I mean, I love

939
00:42:51.395 --> 00:42:53.685
talking about that finding because I think in most,

940
00:42:53.695 --> 00:42:56.135
at least western societies, if you say that you

941
00:42:56.145 --> 00:42:58.635
have low desire, that's supposed to be a problem,

942
00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:01.574
that's not a good thing. But in, in terms

943
00:43:01.584 --> 00:43:04.294
of single people, it's associated with being happier. And

944
00:43:04.304 --> 00:43:06.475
again, like, I mean, why not? If there's something

945
00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:08.604
you don't want that you're not getting, it's not

946
00:43:08.614 --> 00:43:10.860
a problem, right. So I think that there's kind

947
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.760
of this one camp that, like, you know, we

948
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.810
could call the door closed camp as it were.

949
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.010
And so these are the people who have really,

950
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.679
you know, low desire for a partner. Uh, THESE

951
00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:22.600
are people who have, um, you know, low sexual

952
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.959
desire in that camp. Some of those people are

953
00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:27.489
gonna be the people who identify as a romantic

954
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.870
or as sexual, who have never felt this, you

955
00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:31.169
know, I think there's gonna be other people in

956
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:33.370
there, uh, who have felt it before but don't

957
00:43:33.379 --> 00:43:35.590
feel it now. Um, SO, yeah, let's call those,

958
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.280
the door closed people as it were. Um, AND

959
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.820
in many ways they have, they have relatively positive

960
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.620
outcomes in terms of single hood. But then there

961
00:43:42.629 --> 00:43:46.020
is this other group who, the reason they say

962
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.459
that they don't want a relationship. My sense is,

963
00:43:48.469 --> 00:43:51.629
is because they're getting everything that they would have

964
00:43:51.639 --> 00:43:55.310
gotten from a relationship, but they get it with

965
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.979
the additional autonomy and freedom that comes with being

966
00:43:57.989 --> 00:43:59.590
single, right? And I, you know, I always think

967
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.969
about this is like, this is at the heart

968
00:44:01.979 --> 00:44:04.199
of the trade off between being single and being

969
00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:06.629
in a relationship and you'll hear this from most

970
00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:08.409
single people you talk to if you ask them

971
00:44:08.419 --> 00:44:11.100
like, what is the best thing about being single?

972
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.629
I, I have all of the freedom I want,

973
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:14.860
you know, if I, if I don't want to

974
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.979
wash the dishes tonight, no one's gonna give me

975
00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:18.610
if I want to eat ice cream for dinner,

976
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.280
like no one's gonna give me a hard time

977
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.459
for that, you know. Uh And so in a

978
00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:24.169
way, like these are the people who are able

979
00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:26.760
to get like the sexual and emotional needs met.

980
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.350
Um And also maintain that autonomy and freedom. And

981
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.040
so I think that they're a bit of a

982
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.459
different set of the people who are not interested

983
00:44:33.469 --> 00:44:36.760
in romantic relationships. It doesn't come from a place

984
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.610
of like low desire, it's like desire that's getting

985
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.600
satisfied, you know. But again, I mean, our data,

986
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.040
it, it looks like these are people who are

987
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.469
unbeknownst to the, to them, many of them are

988
00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:49.560
on their way to a committed relationship.

989
00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.209
Uh It's interesting that you mentioned, there are people

990
00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:56.560
with low sex drives because it's not only the

991
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:01.010
fact, as you mentioned that many times, people, particularly

992
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.010
even more so in western societies tend to think

993
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.760
that someone with a low sex drive must have

994
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:11.320
some kind of problem, even sometimes a physiological problem

995
00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.840
or something like that. But I would also be

996
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.100
willing to bet that many of the people who

997
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.429
go to their doctors and report a low sex

998
00:45:20.504 --> 00:45:24.024
strive as a problem would also be the ones

999
00:45:24.034 --> 00:45:27.385
who are, who are in a romantic relationship. But

1000
00:45:27.395 --> 00:45:30.284
the thing there is that they are not matching

1001
00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:32.725
the sex drive of their partners.

1002
00:45:32.915 --> 00:45:35.534
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's, I mean, it's, it's

1003
00:45:35.544 --> 00:45:38.995
really all relative and it's not about sex drive

1004
00:45:39.004 --> 00:45:41.844
and isolation. It's about sex drive relative to people's

1005
00:45:41.854 --> 00:45:44.925
other goals, like connect with their husband or wife

1006
00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:47.405
or going from single to being in a romantic

1007
00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:49.284
relationship or something like that, you know.

1008
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.040
So let me ask you now another question at

1009
00:45:53.189 --> 00:45:57.169
this point. Do we have any idea at all

1010
00:45:57.179 --> 00:46:01.770
about how many people out there actually prefer to

1011
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.879
remain single and do not want any romantic relationships

1012
00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:09.540
at all, I mean, do we have any good

1013
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:10.449
data on that?

1014
00:46:11.399 --> 00:46:14.860
We really don't. Yeah, we really don't. Um And,

1015
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:15.949
and you know, I mean, I think that we

1016
00:46:15.959 --> 00:46:18.780
don't even have the right conceptualizations for it. Yeah,

1017
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:21.000
because um you know, even when we were talking

1018
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.020
before about, you know, are you voluntarily single? Like

1019
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.500
this is, this is the way this question often

1020
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.260
gets framed is, are people voluntarily single or not?

1021
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.449
But even voluntarily single can mean different things like

1022
00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:36.090
voluntarily single can mean no matter who you present

1023
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.500
to me is a potential dating option. I don't

1024
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.229
want to date anybody, but it could also mean

1025
00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:42.770
and this is the narrative. I feel like I

1026
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.129
hear more often is given the choices to date

1027
00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:50.590
in my community. I'm not interested in dating any

1028
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.010
of those people, right? Um So I, I don't

1029
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.429
think we even have fully have the conceptualization yet.

1030
00:46:56.439 --> 00:46:58.620
I mean, you know, my sense of the data

1031
00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:02.260
is that um you know, the average person has

1032
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.070
some desire for romantic relationship. I do think that

1033
00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.459
romantic desire and sexual desire is pretty normative. Um

1034
00:47:09.469 --> 00:47:12.500
But there are also large percentages of people. Uh

1035
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.750
uh And especially this is the thing is I

1036
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.600
think that in research, sometimes we talk about it

1037
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.239
in terms of percentages, but you don't need a

1038
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.310
very high percentage to be talking about millions of

1039
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.219
people in the world's population, right? So there's definitely

1040
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.360
significant numbers of people uh who are not interested

1041
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.639
in romantic connection. I guess the other thing I

1042
00:47:30.649 --> 00:47:31.919
would say about all that too is that I

1043
00:47:31.929 --> 00:47:34.550
think that that uh we've kind of implicitly been

1044
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.209
talking about it this way. And I think people

1045
00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:38.659
often do is if this is a trait, you

1046
00:47:38.669 --> 00:47:42.300
know, but within each person, like people often go

1047
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.060
through phases of like dating is the last thing

1048
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.159
that I want or dating is the top priority

1049
00:47:47.169 --> 00:47:49.679
on my list. And so, um I think that

1050
00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:53.179
in addition to asking the question of like, um

1051
00:47:53.459 --> 00:47:57.040
you know, what percentage of people currently have no

1052
00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.550
desire, um you know, asking questions like what percentage

1053
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.280
of people at some point in their adult life

1054
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.500
have no desire or what percentage of a person's

1055
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.649
life do they spend desiring versus not desiring a

1056
00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:12.729
relationship? And sometimes that period of not desiring a

1057
00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:16.000
relationship is after you're married, for example, right? So

1058
00:48:16.219 --> 00:48:18.659
um it's a, it's complicated. So, yeah, no, I

1059
00:48:18.669 --> 00:48:20.239
mean, that's a long way to say like, no,

1060
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.870
again, I'm gonna take it, we don't know on

1061
00:48:21.879 --> 00:48:22.399
this one

1062
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.389
and of course, we're talking mostly about single people

1063
00:48:26.399 --> 00:48:31.419
here. But uh why, what are the main reasons

1064
00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:35.879
why people want romantic relationships? I guess that you've

1065
00:48:35.889 --> 00:48:38.820
already ended up uh touching on some of these,

1066
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.780
particularly when earlier I asked you about interpersonal aspects

1067
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.129
of singlehood. But uh tell us more about it.

1068
00:48:47.139 --> 00:48:48.719
What are the main reasons?

1069
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.790
Yeah. So, I mean, I feel like this question

1070
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.969
is like, you know, to the extent that there's

1071
00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:56.229
a number of things that are being contested in

1072
00:48:56.239 --> 00:48:58.129
the single hood studies space. I mean, I would

1073
00:48:58.139 --> 00:48:59.800
say that this is one of the big ones,

1074
00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.600
right? Um And so I think that the field

1075
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.909
that I come from romantic relationship research in a

1076
00:49:05.919 --> 00:49:08.409
lot of ways, you know, it's a very psychology

1077
00:49:08.419 --> 00:49:11.830
focused, it's a very individual focused kind of discipline.

1078
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.179
And, you know, we think a lot about, for

1079
00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:18.270
example, the evolutionary underpinnings of romantic and sexual desire.

1080
00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:20.899
Um And there are some very good arguments to

1081
00:49:20.909 --> 00:49:23.030
be made there. I mean, we are a pair

1082
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.810
bonding species. It doesn't mean that everyone pair bonds

1083
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.709
and it doesn't mean that when you pair bond,

1084
00:49:27.719 --> 00:49:30.379
it's guaranteed to stick for life. But compared to

1085
00:49:30.485 --> 00:49:32.415
other species, I mean, we are a pair bonding

1086
00:49:32.425 --> 00:49:34.854
species and there's some good arguments as to why

1087
00:49:34.864 --> 00:49:36.975
that is, there's also some really good arguments as

1088
00:49:36.985 --> 00:49:39.854
to why sexual desire should be common. I think

1089
00:49:39.864 --> 00:49:41.685
there's a good argument that we as a species

1090
00:49:41.695 --> 00:49:44.665
would not be here if we didn't have sexual

1091
00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:47.425
desires, a relatively high priority for a lot of

1092
00:49:47.435 --> 00:49:50.709
people, right? Um And so I think that psychology

1093
00:49:50.719 --> 00:49:54.040
has tended to focus largely on these kinds of

1094
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.979
like innate evolutionarily driven processes as explaining why it

1095
00:49:58.989 --> 00:50:01.840
is that we pair bond and have romantic desire.

1096
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.040
But I would say that what the evolutionary perspective

1097
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.929
is and in psychology in general has done a

1098
00:50:05.939 --> 00:50:09.590
poor job of is taking a more sociological perspective

1099
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.209
and thinking about, you know, what are the social

1100
00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:16.375
structures that people are surrounded by, that encourage particular

1101
00:50:16.385 --> 00:50:20.016
normative life paths, right? Um And so it is

1102
00:50:20.025 --> 00:50:23.055
true in an awful lot of societies, it is

1103
00:50:23.065 --> 00:50:27.055
considered the morally correct thing to do to, you

1104
00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:30.176
know, for example, carry on the family line to,

1105
00:50:30.365 --> 00:50:32.706
um you know, marriage has been used as a

1106
00:50:32.716 --> 00:50:36.216
political tool, for example, uh that's been, you know,

1107
00:50:36.226 --> 00:50:38.815
not so much about romantic desire, but has been

1108
00:50:38.825 --> 00:50:42.006
more about, you know, using that structure of pair

1109
00:50:42.016 --> 00:50:45.122
bonding for the like political kinds of purposes, right?

1110
00:50:45.312 --> 00:50:47.041
Um And I would say that it's, I mean,

1111
00:50:47.052 --> 00:50:49.382
to me, it's one of the most fun things

1112
00:50:49.392 --> 00:50:52.181
about working in singlehood studies is there's a lot

1113
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:56.342
of disciplines talk about being interdisciplinary, but like you

1114
00:50:56.352 --> 00:50:58.521
can't get away from it here. You know, I

1115
00:50:58.531 --> 00:51:00.231
mean, having said that I would say that the

1116
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:03.461
sociological side of things often hasn't been really exposed

1117
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:05.802
to the evolutionary arguments, right? And so I think

1118
00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:08.082
that, like, we need to work on integrating those

1119
00:51:08.092 --> 00:51:11.679
two because from my perspective, it's just kind of

1120
00:51:11.689 --> 00:51:14.379
obvious that it has to be both, right? Like

1121
00:51:14.389 --> 00:51:17.840
there's these bottom up things where people around the

1122
00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:20.969
world experience romantic love, like that is absolutely a

1123
00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:25.689
thing. And the ubiquitous ubiquitousness of that culturally, I

1124
00:51:25.699 --> 00:51:27.239
think is one of the points in favor of

1125
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.550
the idea that this is an evolved phenomenon, right?

1126
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.399
Um But at the same time, like if you

1127
00:51:32.409 --> 00:51:35.949
look at how relationships have changed across history, right?

1128
00:51:36.149 --> 00:51:37.949
The kind of structures, I mean, all you have

1129
00:51:37.959 --> 00:51:40.389
to do is travel to a different culture and

1130
00:51:40.399 --> 00:51:42.860
see like dating norms, for example, like in the

1131
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.030
west, there's this thing where people date for years

1132
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.250
and try out different people before they ever get

1133
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.139
married. There's other cultures where you don't date, you

1134
00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:53.239
just like you, you know, you and your family

1135
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.610
pick somebody and you get married for example, right?

1136
00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.590
So I think it's both and I think that

1137
00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.179
that's going to be one of the challenges for

1138
00:52:00.189 --> 00:52:02.610
single hood studies is like we, we need to

1139
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.889
not be on one team or the other, right?

1140
00:52:04.899 --> 00:52:06.719
Like we need to realize like both of these

1141
00:52:06.729 --> 00:52:09.649
are reasons why um there is both social pressure

1142
00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:13.080
to get married and there intrinsic sorry, there's social

1143
00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:16.649
pressure to be in romantic relationships, an intrinsic desire

1144
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:18.540
to be in romantic relationships for a lot of

1145
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.459
people. It's really interesting how those interplay with each

1146
00:52:21.469 --> 00:52:23.340
other. And I think that's what the field is

1147
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.850
going to need to wrestle with in the in

1148
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.840
the near future.

1149
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.310
Yeah, I I mean a few years ago I

1150
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.139
have on the show, Doctor Helen Fisher and the

1151
00:52:31.149 --> 00:52:35.580
data she has about how we we we ubiquitous

1152
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:40.790
romantic relationships and romantic love is across different even

1153
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.649
cultures and also the commonality of, um, symptoms of

1154
00:52:46.659 --> 00:52:49.360
romantic love across cultures. I mean, it is very

1155
00:52:49.456 --> 00:52:53.486
compelling but even she herself says that even from

1156
00:52:53.496 --> 00:52:57.395
an evolutionary perspective, we shouldn't expect it to last

1157
00:52:57.406 --> 00:53:00.545
very long or even to last for a lifetime,

1158
00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:03.436
at least with the same person. And also, of

1159
00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:07.956
course, that data doesn't tell us anything about whether

1160
00:53:07.966 --> 00:53:11.746
it applies to every single person out there or

1161
00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:14.001
even the percent the job people with the place.

1162
00:53:15.062 --> 00:53:16.191
Yeah. And I mean, that is, I mean, I

1163
00:53:16.201 --> 00:53:17.812
think the, I mean, there's a lot of good

1164
00:53:17.822 --> 00:53:19.892
points to unpack in there. But like, you know,

1165
00:53:19.902 --> 00:53:21.721
the one that I'll go on is just, I

1166
00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.011
would say, I would say neither the sociological perspective

1167
00:53:25.221 --> 00:53:28.681
nor the evolutionary psychology perspective does a very good

1168
00:53:28.691 --> 00:53:31.451
job of dealing with individual differences. And there are

1169
00:53:31.461 --> 00:53:34.001
so many individual differences in this, there's so many

1170
00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:38.281
different types of people. Um Yeah. So, so it's

1171
00:53:38.291 --> 00:53:40.172
a, it's a broad landscape as it were.

1172
00:53:40.979 --> 00:53:44.120
Yeah. So let me ask you now, another type

1173
00:53:44.129 --> 00:53:48.520
of question. So do people who fear being single?

1174
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.139
And again, this might include at least some of

1175
00:53:51.149 --> 00:53:55.800
the young usually attached people have a more difficult

1176
00:53:55.810 --> 00:54:01.199
time letting go of ex-partners following a romantic breakup.

1177
00:54:01.979 --> 00:54:04.620
Yeah, that's something that uh definitely flashed in my

1178
00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:06.090
mind when we're, when we were talking about the

1179
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.760
challenges of anxiously attached people is that um you

1180
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:11.939
know, there are different types of bad relationships and

1181
00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:15.199
arguably one of the bad types of relationships is

1182
00:54:15.209 --> 00:54:16.790
not being able to let go of your ex

1183
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.590
partner. Um, SO it is definitely something that they

1184
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.000
have trouble with. I mean, I will say that

1185
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.389
there's kind of like a, you know, there's a

1186
00:54:25.399 --> 00:54:28.909
cultural trope that, like, sticking around your ex and

1187
00:54:28.919 --> 00:54:31.020
like having sex with your ex, for example, makes

1188
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.300
it hard to let go. There has been some

1189
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.070
research that's challenged that and suggests that, like, it

1190
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.719
might not be as bad as people think so,

1191
00:54:38.729 --> 00:54:40.250
you know. Yeah, I do, I do want to

1192
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.449
put that as a caveat that, that some researchers

1193
00:54:42.459 --> 00:54:45.129
would argue that we've overstated the, the problem with

1194
00:54:45.139 --> 00:54:47.439
that. Um I don't know, I mean, I come

1195
00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:49.860
from an attachment background and I do think that

1196
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:52.090
um to kind of put it in simple terms

1197
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.399
that you can't make space for somebody new until

1198
00:54:54.409 --> 00:54:56.199
you kind of like kick out the old person,

1199
00:54:56.209 --> 00:54:57.979
you know. So I do know that there's something

1200
00:54:57.989 --> 00:55:01.040
to be said for like adequately grieving an old

1201
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.719
relationship, letting that person go and making space for

1202
00:55:03.729 --> 00:55:06.090
somebody new. But this is the trick for anxiously

1203
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.080
attached to people is that they so strongly feel

1204
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:12.100
like they need somebody that it's hard for them

1205
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.139
to let go of that person. They they for

1206
00:55:14.149 --> 00:55:16.659
them. It's kind of like, you know, like, like

1207
00:55:16.669 --> 00:55:18.820
being on the sinking of the Titanic and just

1208
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.080
letting that door go and floating, right? Like they

1209
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.479
just feel like kind of terrified by that prospect.

1210
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.959
Um, I mean, we have done some research where

1211
00:55:26.969 --> 00:55:31.399
if you do things like reassure anxious people that

1212
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:35.219
they will meet somebody new soon, then it becomes

1213
00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:37.540
more possible for them to let go of that

1214
00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:38.939
old person. And this is, you know, when I

1215
00:55:38.949 --> 00:55:40.739
talk to my students about this, I think that

1216
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:42.989
one of the mindsets that you can get in

1217
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.149
when you get stuck on someone romantically who was

1218
00:55:45.159 --> 00:55:47.899
an ex partner is you convince yourself the reason

1219
00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:49.090
that you're stuck on them is that they have

1220
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.129
some special irreplaceable quality. And like, even if someone

1221
00:55:53.139 --> 00:55:55.469
else came along, like I wouldn't want them. It's

1222
00:55:55.479 --> 00:55:57.530
just my act like they have this halo around

1223
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.739
and they're amazing. But we did studies where, you

1224
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.639
know, we gave anxious people reason to think that

1225
00:56:03.649 --> 00:56:06.520
they would find somebody new soon. And all of

1226
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.979
a sudden this ex partner who is so special

1227
00:56:08.989 --> 00:56:11.199
and irreplaceable. As soon as you tell them that

1228
00:56:11.209 --> 00:56:13.370
someone else is gonna be coming, they let go

1229
00:56:13.379 --> 00:56:14.979
of that old person, right? And so I think

1230
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:18.229
that like it, it feels like you're hung up

1231
00:56:18.239 --> 00:56:21.780
on that person because they're special. And what is

1232
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:24.729
actually happening a lot of the time is you're

1233
00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:26.530
hung up on them because you feel like you

1234
00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.179
need somebody, you know. And so that's, that's the

1235
00:56:29.189 --> 00:56:30.649
advice I always give to people who are having

1236
00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:33.459
trouble letting go of an A is like, instead

1237
00:56:33.469 --> 00:56:36.080
of ruminating on how special and amazing that A

1238
00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:40.120
is ruminate on that feeling that you need somebody,

1239
00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:42.340
let yourself sit with that. And like that's kind

1240
00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:44.570
of the starting point for letting people go. That's

1241
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.570
just something that's harder for anxious people to do.

1242
00:56:47.459 --> 00:56:50.679
But then on the other hand, I guess that

1243
00:56:50.689 --> 00:56:53.409
there are also situations and this is one of

1244
00:56:53.419 --> 00:56:57.479
the things that really makes romantic relationships complex and

1245
00:56:57.489 --> 00:57:02.209
interesting. There's also situations where it's the fact that

1246
00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:06.459
people never really let go of the other person

1247
00:57:06.469 --> 00:57:10.070
that they eventually come back together and are happy

1248
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.469
again. I mean, there's also that sometimes

1249
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.669
I, you know, it is true. Um I'm, I'm

1250
00:57:15.679 --> 00:57:17.399
blind. There's a, there's a name for that. There's

1251
00:57:17.409 --> 00:57:20.260
been research on that. Um, LET'S call them, it's

1252
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.560
not the right name. Let's call them back and

1253
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.110
forth relationships. It does happen these like romantic coming.

1254
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.159
It's the stuff of Hollywood movies. There has to

1255
00:57:27.169 --> 00:57:29.010
be like a challenge that breaks people up and

1256
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.679
then brings them back together again. In the long

1257
00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:35.560
term. Those relationships tend to be less stable. So,

1258
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.020
uh it is, it is a romantic story but

1259
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:40.389
I mean, it's not that surprising relationships that break

1260
00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:41.949
up once are more likely to break up again

1261
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:44.149
in the future, right? So it works out sometimes

1262
00:57:44.159 --> 00:57:46.699
again, like, you know, life comes in all flavors.

1263
00:57:46.709 --> 00:57:51.149
But, um I, you know, given a choice, I

1264
00:57:51.159 --> 00:57:53.969
would, I would pick slow and steady, you know,

1265
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.959
Yeah, fair enough. So, uh, let me ask you

1266
00:57:57.969 --> 00:58:03.560
now more directly. What do singles value in their

1267
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.760
lives? Again, we've already touched a little bit on

1268
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.000
this. But what are some of the things that

1269
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:12.479
they consider to be necessities and daughters that they

1270
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.199
consider to be luxuries?

1271
00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:17.830
Yeah. So we've, we've, uh, we did some research

1272
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.830
on this specifically. Uh, I, I really like this

1273
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.969
study because we was cross cultural. We asked both

1274
00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:25.689
Western and Korean singles and the answers were relatively

1275
00:58:25.699 --> 00:58:28.060
similar. You know, when you ask them, like, what

1276
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:31.979
are the absolute fundamentals um to a happy single

1277
00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:35.830
life, the things that they say are um their

1278
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.250
uh mental health, their physical health and their family.

1279
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.810
So like those are the three foundations they describe

1280
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.969
as absolute necessities, you know, somewhere in the middle,

1281
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.979
they tend to uh nominate things like, uh you

1282
00:58:48.989 --> 00:58:52.850
know, their work life, uh their leisure life, um

1283
00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:55.530
you know, that sort of thing, their friends. Um

1284
00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.260
And we thought it was really interesting in doing

1285
00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:01.090
that research that the absolute lowest priority for them.

1286
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.010
Um OR, you know, the better way to put

1287
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.810
that is the luxury. Like once I've got my

1288
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.479
family and friends, uh once I've got my mental

1289
00:59:07.489 --> 00:59:09.919
health set, then I start to get interested in

1290
00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:12.629
romance and dating, right? Um And you know, a

1291
00:59:12.639 --> 00:59:16.100
lot of single people, I think rightly get frustrated

1292
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.370
that when people think about single people, the first

1293
00:59:18.379 --> 00:59:20.870
thing that they think about is romance and sex.

1294
00:59:20.879 --> 00:59:22.419
Like these must be people who are thinking about

1295
00:59:22.429 --> 00:59:25.199
romance and sex all the time. Uh, AND you

1296
00:59:25.209 --> 00:59:27.580
know, what you'll often hear from single people is

1297
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:29.090
they'll say, like, look, I don't want to be

1298
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.459
defined by my relationship status. And I often joke

1299
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:35.070
that for me as a researcher, it's really frustrating

1300
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.879
because literally what defines you is your relationship status

1301
00:59:37.889 --> 00:59:40.580
if we're defining single versus partnered people. But what

1302
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:42.229
they mean by that, what I take from that

1303
00:59:42.239 --> 00:59:46.149
is that, you know, single lives in most ways

1304
00:59:46.159 --> 00:59:48.889
are not that different from partnered lives, the kind

1305
00:59:48.899 --> 00:59:50.969
of things that they're occupied by that, they think

1306
00:59:50.979 --> 00:59:53.750
about, you know, maintaining a good relationship with their

1307
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.959
family, you know, maintaining their physical health, that that's

1308
00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:59.020
like a foundation that they want to build on.

1309
00:59:59.239 --> 01:00:01.649
Um YOU know, kind of the next level is

1310
01:00:01.659 --> 01:00:05.260
getting your like career and financial situation in place,

1311
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.199
right? Um And then that's the kind of foundation,

1312
01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.729
you know, like, for example, if you, if you're

1313
01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:13.120
the kind of person who's thinking about having kids,

1314
01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:15.270
you don't have kids and then figure out your

1315
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.280
job, right? Like it goes in the opposite direction.

1316
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.850
And this is why a lot of people are

1317
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.639
talking about like the struggles of the current generation

1318
01:00:22.649 --> 01:00:26.320
where, you know, employment tends to be more unstable.

1319
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.899
It's harder to buy a house, for example, like

1320
01:00:28.909 --> 01:00:30.939
it's harder to set yourself up with like a

1321
01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.340
stable foundation. And so I think people sometimes are

1322
01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:36.489
like, oh, you know, these, these crazy kids not

1323
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.610
wanting love and stuff like that and it's like,

1324
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.620
look, when you take the foundation for relationships out

1325
01:00:41.629 --> 01:00:44.340
from underneath society, like people are going to be

1326
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.530
rational and are gonna be like, look, it's, it's

1327
01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.800
too uncertain for me to plan for the future.

1328
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.629
And so why would I be thinking about dating

1329
01:00:51.639 --> 01:00:53.889
and sex when I haven't even gotten my, like,

1330
01:00:53.899 --> 01:00:57.360
job and my career set? Right. Um So, you

1331
01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.330
know, that, that's, that's just it, I think that,

1332
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.189
I think that for, for single people, uh their

1333
01:01:02.199 --> 01:01:04.820
lives in, in that sense are like very mundane

1334
01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.370
and like everybody else's life that they have very

1335
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.699
normal things that occupy them on a day to

1336
01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:11.600
day basis. And probably in a lot of cases,

1337
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.179
very much the same kinds of things that are

1338
01:01:13.189 --> 01:01:16.300
occupying people in relationships. But, yeah, once they get

1339
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:19.949
that set that our data suggests only then if

1340
01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.879
they're interested in dating and sex, do they start

1341
01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:23.060
to make that a priority?

1342
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.979
Mhm. And I would bet that that bit about

1343
01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:30.610
having certain aspects of your life stable before getting

1344
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.429
into a relationship or even, uh more drastically into

1345
01:01:34.439 --> 01:01:39.800
marriage and having kids, uh, would be cross-cultural, more

1346
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.310
or less the same, at least to some extent

1347
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.639
because for example, I'm very interested in Japan, Japanese

1348
01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:50.340
culture and, and history. And, uh I know that

1349
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:53.659
back in the late eighties when they had a

1350
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:58.500
big financial crisis that really ST destabilized the system

1351
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.030
and they were used to getting out of, uh,

1352
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.939
to finishing college and getting a corporate job that

1353
01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:07.919
would last for their life. I mean, they would

1354
01:02:07.929 --> 01:02:10.379
never be fired or anything like that. It would

1355
01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:13.445
be a stable there. That's the kind of culture

1356
01:02:13.544 --> 01:02:16.084
they used to have there. It, but it was

1357
01:02:16.094 --> 01:02:20.084
immediately after that, that rates of single would really

1358
01:02:20.094 --> 01:02:25.084
rose and rates of marriage really started limiting. So

1359
01:02:25.195 --> 01:02:27.844
that's another example. I guess there

1360
01:02:27.854 --> 01:02:29.955
is a, there is a fantastic paper on exactly

1361
01:02:29.965 --> 01:02:33.570
what you're talking about by Akiko Yoshida. Uh WHO

1362
01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.219
I'm, I'm just such a fan of her work

1363
01:02:35.229 --> 01:02:38.030
and she's, that is exactly her narrative is that,

1364
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.540
you know, that one of the points that she

1365
01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:42.070
makes and there's a number of single hood researchers

1366
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.879
that are not from the West who make this

1367
01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.219
point is that in the West, we tend to

1368
01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:49.604
be kind of obsessed with autonomy and we assume

1369
01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:51.715
that people do things because they choose it, right?

1370
01:02:51.725 --> 01:02:53.804
Because that, that, that's what Western culture is largely

1371
01:02:53.814 --> 01:02:55.675
about. And they make the point that like that's

1372
01:02:55.685 --> 01:02:58.024
really leaked into singlehood studies. And so a lot

1373
01:02:58.034 --> 01:03:00.715
of the discourse and singlehood studies about, oh, well,

1374
01:03:00.725 --> 01:03:03.665
more people are single. It must be because people

1375
01:03:03.675 --> 01:03:06.959
are choosing to be single, right? Um And Akiko's

1376
01:03:06.969 --> 01:03:08.580
point and the, and the point of, of other

1377
01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.070
researchers and she makes this case specifically in Japan

1378
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.040
is exactly what you're talking about is that with

1379
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:18.959
that solid foundation pulled away from people now, I

1380
01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:20.750
mean, not only do they not have this like,

1381
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.760
stable economic foundation to build on, but they don't

1382
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:25.750
even know what the norms are anymore. Like, it

1383
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.199
used to be a very clear path to check

1384
01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:30.560
certain boxes to get to a certain end state

1385
01:03:30.919 --> 01:03:32.770
and people are kind of left with like, what

1386
01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.320
are we supposed to do now? So she makes

1387
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:37.219
the argument that in Japan. Um AND I think

1388
01:03:37.229 --> 01:03:39.379
that I think this argument generalizes to some other

1389
01:03:39.389 --> 01:03:42.260
places as well. That one of the problems is

1390
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.500
that the old norms are still there even though

1391
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.909
the system has changed. And so, you know, she

1392
01:03:47.919 --> 01:03:51.040
uses as an example of that. Um THERE used

1393
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.000
to be a huge imbalance between how much money

1394
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:56.699
women were making and men were making. And there's

1395
01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:58.645
still a gap, a lot more women have entered

1396
01:03:58.655 --> 01:04:01.534
the Japanese workforce. But she argues one of the

1397
01:04:01.544 --> 01:04:03.814
things that happened is that there's still that norm

1398
01:04:03.824 --> 01:04:05.754
of I'm supposed to date somebody who makes more

1399
01:04:05.764 --> 01:04:08.425
money than me. But as women's salaries have gone

1400
01:04:08.435 --> 01:04:11.064
up, there's not as many men who make more

1401
01:04:11.074 --> 01:04:13.354
money than the women, right? Same thing with the

1402
01:04:13.364 --> 01:04:15.225
like, men are still expecting women to do all

1403
01:04:15.235 --> 01:04:17.334
the housework even though so many Japanese women have

1404
01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:20.405
entered the workforce, right? So there's these old norms

1405
01:04:20.415 --> 01:04:22.905
that don't work well for the new situation. So,

1406
01:04:23.149 --> 01:04:25.080
um yeah. No, I think that's an interesting case.

1407
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.699
I will say apropos of nothing. I was actually

1408
01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:29.959
in Japan last month. I'm a big fan of

1409
01:04:29.969 --> 01:04:32.969
Sumo wrestling. Uh AND we had the opportunity to,

1410
01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:34.840
to go to the arena and see some Sumo

1411
01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.469
and it was fantastic. Great,

1412
01:04:37.479 --> 01:04:40.594
great. So let me ask you now. So the

1413
01:04:40.604 --> 01:04:46.195
satisfaction with being single change with age, I mean,

1414
01:04:46.205 --> 01:04:49.754
is it that, for example, older people tend, it

1415
01:04:49.764 --> 01:04:53.145
tends to be easier for them to be satisfied

1416
01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:56.625
with being single than for younger people or not?

1417
01:04:57.419 --> 01:04:59.149
Yeah, that's what our, that's what our data look

1418
01:04:59.159 --> 01:05:00.969
like. It like. It looks like there's an inflection

1419
01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:05.290
point at about age 40 where people's satisfaction with

1420
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.459
singlehood starts to go up. Um I think a

1421
01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:12.080
big part of that is that data in general

1422
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:15.260
suggests that at about midlife, people start to become

1423
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.629
happier with their life. Um You know, I I

1424
01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:21.790
there's, there's um you know, things like socio emotional

1425
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.530
selectivity theory that argue that like as you get

1426
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.219
older, you stop thinking so far in the future

1427
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.459
and you just start enjoying what you have now

1428
01:05:29.469 --> 01:05:31.110
in the short term, right? And so that's part

1429
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.489
of it is people just kind of structurally enjoy

1430
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.429
their lives more. Um And part of the reason

1431
01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:38.280
I think that this isn't just about single people

1432
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.689
is that there's also uh there was a good

1433
01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:43.479
paper by Janina Buehler showing that exactly the same

1434
01:05:43.489 --> 01:05:46.060
is true. People in relationships that after about age

1435
01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.969
40 if you're in a relationship, you're happier about

1436
01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.600
being in a relationship. If you're single, you're happier

1437
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:53.629
about being single. So, I think a chunk of

1438
01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:56.304
that is just people get happy with full stop.

1439
01:05:56.314 --> 01:05:57.834
I mean, I think what's important in a single

1440
01:05:57.844 --> 01:05:59.145
book case is that, I think a lot of

1441
01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.715
people would assume that older singles are unhappy. And

1442
01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.175
so maybe if there's a group that it wouldn't

1443
01:06:04.185 --> 01:06:06.935
apply to would be single people, that doesn't seem

1444
01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:09.034
to be the case. I mean, I do think

1445
01:06:09.044 --> 01:06:13.084
there are probably some relationship status specific parts to

1446
01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.935
this that um you know, by the time you

1447
01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:17.959
get to 40 I think that you've got a

1448
01:06:17.969 --> 01:06:20.760
pretty good sense of, are you a relationship person

1449
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.239
or are you a single person if you want

1450
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.780
to be in a relationship, you've had a decent

1451
01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:28.659
amount of time to get yourself in a relationship.

1452
01:06:28.669 --> 01:06:30.399
You know. So I think part of it is

1453
01:06:30.409 --> 01:06:32.030
selection is that by the time you get to

1454
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.540
midlife you're kind of in the place that you

1455
01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:37.209
want to be. There is a little bit of

1456
01:06:37.219 --> 01:06:40.169
data and see this is where it's, it's challenging

1457
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:44.080
because once you get up to like 70 plus

1458
01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.479
the number of participants, it's a little macabre but

1459
01:06:47.489 --> 01:06:49.800
start to drop off, right. And so like it's

1460
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:53.459
harder to get big samples in those older ages.

1461
01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:55.879
There's a little bit of data that suggests to

1462
01:06:55.889 --> 01:07:00.639
me possibly that satisfaction with singlehood might start to

1463
01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.750
level off at the point when people are starting,

1464
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.649
uh you know, to develop more health issues and

1465
01:07:05.659 --> 01:07:07.580
like getting closer to end of life, that kind

1466
01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:08.889
of thing. So to me, that's still a bit

1467
01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:11.500
of an open question, but certainly in that period,

1468
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:15.399
from like 40 to like 70 people just seem

1469
01:07:15.409 --> 01:07:17.689
to get happier and happier with being in whichever

1470
01:07:17.699 --> 01:07:19.100
relationship status they're in.

1471
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.340
And I would imagine that there's also that subset

1472
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:28.560
of older people that, uh, very, unfortunately, even though

1473
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:32.979
they were for, in committed relationships for a very,

1474
01:07:32.989 --> 01:07:36.889
very, very long time, eventually their spouse dies and

1475
01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:40.360
then in their older age they have to adapt

1476
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:44.389
to perhaps being single for, uh, sometimes for the

1477
01:07:44.399 --> 01:07:45.500
rest of their lives.

1478
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:48.989
Right. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and, you know, I

1479
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.729
mean, the research definitely shows that, that divorce and

1480
01:07:51.739 --> 01:07:53.620
widowhood, I mean, they, they do take a toll

1481
01:07:53.629 --> 01:07:56.550
on people, you know, obviously it does undermine people's

1482
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.330
well being. Um, AND it's a real challenge. I

1483
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.459
mean, having said that, I mean, there's two points

1484
01:08:01.469 --> 01:08:03.389
that I always think about one is that, I

1485
01:08:03.399 --> 01:08:07.290
mean, people are incredibly adaptable, you know. Um, AND

1486
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.810
so this is the thing I think that even

1487
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.929
talking about, like, single, you know, are you a

1488
01:08:11.939 --> 01:08:14.560
single person or are you a relationship person? I

1489
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:18.359
think most people are capable of managing life either

1490
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.310
way and we're very good, you know, what, what

1491
01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:25.009
people call, what research call secondary coping of making

1492
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.120
the best of our situation, you know. Um And

1493
01:08:28.129 --> 01:08:29.879
so I think that people are good at adapting.

1494
01:08:30.049 --> 01:08:32.979
The other thing about widowhood is that, you know,

1495
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:34.500
I don't think this is clear in the data

1496
01:08:34.509 --> 01:08:36.189
yet, but one of the arguments is that one

1497
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.750
of the reasons why singlehood can be problematic, I

1498
01:08:38.759 --> 01:08:40.490
would bet Bella talked about this a bit is

1499
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.660
the social norms around being single, right? Um And

1500
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:45.259
one of the things that happens as you get

1501
01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:48.089
older and people start to pass away is that

1502
01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.100
because there are a number of widows, it is

1503
01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:53.060
more and more normal to be single. And so

1504
01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:55.350
I think in that sense, right? There's more people

1505
01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.549
to spend time with, there's more people to commiserate

1506
01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.870
with. So, you know, I I'm certainly not trying

1507
01:08:59.879 --> 01:09:03.149
to argue that widowhood is easy, you know, but

1508
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.560
I do have a lot of faith in people's

1509
01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:07.890
adaptability and, and the social structure of people's social

1510
01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:09.410
lives is, is different when they get up to

1511
01:09:09.419 --> 01:09:10.319
that age, you know.

1512
01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:15.249
So earlier, I asked you if we have any

1513
01:09:15.258 --> 01:09:19.729
idea about the number of people that uh like

1514
01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:23.330
being single or want to be single. But do

1515
01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:27.540
we know if singlehood is on the rise? Because

1516
01:09:27.549 --> 01:09:30.609
this is something that some people worry a lot

1517
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:35.009
about that. Sometimes they point to statistics that say

1518
01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.359
exactly that even more. So they look into statistics

1519
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.819
coming from younger people and they look at, uh,

1520
01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:48.169
sexless and them not being partnered with other people.

1521
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.649
So is single hood on the rise or?

1522
01:09:51.089 --> 01:09:53.279
That's, I mean, my sense is that, that's the

1523
01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.970
clear consensus in the data. Um I think that

1524
01:09:55.979 --> 01:09:57.520
the, the, the, you know, if you look at,

1525
01:09:57.529 --> 01:10:01.529
uh, figures like, um, you know, when do people

1526
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.990
get married if they get married at all, if

1527
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.060
they divorce, do they get remarried? Um, YOU know,

1528
01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:08.319
the big one that I've seen a lot of

1529
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.560
is the percentage of people living alone. Um, AND,

1530
01:10:11.569 --> 01:10:13.029
you know, living alone is not the same as

1531
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.149
having a romantic partner, is not having a romantic

1532
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.779
partner, but they're correlated. And so I think all

1533
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.740
of the indicators suggest that worldwide and that, that

1534
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.439
is the thing that's really interesting to me is

1535
01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:25.500
that I think that psychology in particular has gotten

1536
01:10:25.509 --> 01:10:28.600
into a lot of trouble by like, collecting data

1537
01:10:28.609 --> 01:10:31.379
in America and then being like, oh, worldwide phenomenon,

1538
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:35.629
right? But this is legitimately a worldwide phenomenon from

1539
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.020
what I can tell. And so that makes it

1540
01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:38.500
interesting, I would say, like, kind of like you're

1541
01:10:38.509 --> 01:10:42.680
pointing to the big debate isn't, is single hood

1542
01:10:42.689 --> 01:10:44.620
on the rise. The big debate is, is this,

1543
01:10:44.629 --> 01:10:46.259
is this a good thing or a bad thing?

1544
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:50.439
Right. And, and I, I mean, do you have

1545
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.839
any opinion on that? Is, is it mostly a

1546
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.600
group or mostly a bad thing.

1547
01:10:56.129 --> 01:10:58.740
You know, I don't think, you know, I don't

1548
01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.830
think that we know well enough yet, you know,

1549
01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:03.649
I don't think that we have enough data. Um,

1550
01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:07.709
YOU know, II, I certainly recognize the argument that

1551
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:12.339
there are probably people throughout at least recent history

1552
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:16.379
who would have been happier without a romantic relationship.

1553
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:17.459
And again, I mean, I think this is where

1554
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:20.069
individual differences come in. Right. That I think that,

1555
01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:22.620
you know, to the extent that romantic relationships have

1556
01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:24.910
been more in men's favor than women's favor, for

1557
01:11:24.919 --> 01:11:28.350
example, and women haven't always had the political power

1558
01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:30.720
to make choices for themselves. I think there's an

1559
01:11:30.729 --> 01:11:33.274
argument to me made that for women in particular,

1560
01:11:33.285 --> 01:11:35.794
this has the potential to be a good thing.

1561
01:11:35.805 --> 01:11:38.384
You know, that, that if those increasing numbers of

1562
01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:43.095
singlehood, for example, didn't mean people never getting partnered,

1563
01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:47.495
but people being more having more opportunity to choose

1564
01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.524
whether they get in a relationship and with whom

1565
01:11:49.535 --> 01:11:52.104
they get in a relationship, like that's probably a

1566
01:11:52.115 --> 01:11:54.970
good thing. Um You know, I do come from

1567
01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:58.200
a romantic relationship research background and also just the

1568
01:11:58.209 --> 01:12:00.140
data that I've seen. Again, it makes it clear

1569
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.540
to me that for the average person, um they're

1570
01:12:03.549 --> 01:12:06.209
happier being partnered than not being partnered. And I

1571
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.279
do think that romantic relationships bring a lot of

1572
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:14.100
benefits that um sexual satisfaction among partnered versus single

1573
01:12:14.109 --> 01:12:17.279
people. It is an enormous difference like the effect

1574
01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:20.350
size on that difference is enormous. And so people

1575
01:12:20.359 --> 01:12:26.040
are considerably more sexually gratified in romantic relationships, people

1576
01:12:26.049 --> 01:12:29.259
get higher levels of social support from their romantic

1577
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:32.390
partners, right? Um And there's all kinds of good

1578
01:12:32.399 --> 01:12:35.319
work showing that, you know, social support and social

1579
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:39.189
connection is related to well being outcomes both in

1580
01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.020
terms of mental and physical health. Right? I do

1581
01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:44.399
agree. I think that there are a lot of

1582
01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:48.680
parts of romantic relationships that are replaceable, right? And

1583
01:12:48.689 --> 01:12:50.180
so if you're the kind of person who's not

1584
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:53.379
interested in a romantic relationship, you can put together

1585
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:56.759
great social support networks, you can, uh there's all

1586
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.870
kinds of things that you can do. I guess

1587
01:12:58.879 --> 01:13:00.950
the one thing and, and this isn't database, this

1588
01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:03.589
is kind of just more my sense of things

1589
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.410
is that the thing about a romantic relationship in

1590
01:13:07.419 --> 01:13:10.129
the conventional way that people do it is it's

1591
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.560
very convenient one stop shopping for all of those

1592
01:13:13.569 --> 01:13:16.310
things, right? Like, um and it is true, you

1593
01:13:16.319 --> 01:13:19.009
know, as people get older in particular people's energy

1594
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.290
levels go down, their interest in trying out new

1595
01:13:22.299 --> 01:13:25.560
relationships or exploring new things kind of goes down

1596
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:27.450
and when you get to more of that stage

1597
01:13:27.459 --> 01:13:29.799
of your life where you don't wanna go out

1598
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:31.589
all the time, you don't wanna meet new people

1599
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.000
all the time. I do think that romantic relationships

1600
01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:37.140
provide enormous benefits. Now, I, I do think there's

1601
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:39.689
a good argument that part of this might be

1602
01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.479
because we've structured society in a way to make

1603
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:45.640
it easy for people to have romantic relationships. And

1604
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:48.600
let's say we started building apartments that were more

1605
01:13:48.609 --> 01:13:52.560
single focused that allowed people like common spaces where

1606
01:13:52.569 --> 01:13:54.040
they could go and get some of these needs

1607
01:13:54.049 --> 01:13:56.569
met. Maybe there are structural changes we could make,

1608
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:59.370
that would make that easier. But yeah, I do

1609
01:13:59.379 --> 01:14:02.450
think that for a lot of people, there are

1610
01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:04.720
important benefits that they get out of a romantic

1611
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:09.609
connection. Um And it's just, it's just considerably more

1612
01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.049
convenient so that particularly as people age, it can

1613
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.709
be a very healthy way for people to get

1614
01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.160
their needs met. But that's contingent on it being

1615
01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:19.859
a good relationship. And I think like a lot

1616
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.069
of people, I would say that a bad relationship

1617
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.759
is worse than being single. Yeah. And also

1618
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:29.346
about that, uh and about being on the rise

1619
01:14:29.355 --> 01:14:32.436
and some of those studies, particularly the ones about

1620
01:14:32.445 --> 01:14:36.166
sex lessness. Uh I've also talked with Bella Depolo

1621
01:14:36.175 --> 01:14:38.625
about this and she agreed with me on this

1622
01:14:38.636 --> 01:14:40.976
point, I guess that some of those studies that

1623
01:14:40.985 --> 01:14:44.175
sometimes we see on the media, on the internet,

1624
01:14:44.186 --> 01:14:48.715
social media and elsewhere where they present uh graphic

1625
01:14:48.726 --> 01:14:51.122
with the number of people, people that over the

1626
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:54.242
course of the last year, for example, haven't had

1627
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:58.202
sex at all and uh younger people over the

1628
01:14:58.211 --> 01:15:01.041
past few decades, it apparently has gone up the

1629
01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:04.631
number of people who have zero sex over the

1630
01:15:04.642 --> 01:15:07.791
last year or something like that. Perhaps those studies

1631
01:15:07.801 --> 01:15:10.211
are also, or, or perhaps they are, but we

1632
01:15:10.222 --> 01:15:13.600
are not given that information, but maybe they're not

1633
01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.680
detailed enough in terms of, is it the case

1634
01:15:16.689 --> 01:15:21.020
that most of those people feel bad about it?

1635
01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:24.930
Is it they're that they're just reporting that? But

1636
01:15:24.939 --> 01:15:27.299
they don't even feel bad. I mean, I would

1637
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:31.649
imagine that it wouldn't very realistic to think that

1638
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.049
most of those people would not feel bad about

1639
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.660
being sexless for a year or even more. But

1640
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:43.859
at least perhaps some of them wouldn't care that

1641
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:45.009
much about it.

1642
01:15:45.919 --> 01:15:48.160
Yeah, I mean, you know, again, it's an individual

1643
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.290
difference and I, you know, I don't know, off

1644
01:15:50.299 --> 01:15:52.620
the top of my head. Well enough, like what

1645
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:55.450
are like, average levels of sexual desire among single

1646
01:15:55.459 --> 01:15:58.390
people. But, you know, our data definitely indicate that

1647
01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:03.009
there would be a substantial number of those people

1648
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.939
who are not having sex and are not troubled

1649
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:08.930
by it, you know. Um, BUT there would be

1650
01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:11.290
a substantial percentage of people who would be, you

1651
01:16:11.299 --> 01:16:13.879
know. So, yeah, I, you know, again, I think

1652
01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:16.060
that the, I, I think that the jury is

1653
01:16:16.069 --> 01:16:17.689
kind of out in terms of like, is this

1654
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.850
a good thing or a bad thing necessarily? Um,

1655
01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.339
BUT yeah, I think, I think you would get

1656
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:24.040
all kinds of different people there. But yeah, I

1657
01:16:24.049 --> 01:16:26.089
can, it is, again, it's, it'll be the single

1658
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.919
people who are frustrated by it who are gonna

1659
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.799
be the less happy singles? I mean, again though,

1660
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:31.930
I mean, this is, I mean, this is another

1661
01:16:31.939 --> 01:16:33.580
point that I often make because I also think

1662
01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.950
that like psychology can often be a very, we

1663
01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:40.750
should be so simplistic. Sometimes we're like positive emotion,

1664
01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:43.939
good, negative emotion, bad, but negative emotion is not

1665
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.049
necessarily a bad thing. Like it's a good thing

1666
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.140
that we feel hungry otherwise we wouldn't be motivated

1667
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:51.160
to go out to eat, right? And sometimes I

1668
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:53.540
think about this when we talk about like people

1669
01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:56.490
who are unhappy singles for like, like all kinds

1670
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.450
of happy singles and they're stable and they, and

1671
01:16:58.459 --> 01:16:59.790
they should, you know, that's the life that you

1672
01:16:59.799 --> 01:17:02.859
should be living. But you know, being an unhappy

1673
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.430
single, maybe that's what motivates you to do something

1674
01:17:05.439 --> 01:17:07.359
to put yourself in a romantic relationship and make

1675
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.649
yourself happier, you know.

1676
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.279
Yeah, exactly. So let me just ask you two

1677
01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:16.180
more questions. These will be the last ones about

1678
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:21.040
perhaps things that I would bet everyone out there

1679
01:17:21.049 --> 01:17:24.859
has experienced to some degree or another in their

1680
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:29.379
romantic life. So do people care more, more about

1681
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.680
missed romantic opportunities or rejection?

1682
01:17:35.009 --> 01:17:39.200
Yeah, I mean, our uh data suggest that at

1683
01:17:39.209 --> 01:17:43.390
least when you get people looking back on uh

1684
01:17:43.399 --> 01:17:45.689
the kinds of romantic experiences that they've had in

1685
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.950
the past that uh over the long term, they

1686
01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:52.919
are more troubled by um you know, opportunities that

1687
01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:55.069
they might have had and never took, than, than,

1688
01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.479
you know, shooting their shot and, and getting, uh,

1689
01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.160
you know, getting shot down. Um, YOU know, I

1690
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:01.569
mean, that's, I think it's one of these, like,

1691
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.089
short term, long term things where, like, I bet

1692
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.810
you it feels worse in the short term to

1693
01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:08.870
get rejected, but in the long term, yeah, our

1694
01:18:08.879 --> 01:18:11.810
data suggests that, um, you know, not taking your

1695
01:18:11.819 --> 01:18:13.520
shot is something that people regret more.

1696
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.600
Yeah. I, I also imagine that at least rejection

1697
01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:24.049
allows for, uh, more easily closing off that bet,

1698
01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.049
let's say, because at least we know for sure

1699
01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.490
that it wouldn't work.

1700
01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:30.430
I think that's, I think that's a good way

1701
01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.790
to put it. I mean, mind you, you, right.

1702
01:18:31.799 --> 01:18:33.629
It's been a while since we did this research.

1703
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.470
But, you know, I do remember some people had

1704
01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:39.569
stories where, you know, they always wondered if they

1705
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.629
had a shot with this person and then they

1706
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.759
run into them at the high school reunion and

1707
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:45.600
then the person is like, you know, if you

1708
01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:48.450
had just asked me out. So, like, sometimes people

1709
01:18:48.459 --> 01:18:50.919
do get a confirmation that they missed their shot

1710
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.609
and I think that's pretty uncomfortable too.

1711
01:18:53.009 --> 01:18:57.169
It's too late to know. Ok. So my last

1712
01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:01.459
question will be then, um, I mean, because people

1713
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.729
sometimes worry about this. There's, uh, the period when

1714
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.589
we're trying to get into a relationship and then

1715
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.009
there's the period where we're already in a committed

1716
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.134
relationship. So when people, people are already in a

1717
01:19:16.145 --> 01:19:22.165
committed relationship, is it that their partner becomes less

1718
01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:27.095
judgmental over their flaws and look past them more

1719
01:19:27.104 --> 01:19:31.225
easily because this is something that people actually worry

1720
01:19:31.285 --> 01:19:32.865
sometimes a lot about.

1721
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.609
Yeah, I mean, I would say, uh, like, I

1722
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.100
wouldn't say that there is direct evidence as to

1723
01:19:39.109 --> 01:19:41.620
whether people become judgmental or not and I would,

1724
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:43.810
or, or become less judgmental or not. I mean,

1725
01:19:43.819 --> 01:19:45.330
part of it is we've been talking about with

1726
01:19:45.339 --> 01:19:48.609
a lot of this is um you know, there's

1727
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.609
some stable individual differences, right? And I don't know,

1728
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.620
I don't know, like which of the big five

1729
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:57.620
personality variables I would wanna tie with being judgmental,

1730
01:19:57.629 --> 01:20:00.339
but disagreeableness would probably be one of them, right?

1731
01:20:00.609 --> 01:20:03.060
Um And so, you know, I would say like

1732
01:20:03.069 --> 01:20:07.359
step one is try to circuit the problem by

1733
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:10.299
selecting people who are like warm and responsive and

1734
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.549
thoughtful in the first, in the first place, right?

1735
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:14.549
But I mean, you know, I mean, I mean,

1736
01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.520
all of us have thoughts about people and so

1737
01:20:17.529 --> 01:20:19.939
they'll like come out sometimes and, and all of

1738
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.040
us feel judgmental towards people at least sometimes, right?

1739
01:20:23.359 --> 01:20:25.740
Um There is a process that I, I, that

1740
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:28.979
that happens when people get into romantic relationships as

1741
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:32.180
people get more committed in, in particular. Um That's

1742
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:35.520
been described as a transformation of motivation that like

1743
01:20:35.529 --> 01:20:39.689
what happens when you get committed to somebody is

1744
01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.714
that now you want this relationship to happen for

1745
01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:45.995
the long term, right? And so your motivation changes

1746
01:20:46.004 --> 01:20:50.174
in that you start becoming less selfish and you

1747
01:20:50.185 --> 01:20:54.415
start becoming more motivated by what kinds of actions

1748
01:20:54.424 --> 01:20:56.975
will make it more likely that this relationship will

1749
01:20:56.984 --> 01:20:59.439
endure for the long term. And so I think

1750
01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:03.720
it that kind of transformation uh of motivation that,

1751
01:21:03.979 --> 01:21:05.439
you know, and I think it can work on

1752
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:06.859
both ends of this, right? I think on the

1753
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:09.770
one hand, people who are really committed to keeping

1754
01:21:09.779 --> 01:21:11.970
the relationship together are going to not want to

1755
01:21:11.979 --> 01:21:14.839
hurt their partner even if um and you know,

1756
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.520
this is like a little dark and Freudian and

1757
01:21:16.529 --> 01:21:18.720
stuff like that. But like, um but it is

1758
01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:20.580
true. I mean, all of us have the potential

1759
01:21:20.589 --> 01:21:22.359
to hurt others, right? Like all of us have

1760
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:25.520
the potential for anger and lashing out. And um

1761
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.589
you know, to the extent that that's something that

1762
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.709
motivates people, the more you recognize that selfish tendency

1763
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.509
is gonna hurt your partner and hurt your relationship.

1764
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.319
Commitment should take the edge off of that, right?

1765
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:37.580
And so I think one of the things that

1766
01:21:37.589 --> 01:21:40.799
will happen there is the person will hopefully be

1767
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:44.759
less judgmental among all kinds of other things because

1768
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:47.399
it's in the way of their own goal of

1769
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:50.069
keeping the relationship together. But I will say the

1770
01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.060
other thing that that transformation of motivation can do

1771
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:55.879
is it can make it easier for people to

1772
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.959
take those negative behaviors from a partner. You know.

1773
01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:01.250
So, um, I think one of the reasons people

1774
01:22:01.259 --> 01:22:02.615
might get upset about something, I mean, it does

1775
01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:04.395
hurt and I certainly am not saying that people

1776
01:22:04.404 --> 01:22:06.895
should be judgmental towards their partners. Right. But I

1777
01:22:06.904 --> 01:22:08.944
think one of the reasons people get upset about

1778
01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:12.095
something like their partner being judgmental towards them is

1779
01:22:12.234 --> 01:22:14.575
they're doing some kind of a calculus of, oh,

1780
01:22:14.584 --> 01:22:17.935
I think this person doesn't really value me and

1781
01:22:17.944 --> 01:22:20.484
that puts this relationship at risk of breaking up.

1782
01:22:20.495 --> 01:22:23.149
Right? And let's say you've been together with someone

1783
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.319
for 20 years and you just, you know, like,

1784
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:27.870
you just know that this person and you were

1785
01:22:27.879 --> 01:22:29.819
going the distance, like that's just not even a

1786
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:33.790
question anymore. You don't read that behavior as much

1787
01:22:33.799 --> 01:22:35.890
as, oh, this is a threat to my relationship.

1788
01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:38.529
And so I think that we get better at

1789
01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.790
putting up with our, the things that annoy us

1790
01:22:40.799 --> 01:22:42.439
in our partner because we don't have to freak

1791
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:44.339
out about like, oh, this is gonna undermine the

1792
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:46.540
relationship. It can become a little bit more like,

1793
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:49.040
oh, there they go again, doing their judgmental thing.

1794
01:22:49.049 --> 01:22:50.680
But like, this will pass just like it does

1795
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:52.040
every other time, you know?

1796
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:57.350
Yeah. Ok. Great. So, Doctor mcdonald, just before we

1797
01:22:57.359 --> 01:23:00.149
go, would you like to tell people where they

1798
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.910
can find you and your work on the internet?

1799
01:23:03.859 --> 01:23:08.209
Yeah. So, um, uh, the lab website is, uh

1800
01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.839
mcdonald lab dot C A that's C A for

1801
01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:15.149
Canada. Uh And we post a bunch of the,

1802
01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.410
like the media appearances that I've done on there.

1803
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.270
Uh There are uh links to all of the

1804
01:23:21.279 --> 01:23:23.419
academic papers that we've done on there. If, if

1805
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:25.549
people are interested in learning it at that level.

1806
01:23:25.799 --> 01:23:27.899
Uh I also have a Twitter account. I think

1807
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.490
my Twitter handle is G mcdonald U of T.

1808
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.089
I am not uh a regular tweeter uh but

1809
01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:35.899
I will post pretty much every new paper that's

1810
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.979
on there and, and other announcements about the Single

1811
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:40.770
Studies Association and stuff like that. So, uh those

1812
01:23:40.779 --> 01:23:42.350
are probably the best two places to find me,

1813
01:23:42.939 --> 01:23:45.560
right? So I'll be leaving links to that in

1814
01:23:45.569 --> 01:23:48.799
the description of the interview when Doctor mcdonald. Thank
