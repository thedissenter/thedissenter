00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.230
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.230
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.380
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Kristen

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.630
Goi. She is professor and chair of Russian and

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.189
East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. In

6
00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.274
our previous interview, we talked about her. Why Women

7
00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.805
have better Sex and Socialism and today we're talking

8
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:26.485
about her other book, Everyday Utopia, What 2 1000

9
00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.924
Years of Wild Experiments Can Teach Us about the

10
00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:33.284
good life. So, Dr. Goi, welcome back to the

11
00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:35.354
show. It's always a pleasure to talk with you.

12
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:37.845
Yeah, no, it's really fun to be back. Thanks

13
00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:38.924
so much for the invitation.

14
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.700
OK, so everyday utopia, uh, what is the premise

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.610
of the book?

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.000
Yeah, so it's a very simple premise, uh, but

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.360
it has a lot of implications because basically what

18
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.080
I'm arguing in the book in sort of very

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.110
concrete steps, is that the way that we in,

20
00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:01.860
let's say the industrialized north today organize our domestic

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.440
lives is actually an aberration. It's not natural. The

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.989
idea of exclusive bi parental care for your own

23
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:18.080
biological children in a usually heterosexual relationship, in a

24
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.519
single family home surrounded by all of your own

25
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:25.970
privately owned stuff. IS actually a big part of

26
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.489
the problem of why people are very unhappy and

27
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.639
dissatisfied with advanced industrialized economies today, and it also

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
plays into the falling birth rate, which is uh

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.779
another part of the argument that I'm developing outside

30
00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.449
of the book. But I think that it's very

31
00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:45.290
important to understand that our domestic lives are very

32
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.279
unnatural, and so I try. To take each piece

33
00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.599
of this and to say how it was different

34
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.510
and how it could be different in the future.

35
00:01:55.559 --> 00:02:00.440
I mean, uh, our modern life ways in contemporary

36
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.559
industrialized and post-industrial societies are very unnatural, as you

37
00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.320
said, but they are also uncommon, right? Because even

38
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.080
among um contemporary societies, I mean, in traditional societies

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.919
like hunter-gatherers, horticulturists, we don't see anything like that

40
00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.240
or it is not really common. And even, I

41
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.225
mean, in many societies. Across the globe, there are

42
00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:29.395
uh social arrangements that have very little to do

43
00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:29.985
with it.

44
00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.434
Exactly. And that's one of the things that I

45
00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.384
do. I, I sort of take a longer, uh,

46
00:02:34.395 --> 00:02:37.955
evolutionary anthropology, uh, perspective, and I, and I try

47
00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.195
to understand like how did we get here? How

48
00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:42.744
did we get to this sort of idea of

49
00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:45.835
monogamous by parental care in a nuclear family, in

50
00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:47.714
a single family home with a bunch of privately

51
00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:50.744
owned stuff like that is part of a process

52
00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:54.089
of You know, really the last couple of centuries

53
00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.130
and industrial industrial development and a certain way that

54
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.649
capitalism wants us to organize our private lives in

55
00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.449
order to benefit a particular kind of economic system

56
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.809
and especially to uphold a certain level of inequality

57
00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.320
in society, that is really truly unnatural. And so,

58
00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.690
you know, the book is very much uh a

59
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.589
an attempt to examine. How our lives could be

60
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.949
differently, not just in the public sphere, because that's

61
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.550
really what I dealt with and why women have

62
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.850
better sex under socialism. Where I talked about the

63
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.570
private sphere, but I was very much interested in

64
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.970
sort of state-driven solutions. This is a book that's

65
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.449
really about organic solutions, sort of society driven solutions,

66
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.809
private solutions, things that we can do in our

67
00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.919
everyday lives when we don't feel like the government

68
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.529
is really responding to us and our demands in

69
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:42.729
quite the way we want it to.

70
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.839
OK, but I also want to ask you about

71
00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.440
something that you, of course, also explored in your

72
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.919
book that has to do with sort of the

73
00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.190
history of utopia. But what is a utopia? What

74
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.619
does the word mean?

75
00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.169
Yeah, so this word is, um, is coined by

76
00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.639
Sir Thomas Moore, uh, Saint Thomas Moore these days.

77
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.679
Uh, HE wrote a book in 1516 called Utopia,

78
00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.419
and this book was written in the aftermath of

79
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.100
Amerigo Vespucci and Columbus's, you know, quote unquote discovery

80
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.250
of America, the those original sort of explorers who

81
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.850
went and found this completely different place, and And

82
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.600
that sort of got a lot of people thinking,

83
00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.570
especially in in in Europe at this time, about

84
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.170
how life could be differently than it is. And

85
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.720
so, so Thomas Moore wrote this book about an

86
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.369
island that he had apparently visited and uh you

87
00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.809
know, it's sort of a a traveler's tale of

88
00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:45.630
how the people of utopia live. And the word

89
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.720
itself comes from the ancient Greek, and it's fascinating

90
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.790
because the way that it's written utopia literally means

91
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.410
no place. But if you were to change the

92
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.799
prefix to EU, it would mean a good place.

93
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.730
And so it has this wonderful ambiguity in the

94
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.209
ancient Greek and Thomas Moore was clearly aware of

95
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.760
that ambiguity when he used this word to name

96
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.250
this sort of fantastical island. It is a no

97
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.730
place, but it is also a good place. And

98
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.049
the reason he coined this word, and the reason

99
00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:20.369
that he told this tale was really as a

100
00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:24.260
way of kind of critiquing contemporary life in England

101
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.540
at the time. He was the Lord Chancellor to

102
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.619
Henry the 8th, and there was a lot of

103
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.899
upheaval happening in society in England, and so he

104
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.380
wanted to imagine what the world would look like

105
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.660
if things were different. And for more, that meant

106
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.220
not only politically different in the public realm, but

107
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.489
also it meant privately different in our domestic lives.

108
00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:50.200
Mhm. Yeah, I mean, I read Thomas Moore's book

109
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.160
Utopia when I was like 2014 years ago or

110
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.399
so, and it's a really fascinating read. So, uh,

111
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.269
but tell us also about utopias in the late

112
00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:05.519
18th and early 19th century because there were some

113
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.279
experiments, I guess back then that people tried. So

114
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.040
tell us a little bit about that.

115
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.820
Yeah, so I think, you know, one of the

116
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.820
ways that we get the word utopia in a

117
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.380
kind of political discourse today is because of Marx

118
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.899
and Engels who were talking about scientific socialism versus

119
00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.320
what they called utopian socialism. And of course they

120
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.200
didn't like utopian socialism, so they were criticizing it.

121
00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.480
They were actually trying to develop their own body

122
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.040
of ideology and theories in opposition to the utopians.

123
00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.920
But the utopians are very, very important to them

124
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.445
because many of the ideas that have Come down

125
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.725
to us in sort of socialist or social democratic

126
00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:49.325
or even communist anarchist politics come from Marx and

127
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:54.084
Engels engaging with the utopians. And so, very specifically,

128
00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:57.125
there are kind of two strands of utopianism that

129
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.605
appear in the 18th and 19th centuries. The utopian

130
00:07:00.605 --> 00:07:03.804
socialists were people like Charles Fourier, Robert Owen in

131
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:07.670
Scotland, the Saint Simonians that Emerged in Switzerland and

132
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.070
then kind of moved into France. These are all

133
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.429
people kind of have um creating social utopias in

134
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:16.390
the aftermath of the French Revolution. And then you

135
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.869
also have a lot of religious utopias and the

136
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.910
Saint Simonians sort of start out as a social

137
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.260
movement and end up as a religion. But these

138
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.299
are really fascinating groups, um, who thought that you

139
00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:33.619
could reorganize society in little clusters, like you could

140
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.100
withdraw from the world and create these little utopian

141
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.140
societies, the societies outside of the mainstream, and that

142
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.019
they would be so attractive that people outside of

143
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.519
the societies would want to join them. So they

144
00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.640
weren't calling for any kind of revolutionary change. They

145
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.160
were calling for what we might think of as

146
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.269
prefigurative politics, with the anarchists often called prefigurative politics.

147
00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.160
The idea of building the world that you want

148
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.760
to live in right here and right now, and

149
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.959
living as if that world already existed. And then

150
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:08.040
hopefully by example, you would um you would appeal

151
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.799
to others. And so particularly people like Fourier. There,

152
00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:15.609
there was a plan, like a very specific plan

153
00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:18.850
about building these philansteries and certain kinds of people

154
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.690
would live in them, and there were uh amazing

155
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.399
diversity of Fourierist communities, particularly in the United States.

156
00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.864
In Canada, North America, where people really tried to

157
00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:34.224
take his ideas and put them into practice. And

158
00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:37.304
I think the, especially the 19th century was sort

159
00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:41.015
of a heyday of utopian experiments, but these were

160
00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:44.539
always very small communities. And they never really ended

161
00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:48.549
up lasting very long because there were financial issues,

162
00:08:48.638 --> 00:08:52.059
there were problems of organization. But really, I think

163
00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:54.328
the big thing is that there was a lot

164
00:08:54.539 --> 00:08:58.898
of resistance from mainstream society. People were very, very

165
00:08:58.898 --> 00:09:03.249
opposed to the idea of these utopian communities where

166
00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:07.809
they outlawed slavery and they treated women. As equals

167
00:09:07.809 --> 00:09:10.460
and they um held property in common and raised

168
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.580
their children collectively. They were doing things that mainstream

169
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.929
sort of Christian patriarchal society just could not really

170
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.289
accept. And so most of those 19th century utopias,

171
00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:24.179
and there were many that were they some of

172
00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:25.859
them, some of them lasted a lot longer than

173
00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:29.955
others, some in France. Lasted for 109 years, but

174
00:09:29.955 --> 00:09:32.145
um, but in the end they all kind of

175
00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.354
fell away because they didn't have a real revolutionary

176
00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.755
program for the transformation of the entire society. They

177
00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:41.315
were just trying to build little communities, little pocket

178
00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:45.344
utopias within a more hostile larger society that they

179
00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:47.484
that they didn't really try to change.

180
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.679
In the book, you also talk about how utopian

181
00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:56.719
visions of how to build a different future often

182
00:09:56.719 --> 00:10:01.599
follow moments of great social upheaval. Uh, EXPLAIN that

183
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:04.510
and why is that the case?

184
00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:06.590
Yeah, I, I think that, you know, this is

185
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.830
an interesting pattern, um, that I noticed like, so

186
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.979
Utopia, the original Thomas Moore book is really written

187
00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:16.710
after 1492, the discoveries of 1492, which sort of

188
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.469
shake the old European uh powers and ways of

189
00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:23.869
thinking. If you think of Tomaso Campanella in Italy.

190
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.760
Um, AND, uh, his utopian vision of the city

191
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.320
of the sun, it happens after the discoveries of

192
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.960
Copernicus, right, and heliocentrism. So there, and, and, and

193
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.080
many of the utopian socialists that I just talked

194
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.250
about in the 18th century were and early 19th

195
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.630
century were in the aftermath of the French Revolution.

196
00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:46.299
And so I think what happens is that sometimes,

197
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.039
and it could be because of a war, a

198
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:51.669
revolution, it could be a pandemic. Something happens that

199
00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:54.179
sort of shakes people out of the status quo.

200
00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:59.030
They're they're they're confused. They feel uncomfortable, like climate

201
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.909
change is, is another, I think, possible avenue for

202
00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:05.429
this, that suddenly we realized that the way that

203
00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:07.590
we're living right now is not sustainable or that

204
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.659
it it contains within it some seeds of destruction

205
00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:14.130
or instability that we want to change. And so,

206
00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:17.429
while things are going well, we tend to have

207
00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:20.150
this status quo bias. We tend to like the

208
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.469
way things are. But when things are suddenly different

209
00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:27.109
or things are suddenly feeling insecure, we allow our

210
00:11:27.109 --> 00:11:29.869
imaginations to run a little bit wilder and we

211
00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:33.349
start to think more productively about how the future

212
00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:35.669
might be different than the past. And so, I

213
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:42.219
do think that society sometimes Experiences these endogenous shocks,

214
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.830
and that those endogenous shocks are actually in some

215
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.219
ways good for the development of human progress. Like

216
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:51.630
we, we actually have these as as as be

217
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.909
as humans, these incredible flexible, creative and adaptive brains.

218
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.669
It's one of the reasons why our species has

219
00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:01.950
survived for so long in so many different environmental,

220
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:07.210
geographic, climactic, um. You know, uh, circumstances, it's because

221
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.090
we're really, really good at adapting, because we have

222
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.770
this incredible prefrontal cortex that allows us to reason

223
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.890
and rationalize and adapt to the world around us

224
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.950
as it changes. And so, but we get lazy.

225
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.630
And because when things are just sort of like

226
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.950
going along, we just sort of think, OK, well,

227
00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:26.890
it's not perfect. I'm not really happy with the

228
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.320
way the world is, but it's the way the

229
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.440
world is, and I'm just gonna accommodate myself to

230
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.479
it. But when something happens like the pandemic and

231
00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:35.880
shuts everything down and suddenly we're all forced to

232
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.080
go like, wow, I live in an apartment all

233
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.159
by myself and I'm really lonely. Why am I

234
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.119
living like this? Um, WHY don't I have a

235
00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:45.119
community of other people around me? Then we start

236
00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:47.559
to, we start to reflect on why we live

237
00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.039
the way we do and how the way we

238
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:49.960
live could be different.

239
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.270
So, you told us about Thomas Moore and I

240
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.750
also asked you about uh sort of utopian kinds

241
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.710
of arrangements of society in the late 18th and

242
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.390
early 19th centuries. But uh in the book, you

243
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:11.229
also go further back into ancient Greece and talk

244
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:15.640
about Pythagoras and this colony in Calabria, Italy. Tell

245
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.590
us about that.

246
00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:20.049
Yeah, so this is one of those wonderful things

247
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:23.609
that people don't know. Everybody knows the Pythagorean theorem

248
00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:26.809
about the triangles, but what very few people understand

249
00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:30.729
is that in Pythagoras' own time, he was much

250
00:13:30.729 --> 00:13:35.330
better remembered as like the founder of the Pythagorean

251
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.090
way of life. He, he, um, so we're talking

252
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.900
here, uh, Pythagoras is like 570 to 495 BC.

253
00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:47.869
And we know from Iambilis, who was a sort

254
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:52.640
of a 3rd century AD philosopher, that Pythagoras left

255
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.039
Samos in about 5:30. Um, I think that's right,

256
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.320
5:30 BC, and he founded a a community, a

257
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.359
colony, I mean, what we might today call a

258
00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:09.919
commune in Croton. Um, AND this was a really

259
00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:12.760
fascinating, I mean, there's a lot of information about

260
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.840
this, and the reason it's so important is because

261
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.780
Iambilis basically says that Plato's Republic was very much

262
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.460
based on the way the Pythagoreans. Organized their colony

263
00:14:24.789 --> 00:14:27.909
in Croton. And so they had a couple of

264
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.190
really interesting things that I talk about in the

265
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.190
book. I think the first thing is very clearly

266
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.109
that they held all their property in common. They

267
00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:38.630
said among friends, all things are in common. They

268
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.270
ate their meals together collectively, sort of uh in

269
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.799
the same way that the Spartans did. But they

270
00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:48.440
also treated women as equals, and that's really fascinating

271
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.760
for that particular moment of time in ancient Greece,

272
00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:53.039
to have women be the equals of men. In

273
00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:55.960
fact, the first named mathematician that we know of,

274
00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.359
Teano, was a Pythagorean. And so they had uh

275
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.719
uh uh essentially what we think of as an

276
00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:06.479
extended family of people who lived together and organized

277
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:09.099
their lives such that they could spend all of

278
00:15:09.099 --> 00:15:11.359
their time sort of contemplating the mysteries of the

279
00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:15.320
universe and mathematics. And we don't learn about that.

280
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.280
We learn about the Pythagorean theorem, but we never

281
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.369
learn about the conditions, the social conditions under which

282
00:15:21.369 --> 00:15:24.679
Pythagoras and his followers came up with these mathematical

283
00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:28.119
inventions. And from my perspective, I think that that

284
00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:33.179
Pythagorean way of life was just as important to

285
00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:35.460
remember and think about as how we, you know,

286
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.619
figure out the triangle stuff. So I, I, I

287
00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:42.580
think that um Not enough of us learn about

288
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.409
the Pythagoreans and their way and they're very unique

289
00:15:45.409 --> 00:15:49.640
utopian experiment. In fact, I say in the book

290
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.599
that I actually think that Pythagoras is sort of

291
00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:54.010
the great great grandfather of utopia in many, many

292
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.450
ways.

293
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.549
Yeah. Uh, SO you mentioned that they shared property

294
00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:02.909
and treated women as equal, as equals, but I

295
00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:06.900
guess that looking across some of the sort of

296
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.869
societal arrangements you've told us about, there's also a

297
00:16:11.869 --> 00:16:16.190
great emphasis on reimagining the role of the family

298
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.299
and gender roles. Correct.

299
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.750
Absolutely. Yeah. I think that in every single one

300
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:27.849
of these utopian. UTOPIAN communities. What, what they're struggling

301
00:16:27.849 --> 00:16:32.330
against is a sort of um way of organizing

302
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.580
society that is a sort of patrilineal patrilocal, um

303
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.260
hierarchical, very um strict, almost you would say sort

304
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.409
of totalitarian way of organizing both the family and

305
00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:49.830
the public sphere. And so these, these are free

306
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.030
thinkers, right? These are people who want to get

307
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.979
away from the status quo. They want to do

308
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:58.020
things differently. They wanna like open their minds to

309
00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:02.229
new experiences and new ways of being. And so

310
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:06.650
in order to do that. You have to sort

311
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.939
of reimagine what society looks like, and you can't

312
00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:15.969
reimagine what society looks like without reimagining what the

313
00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:17.930
family looks like. And when you reimagine what the

314
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.358
family looks like, you're basically reimagining your gender roles.

315
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.000
And so, I mean, in the book, I talk,

316
00:17:25.118 --> 00:17:26.439
and I think it's really important. A lot of

317
00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:31.199
people don't realize that Hobbs's Leviathan, which is a

318
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:34.160
very, very important text for the way that we

319
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.680
live in the world today, which is 1651. This

320
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.020
is the book where he makes an argument for

321
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.719
the, the necessity of the sovereign, right? So he

322
00:17:43.719 --> 00:17:47.719
says that without the sovereign, without some authority, like

323
00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:51.280
without the state basically, life is quote unquote, nasty,

324
00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:53.609
brutish, and short. Like we, the state of nature.

325
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.250
IS a state of chaos and uh and and

326
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.579
and violence, and we treat each other terribly and

327
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:03.650
so without having some sort of strong state authority,

328
00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:10.260
we will live like unpleasant short, unhappy lives. And

329
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.150
if you actually read Leviathan, if you actually spend

330
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.410
some time with that text, Hobbs suggests that human

331
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.890
beings are not born obedient. Like, we are born

332
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.489
free. We are born as free thinkers. And in

333
00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:30.890
order to learn how to be obedient to the

334
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.369
sovereign, to be good subjects to the sovereign, we

335
00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:38.319
have to learn that in the home from our

336
00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:43.430
fathers. And he very specifically draws on this ancient

337
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.439
Roman concept of patria potestas, which is that the

338
00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:52.290
father in the family has all of the power,

339
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.180
even the power of life and death over his

340
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.329
children. Like if a father wants to sell you

341
00:18:57.329 --> 00:18:59.380
or a father wants to kill you, that's his

342
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.810
right. And so what Hobbs says in Leviathan is

343
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.800
that in order for you to have a strong

344
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.300
state, You have to have a strong patriarchal family.

345
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.229
And so, in fact, it's not surprising that if

346
00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:19.380
we look at right wing authoritarian movements throughout history

347
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.939
or even contemporary ones, what do they want more

348
00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:26.060
than anything else? They want the patriarchal nuclear family,

349
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.260
because in the patriarchal nuclear family, people learn obedience

350
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.739
that is necessary to uphold a strong father figure

351
00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.949
in the state. And so, You know, some people

352
00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:39.270
want to say that gender is not political, that

353
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.020
gender and sexuality are all personal, but it's absolutely

354
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.949
a mistake to think that because if we go

355
00:19:45.949 --> 00:19:48.670
back to 1651 and we look at this key

356
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.550
text from Hobbs, what we know is that the

357
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.130
family is one of the most political institutions in

358
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.650
society, because it is in the family that the

359
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.449
entire political system gets born and promoted and perpetuated

360
00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:08.000
over time. Without the patriarchal nuclear family, it's very,

361
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.489
very hard to justify the sovereign because people want

362
00:20:11.489 --> 00:20:12.250
to be free.

363
00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:20.079
So moving on into more modern contemporary sorts of

364
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.369
social arrangements. Tell us about the co-housing movement in

365
00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:30.770
Denmark where they share household shores and deepen neighborly

366
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.530
bonds.

367
00:20:31.949 --> 00:20:34.900
Yeah, so I think that the um, the, the

368
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.209
co-housing movement, which is really born in in Denmark,

369
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.329
um, and it really comes out of a moment

370
00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:44.290
of, I think, sort of feminist and anti-capitalist activism.

371
00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:48.060
Um, IT gets started by an article that was

372
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.510
published in a newspaper called Children Should Have 100

373
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.930
Parents, and the idea Is that are single, I

374
00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.810
mean, it was a it was a very, very

375
00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.560
clear recognition that sort of single family homes that

376
00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:04.560
that are architecture that are built environment promotes the

377
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.420
formation of a kind of family that is actually

378
00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:13.859
Responsible for our unfreedom, and responsible for the oppression

379
00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:16.569
of women and the oppression of the working classes.

380
00:21:16.939 --> 00:21:20.170
And so there was this radical reimagination of what

381
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:27.010
architecture could look like to create more communalistic societies.

382
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.979
Now, it's very important to understand that the the

383
00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:33.810
co-housing movement in Denmark still had a space for

384
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.260
privacy. They had a space for the family. So

385
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.849
every family still has a sort of, you know,

386
00:21:39.939 --> 00:21:42.979
kitchen and a bedrooms and their own bathrooms or

387
00:21:42.979 --> 00:21:47.219
whatever, but there, but they share these communal spaces,

388
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.420
big dining rooms, playgrounds, gardens, and, and different co-housing

389
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.420
communities in different parts of Denmark. And then as

390
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.660
the co-housing movement has spread out all over the

391
00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.300
world, there's sort of this this really delicate balance

392
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.979
between privacy and community. But what I think that

393
00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:07.310
the co-housing movement gets right. Is that everybody in

394
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.550
the community contributes collectively to the maintenance of this

395
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.219
community in a way that is really uh productive

396
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.709
for the community, the health of the community in

397
00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:18.939
the long run, but also it it it it

398
00:22:18.949 --> 00:22:21.770
it prevents the isolation of children and women. It

399
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.109
it basically sort of breaks down, um, in its

400
00:22:25.109 --> 00:22:28.510
original imagination, it sort of broke down the patriarchal

401
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.319
nuclear family in order to sort of spread. The

402
00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:35.060
labor that women do in the home, child rearing

403
00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.670
and housework and all the sorts of um things

404
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.119
that are often done in the private sphere more

405
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:42.709
collectively within society so that it would be valued

406
00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:46.839
and recognized as contributions to the collective good. So

407
00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:51.619
the co-housing movement. I mean, unfortunately, I think it

408
00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:57.140
has become almost commercialized and it's very radical origins

409
00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.650
have sort of been abandoned because it's very useful,

410
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.219
for instance, for like senior citizen communities, for communities

411
00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.540
of pensioners who who don't want to live by

412
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.459
themselves, they want to live more collectively. And so

413
00:23:08.459 --> 00:23:11.430
a lot of co-housing movements are now sort of

414
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.099
being developed without more of the sort of community

415
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:19.349
oriented aspects that that uh mark those original communities

416
00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:22.349
in Denmark, but it's still a promising model. I

417
00:23:22.349 --> 00:23:25.099
think it's a, it's a, it's a move towards

418
00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:28.189
a more communal collective way of living and we

419
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:31.640
see. We see that model in Europe, uh, in,

420
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.180
in places like eco villages, right? There, there are

421
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.859
these small eco villages all around the continent that

422
00:23:36.859 --> 00:23:40.099
are trying very hard to find that delicate balance

423
00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:43.459
between community and privacy in order to promote, you

424
00:23:43.459 --> 00:23:44.890
know, more sustainable living.

425
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.119
Yeah, it's very interesting when you, you talk about

426
00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:55.560
children because particularly conservatives tend to say very frequently

427
00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.599
that uh the nuclear family is the unit of

428
00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:05.349
social organization and it's the traditional form of social

429
00:24:05.349 --> 00:24:08.574
organization, but it's not at all. I mean, we

430
00:24:08.574 --> 00:24:13.314
know from the anthropological literature that cooperative breathing is

431
00:24:13.314 --> 00:24:17.015
actually the way we tend to do things and

432
00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:21.135
people still do things in more traditional societies. Correct.

433
00:24:21.255 --> 00:24:23.854
Absolutely right. And, you know, uh, I think it

434
00:24:23.854 --> 00:24:26.574
was just last year, there was a book that

435
00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:29.255
came out in the United States, uh, by Melissa

436
00:24:29.255 --> 00:24:31.974
Kearney. She's an economist, and she called, I think

437
00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:35.160
the book was called The Two Parent Privilege. And

438
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:39.229
the entire book was about how children, very specifically

439
00:24:39.229 --> 00:24:42.839
looking at the United States, really thrive and, and,

440
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.000
and, and there's all sorts of data that shows

441
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.920
that children who are raised in in uh families

442
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.599
with two parents do much better than um in

443
00:24:50.599 --> 00:24:53.119
families where there's just one parent, single parent families.

444
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.160
But the thing that's so and and a lot

445
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.489
was made about this book on the radio and

446
00:24:58.489 --> 00:25:00.650
on television. Oh, you know, the nuclear family is

447
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.410
the best thing, but one of the things, and,

448
00:25:03.449 --> 00:25:05.969
and I was interviewed about this, you know, on

449
00:25:05.969 --> 00:25:09.010
Freakonomics, I don't even remember like sometime in 23.

450
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.209
Um, OR 24, and, but everything that she says

451
00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:17.890
in the book. Basically points to, if 2 parents

452
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.319
are better than 1, then 3 are better than

453
00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:24.199
2 and 4 are better than 3. So there's,

454
00:25:24.449 --> 00:25:28.130
you know, she's not saying that more parents are

455
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.530
bad. She's basically saying that 2 are better than

456
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.939
2 parents are better than 1. Um, AND, and

457
00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:36.540
my point is exactly what you just said, from

458
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.390
an evolutionary anthropological point of view, we are cooperative

459
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.800
breeders. We've always raised our children in common, and

460
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.339
uh in various permutations of family forms, and there

461
00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:51.459
are many people around the world that still do

462
00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:53.459
that today. We have this saying, it takes a

463
00:25:53.459 --> 00:26:00.660
village, and we know that children thrive in. Families

464
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.290
that have multiple caring adults, and it, it doesn't

465
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.219
necessarily have to be uh uh what we call

466
00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:11.969
consanguineous blood related kin, right? These could be godparents,

467
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.020
right? These could be neighbors, friends, we just know

468
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.060
that. Even um recently we have wonderful data on

469
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.180
this because during the pandemic, babies that were born

470
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.890
during the pandemic and who only saw their biological

471
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.959
parents or maybe like a sibling. They're cognitively delayed

472
00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:35.160
compared to babies that were born pre-pandemic or post

473
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.800
pandemic, right? Where you have access to the faces

474
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.760
and interactions with many other adults in your life.

475
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.560
So, we're actually kind of hardwired to need many,

476
00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:48.750
many more adults in our life than we get.

477
00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:51.310
And, um, and I'm, you know, I don't have

478
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.810
a problem. With single parents, but I will tell

479
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.739
you that the data is probably true that two

480
00:26:57.739 --> 00:26:59.900
parents are better than one. But I think we

481
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.810
should take that data to also suggest that maybe

482
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.140
3 parents are better than 2 and 4 parents

483
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.060
are better than 3, and, and maybe a whole

484
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.219
community of loving, caring adults are going to be

485
00:27:11.219 --> 00:27:13.579
better for our children than the way that we're

486
00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:16.805
raising our children now with this exclusive. Parental care

487
00:27:16.805 --> 00:27:19.055
in single family homes. I just think it's one

488
00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:21.454
of the reasons why people don't want to have

489
00:27:21.454 --> 00:27:24.614
children. It's too hard to do it on the

490
00:27:24.614 --> 00:27:27.535
model that we say that conservatives want to convince

491
00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:30.655
us, is the ideal way to bring children into

492
00:27:30.655 --> 00:27:34.165
the world in this very rigid nuclear family form.

493
00:27:34.494 --> 00:27:36.055
People are looking at that and saying, you know

494
00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:37.935
what? That doesn't look attractive to me at all.

495
00:27:38.135 --> 00:27:41.760
So rather than Doing that, I'm just not gonna

496
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.520
have children. And I think that there's, you know,

497
00:27:45.619 --> 00:27:47.959
there's an interesting reason there are many good reasons

498
00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:49.599
why people don't want to have children, but if

499
00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:51.880
you do wanna have children, just don't do it

500
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.400
in a nuclear family. Reimagine the family, do it

501
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.479
in a different way. Create a different set of

502
00:27:58.479 --> 00:28:02.199
familial uh uh norms so that you can raise

503
00:28:02.199 --> 00:28:04.280
your children in a, in a happy, healthy way

504
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.760
that doesn't require conforming to this very conservative view

505
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.489
of the family.

506
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.680
Yeah. And I mean, currently, it's increasingly hard even

507
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.640
for just two parents to raise kids in the

508
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.760
current economic conditions we live in. And, I mean,

509
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.869
just to refer back to our first interview, maybe

510
00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:28.020
people should try socialism.

511
00:28:30.189 --> 00:28:32.489
Right. I mean, absolutely. So, you know, so that's,

512
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.550
that was one of the reasons why I wrote

513
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.709
this book was When I was doing all of

514
00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:41.390
my, you know, international talks and things like that

515
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.270
for why women had better sex and socialism, that

516
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.030
book, you know, had a kind of a I

517
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.109
never expected that that book would be read outside

518
00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:49.829
of the United States. I think that's the most

519
00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:53.030
important thing, like I had no idea, but there

520
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.790
were a lot of people who told me. What

521
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.109
if the government isn't listening, right? What if you

522
00:29:00.109 --> 00:29:02.390
have Trump, or what if you have Orban? OR

523
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.579
what if you have like a a a government

524
00:29:04.579 --> 00:29:08.630
that is hostile to any kind of sort of

525
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.829
um socialization of domestic work, right? To, to, and

526
00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:14.390
so that was a really good question, and I

527
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.750
thought, and then I, you know, I also have

528
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.109
a lot of anarchist friends who are like very

529
00:29:18.109 --> 00:29:21.630
suspicious of the state. They're like, you know, You

530
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.989
you socialists like you, you have a good idea

531
00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:28.390
in theory, but, but the state is not the

532
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.719
way to realize it, right? You should devolve everything

533
00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:36.079
to sort of more federalized local communities, and people

534
00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:39.079
should collectivize on their own without the intervention of

535
00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:43.589
a state. And I don't particularly think that works

536
00:29:43.589 --> 00:29:46.949
very well, but that's just my opinion. But I

537
00:29:46.949 --> 00:29:51.069
respect the impulse behind it. Like I understand having

538
00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:53.589
spent most of my career studying 20th century state

539
00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:56.949
socialism in Eastern Europe, I understand the suspicion. And

540
00:29:56.949 --> 00:30:00.189
so I wanted to take that seriously, that you

541
00:30:00.189 --> 00:30:05.300
could Socialize, you could support families by creating kindergartens

542
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.810
and giving child allowances and making it a lot

543
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:11.890
easier, you know, subsidizing rent for families, making it

544
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.810
a lot easier to live in our society with

545
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.719
children. Our societies right now in the industrialized North

546
00:30:17.719 --> 00:30:20.449
are extremely hostile to families, no matter what the

547
00:30:20.449 --> 00:30:24.089
damn conservatives say, they don't make it easy for

548
00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:25.890
anybody to have children because the cost of living

549
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.739
is too damn expensive. So one solution to that

550
00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:35.420
is definitely redistribution away from the billionaires into public

551
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.900
coffers so that we have really good wide functioning

552
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.500
healthy social safety nets that make it easier for

553
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.180
parents and families to thrive. But the other version

554
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.119
of that. I think is because that's not gonna

555
00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:52.079
happen. At least it's not gonna happen in my

556
00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:55.439
country anytime soon. And so people get frustrated and

557
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:57.469
they throw up their hands and they say, I

558
00:30:57.469 --> 00:30:59.880
don't know how to live the life that I

559
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.119
want to live, given the political reality that I

560
00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:06.199
live in under Trump right now, for instance. So

561
00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:08.719
how, so should I just give up? Should I

562
00:31:08.719 --> 00:31:13.319
just, you know, Give up on every political intervention

563
00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:16.630
that I can make? Should I give into despair?

564
00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:19.079
And my answer is no, you shouldn't give in

565
00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.319
to despair because there are still things that you

566
00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:24.469
can do on a private level. I think we

567
00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:27.189
need to do both. We need to be activists

568
00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:30.670
politically. We have to put pressure on our governments.

569
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.069
We have to put pressure on the state, but,

570
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.270
but sometimes our political systems are going to be

571
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.390
not as amenable to that pressure, and so that

572
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.099
doesn't mean that we should give up. That means

573
00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:40.579
that there are still things that we can do,

574
00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:44.540
and that's where My anarchist friends and colleagues are

575
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.229
really helpful because they are about reimagining our communities,

576
00:31:49.329 --> 00:31:51.709
our immediate communities, and how we can do things

577
00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:54.750
in our daily lives right now to bring the

578
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.469
world that we want to live in a little

579
00:31:56.469 --> 00:31:58.709
bit closer to us. And I think that that's

580
00:31:58.709 --> 00:32:03.099
an insight that sometimes We forget that we have

581
00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:04.900
the power to make the world the way we

582
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.819
want it to be, and that we, yes, the

583
00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:13.099
political system is intractable sometimes, but if enough people

584
00:32:13.099 --> 00:32:16.020
decide to do things a particular way, we have

585
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.930
power collectively that even the state can't prevent us

586
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.579
from doing the things that we want to do

587
00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:22.500
in our lives.

588
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:28.880
How about the Israeli kibbutzim? Are they also a

589
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.510
sort of uh a form of utopian society?

590
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.599
That's a tricky question, right? So I think that

591
00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:42.939
the, the original. Kibbutzim, uh, the kibbutzniks that came

592
00:32:42.939 --> 00:32:45.189
from Europe. I mean, the early, uh, the first

593
00:32:45.189 --> 00:32:49.699
kibbutz was Dagana like founded in 1909, well before

594
00:32:49.869 --> 00:32:52.270
the, the founding of the state of Israel. I

595
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.790
think when we talk about the kibbutz, we have

596
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.910
to be very careful because of what's happening in

597
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.709
the political world today and the role that the

598
00:32:58.709 --> 00:33:01.430
kibbutzniks played, you know, in the, in the in

599
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.689
the in in settling. Um, BUT the impulse, right,

600
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.900
the impulse behind these, um, keyboard scene, particularly the

601
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.489
ones that were 100% socialized, right? It definitely comes,

602
00:33:15.699 --> 00:33:18.540
it's a direct descendant of some of these utopian

603
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.619
19th, 18th and 19th century utopias in Europe. They

604
00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:27.170
were thinking a lot. About how to create self-sustaining

605
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:32.849
societies where they could collectively share their property, feed

606
00:33:32.849 --> 00:33:37.650
themselves, raise their children collectively, and thrive in a

607
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.760
way that was in keeping with their sort of

608
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.010
uh moral and theological principles. And so, From that

609
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.030
perspective, uh, I, yes, I would say the keyboard

610
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.819
team are a descendant of these utopian ideas. The

611
00:33:50.819 --> 00:33:54.229
way that they, you know, have played a role

612
00:33:54.229 --> 00:33:57.469
in particular kind of settler politics, some people today

613
00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.250
would definitely say is very dystopian, but I don't

614
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.790
think that that was their, um, that was their

615
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.300
intent to begin with.

616
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:08.938
Uh, A very interesting thing is also that we

617
00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:13.668
tend to live in patriarchal societies, but in the

618
00:34:13.668 --> 00:34:19.030
book, you also explore Colombian eco villages that are

619
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.909
matriarchal, right, where residents grow their own food. So

620
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.350
tell us a little bit about them.

621
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.409
Yeah, so I mean, so I think whenever we

622
00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:35.129
whenever we talk about Dismantling patriarchy. We have to

623
00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:41.478
understand that matriarchy or the word matriarchal, right, does

624
00:34:41.478 --> 00:34:45.320
not mean That that that you just have a

625
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.560
society that looks like a patriarchal society, but that's

626
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.438
run by women. A lot of people make this

627
00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:53.879
mistake, right? Um, A, a matriarchal society tends to

628
00:34:53.879 --> 00:35:00.280
be much more egalitarian and non-hierarchical, right? Power is

629
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.800
distributed much more laterally. Patriarchal societies tend to be

630
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.199
very vertical. Matriarchal societies historically have been much more

631
00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:13.909
horizontal. And so, um, and, and, and that's a

632
00:35:13.909 --> 00:35:16.850
really important point because when we're talking about dismantling

633
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.550
patriarchy, it's not like we're just throwing women in

634
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.709
power. You know, we don't need any more Margaret

635
00:35:21.709 --> 00:35:24.939
Thatcher in the world, right? We're actually talking about

636
00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:28.510
devolving power and and living in a more egalitarian

637
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.550
society. And so this matriarchal, um, Nashira, it's called

638
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.790
in Colombia is a is an example of a,

639
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.469
a, um, sort of a hybrid society in some

640
00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:45.969
ways where There are basically uh only women in

641
00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:48.489
charge. There are some men who live in the

642
00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:50.689
village, but for the most part, it's the women

643
00:35:50.689 --> 00:35:56.000
who collectively make decisions, and they are completely self-sustainable,

644
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.090
they grow their own food, they have their own

645
00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.699
sort of uh social organization. And it was really

646
00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:05.820
created in a way as a response to, you

647
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.500
know, not only long history of of violence in

648
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.739
Colombia, but also, um, you know, problems of domestic

649
00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:14.610
violence in what is a very sort of machismo

650
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:20.689
based society. And so, It's an attempt to organize

651
00:36:20.689 --> 00:36:26.500
a community based on far more peaceful and egalitarian

652
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.199
and non-patriarchal principles and You know, it has, it

653
00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:32.199
has been an inspiration. There, there are a lot

654
00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:35.439
of communities that look to Nashira and other forms

655
00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:38.310
of organizing to to think about how we might

656
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:42.000
also organize our lives differently. I think Nashira is

657
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.120
interesting in that it is explicitly matriarchal in the

658
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.800
sense that in that case, women are the ones

659
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.290
who have the political power within the community. Yeah.

660
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.540
So tell us also about uh planned microdistricts in

661
00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.979
China where households can have easy access to everything

662
00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:02.699
they need.

663
00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:06.360
Yeah, so this idea, this, this is an idea

664
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.919
that actually starts really in the Soviet Union and

665
00:37:09.919 --> 00:37:13.560
it spreads all over the world, uh, in, in

666
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.399
any place where basically sort of Soviet or Eastern

667
00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:20.030
bloc architects went. And they were called micro Raoni

668
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.719
in the, um, in the Soviet context. And, um,

669
00:37:23.919 --> 00:37:27.760
basically, these days, if you've ever heard of something

670
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.620
called the 15 Minute City. This is a kind

671
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.330
of reinterpretation of this idea, but like trying to

672
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.330
get rid of the Soviet baggage, like people don't

673
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.469
want to hear that this was a Soviet idea.

674
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.889
But the idea was that you would build communities.

675
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.479
That were walking, that were um pedestrian communities, so

676
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.729
all of the roads would be on the outside.

677
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.649
By the way, this is true of cohousing too.

678
00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:52.610
There are no cars in the community. All of

679
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.729
the cars are parked on the outside. The same

680
00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:57.770
was true of these microdistricts, and the idea was

681
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.810
that you would have microdistricts, you would have people

682
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.780
living in these sort of um Tall tower blocks

683
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.370
and then there would be parks and public amenities

684
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.169
on the ground floor of these blocks. So butchers

685
00:38:09.169 --> 00:38:13.629
and uh dairies and kindergartens and polyclinics and parks

686
00:38:13.629 --> 00:38:16.699
and everything that you needed. WOULD be within a

687
00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:20.320
15 minute walk from your house. And that was

688
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.610
a very, very popular model and it worked very

689
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.260
well and and I mean actually anywhere you travel

690
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.820
around the world, uh, that was a former socialist

691
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.620
city, uh, you know, former socialist country where a

692
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.860
lot of their urban planning was done in cooperation

693
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.500
with Polish or Bulgarian or Soviet or Chinese architects,

694
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.959
you will find these microdistricts. And they, they are

695
00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:44.959
extremely, I mean, ironically, they were not built for

696
00:38:44.959 --> 00:38:49.719
environmental reasons. They were built to create more collective

697
00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:53.000
communities and to reduce the burdens on individual women

698
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.550
in the households, um, but it turns out. That

699
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.030
now in 2025 as we face the reality of

700
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:03.149
the climate crisis, that microdistricts, these micro Raoni are

701
00:39:03.149 --> 00:39:06.709
extremely environmentally friendly because you have shared resources and

702
00:39:06.709 --> 00:39:09.830
amenities in a way that single family homes do

703
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:14.110
not. Single family homes are incredibly inefficient, uh, when

704
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.479
you think it's just, if you think about heating

705
00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:20.120
and cooling alone. In a in a in a

706
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.449
in a world that is facing a climate crisis

707
00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:25.969
where we're going to have extremes of heat and

708
00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:31.340
extremes of cold. Just the energy resources necessary to

709
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:36.239
heat or cool our individual boxes are much less

710
00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:39.820
efficient than if we lived more collectively with people

711
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.260
in in buildings where heat and cooling could be

712
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.540
shared. And so just on that alone, these communities

713
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.800
are far more environmentally efficient than single family homes,

714
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.290
but because they have this sort of socialist baggage,

715
00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:55.340
I mean, they're all over the place in China.

716
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.639
Um, PEOPLE, people reject them.

717
00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:01.439
I mean, I guess that when people hear the

718
00:40:01.439 --> 00:40:05.510
word bleed, they immediately think of gulags and

719
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.919
exactly, exactly. I mean, that's why I mean I'm.

720
00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:13.929
I'm impressed in some ways that these younger architects

721
00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:16.399
who are talking now about the 15 minute city,

722
00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:19.409
they're like trying to relaunch the idea from an

723
00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:22.489
environmental perspective without any of the planned baggage, but

724
00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:26.729
it's essentially the same idea. They're just rebranding it

725
00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:29.580
to make it sound more modern and, and, um,

726
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.370
you know, less associated with the sort of problematic

727
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.370
socialist past.

728
00:40:36.189 --> 00:40:39.560
OK, so, I mean, I'm not sure if you're

729
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.610
religious or not. I would imagine you're not because

730
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:46.129
of your liking of socialism and things like that,

731
00:40:46.169 --> 00:40:49.929
but do you think that monastic life can also

732
00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:52.169
constitute a form of utopia?

733
00:40:52.689 --> 00:40:55.090
Absolutely. In fact, I think that monastic life is

734
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.689
probably the original utopia. So if we think of

735
00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:02.010
like uh Saint Benedict of Nursia, um, I was

736
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:05.709
raised Catholic and so I um I think that

737
00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:10.500
when we think of early monastic communities, so the,

738
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:15.649
the earliest monastic communities were Buddhists. Uh, THEY decided

739
00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:18.760
to live collectively at first during the rainy season,

740
00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:22.520
uh, and then eventually they decided to settle collectively,

741
00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:26.370
and we know that there in, in the Christian

742
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:30.090
tradition there were Aramitic, um, monasteries of people who

743
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:33.290
live by like live by themselves, hermits, but that

744
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.010
eventually there was the formation of enobidic communities which

745
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:42.889
are settled communities of religious people living together. To

746
00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:46.610
share their property in common. And uh and that

747
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.090
tradition starts in Egypt, and then it moves to

748
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.129
Italy, and Saint Benedict of Nursia creates this thing

749
00:41:52.129 --> 00:41:55.639
called the rule of Saint Benedict, which is essentially

750
00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:59.469
a text about how a bunch of non-related people

751
00:41:59.729 --> 00:42:02.209
could live together in harmony with each other and

752
00:42:02.209 --> 00:42:04.770
with nature. It is in, in so many ways

753
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:11.100
fundamentally a utopian community document. And, and that is

754
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:17.820
if, if, if we think about um Monasteries. In

755
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.139
all traditions, right, where you're living outside of the

756
00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:23.020
world, the one thing that I think is really

757
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.290
fascinating is that most monasteries, not all, but most

758
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:31.729
monasteries take in children. Right? And they, and they

759
00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:35.090
raise those children collectively outside of the, the strictures

760
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.560
of the the patriarchal nuclear family. And so, yes,

761
00:42:38.649 --> 00:42:42.129
absolutely. And, and when we think about certain kinds

762
00:42:42.129 --> 00:42:46.250
of structures where we still live communally today like

763
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.250
university dormitories, if you've ever spent time on a

764
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:55.429
residential university campus, universities are modeled on monasteries. And

765
00:42:55.429 --> 00:42:59.070
even um Charles Fourier, who talks about the philancery,

766
00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.389
right, the philanceri is an interesting portmanteau of the

767
00:43:02.389 --> 00:43:07.830
word phalanx and monastery. So monasteries and monastic forms

768
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.189
of living are really fundamental, I think, to utopian

769
00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.629
visions of community.

770
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.169
OK, so in terms of these societies, we talked

771
00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:23.760
about several of their aspects like for example, family,

772
00:43:24.149 --> 00:43:28.479
uh eco the economy, gender roles and stuff like

773
00:43:28.479 --> 00:43:31.689
that. One thing I haven't asked you about yet

774
00:43:31.689 --> 00:43:35.850
is education. So do you think that in these

775
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:40.570
societies there are alternative forms of education and that

776
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.159
we also need that or not?

777
00:43:43.919 --> 00:43:45.790
Yeah, I, I spent a whole chapter in the

778
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.909
book talking about education. I think education is probably

779
00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:51.229
one of the, the key linchpins of, of building

780
00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:54.899
an alternative society because public education in particular, which

781
00:43:55.379 --> 00:43:58.830
was itself a utopian demand, you got to remember

782
00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.350
the 10th point of the communist manifesto was public

783
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.199
education at public expense for all children in public

784
00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:10.639
schools, right? Somehow that vision of education got co-opted

785
00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:13.929
and public education has largely become a tool of

786
00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:17.489
social control. Uh, AND that's why, I mean, if

787
00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:19.770
you look at the situation in my country, like

788
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.370
Republicans are constantly trying to get into the schools

789
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.770
and control what students are taught and what books

790
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:29.810
they read, there's a real desire to control education

791
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.110
and so. Yes, if we're going to live in

792
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.110
a different world, we have to have a different

793
00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.469
view of education. And uh I spent a lot

794
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:42.020
of time in the book talking about alternate visions

795
00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.590
of of education and the ways in which young

796
00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.030
people learn about the world. And I think that,

797
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.050
you know, they're they're sort of two. I mean,

798
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.729
I, I could say a lot, but so I

799
00:44:51.729 --> 00:44:53.969
won't because there's, there's just a lot of information

800
00:44:53.969 --> 00:44:55.409
in that chapter because that was sort of a

801
00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:58.169
chapter that was really important to me because I

802
00:44:58.169 --> 00:45:01.159
am myself a professor. I am an educator. And

803
00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:04.689
I think that there's, there's sort of three parts

804
00:45:04.689 --> 00:45:08.330
of education. And one part of education is to

805
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.370
basically equip us with the tools that we need

806
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.729
to function in the world, right? We need to

807
00:45:12.729 --> 00:45:14.570
be able to be on time and we need

808
00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.689
to be able to play well with others, and

809
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:19.629
we need to be able to like Do math

810
00:45:19.629 --> 00:45:21.909
and and and read and have, you know, essential

811
00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:24.350
literacy and and sort of understand when we're being

812
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.060
lied to and when we're not being lied to

813
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.510
and, you know, just sort of be able to

814
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.939
function. And then there's a sort of kind of

815
00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:31.110
education which I think of as sort of more

816
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.739
of a pedantic form of education, which is information,

817
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.030
right? And this is the kind of thing that

818
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.949
is, is, is dying right now because we can

819
00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:38.790
get all the information we need on Wikipedia and

820
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.149
so there's no need to go and read a

821
00:45:41.149 --> 00:45:43.469
really long book when you could just like read

822
00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:45.979
the 15 minute summary or whatever AI can give

823
00:45:45.979 --> 00:45:48.780
you a Uh, you know, a small little summary

824
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.320
that you You, uh, You just, uh, you just

825
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.879
absorb and you forget. It it's like it's, it's

826
00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:58.709
it's it it's a sort of informational aspect of

827
00:45:58.709 --> 00:46:01.070
education is, is, is, is in flux right now,

828
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.429
I think. But then there's this third aspect of

829
00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:08.229
education, which is the, the education of the mind

830
00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:10.699
and and and what we call critical thinking skills,

831
00:46:10.709 --> 00:46:16.739
and this idea. That all human beings, we have

832
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:20.219
this thing called the prefrontal cortex. It's the it's

833
00:46:20.219 --> 00:46:24.699
the rational part of our brain and it's a

834
00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:33.629
very calorically, energetically hungry part of the brain. And

835
00:46:33.629 --> 00:46:36.310
so we don't need to use it and we

836
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.709
don't need to grow it. And so it, if,

837
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.280
if we don't use it, and if we don't

838
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:48.540
grow it, it just doesn't develop. And so One

839
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.439
of the things that I think education has done

840
00:46:52.439 --> 00:46:58.300
in the last 150, 200 years is to democratize.

841
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.979
The growth of our prefrontal cortices, so that even

842
00:47:02.979 --> 00:47:07.300
the children of poor people can develop rational thinking

843
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:10.300
skills. I mean, I'm talking physically about developing a

844
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.540
part of the brain that would not develop if

845
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.500
you start working as a child at 13 or

846
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.379
14 or 15. Like, if you're, if you don't

847
00:47:17.379 --> 00:47:22.090
need or. If you're on your phone, right, constantly,

848
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.100
and you're just like being fed a steady stream

849
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.340
of reels or TikToks or whatever, and you don't

850
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.300
ever actually have to think. Your prefrontal cortex will

851
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.750
just stop growing, and once it stops growing, It's

852
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.459
done. You can't like, you can't get it back.

853
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.949
And so I think that the, the value of

854
00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:44.860
education and the importance of education is to continue

855
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:51.429
to, to support a more egalitarian growth of the

856
00:47:51.429 --> 00:47:56.629
prefrontal cortex, because what's happening in 2025. If you

857
00:47:56.629 --> 00:47:58.820
ask me, and this may be a little bit

858
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.679
of a controversial point of view, but what's happening

859
00:48:01.909 --> 00:48:07.899
is that we're seeing a, a in egalitarian distribution

860
00:48:07.899 --> 00:48:11.669
of cognitive ability, so that people like, you know,

861
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.270
like Mark Zuckerberg or whatever, doesn't let his children

862
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.340
play on the phone. That should tell you something,

863
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:21.590
right? Um, THESE, these tech titans are creating these

864
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.429
very addictive social media platforms don't want their own

865
00:48:24.429 --> 00:48:29.169
children to be on them. And so elite people.

866
00:48:30.169 --> 00:48:35.000
Economic and political and cultural elites will raise their

867
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.600
children to have these cognitive capacities, and the rest

868
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.510
of society is literally going to be cognitively unequal.

869
00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:46.409
This is not just about economically unequal. I'm actually

870
00:48:46.409 --> 00:48:52.550
saying that they will have ultimately less cognitive capacity

871
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:57.739
because they haven't had the opportunities to develop. Certain

872
00:48:57.739 --> 00:49:00.820
parts of their brain which require certain kinds of

873
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.780
stimulation at a particular age in order for those

874
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.139
parts of the brain to develop. And so, the

875
00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:10.840
role of education. In a utopian society, and especially

876
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.000
now that we're living in a world of AI,

877
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.770
right? Where we have computers that are gonna be

878
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.729
thinking for us, that are going to prevent us

879
00:49:18.729 --> 00:49:22.840
from thinking for ourselves, is to develop, to make

880
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.750
sure absolutely sure that every child has the opportunity

881
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.479
to develop those cognitive capacities if they want to.

882
00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.479
And I just think that it's. It's an absolute

883
00:49:33.479 --> 00:49:36.709
crime right now of what's happening around the world

884
00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:39.320
where people are basically being prevented. I mean, we're

885
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.280
basically going back to the 17th, 16th, 15th century.

886
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.280
We're going back to the Middle Ages, where most

887
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.719
people don't learn to read, where most people weren't

888
00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:50.679
weren't uh numerate, where people didn't have to think

889
00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:52.840
because they basically worked in agriculture and they just

890
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.120
had to follow orders and do what they were

891
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.959
told, and they didn't need a brain or the

892
00:49:58.959 --> 00:50:02.820
history of women, right? Um, NOT being educated because

893
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.300
they all they had to do was make babies

894
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.699
and they didn't need a brain for that. And

895
00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:07.659
I think that this is a, this is a,

896
00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:10.979
this is the worst form of inequality, this cognitive

897
00:50:10.979 --> 00:50:13.340
inequality. It is, it is, it is, it is

898
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.939
creating a class of people that do not have

899
00:50:15.939 --> 00:50:19.179
the cognitive tools to liberate themselves from oppression, and

900
00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:20.979
I just think this is the worst form of

901
00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:22.939
inequality we face right now in the world today.

902
00:50:24.979 --> 00:50:28.810
So these different forms of social organization we talked

903
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:33.149
about like the ones in Denmark and China. Do

904
00:50:33.149 --> 00:50:35.370
you think that it would be possible for them

905
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.129
to operate at the state level? I mean, instead

906
00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:42.409
of the level of just small communities, uh, at

907
00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:45.600
the level of an entire country, for example.

908
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:48.330
Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I, I do think that

909
00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:52.389
it's possible. Again, it depends on how big the

910
00:50:52.389 --> 00:50:57.620
country is. Um, I think geographic proximity is probably

911
00:50:57.949 --> 00:51:02.830
somewhat important. Uh, I, you know, there's a big

912
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.270
debate about ethnic homogeneity, like some people say, well,

913
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.030
the Scandinavian countries work so well because they're more

914
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.510
ethnically homogenous, like they will never happen in the

915
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.860
United States because we're too diverse. I'm not very,

916
00:51:14.989 --> 00:51:17.590
I'm not very convinced by those arguments because I

917
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:19.350
think that basically what people are saying is that

918
00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.669
we're just all racists, and so we can't overcome

919
00:51:21.669 --> 00:51:23.899
our racism, and that just does, that's just stupid.

920
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.550
Obviously, we can overcome our racism. We have in

921
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.310
the past, and so that's just a, that's just

922
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.179
a, you know, a question of will and development

923
00:51:32.179 --> 00:51:38.500
and education. But I do think that any And

924
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.909
this is, this is so, so your question is

925
00:51:40.909 --> 00:51:46.189
a complicated one because You're what you're saying is

926
00:51:47.629 --> 00:51:52.639
Can we do A sort of extreme form of

927
00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:58.189
redistributive politics within the container of the nation state.

928
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.000
And, and some people will say that the nation

929
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.199
state is the problem, right? That the nation states

930
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:10.919
exists in order to prevent the redistribution of resources.

931
00:52:11.469 --> 00:52:13.709
I happen to be the kind of person who

932
00:52:13.709 --> 00:52:17.620
thinks no, the that the nation state can be

933
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:22.510
a tool for redistribution. It can actually represent the

934
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.110
will of the people. I, I, I maybe, maybe

935
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.830
I'm naive, but I actually think that the state

936
00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:34.520
can be. A valuable. Thing, right? Um, THE problem

937
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:40.830
is how do you maintain democratic participation in that

938
00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.870
state so that it does not become some kind

939
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:45.590
of totalitarian regime, so it does not become some

940
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:51.070
kind of patriarchal nightmare, you know, um, and that's

941
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.179
trickier, right? There, there is, there is a tendency

942
00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:58.290
to When the state becomes the paternalistic sort of

943
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:02.889
provider, that there there there are inherently problems that

944
00:53:02.889 --> 00:53:06.689
then arise with the stickiness of state power, that

945
00:53:06.689 --> 00:53:09.169
it's not as flexible and dynamic as we might

946
00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:12.570
want that state to be as society changes. And

947
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:17.250
so, in theory, absolutely, I'm a profound believer in

948
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:23.600
the possibility of people. Using the state for their

949
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.159
own collective well-being. Um, BUT I also recognize that

950
00:53:28.159 --> 00:53:30.760
there are problems with the model, and so we

951
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.719
need to keep working on it. That's, that's my

952
00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:35.520
feeling is that we haven't found the right model

953
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.600
yet, but that doesn't mean that that model doesn't

954
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.719
exist. We just have to keep pursuing this utopian

955
00:53:40.719 --> 00:53:42.270
goal of refining the model.

956
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.820
Since we're talking about utopias, do you think that

957
00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.379
communism itself also counts as a form of utopia?

958
00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:56.090
I mean, certainly in Marxist theory, when we think

959
00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.919
about sort of the teleological. I mean, Marxism is

960
00:54:00.919 --> 00:54:05.560
a sort of Hegelian teleological dialectic, right? So so

961
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.239
one stage follows the next. You have like um

962
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:12.389
slavery and then feudalism and then capitalism, and then

963
00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:16.560
socialism, and then ultimately communism, right? So if we're

964
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.830
talking about traditional Marxist theory where communism is the

965
00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:24.310
moment when the state withers away and people live

966
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:28.520
collectively and there's no law, of course that's utopian.

967
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.949
Right, that's, that's probably one of the most extreme

968
00:54:30.949 --> 00:54:34.040
utopian visions that we have still active in our

969
00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.679
societies today. I don't think when people use the

970
00:54:37.679 --> 00:54:41.840
word communism to refer to 20th century state socialism

971
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.850
in Eastern Europe, which themselves, they did not call

972
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:48.840
themselves communist societies, they called themselves socialist societies because

973
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.165
they recognized that they were at a. Stage that

974
00:54:52.165 --> 00:54:55.844
was still socialism, right? They, they, they, they often

975
00:54:55.844 --> 00:54:58.405
called themselves communists. They were part they were members

976
00:54:58.405 --> 00:55:02.784
of communist parties because the goal was communism. But

977
00:55:02.784 --> 00:55:05.324
the stage that they were at, they called really

978
00:55:05.324 --> 00:55:08.810
existing socialism. And that, of course, was not a

979
00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.570
utopian society. It was an attempt to build the

980
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:15.250
conditions under which utopia would be realized eventually, but

981
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:18.810
the societies as they existed, were still very much

982
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.169
in the stage of basically trying to figure out

983
00:55:22.169 --> 00:55:25.469
how to make states work to redistribute wealth in

984
00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:28.800
a more equitable way. Um, AND so it's again,

985
00:55:28.939 --> 00:55:31.439
it, it depends on what you, what you mean

986
00:55:31.439 --> 00:55:34.080
by the word communism because in my country when

987
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.629
we say communist we're almost always talking about the

988
00:55:36.629 --> 00:55:39.800
Soviet Union and we're not talking about the ideal

989
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.600
Marxist form of communism which is this moment where

990
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.070
there is no state and there is no law.

991
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.000
And, yeah, yeah,

992
00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:51.050
I was talking about the ideal vision because I

993
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:55.620
mean, actually, if we at least follow the Marxist

994
00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:00.100
vision of communism, we've never had a communist society.

995
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.510
Right. Exactly. And that's what I'm trying to say,

996
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.959
yeah, and I think that, you know, that's why.

997
00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:08.570
I think it's very important to remember that Marx

998
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.979
and Engels were in dialogue with the utopian socialists

999
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.729
in many ways, like a lot of their basic

1000
00:56:14.729 --> 00:56:17.989
ideas come from people like Flora Tristan, especially around

1001
00:56:17.989 --> 00:56:21.199
the issue of the family. And so they were

1002
00:56:21.199 --> 00:56:26.239
very aware of like the technologies of how we

1003
00:56:26.239 --> 00:56:30.399
would eventually get to communism, but what they disagreed

1004
00:56:30.399 --> 00:56:33.770
with fundamentally was that you could build kind of

1005
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:36.810
a little utopia within a capitalist society and that

1006
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.760
that would make any difference. They really felt like

1007
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.239
you had to seize the state. You actually had

1008
00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:45.639
to overthrow everything in order to to get to

1009
00:56:45.639 --> 00:56:48.600
that end state of communism, you know, and then

1010
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.189
today. I think it's worth again also, you know,

1011
00:56:52.229 --> 00:56:56.899
recognizing like the anarcho-communists, and there are many people.

1012
00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:03.659
Who believe that climate change uh is going to,

1013
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.100
you know, do so much damage to the planet

1014
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.270
that we, we will eventually have what's called civilizational

1015
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:15.120
collapse. So there are these people called post-civilizationalists, right?

1016
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.820
They, they think that like we don't have to

1017
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.820
do anything, like everything is just gonna go to

1018
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.610
hell. And then from the ashes of that, we

1019
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.379
can build the society that we want. And so

1020
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:27.520
we have to be prepared for that. So they're

1021
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.080
not even saying that, you know, we should, um,

1022
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.510
you know, build little communities that will then spread

1023
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.520
in a kind of federated, you know, way, and

1024
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.439
they're not saying we should overthrow the state. They're

1025
00:57:37.439 --> 00:57:40.379
just basically saying, you know what, Civilization is doomed,

1026
00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:43.280
like we've screwed the planet. Capitalism is using too

1027
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.040
many resources. Whatever, you know, is gonna happen in

1028
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.439
the next 20 years or 30 years. I don't

1029
00:57:49.439 --> 00:57:51.520
know, sometimes they have a very short horizon, sometimes

1030
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.199
they have a long horizon, but we need to

1031
00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:56.399
be ready to build. Our utopia when the time

1032
00:57:56.399 --> 00:57:58.600
comes. And so you have some of these communities

1033
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.350
where I call them sort of extreme green preppers.

1034
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.209
I think in in um Portugal there's Tamara, right?

1035
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.040
There are some of these other eco villages where

1036
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.000
they're really trying to imagine what society is going

1037
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.600
to be like post civilization. And uh and they

1038
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.479
think of that as a good thing, right? They,

1039
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.189
they're very convinced that this will be a moment

1040
00:58:19.189 --> 00:58:21.919
for the human race to hit reset and we'll

1041
00:58:21.919 --> 00:58:24.840
have and we will actually achieve some form of

1042
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:30.209
communism in the aftermath of civilizational collapse. You know,

1043
00:58:30.409 --> 00:58:33.010
it's a pretty extreme view, but it's out there

1044
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.770
and people are talking about it, and I think

1045
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.719
it's worth talking about because it is an interesting,

1046
00:58:37.969 --> 00:58:41.449
it is an interesting thought experiment, like, were the

1047
00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:45.760
world to like suddenly change tomorrow, um, how would

1048
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.709
we rebuild our societies? Would we, would we actually

1049
00:58:48.709 --> 00:58:50.929
reproduce capitalism in the way that we have it

1050
00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:52.909
today, or would we actually improve on the model

1051
00:58:52.909 --> 00:58:55.090
and do something or do something completely different?

1052
00:58:56.969 --> 00:58:59.800
What do you think that we can gain by

1053
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.129
studying the history of this sort of social dreams

1054
00:59:04.129 --> 00:59:07.620
and utopian visions of society that people have and

1055
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:12.300
sometime, sometimes try to implement to varying degrees of

1056
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:12.719
success?

1057
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.840
Imagination and hope. We need both of those. If

1058
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.070
we're going to survive the next decades with all

1059
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:23.679
of the variety of problems that we are facing

1060
00:59:23.679 --> 00:59:26.560
in the world today, probably foremost, the climate crisis,

1061
00:59:26.639 --> 00:59:32.669
but also just in general, there's so much. Negative,

1062
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:38.709
um. I mean, war and famine. I mean, I,

1063
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.949
I could, I could, the list could go on

1064
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:43.590
for quite a long time. The, the, the, the

1065
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:49.750
incredible uh and fast development of artificial intelligence. Who

1066
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:52.989
knows when general artificial intelligence will be around. There's

1067
00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.260
a we're going through an accelerated period of change.

1068
00:59:56.929 --> 01:00:00.810
And for some people, it shuts them down. Like

1069
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.620
they, I feel like a lot of people have

1070
01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:07.860
become politically and socially ideologically catatonic. They can't, they

1071
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.979
can't face or cope with the amount of negative

1072
01:00:10.979 --> 01:00:13.139
news and the amount of change that is happening

1073
01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:15.729
in the world today. And so studying the past

1074
01:00:16.169 --> 01:00:21.830
history of utopia. Gives us imagination, gives us possibility

1075
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.219
that things could be different, that they things have

1076
01:00:24.219 --> 01:00:26.300
always been bad in the world. There's always been

1077
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.939
bad stuff happening and um and and and people

1078
01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:32.179
have always been resisting. I think that's the most

1079
01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:34.169
important lesson that we get is that people have

1080
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:38.179
in every single cultural context, in every single historical

1081
01:00:38.179 --> 01:00:40.780
epoch where there has been injustice or where there

1082
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.699
has been tyranny or where there has been uncontrolled.

1083
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.330
Social change, there have always been people who resisted.

1084
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.729
There have always been people who use our creativity,

1085
01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.939
our flexibility, and our adaptivity to challenge the status

1086
01:00:54.939 --> 01:00:57.340
quo and create new ways of living. And by

1087
01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.580
learning about these people, that's what I hope this

1088
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.370
book brings to people, is this possibility of hope,

1089
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.979
and this possibility of optimism that the future can

1090
01:01:05.979 --> 01:01:08.139
be different because we have the capacity to make

1091
01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:09.300
it different if we want to.

1092
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:13.570
OK, but on the other hand, and this will

1093
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.969
be my last question, I guess we, I also

1094
01:01:16.969 --> 01:01:19.879
need to ask you about what you think might

1095
01:01:19.879 --> 01:01:22.969
be some of the, if you think there's any,

1096
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:26.330
of course, some of the drawbacks and limitations of

1097
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.364
this. Utopian visions because we know actually that, for

1098
01:01:30.364 --> 01:01:33.524
example, in the 19th century, some of the societies,

1099
01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:39.364
alternative societies, people tried actually failed. So, what, what

1100
01:01:39.364 --> 01:01:43.455
do you think are perhaps some of the pre

1101
01:01:43.455 --> 01:01:48.084
if not drawbacks and limitations, maybe difficulties in trying

1102
01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:50.284
to implement these kinds of society?

1103
01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.929
Yeah, so I say in the book, and, and

1104
01:01:53.929 --> 01:01:56.080
I think this is really important to go back

1105
01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.449
to this discussion that we had earlier about the

1106
01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:01.610
no place and the good place, the word utopia

1107
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:06.850
itself. So, utopia has to remain on the horizon.

1108
01:02:07.689 --> 01:02:10.989
I think if anybody tells you, hey, by the

1109
01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:13.629
way, we're living in utopia, here are the rules

1110
01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.310
and you have to follow them, run away as

1111
01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:20.510
fast as you can, right? Utopia, the minute it

1112
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:23.729
gets to be fixed. The minute it has a

1113
01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.159
a a clear delineated set of rules and rulers,

1114
01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.679
you're no longer in a utopia. You're actually in

1115
01:02:30.679 --> 01:02:33.600
the beginnings of a dystopia, and that's why it's

1116
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.000
so valuable to study these communities that failed, as

1117
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.959
well as the ones that succeeded for as long

1118
01:02:39.959 --> 01:02:42.919
as they did, and then eventually cease to exist

1119
01:02:42.919 --> 01:02:46.719
for a variety of reasons. So, in my view,

1120
01:02:47.419 --> 01:02:52.699
Utopia is always about challenging the hegemony of the

1121
01:02:52.699 --> 01:02:57.570
status quo, right? So people like um Ernst Bloch,

1122
01:02:57.699 --> 01:03:01.330
right, that these German uh philosophers or Karl Mannheim,

1123
01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.100
they talk a lot about the role of ideology.

1124
01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:09.139
We all live in an ideological system that that

1125
01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:11.580
shapes our way of thinking about the world, what

1126
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.100
we imagine the world to be and how we

1127
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.429
imagine the world to function. Again, what you said,

1128
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:20.010
uh, we talked about earlier that in times of

1129
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:25.010
great upheaval, people start to generate social ideas, social

1130
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:29.419
dreams, because the status quo has been upset. But

1131
01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:34.399
what Mannheim and Bloch argue is that utopia, utopian

1132
01:03:34.399 --> 01:03:38.889
visions as a concept, they exist to challenge hegemonic

1133
01:03:38.889 --> 01:03:42.250
thinking in society. And again, I think this is

1134
01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.610
a sort of dialectical way of imagining the progress

1135
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:50.729
of human history. We are always a thesis in

1136
01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:53.449
search of an antithesis which will create a conflict,

1137
01:03:53.489 --> 01:03:55.649
which will create a new synthesis in a very

1138
01:03:55.649 --> 01:03:59.169
kind of Hegelian dialectical way of of of thinking

1139
01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:03.929
about history. And so, For me, that's why utopia

1140
01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:06.500
can't be a thesis. It can never be a

1141
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.330
fixed thing. It always has to play the role

1142
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:12.260
of antithesis. The minute you create a society within

1143
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.500
that society, there has to be people criticizing that

1144
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:22.020
society. And so utopian thinking plays the role of

1145
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.449
like the devil's advocate in many ways. It says,

1146
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.300
hey, the way you're living your life or the

1147
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.750
way we're doing things right now is not ideal.

1148
01:04:29.459 --> 01:04:33.669
And And this reflects a reality about human history,

1149
01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:36.540
which is that human history and human evolution, the

1150
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:39.149
the circumstances under which we live are always changing.

1151
01:04:39.899 --> 01:04:41.489
And so we can never have a set of

1152
01:04:41.489 --> 01:04:43.770
rules that work for everybody at the same time

1153
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:46.020
in all places, right? It just, it, it like

1154
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.810
society doesn't work that way. We're always going to

1155
01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:51.000
be developing because things are changing all around us.

1156
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.560
And so people will try to create new realities.

1157
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:57.770
People will try to keep new rules, new ideologies

1158
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.489
to keep people in place. Ideological systems are about

1159
01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:04.419
maintaining social order. And then when those ideological systems

1160
01:05:04.419 --> 01:05:06.699
break down, it's not surprising that we see a

1161
01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:09.540
breakdown in social order. And so what utopians are

1162
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.500
always trying to do is say, hey, this social

1163
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.889
order that you've created benefits a very small number

1164
01:05:15.889 --> 01:05:20.669
of people. And that's, that's been generally true in

1165
01:05:20.669 --> 01:05:22.790
history, and one of the things that we've seen,

1166
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.909
again, if you think about the teleology of history

1167
01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:29.260
is that Maybe with the exception of the last

1168
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:34.449
decade, is that we've built societies where greater number

1169
01:05:34.449 --> 01:05:37.530
of people benefit from the system. It's not perfect,

1170
01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.780
right? But we don't, for most of us are

1171
01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.540
not living in like, you know, totalitarian monarchies or

1172
01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.179
something like that where there's like one person with

1173
01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:46.580
all the power and everybody else has none. We're

1174
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:51.219
actually getting, we're getting better. Progress is slow, and

1175
01:05:51.219 --> 01:05:55.739
we sometimes we revert to the past. There's regression.

1176
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.270
But there is this forward momentum, and I argue

1177
01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:03.459
in the book. That utopians are the key, right?

1178
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.840
These social dreamers, these radical thinkers, square pegs in

1179
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.020
the round hole, right? Like there's all different ways

1180
01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.919
people have sometimes they've been considered fools or they've

1181
01:06:12.919 --> 01:06:16.919
been naive or whatever crazy they, the word utopian

1182
01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:20.229
means unrealistic, right? That the whole way in which

1183
01:06:20.229 --> 01:06:22.280
we talk about people who are utopian or have

1184
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.399
utopian thoughts. Is that they're, they're crazy. They, they

1185
01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.929
don't make any sense. But those are the people

1186
01:06:27.929 --> 01:06:30.929
that actually push us forward. We follow those people

1187
01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:34.370
into the future. We, they forge the path forward

1188
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.439
to us. I mean, As I talk about in

1189
01:06:36.439 --> 01:06:39.219
the book, like the idea of kindergartens and childcare,

1190
01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.600
utopian, the idea of public education in public schools,

1191
01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:46.639
utopian, the idea of divorce, utopian, women keeping their

1192
01:06:46.639 --> 01:06:50.600
own names, utopian. All of these were ideas that

1193
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.679
started out as totally utopian pie in the sky.

1194
01:06:54.189 --> 01:06:57.659
And then slowly, they became mainstream, and now we

1195
01:06:57.659 --> 01:06:59.429
think of dropping our kids off at a kindergarten

1196
01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:01.709
is the most natural thing in the world, or

1197
01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:03.590
getting a divorce, or sending your kids to a

1198
01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:06.419
public school. That's not utopian. You're not participating in

1199
01:07:06.419 --> 01:07:09.219
a utopia. You're just doing what everybody else does.

1200
01:07:09.669 --> 01:07:13.149
And so, in some ways, the success of utopian

1201
01:07:13.149 --> 01:07:14.669
ideas is that you don't even think of them

1202
01:07:14.669 --> 01:07:17.340
as utopian anymore. You forget that they were ever

1203
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.050
utopian to begin with. The downside of this, I

1204
01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:26.429
think, is that some utopian ideas can justify incredible

1205
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.479
evils in the world if they are implemented by

1206
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:32.850
the wrong people, because in times of great social

1207
01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:37.320
upheaval, people are also really looking for answers. And,

1208
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.280
you know, not all utopias are progressive. Some utopias

1209
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.300
can be extremely regressive and can be extremely um

1210
01:07:47.199 --> 01:07:49.909
Counterproductive to the progress of human history. I mean,

1211
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:52.989
many people would say that capitalism in its purest

1212
01:07:52.989 --> 01:07:54.909
form is a utopian vision of the way you

1213
01:07:54.909 --> 01:07:58.310
organize the economy. And so, yeah, I, I think

1214
01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:00.020
we have to be careful when we talk about

1215
01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.350
utopia, but in my vision, and I think in

1216
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:04.510
the vision of, of, as I said, philosophers and

1217
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:07.790
sociologists like Ernst Bloch and Karl Mannheim and and

1218
01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:09.669
many of the other scholars who I talk about

1219
01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:12.310
in the book, who talk about the value of

1220
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:16.830
utopian thinking. What we're saying is that utopianism is

1221
01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:19.500
always a critique. It's kind of a counter hegemonic

1222
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.350
ideology to the reigning ideology that that maintains a

1223
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:26.919
certain social order that benefits a small group in

1224
01:08:26.919 --> 01:08:30.750
society. And if we want to try to redistribute

1225
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:34.310
resources and redistribute privilege more equitably among more members

1226
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.950
of society, then we always need to have utopians

1227
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.669
and utopian thinking in our lives.

1228
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:45.350
Great. So the book is again everyday Utopia, What

1229
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.450
2 1000 Years of Wild Experiments Can Teach Us

1230
01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:51.229
about the Good Life. And of course, I'm leaving

1231
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:54.509
a link within the description of the interview. And

1232
01:08:54.509 --> 01:08:58.509
Dr. Gody, where can people find your work on
