00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.519
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.930
joined by Doctor Peter Linder. He is Distinguished professor

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.710
Emeritus in the Department of Economics at the University

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.479
of California Davis. And today we're talking about his

6
00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:20.600
book Making Social Spending Work. So, Doctor Linder, welcome

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.909
to the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.760
Well, thank you, Ricardo. A pleasure for me too.

9
00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.450
So, just to introduce the topic here, let me

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.569
start perhaps with the most basic question just for

11
00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.049
people to understand or to have a good idea

12
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:39.060
of what we're talking about here exactly. So, what,

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.610
what is social spending and what counts as social

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.970
spending?

15
00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:49.669
In my work, I am concentrating on government spending

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.349
on public education, public health, uh, public pension insurance,

17
00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.560
public housing, and welfare for the poor. Things like

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.599
that. Those are the kinds of spending that are

19
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.489
always defined as social spending by the OECD and

20
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:12.059
others. I could have added private and charitable spending

21
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:16.019
on the same things. Um, I don't, I talk

22
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.339
about them a bit in the book, but I

23
00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:20.660
don't emphasize them because the the real controversy. What

24
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.739
people are wondering about is the government spending, so

25
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.300
government spending on public education, public health, and those

26
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.970
other things.

27
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.419
OK, but since uh social spending could be done

28
00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:38.580
through charity or private or or through private entities

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.779
or even private people doing it, what are some

30
00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:47.050
of the most common arguments against government social spending?

31
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.510
Uh, TWO arguments that are related. One, it takes

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.160
money away from productive people and gives it to

33
00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:00.629
people that are less productive because of poor health

34
00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:05.769
or behavior or whatever. And that's often viewed as

35
00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:10.050
unfair. The second argument is that it's a bad

36
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.330
disincentive for everybody. If you're taxing the productive, subsidizing

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
the unproductive, people in general will be less productive

38
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.410
and will have less income to share. Those are

39
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.100
the arguments.

40
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.509
Are those arguments supported by the evidence?

41
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:34.759
Not strongly, um, well, um, the second argument is

42
00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.199
the crucial empirical one. Does it really discourage economic

43
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.039
growth by giving people bad incentives? Um, THE argument

44
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.839
for that is not strong, and that's one of

45
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.000
the main things that I argue in the book.

46
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.470
And so I, I'm not sure if you're going

47
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.800
to reply to this question with the counterarguments to

48
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.360
the arguments you mentioned before, but what are the

49
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.720
most common arguments for government social spending?

50
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:09.380
Um, Growth and equality, that is, it promotes a

51
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.460
people's productivity by investing in them, you know, investing

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.360
in their health, their education, their security. And uh

53
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.229
it makes tends to make things more equal, that

54
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.389
because it insures people who needed help in order

55
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.949
to get the extra productivity.

56
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.259
And why is this still an uh an ongoing

57
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.119
debate? Why are people still debating whether government social

58
00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.399
spending is good or bad?

59
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.490
It will always be ongoing for the simple reason

60
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.539
that there's a conflict of interest. We know that

61
00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.339
this takes money from some people and makes it

62
00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.460
available to others. It takes money from people who

63
00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.979
don't have bad outcomes, don't need insurance, or are

64
00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.610
rich. It gives money to people who it wants

65
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.220
to invest in. That means there will always be

66
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.899
a conflict of self-interest between those who know they're

67
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.100
gonna be paying and not getting so much benefits,

68
00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.139
and those who know they're gonna be getting more

69
00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.050
benefits. Guaranteed. It will always be an argument.

70
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.519
So now I would like to ask you about

71
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.420
uh the conditions that allow for government social spending

72
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.779
to take off, but perhaps uh just before we

73
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.209
get into that, looking back in history, how old

74
00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.929
is this type of social spending?

75
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.290
Different histories for different types. The oldest is simply

76
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.250
relief to the poor. We know they gave some

77
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.200
of that in the Middle Ages, especially to the

78
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.250
poor who are obviously disabled or old widows, something

79
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.890
like that. Uh, THAT goes back to the Middle

80
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.709
Ages, maybe earlier in some settings. Public education is

81
00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:02.309
really only from the early 19th century, so that's

82
00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.670
only a couple 100 years old. Yes, uh, paid

83
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.410
for mainly by the state. Uh, YET, it's not

84
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.329
until the 20th century even that social spending is

85
00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:16.329
great at all, as great as, say, 3% of

86
00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:21.329
GDP. So most social spending is extremely recent, even

87
00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.010
post-war.

88
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.899
And going back to the question I mentioned before,

89
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.140
are there any particular kinds of conditions that allow

90
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.269
for government social spending to take off, or is

91
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.549
there a minimum, a minimum set of conditions or

92
00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:38.829
not?

93
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.529
Good question. Uh, ESPECIALLY when we look at that

94
00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.850
history, right? For most of human history, this never

95
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.799
happened. Now it's happened a lot in the last

96
00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.399
100 years. And it's still here. So what were

97
00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:59.160
the conditions that were so recent? Um, I think

98
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.070
the main thing to emphasize is that, uh, political

99
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.440
voice. Has spread to the masses. It was through

100
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.799
most of history is simply the the ruler and

101
00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:17.559
his army, his henchmen, or uh the landed classes

102
00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.350
that had the power and so this sort of

103
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.480
thing just didn't happen for millennia. But once you

104
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.029
give voice to the masses, uh, that makes it.

105
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.380
Uh, POSSIBLE for this sort of thing to take

106
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.459
off because there's a, a growing share of society

107
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.859
that wants it. Something else too, on the education

108
00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.059
front, which is an extremely important early um type

109
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:49.769
of social spending. We began to have. An economy

110
00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:53.570
that would reward people for being illiterate and numerate

111
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.230
and more informed. Once there was a lot of

112
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.220
need for information about what's going on in the

113
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.059
world and what's changing. So, in particular, it's the

114
00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:07.619
rise of commerce. Think of since Columbus, uh, and

115
00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:10.100
the rise of commerce all over the world. Now

116
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.260
it becomes the case that almost anybody could gain.

117
00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.589
By getting education, um, you don't need to have

118
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.149
some special technology come along. Just as soon as

119
00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:24.910
you have commerce and people trading a lot, the

120
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.579
world will get a big, uh, collective gain from,

121
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.630
um, literacy and numeracy.

122
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:41.630
And why is it that Northwest Europe historically seems

123
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.589
to have led the way? Why North Northwest Europe

124
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:46.149
specifically? Yeah.

125
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.709
That's a good question, uh. It. It does have,

126
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.609
it was early in the spread of political voice,

127
00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:00.779
um, for a shorthand we could sort of say

128
00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:06.079
democracy. And that, as I said, is something that

129
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.970
makes uh social spending uh become possible because enough

130
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.910
people will uh stand up and vote for it,

131
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:17.809
uh, at the expense of taxpayers, uh, including themselves.

132
00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.380
That's, I think a main thing, a reason why

133
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.260
Northwest Europe, uh, and it's Northwest Europe also that

134
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.179
had, as I said, for education, that rise of

135
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:32.690
commerce, the, you know, the sudden need for and

136
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.659
the immediate uses for uh basic education. So I

137
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.780
would say North Europe for those reasons, I have

138
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.700
to say North Europe and soon uh Northern America

139
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.780
too. But basically it's it's it's a European thing,

140
00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:53.789
and to this day, for reasons that are sort

141
00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:58.859
of political, social, Europe is still the center of

142
00:08:58.869 --> 00:09:03.619
of social spending. Really all of Europe, even Eastern

143
00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:06.299
Europe, um, that's the center, that's where it happens.

144
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.200
It's, it is largely a European thing.

145
00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:13.210
Yeah, I can confirm it because I live here,

146
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:13.940
so.

147
00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:16.369
OK, so,

148
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.700
uh,

149
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.989
earlier you mentioned when I asked you about how

150
00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.349
old the government social spending is, you mentioned at

151
00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:28.820
a certain point that, for example, public education started

152
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.950
around 200 years ago. Uh, HOW important is universal

153
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.549
education when it comes to growth and equality, for

154
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:38.869
example?

155
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:46.190
Um, THAT'S easy. That's very important. There's There are

156
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.390
high rates of return to all of society and

157
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.369
not just to the child and their parents. From

158
00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:57.330
education. It's always been true. It's just never been

159
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.200
overturned. You keep looking for the day that we

160
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.869
will find a a rising literature saying, you know,

161
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.229
the money spent on education, it's all wasted, and

162
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.679
that's an argument, a hard argument to make, even

163
00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:14.320
just for government money. Uh, EVERYWHERE the returns are

164
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.119
there, and you look at higher education, is the

165
00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:20.479
demand for higher education falling off because people know

166
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.679
that it's not worth it. No, uh, the rates

167
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:27.080
of return are high, the demand is crushing. It's

168
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.799
so hard, it's so hard to get into the

169
00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:34.289
best schools because everybody is applying. Uh, SO the

170
00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:41.539
Contribution to our productivity. From Uh general education is

171
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.770
enormous, so enormous that really there is no society

172
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:51.229
in the world that has not. Um, PAID for

173
00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:56.070
most of its. Primary education through taxes and government.

174
00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.239
That's universal. Everybody does it. They must have figured

175
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:00.150
out something.

176
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.650
Uh, AND so, uh, a particular phenomenon that you

177
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.969
point to at a certain point in your book

178
00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:13.049
is that since around 1910, there's been a somewhat

179
00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:18.650
slow shift in social spending toward supporting the powerful

180
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.929
and the elderly at the expense of assisting the

181
00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:25.250
young and the poor. So, um, could you tell

182
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.330
us a little bit about that and is it,

183
00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:30.659
uh, problematic in some way?

184
00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:36.500
Um, IT is clearly happening over this, these last

185
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.580
100 years. As the budget social budget grows, it

186
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.140
becomes more and more, um, spending on the elderly

187
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.380
and less and less obviously redistributive toward the poor.

188
00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:52.659
Giving money toward the poor has dropped as a

189
00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:57.020
share. Uh, YOU could say, well, rising conservatism doesn't

190
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.219
like. Uh, WELFARE spending, that could be, it could

191
00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.010
also be that the uh the needs are, um,

192
00:12:04.219 --> 00:12:07.099
not as great. You, the poverty line, the share

193
00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:10.099
of people below the poverty line, always tends to

194
00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:12.090
stay high, but that's because you keep raising the

195
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.739
poverty line, and it may be that the political

196
00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:18.409
process is seeing that, you know, in absolute terms,

197
00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:21.669
the needs are lower. So I think that's maybe

198
00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:24.750
one reason why the welfare spending went down. Education

199
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.840
down and pensions up. Well, that's demography, that's the

200
00:12:27.849 --> 00:12:30.270
the aging of population. We don't have so many

201
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.390
children. And uh we have a a few elderly.

202
00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:36.229
I can, I can name one at least.

203
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.900
Uh, AND another very interesting aspect of government social

204
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.739
spending, you point out in the book is what

205
00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:51.010
you call there the free lunch puzzle because apparently,

206
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.679
uh, As uh um apparently when we have larger

207
00:12:56.679 --> 00:13:00.359
social spending budgets, they do not really seem to

208
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:04.510
have, uh, uh, any effects in terms of loss

209
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.830
of GDP or loss of skills or work. So,

210
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.530
how does that happen?

211
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.739
Well, let me comment first on the fact that

212
00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:16.679
the evidence seems to look that way and then

213
00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:19.390
let's think about how it happens, which is a

214
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.500
great research question. Uh, THE evidence, uh, really looks

215
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.320
like this. If you have a period in which

216
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.039
the share of GDP being spent on government social

217
00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:35.969
spending is going up. Mhm. It's just it uh

218
00:13:35.969 --> 00:13:38.210
is going or sorry or is at a higher

219
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.809
level. Uh, IT is not the case that that

220
00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:48.840
is like uh. Uh, A setting where the Um,

221
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.030
GDP is dropping, or GDP per person is dropping.

222
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.159
It, it just is not clear, it just does

223
00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:56.520
not happen that way. Now I'm saying that at

224
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.270
first it just with raw correlations, you know, uh,

225
00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:05.640
the fact is, Uh, large social spending is something

226
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.469
that rich countries do. And that makes it hard

227
00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:12.159
for a person who just wants to come up

228
00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:15.340
with a good propaganda argument against it, to say

229
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.409
that it ruins economic growth, uh, and and makes

230
00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:21.960
prosperity impossible. So it's just hard to see it.

231
00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:26.940
Now that's just raw correlation. What's the causation? Does

232
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.979
social spending cause better growth? Does it secretly worsen

233
00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:36.690
growth, but something else made it happen anyway, um.

234
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.669
That's difficult statistically, uh, to show, but I can

235
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:45.630
give you, and this is the second part of

236
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.669
your question, I can give you not exactly statistical

237
00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:53.830
evidence like from a medical control trial, but I

238
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.109
can give you just good reasons why it should

239
00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:01.510
not have caused much damage to economic growth. Here's

240
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.650
the main reason. Governments are not completely stupid. Uh,

241
00:15:07.109 --> 00:15:09.510
IF something is really dumb and all it does

242
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.469
is worsen economic growth, uh, for the benefit of

243
00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:16.510
some small group, uh, they won't do it. And

244
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.859
if you look at European, uh, especially Northern European,

245
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.409
uh, designs. They they have learned from mistakes. They've

246
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:29.169
made auto course corrections uh when uh setting up

247
00:15:29.169 --> 00:15:33.090
these programs and expanding them. Um, THE basic answer

248
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.190
is that the way it's done is not stupid.

249
00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:39.169
The theories that it would uh really ruin the

250
00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:43.520
economy are theories about kind of a stupid policy.

251
00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:46.200
Yes, that was a danger, and I'm glad people

252
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.690
were worried about it, but it's not actually happening

253
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.270
much. Uh, YOU can find some examples of waste

254
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.020
in government just as you can in private enterprise,

255
00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:59.030
but as an overall phenomenon, no. Now, let me

256
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.349
tell you some specific ways in which it clearly

257
00:16:01.349 --> 00:16:03.710
helps. First of all, if you let me include

258
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.020
education in the social spending, as others have said,

259
00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:09.409
oh, you should have, you should emphasize that all

260
00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:13.669
along. Well, uh, it's, it makes the case so

261
00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:17.789
easy because education is clearly, public education is clearly

262
00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:22.489
raising GDP. Significantly, a good rate of return. Now,

263
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.030
and even beyond that, there are reasons why uh

264
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.030
other kinds of social spending also help, uh, better

265
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:35.940
public health, uh, public health is Something that uh

266
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:42.320
governments. Um, PROMOTE, uh, through public and usually through

267
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.659
public health insurance subsidies. And it makes the world

268
00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:50.859
more productive. Those are 22 quick examples right there.

269
00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:54.119
Uh, I go into others in the book. Uh,

270
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.289
LET me pause there for the moment.

271
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.210
Mhm. No, yes, I was going to ask you

272
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.890
because earlier I asked you about public education specifically,

273
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.569
but there are 2 or 3 more examples of

274
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.969
social spending that I would like to ask you

275
00:17:07.969 --> 00:17:11.948
directly about because together with education. They are the

276
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:16.098
most evident, I think. When it comes to healthcare,

277
00:17:16.428 --> 00:17:20.578
um, I mean, in terms of universal healthcare specifically,

278
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:25.388
how old is it historically and what kinds of

279
00:17:25.388 --> 00:17:29.409
benefits can a particular society get from it?

280
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:33.119
Uh, IT is really, think of it as being

281
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:38.459
since World War II. Mhm. Um, THAT'S basically correct.

282
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.420
That's the easiest way to time it. Um, IT

283
00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:49.239
Uh, benefits society greatly because if you didn't have

284
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.469
any public insurance. People are often will not be

285
00:17:54.469 --> 00:17:59.099
able to afford as much uh private insurance for

286
00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:06.890
their health. Um, And No country has ever, now

287
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.369
at this point I retreat to say, well, it

288
00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:11.290
must be, there must be something in this argument

289
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.160
because this is the way we do it. Uh,

290
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.930
NO country has ever continued since World War II

291
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.050
to have all health be private and waiting for

292
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.130
church charities and things like that. Nobody's ever done

293
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.489
it. So why have they not done it? Um,

294
00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:33.560
BECAUSE they sense that there are strong. Collective externalities.

295
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:38.089
About the public health. Uh, FOR example, if I

296
00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:40.089
think that you are just somebody who lives in

297
00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:42.020
a bad part of town because you're a kind

298
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.130
of a lazy person and you're, you're the wrong

299
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.689
kind of person, I should pay for your improved

300
00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:53.369
sanitation and your health checkups. Because you can spread

301
00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:58.209
disease and in um many countries like say the

302
00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:00.689
United States, here's a a a common symptom of

303
00:19:00.689 --> 00:19:05.930
what's wrong with not having the full insurance. People

304
00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:08.489
are uninsured and they get into a desperate condition.

305
00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:10.260
They are, uh, they have to go to the

306
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.900
emergency room. OK, they go to the emergency room,

307
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.810
they don't have the money. The rest of society

308
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.140
pays more than it would have otherwise, if it

309
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.000
had paid, invested more in preventive health care. Through

310
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.760
government, like local clinics, uh, emmerencias uh in Spain

311
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.439
which have served my wife uh in time of

312
00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:31.699
need and things like that. Um, IF you didn't

313
00:19:31.699 --> 00:19:34.439
have those, then the cost goes up because by

314
00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:37.319
the time they reach the hos hospital's emergency room,

315
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.229
it's really costly to the rest of society. So

316
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.640
it's not just that your health is your concern,

317
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.359
your health is my concern too.

318
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.829
So, one more then, when it comes to welfare

319
00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:54.939
provision, what kinds of social spending does it include

320
00:19:54.939 --> 00:19:59.300
and over time, has it, has it gone up,

321
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.630
at least in the more developed countries or not?

322
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:10.359
Over time, it is. It went up earlier, though,

323
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.300
as I said, as a share of all social

324
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.859
spending, it's down because other things goes faster. OK.

325
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:22.479
Uh, Let's see, uh, other, uh, kinds of effects

326
00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:26.439
it has. The arguments are the usual, uh, one,

327
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.839
you know, a conservative will say, oh, we don't

328
00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.359
give them the extra welfare spending cause they'll just

329
00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:36.050
spend it on, uh, something bad and not merits.

330
00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:39.969
I can remember even way back in 50 years

331
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:42.479
ago or more, uh, when I was in India,

332
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.400
they said, oh, don't give people who are begging

333
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.239
money because they'll just spend it on movies. OK.

334
00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:53.650
Apparently that was a social evil. Um, SO that's

335
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.150
a, that's a common argument, but against that is

336
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.189
the more progressive argument that, no, they get a

337
00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:01.709
chance if they can feed themselves, like if they

338
00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:04.739
can just kind of keep a household together, then

339
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:07.310
they can in fact uh go out and find

340
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.030
work more easily. That's a common argument in favor

341
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.939
of the welfare, uh. Yeah, that that one has

342
00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:18.819
always gone back and forth, and you'll notice that

343
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:22.969
any critic of social spending. Is always trying to

344
00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:25.609
tell you bad stories about welfare. Welfare is usually

345
00:21:25.609 --> 00:21:28.689
the main target, basically because it goes to people

346
00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:33.489
that are so different from me. Yes, the, the

347
00:21:33.489 --> 00:21:35.449
person will be thinking, right? It's them.

348
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:38.849
Uh, BUT let me just ask you, when it

349
00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:42.050
comes to some of those arguments in favor or

350
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.719
against welfare. What does the evidence tell us when

351
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:50.959
it comes to how people spend money they get

352
00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:54.599
from welfare? Uh, I mean, do they really tend

353
00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:58.430
to spend that much in things like, for example,

354
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.229
entertainment or even things that are considered bad like,

355
00:22:03.479 --> 00:22:07.319
I don't know, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or things like

356
00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:07.560
that.

357
00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:11.930
Um, THEY spend it the way other poor people

358
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:17.400
would who who who got their income. Without welfare,

359
00:22:17.949 --> 00:22:19.729
uh, if you get your income by being a

360
00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:23.910
barista uh in Starbucks, or you get your income

361
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.729
from welfare, it's gonna be the same expenditure pattern

362
00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:32.750
if it's the same amount of money, um. So

363
00:22:33.189 --> 00:22:35.859
that I think is the basic answer. There's not

364
00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:38.030
much difference I see something else is going to

365
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.109
add, but uh um about how you say about

366
00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:46.599
how they spend, oh yes, gender. Um, INTERESTING, uh,

367
00:22:46.689 --> 00:22:48.650
this is, you know, the World Bank and others

368
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.609
who work on development and poverty all over the

369
00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:55.890
world. They found a very interesting pattern about how

370
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.609
you give welfare. Let's think of the Mexican and

371
00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:03.770
Brazilian famous conditional cash transfers to the poor. You

372
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.780
give cash transfers to people who are poor. Under

373
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.189
the condition that their children are actually going to

374
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:13.430
school and getting health checkups, but you, to whom

375
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.189
do you give the cash transfer? Always to mama.

376
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.939
Very interesting. Um, THERE'S a lot of evidence that

377
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.010
the targeted spending will be more related to the

378
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.430
child if mama gets the check. Then if a

379
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.680
papa gets it. Um, AND since you are interested

380
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.640
in the children in these programs in the first

381
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.760
place, that's sort of a universal lesson. So if

382
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.390
you want to ask how do people spend it,

383
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.680
interesting result that it depends on who, uh, is

384
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.280
it mama or papa who gets it.

385
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.709
That's very interesting. So earlier when I asked you

386
00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:52.709
about how old is social spending and then we

387
00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:56.290
also talked about Northwest Europe and the you have

388
00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.189
the United States, and we, of course, could have

389
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.750
a few other countries across the world. Uh, WHEN

390
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.750
it comes to the developing countries, have they been

391
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.010
following a different path when it comes to government,

392
00:24:10.109 --> 00:24:11.420
social spending or?

393
00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:18.400
That it depends on which continents, but basically, um,

394
00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:22.329
what I find, what I show is that If

395
00:24:22.329 --> 00:24:25.410
you just say, are they following a different path

396
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.250
from what we followed earlier when we were, let's

397
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.579
say the same income that they have now. And

398
00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:35.819
I've looked at that as best the the numbers

399
00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:41.010
can tell us. Now, Interestingly, for most of the

400
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:48.140
world. At any given level of real GDP. There's

401
00:24:48.589 --> 00:24:50.910
difficulty in measuring it, but at any level of

402
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:56.229
real GDP, 19th century, same same GDP now, the

403
00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:59.709
developing countries now are spending more on social spending,

404
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.469
a greater share of that GDP on social spending

405
00:25:02.699 --> 00:25:05.750
than we, Sweden, the United States or Japan did

406
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.849
way back then. That's the general pattern. The exception

407
00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:14.550
is where they're definitely still spending less. Then we

408
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.229
had, uh, would be certain East Asian countries, uh,

409
00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:26.130
Korea. China Singapore, uh, a few of those are

410
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.920
definitely spent, I said, uh, are definitely spending less

411
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.410
at the same level of income than we did,

412
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:35.989
but that's those are exceptions. Most, most of the

413
00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:39.329
rest of the developing world is spending more on

414
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:41.500
social spending than we did.

415
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.989
And are there important differences in social spending depending

416
00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:50.670
on the kind of political regime, like, for example,

417
00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:53.510
between autocracies and democracy?

418
00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:59.079
Yes, um, I can think of two patterns that

419
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:03.380
came out pretty clearly. Setting aside the communists for

420
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.099
a moment, uh, communist regimes. Then autocracy, uh, spend

421
00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:11.500
less, uh, for the poor than democracies. Uh, THAT

422
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.500
has been a general pattern, uh, I'm sorry, for

423
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.959
the poor and for social spending in general, and

424
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:21.800
including education. There's a debate about that, but. That's

425
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:29.329
my conclusion. And Good example. Well, Spain and Portugal

426
00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:33.969
since 1975. Um, THEY have raised all kinds of

427
00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:38.050
social spending, including visible, very visibly education, uh, since

428
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.890
1975, faster than the other, uh, OECD or advanced

429
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.849
countries, uh, because they came out of those, they

430
00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:48.930
came out of Franco and Salazar, etc. So that's

431
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.449
one good example right there. Now, the communist countries

432
00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:57.750
are interesting. Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Say now

433
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.599
Russia and Eastern Europe. They do spend, they are

434
00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:05.199
very European. They are high spenders on social spending,

435
00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:08.040
uh, like, like the rest of Europe much. Some

436
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.760
of them are a little more conservative, like Estonia

437
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.400
is a little to the conservative side, things like

438
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.650
that, um, but in general, they spend very much

439
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:21.099
like other Europeans. Communist countries of Asia and Central

440
00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:25.900
Asia, no. They, um they definitely spend less on

441
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.140
this, and it, it can be a surprise to

442
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.069
people who read the words about Chairman Mao's regime,

443
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.969
for example, all the iron rice bowl and making

444
00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:39.109
sure everybody has plenty of everything. China never spent

445
00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:42.550
like that, uh, and to this day they don't.

446
00:27:42.709 --> 00:27:47.189
They spend less on social spending than the average,

447
00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:53.239
uh, prosperous capitalist country uh of non-communist. So, there

448
00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:57.560
is an interesting difference there. Uh, SO, do autocracy

449
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.000
spend less? Yes, uh, they spend less on social

450
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.530
spending except for uh communist regimes in Eastern Europe.

451
00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:09.939
Mhm. So, now I would like to ask you

452
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:15.010
about when it comes to equalizing incomes, I mean,

453
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.780
for uh uh I think that it, it started

454
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.260
mostly after World War 2, or at least it

455
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.229
got stronger after that. There was a Strong tide

456
00:28:25.229 --> 00:28:30.599
of governments around the world toward equalizing incomes. But

457
00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:35.510
since the 1980s, has that tide been reversed in

458
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.310
any way with the rise of what some people

459
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.099
would call neoliberalism.

460
00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:44.489
Uh, HAD the tide toward redistributing from rich to

461
00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:50.420
poor, uh. No, not been reversed, not been reversed.

462
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.790
It has stopped advancing uh in many countries. So

463
00:28:54.790 --> 00:29:00.650
it's been like a a plateau, but the There

464
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:07.959
is no general decline in how much I redistributed

465
00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:12.079
from richer toward poorer since 1980. No general decline.

466
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.229
Let's see. So think of it as we got

467
00:29:15.229 --> 00:29:20.660
more progressive up to 1980 and the wealthy OECD

468
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.989
countries have Stayed a progressive like that ever since.

469
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.130
That would be my best summary. I have, I

470
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.849
have numbers in the book about it, but that's

471
00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:33.050
the best summary. Mhm.

472
00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:38.130
And when it comes to economic inequality and perhaps

473
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:46.329
even more specifically intergenerational inequality, has it gotten, has

474
00:29:46.329 --> 00:29:48.930
it become worse over time or not?

475
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.810
Um, So if you meant inequality, then my I

476
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.569
my previous answer would apply again. If you mean

477
00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:03.969
um immobility, that uh that's to say uh the

478
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:08.630
social classes get locked between the generations. Um, MY,

479
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.180
my work is not about that. Uh, MEASURING inequality

480
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.540
was kind of difficult. Measuring intergeneration mobility is more

481
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.290
difficult. Uh, BUT now with the large data sets,

482
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.520
uh, and sophisticated statistical techniques, people have been doing

483
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.900
it. People like Raj Chetty and his, uh, co-authors

484
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:33.310
operating out of Harvard, etc. um. There are, let's

485
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.989
see, uh, and my, my colleague Gregory Clark, there

486
00:30:36.989 --> 00:30:42.680
are Still, there's still a lot of debate about

487
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.410
that. Certainly if you thought that. With the rise

488
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:53.119
of social spending and the welfare state. Every mobility

489
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:57.520
should have improved, that is to say, say, sons

490
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.989
to think of males whose occupations are easily measured.

491
00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:05.869
Uh, SONS nowadays is it true that they are

492
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.520
much more fluid, they can become anything uh more

493
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.699
than their unaffected by their fathers. No, there's not,

494
00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:17.400
there's not a clear rise in improvement in mobility.

495
00:31:17.949 --> 00:31:20.050
But that is the literature of other people. I

496
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.189
cannot claim that my book is uh resolving that.

497
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.180
So, another topic I would like to ask you

498
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.910
about because it is very relevant to our current

499
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:35.930
political context, particularly in Europe and also the United

500
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.500
States, because with the rise of recent far right

501
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.319
move. Movements. This is something that they always touch

502
00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:46.880
on in their sort of political discourse. When it

503
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.650
comes to immigration specifically, does it have any negative

504
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.890
impact on the economy?

505
00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:02.150
Uh, AS a, as an overall global result, no,

506
00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:06.030
but uh uh yes, there's a danger, uh, here's

507
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.949
what it would depend on. Are the, why are

508
00:32:09.949 --> 00:32:14.550
these people coming to your country? If it's simply

509
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:19.670
because. Um, THE situation in their own home country

510
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.270
is a disaster. They are just refugees. They have

511
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:28.670
to flee. Think Syria in 2015, for example. Think

512
00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.890
most African countries today. Uh, NOW, that can be

513
00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.729
a problem for the receiving country. And the way

514
00:32:38.729 --> 00:32:42.250
you asked your question really was, what are the

515
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.739
effects on us, then already natives of the receiving

516
00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:47.849
countries? That's the the sort of the narrow context

517
00:32:47.849 --> 00:32:50.839
in which people usually ask, is it good? Yes.

518
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:53.969
And yes, there's a danger there, um, and I

519
00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:57.599
would say this hasn't been the problem so much

520
00:32:57.599 --> 00:33:00.010
in the past, but it's uh the threat is

521
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.290
there now. Today we live in a world where

522
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.699
The people who are living under bad governments. In

523
00:33:09.699 --> 00:33:15.369
poor countries, They know it They have some money,

524
00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:17.500
because they aren't as poor as poor in the

525
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.890
past. And they have cell phones. Uh, YOU know,

526
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.160
Africa just jumped into cell phones. They, they never

527
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.290
went through that earlier phase of building telephone lines

528
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.530
and landlines. It never happened. Africa is also, you

529
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.290
know, all the, all the women in the marketplace,

530
00:33:33.329 --> 00:33:35.280
they know the latest price some other, you know.

531
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.050
So, but they know about the opportunities and that's

532
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.290
one problem, and and they can get here much

533
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.930
more easily now. So that is a danger that

534
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.890
they can just overwhelm the system, and if they're

535
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:53.109
coming for reasons that Uh, are like that. They

536
00:33:53.109 --> 00:33:55.339
may be informed, but they don't speak our language,

537
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.109
and they could be a cost. So if in

538
00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:01.109
large numbers, in large magnitudes, it could be a

539
00:34:01.109 --> 00:34:04.229
problem. So far, our countries have been able to

540
00:34:04.229 --> 00:34:07.859
handle this pretty well. If you think of the

541
00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:12.389
basic issue of what a sort of steady moderate

542
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:17.500
inflow of immigrants worsen the economy. Well, even on

543
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.889
the terms that you and most people ask about,

544
00:34:19.938 --> 00:34:21.540
which is what's the effect on the rest of

545
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.179
us in the rich countries. Uh, NO, uh, they

546
00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:31.658
do not, for example, cause a drain on Um,

547
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:36.280
government, uh, budgets. They do when they first arrive

548
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.458
because their children are qualify for schools and then

549
00:34:39.458 --> 00:34:42.399
they qualify for some basic health care. But very

550
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:45.159
soon, the fact that these people work and they

551
00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.649
do work, they don't uh they don't come just

552
00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:51.760
to rest on things, except in those mass refugee

553
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.089
very most alien cases. Then the fact they work

554
00:34:56.089 --> 00:35:00.638
means that they are generating more in taxes than

555
00:35:00.968 --> 00:35:03.168
the children are taking, and as you simply go

556
00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:07.888
over an entire generation or longer, it's overwhelmingly clear

557
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:10.208
that anybody who is an immigrant, it becomes a

558
00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:13.928
net payer of taxes, not a net recipient, uh

559
00:35:13.928 --> 00:35:19.550
that that population as a whole. So, overall, they're

560
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.409
not a fiscal burden, they're not an economic burden,

561
00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:26.550
even in the receiving country. And another good thing

562
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.270
that we don't mention much about the immigration is

563
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.804
the migrants themselves are getting enormous gains. They're. Human

564
00:35:32.804 --> 00:35:35.925
beings, if you want to count them, then that

565
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.745
helps them. The countries they leave, uh, now there,

566
00:35:38.844 --> 00:35:41.364
there is a cost. See, cause they suffer brain

567
00:35:41.364 --> 00:35:44.645
drain and things like that. Very little do people

568
00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:47.084
talk about it. We're actually very just focused on

569
00:35:47.084 --> 00:35:48.004
ourselves these days.

570
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.330
So, uh, about another kind of thing that people

571
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.729
who are not, uh, big proponents, I mean, they

572
00:35:57.729 --> 00:36:01.709
don't tend to like uh social spending too much.

573
00:36:02.209 --> 00:36:05.090
One of the things that they very often bring

574
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.485
to the table has to do with social. Security

575
00:36:08.485 --> 00:36:12.905
and the fact that because our life spans across

576
00:36:12.905 --> 00:36:17.604
almost the entire globe are moving upwards that in

577
00:36:17.604 --> 00:36:21.485
the, at least in the long term social security

578
00:36:21.485 --> 00:36:25.245
would become unsustainable. Is that true?

579
00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:31.629
It's um so uh I, I agree with the

580
00:36:31.629 --> 00:36:34.949
need to worry about the aging of the population

581
00:36:34.949 --> 00:36:40.939
and its implications for Pension budgets. Public, but not

582
00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:45.659
just public. I could explain about that. As a

583
00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:48.949
country gets older, as the population gets older, and

584
00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:52.879
people are Tempted to spend a greater share of

585
00:36:52.879 --> 00:36:56.989
their adult life and retirement, something has to give.

586
00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.649
So, Um, As that the elderly or let's say

587
00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:08.919
retired. Uh, POPULATION keeps rising as a share of

588
00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:13.699
the total. It cannot be true. That what they

589
00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:17.750
get in their old age rises as fast as

590
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.300
what a person, the average person earns when working.

591
00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:24.419
That can't be true because the number of years

592
00:37:24.419 --> 00:37:27.419
is changing, or I'm sorry, what they get in

593
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:30.459
old age per year, uh, in the book I

594
00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:33.709
make this very clear. Let's uh cause most people

595
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.060
if you're thinking about social Security payments, you're thinking

596
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.149
about how much of them they get per year,

597
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.530
not over their lifetime, because their lifetime is expanding,

598
00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:45.219
but per year, no, the amount, the generosity of

599
00:37:45.219 --> 00:37:48.699
your aid to the average elderly or retired person

600
00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:52.649
cannot rise as fast as the wage. That's a

601
00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:55.530
problem because in many countries the law ties their

602
00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.209
pension, annual pension to the wage. That's dangerous because

603
00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:01.889
there's more of them and there's fewer of the

604
00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:05.159
workers. Uh, THERE'S there's just a mathematical problem here.

605
00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:08.250
So that if you can call it conservative you

606
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.050
wish, but that concern about uh the rise of

607
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.929
the pensions is great. Now, does it mean that

608
00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:20.370
uh you say unsustainable? Yeah, um. I would choose

609
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.449
slightly different words cause unsustainable means, oh, the system's

610
00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:28.169
gonna go bankrupt and collapse, the pension system. That's

611
00:38:28.169 --> 00:38:32.570
not true. No political process would ever allow that

612
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.330
to happen, that the whole thing just collapses and

613
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.050
we you just flat out run out of money.

614
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.570
It wouldn't happen. They would raise the money through

615
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:45.050
government somehow. Uh, BUT the danger is still, uh,

616
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.060
clear, and it's a slow, slow acting danger. The

617
00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.580
more and the share of GDP that you spend

618
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.879
on Uh, the elderly, uh, support for the elderly.

619
00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:04.419
The less you can spend on other things, or

620
00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:06.219
the less you can leave in private hands for

621
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:11.310
other things. Now, the rate of return that society

622
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.189
is getting from its help to the elderly is

623
00:39:14.189 --> 00:39:17.600
clearly lower than the rate of return that you

624
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.989
get on investing more in children. So there is

625
00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:24.949
a cost to growth in the long run. It's

626
00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:29.360
gonna be slow acting though using calling unsustainable, it's,

627
00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:33.149
it's not gonna result in bankruptcy, the immediate collapse

628
00:39:33.149 --> 00:39:36.780
of the system. Uh, BUT there is a definite

629
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.979
danger and the main danger to. You could say

630
00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:45.100
to social spending or it's the main danger to

631
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.689
rich uh to countries the world over from the

632
00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:50.939
aging of the population, is that you're just gonna

633
00:39:50.939 --> 00:39:54.179
be taking money away from more productive things. So

634
00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:57.600
really simple as that, uh, and, and I, I,

635
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.229
I work on that a lot. Most countries have,

636
00:40:01.379 --> 00:40:03.679
OK, OK, I'll pause here. Most countries have not

637
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.260
done the job quite so well yet.

638
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.310
Uh, BUT I, I would like to ask you

639
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.199
also because this is something that people, working people

640
00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:17.229
worry a bit about, would that entail also necessarily

641
00:40:17.229 --> 00:40:22.590
raising the age of retirement or cutting pensions in

642
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.120
any way?

643
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.830
Uh, YES, the last part of your question made

644
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.909
it very general, so the answer is yes in

645
00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:34.510
general. Uh, SOMETHING has to has to give, you

646
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.070
know, suppose there were even it's so simple, suppose

647
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.649
you, there were no pensions, there's no system. You

648
00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:43.500
just have to save for your own old age.

649
00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:48.409
The more it's true over the generations that you

650
00:40:48.409 --> 00:40:51.659
know you're gonna live longer than your grandfather lived.

651
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.500
Mhm. The less you can spend every single year,

652
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.129
all the way including all that retirement. uh RELATIVE

653
00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:04.489
to your pay because it just, it won't go

654
00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:08.090
with that much further. So that's just a uh

655
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:13.370
a basic fact. uh, THE Generosity of what you

656
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.330
get each year in old age in retirement, say.

657
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.590
Has to Rise more slowly. It cannot keep up

658
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.560
with the wage rate. That's, that's uh just uh

659
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.040
again a basic point that I keep harping on.

660
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.050
So that in general, yes. Now, specifically you said,

661
00:41:33.139 --> 00:41:37.580
uh, should we have people work older? Um, I,

662
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:39.719
there's a good argument for that. After all, if

663
00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:42.600
your adult life is gonna be longer, why shouldn't

664
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.560
the share of your adult life spent at work

665
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.080
stay the same? That's OK. That you would mandate

666
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.320
this, uh, that gets a little tricky because people's

667
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.570
individual conditions are so different. But one way or

668
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.889
the other, you've got to make it clear. If

669
00:41:59.889 --> 00:42:04.310
they don't work to a later age. Then the

670
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.429
generosity of the pension has to slow down. It

671
00:42:07.429 --> 00:42:09.550
cannot keep up with general pay.

672
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.020
But could that be mitigated in any way by

673
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.610
rising productivity levels or not?

674
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.939
Yes, absolutely. Oh, I would love, wouldn't that be

675
00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:25.060
wonderful? Suppose we have no problem about the people

676
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.979
getting older because, oh, we just suddenly become more

677
00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:30.899
productive and uh our productivity goes up 5% a

678
00:42:30.899 --> 00:42:35.485
year, no problem. Uh, DEBATE over, let's just. Relax

679
00:42:35.485 --> 00:42:37.284
and enjoy the extra prosperity.

680
00:42:37.524 --> 00:42:43.024
Uh, SO we were talking about, uh, if rising

681
00:42:43.024 --> 00:42:47.405
productivity levels could mitigate at least to some extent

682
00:42:47.604 --> 00:42:51.514
the issues associated with the pension system.

683
00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:54.034
Yes, the, the, it clearly could.

684
00:42:54.564 --> 00:42:57.915
Uh, SO, uh, let, let me then ask you,

685
00:42:58.084 --> 00:43:00.925
we're getting to the end of our conversation. Let

686
00:43:00.925 --> 00:43:03.794
me just ask you a couple more questions. So,

687
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.120
Uh, could you give us specific examples of, uh,

688
00:43:08.129 --> 00:43:15.649
government spending or making social spending in ways that

689
00:43:15.649 --> 00:43:18.840
are, that you would consider wrong?

690
00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:25.419
Mhm. Sure. That's pretty easy to do because it

691
00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:30.219
exists in the real world, um. So, let's think

692
00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:36.330
of. Um, PENSIONS in Brazil, locked in by the

693
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:43.179
by the uh constitution of 1983 88, and The

694
00:43:43.179 --> 00:43:47.620
pensions, the constitution of Brazil, when they became a

695
00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:55.370
democracy. Mhm. MADE it illegal to cut pensions very

696
00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:02.959
much. And Oh boy, there's been much literature about

697
00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:04.520
what is wrong with this. First of all, the

698
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.840
pension system is only for the very rich, the

699
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.320
top government officials, the military, the judges in the

700
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.590
court system, etc. AND they get outrageous, uh, uh,

701
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.389
generosity of these uh benefits. This was pointed out

702
00:44:20.389 --> 00:44:22.560
as much as 30 years ago by the Wall

703
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.159
Street Journal and others, uh, and the Brazilians are

704
00:44:25.159 --> 00:44:28.600
well familiar with this. In fact, the only partial

705
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.830
reform of that bad, uh, redistribution, not only toward

706
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.419
somebody it just as a pension, uh, that they

707
00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:40.879
can enjoy on vacation, but to somebody who was

708
00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:48.479
rich beforehand. Uh, THAT It was so obvious to

709
00:44:48.479 --> 00:44:53.689
Brazilians that they were able to get the Part

710
00:44:53.689 --> 00:44:58.879
of that constitutional protection for the rich, overthrown under

711
00:44:58.879 --> 00:45:04.120
Bolsonaro. Interestingly, uh, Bolsonaro with all of his horrible

712
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.770
um uh effects on policy, when he first came

713
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:12.409
in, he and his fellow conservatives did a a

714
00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:17.574
correct job of minimizing those uh very bad. So

715
00:45:17.574 --> 00:45:20.415
this is something very familiar to the Brazilians. It

716
00:45:20.415 --> 00:45:22.975
will be very familiar to other countries in the

717
00:45:22.975 --> 00:45:26.814
near future. For example, Turkey has got the same

718
00:45:26.814 --> 00:45:29.885
kind of thing, uh, incredible pensions to buy off

719
00:45:30.354 --> 00:45:32.895
anybody influential that could be an opponent to the

720
00:45:32.895 --> 00:45:36.334
government, you know, and uh stay tuned. They will

721
00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:37.254
become like Brazil.

722
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.080
So, my last question then is, uh, between now

723
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:49.649
and mid-century, there is around 2050. What are some

724
00:45:49.649 --> 00:45:53.489
of the biggest threats to social problems?

725
00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:00.300
The biggest, uh, there are two main candidates that

726
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.449
I have thought about and write about. One is,

727
00:46:04.459 --> 00:46:07.780
uh, immigration, the other is the aging of the

728
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.020
population. The second one is the real threat. That's

729
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.260
the big one. THE immigration, uh, coming in, would

730
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:21.179
it make people Undermines their support for social spending,

731
00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:25.419
that's people have raised that possibility. That doesn't seem

732
00:46:25.419 --> 00:46:31.199
true so far, uh, because You know, even the

733
00:46:31.199 --> 00:46:34.560
Swedish conservatives or the Danish Conservatives say, well, wait

734
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.800
a minute now, uh, we'd like to keep some

735
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.090
of the social spending away from immigrants, uh especially

736
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:44.320
really alien Muslim types, but, uh, we can't get

737
00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.919
rid of the whole program because that's ours. Uh,

738
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.330
WE'VE always lived under this program, we love it.

739
00:46:50.189 --> 00:46:52.229
So then they, then you try to think of

740
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:54.709
ways, well, could we just deny the support only

741
00:46:54.709 --> 00:47:00.280
to the immigrants. That's something. That has been tried

742
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.120
in some cases, it's, it's very difficult, um, just

743
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.320
to bifurcate uh the level of support. Oh, did

744
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.320
you, were you born in a foreign country? Nope,

745
00:47:10.439 --> 00:47:13.639
sorry, you, you're, you're not entitled to education, things

746
00:47:13.639 --> 00:47:17.110
like that. That's a hard thing for any political

747
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:24.330
system to support. It has been tried. The main

748
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:29.149
international migration example would be the in the state

749
00:47:29.149 --> 00:47:32.429
of California back in the 1990s, the conservatives were

750
00:47:32.429 --> 00:47:35.379
in power and they were able to get voted

751
00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:39.790
through a proposition 180, I'm trying to remember the

752
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.919
number of it now, but uh a proposition whereby

753
00:47:43.429 --> 00:47:46.870
if you are not a native born citizen, you

754
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.179
don't have the right to public programs as much.

755
00:47:51.149 --> 00:47:54.590
And so they they got it, they won with

756
00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:58.639
a majority of the vote. But Hispanics and others

757
00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:04.320
were so offended. By this uh behavior, then it

758
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.879
really killed the Republican Party in California. And to

759
00:48:07.879 --> 00:48:11.840
this day, the Republicans just have no particular hope

760
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.959
in California, whereas they're really strong in Florida or

761
00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:19.000
Texas, uh, places like that. Um, SO you can

762
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.320
try to discriminate against the foreigners in your social

763
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.239
spending. In practice, it doesn't work out very well.

764
00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:31.000
So you've got that basic choice. Either don't let

765
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.800
people in. Or Yeah, try to let everybody in

766
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.360
and deal with it, but basically what most countries

767
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.120
are gravitating toward will preserve the social spending, that

768
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.679
was what you're asking about. It will preserve the

769
00:48:45.679 --> 00:48:51.979
social spending generosity. Um, BUT we will increasingly do

770
00:48:51.979 --> 00:48:55.020
what Canada and Australia and other countries have done

771
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.979
all along, which is have skill requirements and productivity

772
00:48:58.979 --> 00:49:04.050
requirements for immigrants. Uh, AND basically, if people are

773
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.379
truly destitute and refugees from bad governments, too bad

774
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:09.860
for them is where the political system is going.

775
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:14.409
We want the skilled immigrants, thank you. The others,

776
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.649
no. That's really what the the systems are saying,

777
00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:18.250
right?

778
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.129
Yeah, so, uh, just to be clear then between

779
00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:26.320
now and mid-century, the biggest A threat, or I

780
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.919
mean, the main area where social spending would uh

781
00:49:31.919 --> 00:49:35.159
be probably cut down a little bit is in

782
00:49:35.159 --> 00:49:40.750
terms of supporting immigration or unskilled immigration.

783
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.830
UNSKILLED immigration on the immigration front, but your original

784
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.110
question, I'm sorry that I got into two things

785
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.550
at once, but it was, uh, your original question

786
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.870
was broader, and yes, the main threat is from

787
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.949
the aging of the population. You have to deal

788
00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:59.169
with that. That's the big threat. The immigration is

789
00:49:59.169 --> 00:50:01.719
less of a threat. It will probably be dealt

790
00:50:01.719 --> 00:50:03.830
with by favoring the skilled immigrants.

791
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:09.750
Right, so the book is again making social spending

792
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.070
work. I will leave a link to it in

793
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:17.100
the description of the interview, uh. Oh, there it

794
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:24.290
is. Great. So, Doctor Linder, just before we go,

795
00:50:24.419 --> 00:50:28.459
are there any places on the internet that where

796
00:50:28.459 --> 00:50:30.969
people can find you and your work?

797
00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:36.290
Uh, SURE, you just Google my name, um, and

798
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.129
my work is there, and I even have little

799
00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:43.050
things on my website that are additions to um.

800
00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.510
Uh, FACTS since, uh, the book was published, uh,

801
00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.580
and Come just Google my name. That's the easiest

802
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.250
thing to do.

803
00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:57.489
Right. So, Doctor Linder, thank you so much again

804
00:50:57.489 --> 00:50:59.139
for taking the time to come on the show.

805
00:50:59.179 --> 00:51:02.179
It's been a fascinating conversation, so thank you so

806
00:51:02.179 --> 00:51:03.060
