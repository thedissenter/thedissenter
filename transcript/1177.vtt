00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.970
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.280
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.010
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Mark

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.369
Alfano. He's professor of philosophy at Macquarie University, and

5
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.250
today we're talking about his book, Nietzsche on Virtue.

6
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:20.920
So, Doctor Alfano, welcome back to the show. It's

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.049
always a pleasure to everyone. Thank

8
00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:24.770
you so much, Ricardo. It's really nice to be

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.129
back.

10
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.540
OK, so, start by telling us about the premise

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.419
of the book and the kinds of goals you

12
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:39.220
add with it and also the methodology you apply

13
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.689
there because you apply a kind of digital humanities

14
00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.000
methodology, right? So tell us all about that.

15
00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:51.750
Yeah, um, so the The thing that's disappointed me

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.990
in the Nietzsche literature for, for years is that

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.630
people tend to kind of like cherry pick just

18
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.349
a few passages when they want to interpret what

19
00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:04.150
he has to say about different topics in moral

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.900
psychology, virtue ethics, virtue epistemology, and, and other areas.

21
00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:12.779
Um, SO I, I wanted to do something more

22
00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:17.959
systematic. Um, SO, I basically got my computer to

23
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.040
read everything that he ever published, and to look

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.120
for what he talked about when he talked about

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.370
virtue. So it's a it's called a co-location analysis,

26
00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:33.010
so like in the same paragraph or the same

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.809
sentence, what else is going on when Nietzsche talks

28
00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:43.239
about virtue, um. And um this kind of led

29
00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:48.040
me to conclude that Nietzsche is a kind of

30
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.160
virtue theorist, even if um a lot of people

31
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.260
think that he's a nihilist or he doesn't have

32
00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:58.629
any kind of positive ethics or epistemology. Um, AND

33
00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:03.339
in particular that he's interested in virtues like curiosity,

34
00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:07.839
intellectual courage, having a sense of humor, um, what

35
00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:12.000
he calls solitude or einssukeit, um, which is this

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.320
disposition to sort of criticize your own in-group and

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.270
not take for granted what you're raised with, um,

38
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.490
and, uh, Obviously, the computer can't do all the

39
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.940
reading for you. So, I, I went and close

40
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.100
read all the passages as well. Um, BUT this

41
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.619
revealed to me that there was a lot that

42
00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:38.699
was missing from the existing literature. Um, SO, that's

43
00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.820
what I tried to, to do in this book

44
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.009
was to sort of show people like, well, here's

45
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.559
the stuff that we, we haven't been talking about.

46
00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.589
Um, AND it's actually quite interesting. I mean, N

47
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.979
Nietzsche is a strange Figure in many ways, you

48
00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.940
know, I, I don't think that he's right about

49
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.539
everything. I don't think he's right about most things,

50
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.100
actually. Uh, BUT when he is insightful, then he's

51
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.210
often very insightful. Um, AND about these things, like

52
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.619
sense of humor, uh, intellectual courage, curiosity, solitude, I

53
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:12.919
think he's very insightful.

54
00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:18.309
OK, but what are virtues according to Nietzsche, and

55
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.550
we're going to also break it down a little

56
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.470
bit as we go through the questions, but what

57
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.490
are virtues?

58
00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.250
Yeah, so, so he's interesting in this regard, because

59
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.210
um, In virtue theory nowadays, and probably historically, uh,

60
00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.940
going back at least to Aristotle, um, virtues are

61
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.460
thought of as these, um, acquired, um, habits of

62
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.679
character. Um, THAT are admirable and praiseworthy, um. And

63
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.850
um that they are the, the same for everyone.

64
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.699
So, what counts as a virtue for me is

65
00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.979
also what counts as a virtue for you. It

66
00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.259
might get expressed somewhat differently, um, depending on our

67
00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:13.179
upbringing or acculturation, and so on. Um, BUT like,

68
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.860
uh, you know, honesty is just a virtue for

69
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.178
everybody. Um. Courage, uh, virtue for everybody, open-mindedness, virtue

70
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:26.898
for everybody. Um, FOR, for Nietzsche, um, things are

71
00:04:26.898 --> 00:04:29.838
a little bit more complicated. So, he thinks that,

72
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:36.178
um, virtues are drives, um, and specifically that they're

73
00:04:36.178 --> 00:04:42.600
drives that Um, are characteristic of the individual as

74
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.730
opposed to universal across all people. Um, AND he

75
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.570
thinks some of these drives are instincts, so they're

76
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:54.410
natural, like that, you're born with them, as opposed

77
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.929
to something that you might acquire through habituation. Uh,

78
00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:02.149
AND some of them are acquired, and, um, when

79
00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:05.670
they are sort of firing together in a way

80
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.140
that Um, is consistent, then that makes them virtues

81
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.859
for that individual. So, whether a particular drive that

82
00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:20.660
I have counts as a virtue is not a

83
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.500
matter of what is kind of, uh, internal to

84
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.700
it, but much more a matter of how it's

85
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.820
related to my other drives and how they are

86
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.980
functioning. So, there's a kind of, um, harmony that

87
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.980
is Required for a drive to count as a

88
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.579
virtue. Um, THIS, I think, is, is kind of

89
00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:46.260
a unique view. It, it, um, It's not that

90
00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.730
different from what you see in Menza, um, the

91
00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:54.369
Chinese philosopher, um, so he had this idea that

92
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.269
there's sprouts of virtue, uh, but he thought everyone

93
00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.109
had the same sprouts. So what's distinctive about N

94
00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.149
Nietzsche is he thinks like, It, it, we don't

95
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.399
all have the same sprouts, and so what will

96
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.040
be a virtue for me might not be a

97
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.440
virtue for you. Um, I hope I'm addressing your

98
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.790
question,

99
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.799
yes, but, but let me just ask you a

100
00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:19.600
couple of follow-up questions. So what is exactly the

101
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.450
relationship between drives and virtues according to Nietzsche?

102
00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:28.829
So, so for Nietzsche, a drive um is a

103
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:39.540
disposition to um thought, feeling. Action and evaluation, um,

104
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.679
and When someone has a drive that counts as

105
00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.660
a virtue, it's one that leads them to engage

106
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.950
in Um, Engage their own agency in a way

107
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.170
that is consistent with the other drives that they

108
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.459
have. So he's especially concerned about drives where it's

109
00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:06.480
like, If I express drive A, then that stymies

110
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.109
drive B. Um, SO, um, I end up undermining

111
00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:17.619
my own agency. Um, BUT, um, when the drives

112
00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:21.190
are sort of operating in tandem with each other

113
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.070
in a way that's at least harmonious, um, or

114
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.070
sometimes even, um, expressing one amounts to expressing one

115
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.070
of the others, then for him that would count

116
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.829
as a virtue.

117
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.570
OK. And what are the types and what different

118
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.890
types of people are there?

119
00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:46.260
Yeah, so, um, in, in the book, I argue

120
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.420
that N Nietzsche has a, a type specific or

121
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.779
a type relativized notion of virtue, and the, the

122
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:59.220
basic idea there is that someone's type is the

123
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.100
set of their drives, which could include both instincts

124
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.869
and acquired drives. Um, AND different people belong to

125
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:13.200
different types if they have different sets of drives.

126
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.799
So like if I have drives A, B, and

127
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:18.470
C, and you have drives B, C, and D,

128
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.880
then we have similar types, but not, not identical

129
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.950
types. Um, AND if I have drives A, B,

130
00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:26.480
and C, and you have X, Y, and Z,

131
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.170
then we have completely different types. Um. So, some

132
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.770
other philosophers have written about Nietzsche on on types

133
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.409
and suggested that he only distinguishes between like higher

134
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.190
and lower, as if there were only two. BUT

135
00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:45.280
he actually, at one point, he, he talks about,

136
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:49.770
um, an enchanting abundance of types. And so he

137
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.650
thinks there's, there's a lot of diversity in human

138
00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:01.210
dispositions, and that that is itself worth, um, Investigation

139
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:07.320
and even celebration. Um And he thinks that Because

140
00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:12.469
of this diversity of types, there will be many,

141
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.150
many different ways to be virtuous, depending on which

142
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:21.109
type someone happens to embody. Um, HE, he, he,

143
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.369
he talks about his own type quite a bit.

144
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.229
Um, SO that's where things like curiosity, intellectual courage,

145
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.090
sense of humor, and so on come into play.

146
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.890
But what's interesting is that he thinks that like,

147
00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:36.989
if that's not for you, that's fine. Like, you

148
00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:41.049
can have your own. Set of virtues, and you

149
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.130
are not required. In any sense to embody the

150
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.869
same virtues as someone else.

151
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.390
Right, so tell us perhaps as an example about

152
00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:57.609
his own type. I mean, how does he talk

153
00:09:57.609 --> 00:10:01.409
about his own type and What are then the

154
00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:06.510
virtues that are fitting and conducive to flourishing for

155
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.809
Nietzsche's style.

156
00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:13.030
Um, SO he, he has this kind of notion

157
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:18.969
of, um, A certain kind of cruel curiosity, which

158
00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:23.330
might not sound very nice, um, but, uh, this

159
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.409
is connected with his stuff about will to power.

160
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.969
So, um, when he talks about will to power,

161
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:33.210
it often is a matter of overcoming resistance, and

162
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.450
he thinks that at least for people like him,

163
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.250
not necessarily for others, but for people like him,

164
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:45.880
um, Recognizing and fully appreciating what is most um

165
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.349
embarrassing and shameful about oneself and one's in-group is

166
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:56.320
very difficult. And in order to overcome that resistance,

167
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.830
to overcome that challenge, um, one needs curiosity, so

168
00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:06.219
the desire to find things out, to engage in

169
00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:10.440
inquiry and recognize that you don't already know what

170
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.479
you might think you know, um, as well as

171
00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:18.039
intellectual courage, which is a matter of facing up

172
00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:22.880
to these challenges, uh, and not, um, shying away

173
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.479
from them, um, as well as, uh, sense of

174
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:30.000
humor. So, you might think sense of humor has

175
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.849
nothing to do with epistemology. Um, BUT for Nietzsche,

176
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:41.059
it, it's actually Um, deeply related to, um, To

177
00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:45.479
epistemology, because having a sense of humor, especially the

178
00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:50.770
ability to laugh at oneself. Um, IS a way

179
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.330
of overcoming that kind of resistance, because if you're

180
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.090
self-protective, if you don't want to, um, acknowledge the

181
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.969
things that are bad or shameful or embarrassing about

182
00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:07.969
yourself, um, That makes it very difficult to, to

183
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:13.239
acquire self-knowledge, um. But if you're able to laugh

184
00:12:13.239 --> 00:12:16.239
at yourself, um, then you can sort of recognize

185
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:21.369
that kind of thing, and um, Acknowledge it and

186
00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:25.049
maybe even overcome it in certain cases. Um, AND,

187
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.500
and solitude is related to this as well, because

188
00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:31.690
Um, sense of humor is more about being able

189
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.250
to laugh at me. Um, AND solitude for Nietzsche

190
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.369
is being able to laugh at and not take

191
00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:44.530
too seriously us as an in-group. Um, AND I

192
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.590
think this is actually one of the reasons why

193
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.210
he's often very, very critical of the Germans, because,

194
00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:55.250
uh, he wants to sort of poke holes and

195
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.330
poke fun at. Um, HIS own in-group. Um, SO

196
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.890
he's, he's much more critical of, of the Germans

197
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.690
than the French or the English or any other

198
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.280
group, essentially, uh, because he, he knows that, um,

199
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.609
these ties of upbringing and blood and nationality and

200
00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:17.609
things like that, um, make it very difficult for

201
00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:21.169
people to see what is wrong with their own

202
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:21.669
community.

203
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:28.710
Right. So in the book you refer to pro-Christian

204
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.530
moralism. So what is that and tell us about

205
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.179
how it is life denying.

206
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.789
Yeah, so the, the myth of Procrustes comes from

207
00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:43.250
ancient Greece. He was this kind of bandit character,

208
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.510
um, in, in Greek mythology. He would invite you

209
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.099
into his home, uh, and then say like, oh,

210
00:13:51.109 --> 00:13:53.669
you can stay here in this bedroom, here's your

211
00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:56.429
bed. Um, AND then it would turn out that

212
00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:59.229
you were either too tall or too short for

213
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:01.979
the bed. And if you were too tall, he

214
00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:04.690
would cut your feet off. And if you were

215
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:09.049
too short, he would um stretch you, and in

216
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:14.150
either case, he would kill you. Um, SO, the,

217
00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:16.969
the, the myth of Procrustes has to do with

218
00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:19.849
this notion of like, forcing everyone to be the

219
00:14:19.849 --> 00:14:25.650
same. Um, HAVING this normative ideal that insists that

220
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.489
everybody ought to be alike. Um, AND in a

221
00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:35.729
couple of places, Nietzsche talks about Procrustian morality. Um,

222
00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:41.239
AND he's been interpreted to, to think that, um,

223
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.679
There's just something wrong with morality as such. But

224
00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:49.479
the way I interpret him is he's saying, no,

225
00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:53.510
the morality is fine, um, it's just that we

226
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.820
shouldn't insist that everyone be the same. And we

227
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.460
should recognize human diversity and acknowledge that um what

228
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.940
counts as being a good person for me might

229
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.179
be different from what counts as being a good

230
00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:11.460
person for you, which might be different from what

231
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.179
counts as being a good person for, you know,

232
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.679
my sister, and so on. Um, SO, so this,

233
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.179
um, Procrustian thing has to do with types, uh,

234
00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:25.520
as, as we discussed a little bit. So, Different

235
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.039
people have different types, and to try to force

236
00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:30.400
people to all be the same type is the

237
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.020
thing that Nietzsche is objecting to.

238
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.369
OK, so earlier we talked about the relationship between

239
00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:42.090
drives and virtues. How is the development and evaluation

240
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:47.260
of our drives related to our social relationships?

241
00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:51.690
Yeah, so this is an interesting thing in Nietzsche.

242
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:57.030
So he, um, He has this idea that um

243
00:15:57.479 --> 00:16:03.299
the attribution of traits to people, including drives, including

244
00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:09.919
Uh, virtues, including also vices, um, often functions to

245
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:15.270
some extent like a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, if you

246
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.489
see something in me and you say like, oh,

247
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.570
Mark, you're very curious, then I might think, oh

248
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.049
well, maybe I am. Um, AND then I, I

249
00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:28.289
take that on as part of my self-concept, and

250
00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:30.239
I start to act more that way, and then

251
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:34.650
I feel good about doing that, and I end

252
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.590
up actually becoming more like that. Um, THE same

253
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.520
thing can happen with vices. Uh, SO when we

254
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.130
tell someone, you know, uh, that they're a coward,

255
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.190
um, that might make them more cowardly. Um, It

256
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.609
it, it's not like, uh, magic. It has to

257
00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:57.640
do with how people think of themselves, their, um,

258
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.130
what they know others to expect from them, um,

259
00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:07.170
and how they feel about their own behavior. Um,

260
00:17:07.739 --> 00:17:11.459
BUT to some extent, this actually seems to be

261
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:15.140
empirically borne out. So, there are a bunch of

262
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.118
studies which I, I cited in a previous book,

263
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.890
um, That suggests that actually you get a small

264
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.959
effect out of this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy thing,

265
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.329
where if a trusted Source tells you that you're

266
00:17:31.329 --> 00:17:33.569
a certain way, then you, then you think to

267
00:17:33.569 --> 00:17:35.859
yourself like, oh, maybe I am that way, maybe,

268
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.439
maybe I should be more that way. Um, AND,

269
00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:43.010
and people sort of talk themselves into and talk

270
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.630
each other into, um, acquiring traits that they may

271
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.810
be halfway possessed, uh, but then come to fully

272
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.369
possess.

273
00:17:53.229 --> 00:17:58.130
Mm, OK. And I mean, when it comes to

274
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.510
the different types of people we talked about, how

275
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.390
can one understand one's own type? How can we

276
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.130
acquire this kind of self-knowledge?

277
00:18:11.479 --> 00:18:15.510
Yeah, it's a really interesting question. Um, INTROSPECTION is

278
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:24.300
pretty bad. Um, SO, I think, um, Just speaking

279
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.819
from the empirical literature rather than from Nietzsche here,

280
00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:31.579
um, a lot of it has to do with

281
00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:36.319
Seeing yourself in the mirror of another person who

282
00:18:37.729 --> 00:18:43.569
Empathically and sympathetically engages with you and Either tells

283
00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:47.140
you or shows you. What they think you are.

284
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.810
Um, THIS is an idea that, um, is pretty

285
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.890
similar to what John Doris, um, explores in his

286
00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.729
book, um, Talking to Ourselves. Um, HE has this

287
00:19:01.729 --> 00:19:04.550
idea that we, we sort of negotiate our identity.

288
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.859
It's not something that's kind of fixed. It's something

289
00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:13.829
that's partially inchoate, and then by Engaging with others

290
00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:18.589
and finding out how they interpret us and either

291
00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:24.390
accepting or rejecting or negotiating their interpretation, we become

292
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.790
the kind of people that we are.

293
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.560
Mhm. And I mean, what is the role, because

294
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.239
you also talked about this, about this in the

295
00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:37.479
book, what is the role that shame, curiosity, and

296
00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:43.219
intellectual courage play in acquiring this kind of self-knowledge?

297
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.949
So shame in particular is interesting in Nietzsche because

298
00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:51.319
um he distinguishes between a current shame, which is

299
00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:55.510
like this felt emotion, on the one hand. And

300
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.390
um having a sense of shame, on the other

301
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:04.750
hand, um, And the basic idea there is that

302
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.010
um if someone has a Sense of shame that

303
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.329
will lead them to anticipate. What sorts of things

304
00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:16.489
they might do or say or feel that would

305
00:20:16.489 --> 00:20:19.849
lead them to feel a current shame. And to

306
00:20:19.849 --> 00:20:24.849
avoid those things. Um, SO to be shameless is

307
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:32.489
to not anticipate, um, those thoughts, feelings, actions, behaviors,

308
00:20:32.589 --> 00:20:37.959
um, and so on. And This sense of shame,

309
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.849
at least for Nietzsche, um, is actually a way

310
00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:46.410
for people to see what is Problematic in their

311
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:52.030
own character, and to improve it in advance without

312
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:58.270
having to go through the messy process of Doing

313
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:04.310
wrong or doing badly, and then be uh publicly

314
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.790
shamed.

315
00:21:05.719 --> 00:21:09.670
Mhm. And what about the role of a sense

316
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.180
of humor? What role can it play here in

317
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.989
our understanding of our own type?

318
00:21:17.969 --> 00:21:21.319
Um, SO the way I understand N Nietzsche on

319
00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:24.989
humor is that, um, It introduces some kind of

320
00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:28.709
levity, it introduces a kind of lightness, not taking

321
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:34.229
things seriously, um, and he's especially interested in cases

322
00:21:34.229 --> 00:21:37.829
where people are able to laugh at themselves. Um,

323
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.349
IF you think about someone who's like incapable of

324
00:21:40.349 --> 00:21:43.069
laughing at themselves, you're probably thinking of a bad

325
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:49.319
person, right? So, for, for him, um, having a

326
00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:53.319
sense of humor, especially about oneself, is a way

327
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:59.560
of distinguishing between what is fixed in my personality

328
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.280
or character on the one hand, and what can

329
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.599
be changed, and when the stuff that can be

330
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:13.079
changed is Bad or contemptible or laughable, um, not

331
00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:16.520
being so self-serious, uh, that I can't just say

332
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.319
like, oh yeah, I'm just, I won't do that

333
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:21.280
anymore. I won't be like that anymore. Um, IT'S

334
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.050
when people think that Everything about them is fixed,

335
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.810
that it becomes hard to um Hard to change.

336
00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:37.319
So, um, Having a sense of humor for Nietzsche

337
00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:40.640
is, um, I, I would say is a matter

338
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.099
of being able to See what's essential to me

339
00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:47.660
and what is not essential to me, and when

340
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.599
the non-essential stuff is bad, uh, or contemptible, just

341
00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:54.380
throw it away, no big deal.

342
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.459
Mhm. And what about the role of curiosity and

343
00:22:59.459 --> 00:23:02.459
intellectual courage, because I think that I asked you

344
00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.219
about that earlier, but you only referred to shame,

345
00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:08.300
so how about those two?

346
00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:15.189
Yeah, sorry, um. So Curiosity, um, has been, um.

347
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.199
Articulated in a lot of ways. So like, you,

348
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.000
you can be curious in the sense that you

349
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.640
want to try like a new cuisine or listen

350
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.060
to new music. Um, THAT'S a kind of experiential

351
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.280
curiosity. Um. And of course, Nietzsche recognizes that, um,

352
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.589
but when he talks about curiosity, he's primarily interested

353
00:23:38.729 --> 00:23:47.079
in curiosity that's related to inquiry. So, hm. ASKING.

354
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.280
Questions that are hard to answer. And then going

355
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.189
about the work of actually Answering them as best

356
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.689
one can. And questions can be hard in lots

357
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:02.050
of different ways, so like, we still don't know

358
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.280
whether gold box conjecture is true. Um, THAT'S a

359
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.640
really hard question. Um, BUT there are other kinds

360
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.119
of questions that are hard to answer for other

361
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:16.920
reasons, um, and, and N Nietzsche seems to be

362
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.280
especially interested in questions that are hard to answer

363
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.459
because the answers make us uncomfortable. Questions where if

364
00:24:27.459 --> 00:24:30.780
we really admitted the truth, we would feel bad

365
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.260
about ourselves or our families, or our countries, or

366
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.819
our communities more broadly. Um, AND that's a different

367
00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:46.819
kind of difficulty from just really hard math. Um,

368
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.140
SORRY, you asked about something else as well, which

369
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.579
I still didn't address.

370
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.319
Uh, INTELLECTUAL courage and curiosity.

371
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.020
Yeah, OK, so, So hopefully I said something intelligible

372
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:05.680
about curiosity, um. Intellectual courage is also interesting for

373
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:12.599
Nietzsche because um He, he thinks that um there's

374
00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:19.449
a kind of eppistemic fear that people face when

375
00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:24.989
they deal with questions that are related to their

376
00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:30.660
identity. So, either their identity as um individuals or

377
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.280
their identity as members of a group or community.

378
00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:42.619
And um When he praises intellectual courage, he's often

379
00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:46.900
talking about The courage that people have when they

380
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.079
Face those questions and still try to answer them

381
00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:51.660
honestly.

382
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.849
Mhm. And I mean, how should we deal with

383
00:25:56.849 --> 00:26:00.810
people who are of different types than us, because

384
00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.609
I mean if different people are of different types

385
00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:09.069
and if different types would correspond for Nietzsche to

386
00:26:09.449 --> 00:26:13.890
different sets of virtues, I mean, many times there

387
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.329
would be a sort of mismatch there, right.

388
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.310
Yeah, so, the, the stuff on um solitude is

389
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.189
interesting in this regard. So, one of the things

390
00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:31.910
that Nietzsche um finds interesting is the ability for

391
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.290
someone to sort of move back and forth between

392
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:42.369
being Sorry, uh, being, um, deeply engaged with the

393
00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:48.810
community and taking some distance from it, um. And

394
00:26:49.069 --> 00:26:55.880
um, We know from contemporary, um, empirical psychology that

395
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:02.569
in, in general, people are Um, Uh, disposed towards

396
00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:08.550
homophily or towards wanting to be With and only

397
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.000
with people who are similar to them. Um, SO

398
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.010
you might think that like, uh, Nietzsche would expect

399
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.609
people to just, um, only engage with their own

400
00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:22.560
type. So if I'm this way, then I only

401
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.079
talk to, and I only engage with people who

402
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:29.479
are the same way. Um. He doesn't actually say

403
00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:33.319
that. Uh, IN fact, he, he thinks that, um,

404
00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:37.920
We can learn a lot by engaging with people

405
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.650
who have uh a different type. Um, AND there's

406
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:50.540
this, um, This real appreciation, um, in his work

407
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.359
going back all the way to the untimely meditations,

408
00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:57.369
but you see it also in Daybreak and Beyond

409
00:27:57.369 --> 00:28:00.520
Good and Evil, and Gay Science and elsewhere, um,

410
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.560
this deep appreciation of human difference, um. And I

411
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.939
think the The way that I would spell that

412
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:18.930
out is that um, He thinks that Seeing other

413
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:25.130
types embodied and enacted is a way of opening

414
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:31.839
up possibilities for Oneself So, if I only ever

415
00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:34.680
encounter people who are already similar to me, then

416
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.880
I'm not going to imagine and envision other ways

417
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.839
that I could be. Um, AND It might be

418
00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:51.239
um. Tricky, it might be challenging, it might be

419
00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:55.719
uncomfortable to encounter people who are very, very different

420
00:28:55.719 --> 00:29:00.319
from me, but encountering that full range opens up

421
00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:04.959
a space of possibilities that, um, many of which

422
00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:06.719
I will not explore, many of which I will

423
00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:09.239
not end up embodying myself, but some of which

424
00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:16.969
I might. Um, AND so the, the The idea

425
00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:22.500
is that um Doing this purely in the abstract

426
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.770
is very challenging, um, whereas seeing An individual exemplar

427
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.369
of a type, um, shows you like, 00, this

428
00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:35.010
is actually a thing that a person might be

429
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:39.670
or do. Uh, AND I think that there's something,

430
00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.650
uh, kind of magical about that. Mhm.

431
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.880
And when it comes to solitude in the book,

432
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.520
you also talk about how we can do cultural

433
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.280
criticism through solitude. So tell us about that.

434
00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:02.819
Um, YEAH, so, uh, I think that there is

435
00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:06.660
that it's tempting in some cases to think. Um,

436
00:30:06.739 --> 00:30:09.500
YOU know, we're one way, people in this other

437
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.020
community are a different way, um, and maybe we

438
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.880
can look down on them, or they look down

439
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.979
on us or something like that. Um, AND there's

440
00:30:18.979 --> 00:30:22.160
a kind of lazy relativism that comes with that,

441
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.339
um, which suggests, OK, maybe we shouldn't look down

442
00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:31.250
on each other. Everybody's just different. Um. When N

443
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:36.010
Nietzsche talks about solitude, he really emphasizes that it's

444
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:41.290
about um taking a critical perspective on one's in-group,

445
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:47.500
and often that is Best or most easily done

446
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.459
by adopting. The perspective of people from some other

447
00:30:52.459 --> 00:30:58.079
group, people from some other community. So, um, I

448
00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:01.209
mean, Nietzsche was also a racist. I, I acknowledge

449
00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:06.329
that, um, but in his better moments, um, he

450
00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:12.300
tries to adopt the perspective of, uh, Other communities,

451
00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:17.040
uh, And use that perspective to turn a critical

452
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.739
eye on his own community, especially German speakers.

453
00:31:23.489 --> 00:31:27.790
Yeah, and what is the pathos of the distance?

454
00:31:29.689 --> 00:31:32.050
Uh, PATHOS of distance. Um, IT'S a phrase he

455
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.660
uses, if I recall correctly, um, 6 times. So

456
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.050
it's, um, it's not something that's super well attested,

457
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.140
and any interpretation of it is going to be

458
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:48.939
a bit speculative. Um, BUT, uh, the way I

459
00:31:48.939 --> 00:31:57.040
understand it, it's Um, a sense for. Um, Hierarchy.

460
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.619
Um, SO distance for, for Nietzsche is, is a

461
00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:05.660
kind of vertical distance. Um, AS opposed to kind

462
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.439
of a horizontal distance, and someone who embodies this

463
00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:14.119
pathos of distance understands sort of where they fall,

464
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.130
uh, within some kind of hierarchy. So it might

465
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.380
be an intellectual hierarchy, it might be a political

466
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.400
hierarchy, um. He, he, he seems to think that

467
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.859
people acquire this mostly through, um, economic and political

468
00:32:30.859 --> 00:32:34.540
hierarchies, and then they realize that actually those aren't

469
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.339
not, those are not the most important hierarchies. So

470
00:32:37.339 --> 00:32:43.000
things like, um, Uh, intellectual virtue, uh, form a

471
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.520
hierarchy as well, and somebody who has acquired a

472
00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:55.300
pathos of distance, perhaps through encountering, um, Social hierarchies,

473
00:32:55.719 --> 00:32:59.709
uh, political hierarchies can then turn around and say,

474
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.859
wait a second, like, the things that really matter.

475
00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:08.160
Rank rank people very differently from the ways that

476
00:33:08.579 --> 00:33:13.859
current political or economic hierarchies do. Um, AND, you

477
00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:16.410
know, in a way this is not that dissimilar

478
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:19.339
from some of the stuff that Socrates had to

479
00:33:19.339 --> 00:33:23.530
say, right? He, he was constantly butting up against

480
00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:29.859
the political hierarchies in Athens, um, and sort of

481
00:33:29.859 --> 00:33:33.800
insisting that, well, actually, You know, these people who

482
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.400
are on top of society don't know what they're

483
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.359
talking about. Um, AND so he, he would sort

484
00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:43.599
of humiliate them, um, eventually they got him to

485
00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:48.949
commit suicide. So, you know, in a way, N

486
00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:54.369
Nietzsche is not that dissimilar from Socrates, which is

487
00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:56.939
weird because he has a lot of nasty things

488
00:33:56.939 --> 00:33:59.420
to say about Socrates. But I think both of

489
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:06.390
them saw. Saw the ranking the in in in

490
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.780
their society as Not something to be completely done

491
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.040
away with, but something to be kind of overturned.

492
00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:19.208
Mhm So in his work, Nietzsche uses this concept

493
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:22.967
of amorfati. Uh, TELL us about it, what it

494
00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:28.529
is and how through it people can stop despising

495
00:34:28.529 --> 00:34:31.809
aspects of themselves that cannot be changed.

496
00:34:33.998 --> 00:34:36.599
Yeah, OK, so this is um something I, I

497
00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:42.168
should have brought up earlier. So, um, Nietzsche thinks

498
00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:46.929
that people have instincts that are only changeable to

499
00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:55.290
some extent. Um, AND Accepting That things can change,

500
00:34:55.379 --> 00:34:58.580
but they can't change too much, is the way

501
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.199
I would understand Amorfati. So, love of fate, uh,

502
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.419
I guess one is the English translation. Um, THE

503
00:35:07.419 --> 00:35:09.500
idea is like, I, OK, so I have this

504
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.540
type, these are my drives, they can change, but

505
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.580
only within constraints. Um, AND so what I need

506
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.479
to do, if I'm going to flourish, is to,

507
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.949
um, Love the aspects of myself that I can't

508
00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:30.320
change, and allow the other aspects of myself that

509
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.969
can change to change, if that will make things

510
00:35:34.149 --> 00:35:40.520
better. Um So, it, it's both a a council

511
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:47.639
of um acceptance and a council of recognizing that

512
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.659
some things are actually ephemeral.

513
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.020
Right. So I have one last question then, since

514
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.379
we are talking about virtues here, does Nietzsche have

515
00:35:59.379 --> 00:36:02.100
a met the ethical position?

516
00:36:03.669 --> 00:36:05.979
Uh, YOU'RE gonna force me to do meta ethics.

517
00:36:08.449 --> 00:36:12.330
I always try to avoid meta ethics, uh, but

518
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.330
you did warn me in advance that this might

519
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:23.959
happen. Um, It's Nietzsche's meta ethics has been interpreted

520
00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:29.270
as basically every possible position under the sun. Um,

521
00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:32.860
AND I'm not good at meta ethics, so I'm

522
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.709
a little bit, um, reluctant to, to try to

523
00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:39.340
answer this question, but I would say if I,

524
00:36:39.389 --> 00:36:44.080
if I had to, um, answer it, that He

525
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.060
has some kind of naturalist. Perspective, uh, that according

526
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:57.469
to which we should primarily recognize that we're animals

527
00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.459
and that our flourishing is not so different from

528
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:08.580
the flourishing of dogs and cats and rabbits, and

529
00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:12.780
especially other mammals, but even non-human, uh sorry, even

530
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:19.669
non-mammalian. Animals and that we should think of ourselves.

531
00:37:20.669 --> 00:37:28.729
In terms of the embodiment that we Uh That

532
00:37:28.729 --> 00:37:33.570
we inevitably face. Um, AND so, like the other

533
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:38.860
critters, you know, we need, uh, food and Water

534
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.510
and shelter and connection and All these sorts of

535
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:50.679
things. And any kind of meta ethics that points

536
00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:56.020
to another world, that points to something that's outside

537
00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:02.320
of mammalian embodiment is Um, it is kind of

538
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.260
hopeless. So I'm not sure whether he has a,

539
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.760
a positive meta ethics, but I think he has

540
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.560
at least a negative meta ethics. That says Recognize

541
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.909
human um Embodiment and the fact that we are

542
00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:20.209
these evolved creatures.

543
00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:26.120
Mhm. OK, great. So the book is again Nietzsche

544
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.939
