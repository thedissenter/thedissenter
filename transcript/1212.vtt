00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.840
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.539
today I'm joined by Doctor Marina Dubova. She's a

4
00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.439
um a nomi poststructural fellow at the Santa Fe

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.158
Institute, and today we're talking about her work related

6
00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.760
to the cognitive mechanisms of discovery and also the

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.469
cognitive foundations of the scientific method. So, Doctor Dubova,

8
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.479
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:27.870
Thanks so much for inviting me.

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.779
OK, so, uh, first of all, what is discovery

11
00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.009
and how do you approach such a topic?

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.119
Yeah, that's a great question. Uh, I typically think

13
00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:44.000
of discovery in a cognitive way. So, I think

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.479
of science in general as a cognitive activity of

15
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.279
how we as humans try to make sense of

16
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:53.040
the world. Um, SO in that way, uh, science

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.759
is a cognitive process and it's just, uh, and

18
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:01.700
it's characterized by many subprocesses that we often distinguish

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.319
in any cognitive system. For example, that would include

20
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.275
how We observe the world, how we experiment or

21
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:12.055
actively, uh, investigate the world around us, uh, how

22
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.644
do we represent the world based on our observations?

23
00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.855
How do we categorize the world or like, uh,

24
00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.535
parse the world into multiple parts? Uh, HOW do

25
00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.055
we communicate with others? How do we know who

26
00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:27.220
to learn from, uh, from the community? Uh, AND

27
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.900
how do we use flexible analogies to guide our

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.580
thinking and to notice similarities between different observations. So

29
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.660
all of these subprocesses, I believe, guide scientific process

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.220
just as much as they guide human learning or

31
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.440
animal learning or other systems learning in the world.

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.930
Yes, I mean, I invited you because I've never

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.419
read, or, or I, or I mean, I've had

34
00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:53.300
other discussions about the cognitive foundations of science on

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.139
the show, but it's always interesting to discuss this

36
00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.419
a little bit further because I've also had people

37
00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.739
on the show to talk about the sociology of

38
00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.860
science, the philosophy of science, and all of that

39
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.970
because, uh, I mean, to If we want to

40
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.929
be rigorous about science as an institution, we have

41
00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.210
to approach it as a human activity with all

42
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.330
of our biases, our cognitive limitations, the fact that

43
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.809
it operates within a particular cultural context, and all

44
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.990
of that. I mean, it's not just a pure

45
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.160
way that is not unbiased, that is not. Is

46
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.059
the role of discovering the truth with a capital

47
00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.679
T or something like that, right?

48
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.960
Absolutely, and, uh, as you mentioned, there are a

49
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.759
lot of people who have recognized this aspect of

50
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.880
science, the fact that all our knowledge is human

51
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.869
knowledge, it's limited, it's subject to very similar biases

52
00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.839
that we have in general as humans. It's not

53
00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:56.100
a magical activity that can lead us to Uh,

54
00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.520
objective knowledge about the world, no matter what, no

55
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.479
matter what we do, uh, if we just follow

56
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.679
exactly the methods that science prescribes to us, we

57
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.839
can, we, we still cannot transcend the inherent limitations

58
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.059
of science as an activity, as a human activity

59
00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.979
as we know it.

60
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.919
Yeah, so what are then the cognitive mechanisms of

61
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.720
discovery?

62
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.399
Yeah, as I mentioned, these are all different mechanisms

63
00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.440
that we use to try to understand the world

64
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.279
around us. This includes trying to observe the world,

65
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.679
categorizing the world into parts, or trying to parse

66
00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.679
the world in some other different ways, uh, representing

67
00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.419
the world with different types of models or theories.

68
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:42.559
Um, And, uh, things like analogies, making flexible connections

69
00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.080
between observations or models, uh, or different ways of

70
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.199
understanding the world, interacting with other people. All of

71
00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.000
these are different cognitive mechanisms of discovery, uh, and

72
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.710
These have been to some degree appreciated by philosophers

73
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.869
and sociologists of science to some extent, but now

74
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.050
we can also start to make the connection to

75
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.520
cognitive sciences, which has studied these exact same processes,

76
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.869
uh, in kind of in more detail exactly how

77
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.970
humans, uh, do these things in their everyday life.

78
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.559
So then, I mean, adding a cognitive science perspective

79
00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.619
to all of these, uh, we can include it

80
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:26.010
in a sort of multidisciplinary approach to understand how

81
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.660
science as an institution really works and how we

82
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.820
produce. Scientific knowledge, correct?

83
00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:35.299
Yeah, and ideally we could, uh, I, at least

84
00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:37.339
that's my hope is that we can also think

85
00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.089
about how we could improve science by thinking about

86
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.500
it more concretely in terms of some of these

87
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.670
processes and how they work in certain contexts. Uh,

88
00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.109
AND we can start applying cognitive methods, the methods

89
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.269
we have traditionally used to study, uh, for example,

90
00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:55.510
human learning to better understand learning in the context

91
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.739
of science. For example, we can start using, or

92
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.029
we can use more cognitive experiments with scientists where

93
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.630
we try to ask scientists to learn about certain

94
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.470
toy system where we can set up exactly what

95
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.350
is there for them, for them to learn and

96
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.459
see what kind of strategies they actually use, and

97
00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.170
we can kind of scale this approach to study.

98
00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.589
Many different scientists at different career stages and what

99
00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.950
kind of approaches they take and whether that helps

100
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.630
them learn about the toy system. Uh, WE can

101
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.029
also start modeling the process in the same way

102
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.510
we model learning in general, uh, or maybe with

103
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.820
some modifications, but the general approach is kind of,

104
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:35.989
uh, very similar where we can apply computational models

105
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:40.070
to basically probe which kinds of strategies, uh, really

106
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.149
help. Agents or scientists, uh, learn about the world

107
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:46.829
in different conditions and that, that way we can

108
00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:52.309
hopefully, uh, open up the possibility of finding other

109
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.549
strategies that have been so far, different strategies than

110
00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:58.250
the ones that have been already considered in science

111
00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:00.890
and learning that they may be the ones that

112
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.109
help, could help us learn about the world. That's

113
00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:05.250
kind of the hope at least.

114
00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.200
Yes, and I mean, I don't know if you

115
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.839
will agree exactly what, with what I'm going to

116
00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.559
say, but from my conversations, as I said, with

117
00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.570
sociologists of science, philosophers of science, and cognitive science,

118
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.119
scientists, what I took from all of that is

119
00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.519
that we should think about scientific knowledge as a

120
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.179
human construct. I mean, we're not really through science

121
00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:32.959
arriving at objective truth or About or or at

122
00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:37.399
objective reality. I mean, it's always ultimately a construct,

123
00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:38.130
correct?

124
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.839
Absolutely, I completely agree with that, and uh again,

125
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.040
cognitive perspective just adds to that a little bit,

126
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:48.299
uh, but yes, science is an inherently human activity.

127
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.519
Of course, we are making active progress in learning

128
00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:55.279
useful knowledge about the world, uh, but it doesn't

129
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.929
mean we are arriving at one. One true model

130
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.589
or one true theory about how the world actually

131
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:03.630
works. I, I completely agree with that and I

132
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.989
think some of my favorite philosophy literature is the

133
00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.070
literature that kind of makes, makes this point very

134
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.429
clear.

135
00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.549
So what would you say are then the cognitive

136
00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:17.239
foundations of the scientific method?

137
00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:21.309
I mean, uh, these, I would say would be

138
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:25.309
the strategies we typically tend to prescribe or use

139
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:29.029
when we go about, uh, scientific process. This could

140
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:34.630
include some strategies or hunches or method methodological foundations

141
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.790
that we prescribe to students when they try to

142
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.459
design their experiments or some specific, uh, preferences that

143
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:45.345
We suggest, uh, students or scientists should have when

144
00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:48.304
they're designing new models or new representations of the

145
00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:51.945
world. So these would be all the foundations or

146
00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.864
the strategies that we, uh, tend to, uh, tend

147
00:07:54.864 --> 00:07:57.364
to follow when we, uh, when we do science.

148
00:07:57.424 --> 00:07:59.945
And of course, these are very versatile, very diverse.

149
00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.785
Nobody is really following any one of these prescriptions

150
00:08:02.785 --> 00:08:06.040
perfectly well. Uh, BUT we can start kind of

151
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.200
analyzing at least what are the typical, typical strategies

152
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.100
that we as human scientists at least try to,

153
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.640
uh, try to adhere to when we learn about

154
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.720
the world. Mhm.

155
00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:20.209
Yeah, that, that's, that's very interesting, but I mean,

156
00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.700
because this is also something that I've talked about

157
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.380
with philosophers of science. When you approach the cognitive

158
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.179
foundations of the scientific method, are you approaching the

159
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:34.020
scientific method itself as one single thing, or do

160
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.140
you think there are scientific methods out there and

161
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.700
they vary depending on the scientific discipline we are

162
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.140
approaching.

163
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.580
Absolutely. I think there's a lot of diversity in

164
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.900
scientific methods and different disciplines could definitely have different

165
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.460
perspectives on how they are, uh, most effectively learning

166
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.340
about the world, what would be the best approaches.

167
00:08:57.619 --> 00:08:59.739
Uh, ACTUALLY being here at the Santa Fe Institute.

168
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.520
Really gives me an opportunity to observe this firsthand

169
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.919
because I can interact both with physicists and philosophers

170
00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.200
and sociologists and anthropologists. And this really highlights this

171
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.119
diversity of approaches that 1 may have about learning

172
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:18.000
about the world. Uh, AND I would say there

173
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.780
is Again, there's so much diversity, but there's also

174
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.820
some things that tend to reoccur in at least

175
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.289
some sciences where scientists do tend to have an

176
00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:31.099
intuition about what kind of model is a good

177
00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:33.880
illuminating model, for example, or what kind of experiment

178
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.500
ideally, uh, might be a good experiment. And some

179
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.260
of these we can trace, we can potentially speculate

180
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.780
what the history of these preferences would be. For

181
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.380
example, uh, when, uh, in social sciences or in

182
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.599
psychology, we often look Look up to sciences like

183
00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:56.880
physics where we may inadvertently try to adopt the

184
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.799
methods that may not be perfectly suited for the

185
00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.760
subject matter. So I think there's both a lot

186
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.559
of diversity and also some convergence among scientists, scientists

187
00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.340
on uh what things we should do.

188
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.419
So what do we know, because this is something

189
00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:15.140
you've studied, uh, what do we know about how

190
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.820
scientists go about choosing new experiments to perform?

191
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.849
Yeah, this is a, a fascinating question to me.

192
00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:27.489
I really love, uh, thinking about it. Uh, I

193
00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:30.729
think we, we know a lot of, a lot

194
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:34.650
about how in specific, uh, historical cases, what really

195
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.369
happened and why specific scientists may have chosen a

196
00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:40.010
specific experiment to perform or to pay attention to.

197
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.159
Uh, WE also know on a large scale, uh,

198
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:46.309
what kind of Large scale patterns we can detect

199
00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:49.469
in the, uh, publications, for example, of scientists, how

200
00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:53.309
they go about exploring this knowledge landscape of what

201
00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:56.669
things they could add on to. Um, BUT something

202
00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:59.830
we were interested in is not only kind of

203
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.429
reiterating the existence of potentially some of these strategies,

204
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.039
but to also Test when, uh, and in what

205
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:10.000
situations they actually help our learning, uh, help the

206
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.039
learning of the agents about the world just as

207
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.119
science is. So basically what we did, uh, in

208
00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:18.679
the study specifically, we took some of the canonical

209
00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:23.200
examples of, um, scientific experimental strategies that have been

210
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.400
discussed either in methodology of science, philosophy and history

211
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.729
of science, or scient metrics. That may or may

212
00:11:29.729 --> 00:11:32.809
not, that are not always the exact strategies that

213
00:11:32.809 --> 00:11:34.969
scientists follow, but at least some of the strategies

214
00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:38.090
that we know as gold standards and that we

215
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.039
sometimes try to perform, these include the ideas of,

216
00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:45.710
for example, falsification-driven experiment. The idea that a good

217
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.049
experiment is really this rigorous test of the dominant

218
00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:52.530
theory in the field where we design the experiment

219
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.849
specifically to aim to falsify the theory that we

220
00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:59.849
currently have. And that's very, uh, Very prominent idea

221
00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:05.020
in many sciences. The other experimentation strategy is, um,

222
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:08.809
driven by, uh, this conception of crucial experimentation by

223
00:12:08.809 --> 00:12:11.750
La Kato. Uh, FOR example, in this case, uh,

224
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.549
the idea is that a good experiment is the

225
00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:17.219
one that tries to, um, resolve a disagreement in

226
00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:19.270
the, uh, in the theories in, in the given

227
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.849
field. So, for example, if there are multiple dominant

228
00:12:21.849 --> 00:12:24.119
theories in the field, we need to design an

229
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:28.520
experiment. The perfectly identi uh that is, uh, kind

230
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.900
of in that space where two different theories give

231
00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:36.179
divergent predictions. So, that's a really good informative experiment

232
00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:38.719
compared to running the experiments where maybe two theories

233
00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:42.840
are giving very similar predictions. Even though these, these

234
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.679
are just examples of these canonical strategies that we

235
00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:48.919
sometimes think about as scientists on when we are

236
00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.200
designing our experiments because they seem like a really

237
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.369
good, good approach. Uh, IT has also been recorded

238
00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:58.289
that many scientists or hypothesized that sometimes scientists do

239
00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:01.510
exactly the opposite, where we actually design an experiment

240
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:06.880
in such a way that Kind of, um, that

241
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.330
makes it more likely that our favorite theory ends

242
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.000
up being proven correct again and again. So that's

243
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.609
more of a confirmation driven strategy, and we know

244
00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:16.890
that also happens in the practice of science.

245
00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:21.409
But I mean, are some of those ways of

246
00:13:21.409 --> 00:13:26.770
approaching experimentation, I mean, should they be ditched, for

247
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.369
example, do you think that when, even when people

248
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:35.450
with their own biases design an experiment where it

249
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.969
leads to, or, or it's designed in the way

250
00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:42.799
to try to Uh, basically validate their ideas or

251
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:47.469
their hypothesis. Do you think that that's bad, uh,

252
00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:51.500
methodology, or that can also be valuable in some

253
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:51.900
way?

254
00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:54.400
I, I think both are true. Uh, I think

255
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.719
it depends on the context, and of course there's

256
00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:59.859
a lot of, uh, I mean, interestingly, in the,

257
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.479
um, In the methodology of science literature, at least

258
00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:06.280
in my field in uh cognitive psychology, it's often

259
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.260
considered that confirmation-driven approach is, is supposed to be,

260
00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:15.919
is intuitively feels bad versus falsification-driven or crucial experimentation

261
00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:19.799
or disagreement, uh, driven experimentation seems like the most

262
00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:22.520
rigorous way we could do, uh, science, and that's

263
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.549
what many cognitive psychologists are ideally striving to. Um,

264
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.030
SOMETHING we have been interested in is actually testing

265
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.789
in a model which one of these strategies would

266
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.909
lead to more successful learning, and of course, we

267
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:38.260
can define more successful learning in different ways, uh,

268
00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:40.390
and of course, we had to make certain assumptions

269
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.710
when, uh, designing a model, but that kind of

270
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.489
helped us learn which strategy actually is the one

271
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:50.049
that leads to a more successful learning about the

272
00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:52.210
world, at least in the context which we studied.

273
00:14:52.989 --> 00:14:57.539
Right. Uh, WHAT is, what does it mean for

274
00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:02.830
experimentation to be theory motivated and should it be

275
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.140
theory motivated?

276
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.919
Yeah, that's, uh, I mean, all of our experimentation

277
00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:11.020
is, uh, theory driven in some way, so we

278
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.460
construct even the space of possible experiments, we conceive

279
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.340
of the space of possible experiments we could do

280
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.210
based on our theories or conceptualizations of the world.

281
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.369
However, even among the strategies I just mentioned, Uh,

282
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.460
that we are currently Discussing in science, there are

283
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.500
ones that are more guided by theory, which we

284
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.739
are deliberately trying to use our theories to guide

285
00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:37.900
specific selection of, uh, experimental conditions, and the other

286
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.059
strategies that may be less theory, uh, theory motivated

287
00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:45.719
or more exploratory. For example, uh, ideas of, uh,

288
00:15:45.729 --> 00:15:48.659
constructing an experiment to confirm one's theory or falsify

289
00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:51.380
one's theory, or, uh, to resolve a theoretical disagreement

290
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.789
could be considered. And and deliberately theory motivated strategy

291
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.190
where on top of everything else that theory provides

292
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.030
for us to even conceive of an experiment, we're

293
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.510
also trying to pick the certain experimentation conditions that

294
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.349
are, that are guided and driven, uh, motivated by

295
00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:13.059
the specific theoretical predictions that a given theory is

296
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:17.510
producing. Uh, BUT a, a different strategy, more exploratory

297
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.659
strategy could be something like just simply choosing. Uh,

298
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.059
AND experimental manipulation by random choice. So once we

299
00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:28.429
have conceived of the space of possible experiments, uh,

300
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.090
it doesn't matter what the theory says, it doesn't

301
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.859
matter what two theories and where they disagree, uh,

302
00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:37.700
it's more important to just choose whatever, uh, whatever

303
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.140
experiment, uh, we can do it by random or

304
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.820
try to do some kind of novelty-driven sampling where

305
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.200
we try to Uh, design experiments that are as

306
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.000
different as possible from other experiments we've done. In

307
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.140
that case, theory itself places a slightly lesser role

308
00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:56.479
in design in our choice of design of an

309
00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:59.559
experiment, and that's kind of what we call less

310
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:03.359
theory-driven experiments in our, um, in our, um, in

311
00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:06.439
our simulation that we have mentioned. What we have

312
00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.848
found in that study is that If we basically

313
00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:12.050
run this model of agents who are trying to

314
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.368
learn about the world and who are designing experiments

315
00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.579
based on one of these strategies, uh, and who

316
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.140
are basically trying to, uh, create representations of the

317
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.420
world based on their experimental observations. So the goal

318
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.848
is to create a good theory for these agents,

319
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.579
and good in the sense means either a theory

320
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:33.099
that can predict the world, uh, predict the ground

321
00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:36.670
truth very well, or, uh, the theory that can

322
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.430
Um, account for as much information in the world

323
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.459
as possible. So these would be our two, metrics

324
00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:46.849
of success in this case. We basically found that

325
00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:50.530
the agents who are, uh, driven by more exploratory

326
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.359
strategies such as simply randomly choosing what kind of

327
00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:57.130
experiment to do or, uh, using some kind of

328
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.000
novelty considerations. Uh, THESE were the agents who ended

329
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.430
up learning the most predictive and informative theories about

330
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.560
the world, whereas the agents who are following this

331
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.760
more theory guided, um, strategies such as false even

332
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.400
falsification or crucial experimentation, were the ones that inadvertently

333
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.229
narrowed themselves down to a certain aspect of the,

334
00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:22.959
of the world, and they, they thought that they

335
00:18:22.959 --> 00:18:26.000
would be developing very good theories because they limited

336
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.510
the range of observations they are learning from. So,

337
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.640
in that case, uh, it turned out that there's

338
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.839
this very interesting illusion of a theoretical success that

339
00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:38.719
was emerging. So, if the experimentation strategy is guiding

340
00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:41.880
you to narrow down the set of observations that

341
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.800
you're learning from, you may think, you, you may

342
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.829
have less information to even explain. Therefore, leading to

343
00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:52.890
potentially, uh, leading you to potentially conceive of your

344
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.589
theory as being more successful just because once we

345
00:18:56.589 --> 00:19:00.050
evaluate scientific success, we can only, um, We can

346
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.420
only look up, look up at the things that

347
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.260
we currently know. For example, if I try to

348
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.579
evaluate the success of psychology right now, I would

349
00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:10.739
look mostly at the current observations that we know

350
00:19:10.739 --> 00:19:13.619
as scientists and how well our theories are accounting

351
00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:16.890
for these observations. So, from that perspective, these agents

352
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.535
who were very theories Driven, even the ones who

353
00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:22.454
were trying to falsify, um, the, uh, theories by

354
00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.535
their experiments were the ones that were collecting more

355
00:19:25.535 --> 00:19:28.734
limited data for themselves to learn from, leading to

356
00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:31.974
this illusion of having successfully explained the world when

357
00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:34.515
in fact, you cannot actually generalize to the ground

358
00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:36.675
truth that you're trying to, try to learn about.

359
00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:41.930
OK, but how would randomization work in experimentation? I

360
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:47.530
mean, how would experimenters or researchers randomize experimentation?

361
00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:50.199
I mean, that's a great question, and I think

362
00:19:50.199 --> 00:19:52.839
that kind of goes into uh this other aspect

363
00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:55.589
I mentioned of we, we tried all of, all

364
00:19:55.589 --> 00:19:59.439
of these idealized strategies. Obviously, nobody can ever execute

365
00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:03.939
these strategies precisely. Uh, EVEN perfect falsification is also

366
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.900
impossible. We would always be swayed by these different

367
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:12.640
other aspects or by our inability to perfectly Perfectly

368
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.420
assess what would be ideal falsification case for a

369
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.939
theory and things like that. In the same way,

370
00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:22.859
perfectly random strategy is never possible. Uh, WE always

371
00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:26.020
are guided by all kinds of, uh, all kinds

372
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.540
of both theoretical considerations that are already guiding our

373
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.030
experimentation, but also we are also, uh, guided by

374
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.239
costs and other practical things that make it sometimes

375
00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:43.839
very, uh, Potentially even uh not beneficial to conduct

376
00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:46.680
these kinds of more exploratory experiments when we as

377
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.359
human beings may have more trouble, for example, to

378
00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:52.319
even connect these findings to other things that we

379
00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:56.239
know, which would make, make it cognitively costly, for

380
00:20:56.239 --> 00:20:59.719
example, to conduct these more exploratory experiments. What I

381
00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:03.160
would suggest it's more, um, What I would suggest

382
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.520
is more uh kind of nuanced position where there

383
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.560
are different trade-offs that are associated with different experimentation

384
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.160
strategies and we should just be not, uh, be

385
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.079
aware of this, this possible vicious cycle, uh, which

386
00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:21.479
may be introduced if we are following a theory-driven

387
00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:27.040
experimentation, and I believe any increase in the how

388
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.469
much exploration we are allowing in our experiments. Uh,

389
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.489
WOULD make us more robust to these kinds of,

390
00:21:33.719 --> 00:21:35.890
uh, vicious traps that we have uncovered in our

391
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.189
stimulation. So, for example, in a given experiment, if

392
00:21:39.189 --> 00:21:42.569
I have a choice, In a given situation, to

393
00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:47.369
either specifically, deliberately pre-plan all of the variables and

394
00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:50.109
how they're going to behave in my experiment, versus

395
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.930
if I just let it, let it be more

396
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.410
exploratory choice, where I don't perfectly pre-plan everything, I

397
00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.089
believe that uh more exploratory choice would be more

398
00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:03.030
on the side of these agents who were randomly,

399
00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:05.689
uh, selecting their experiments. So, I believe that's, that's

400
00:22:05.689 --> 00:22:08.689
kind of one. Uh, KIND of minor way in

401
00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:11.430
which we can alter our experimentation day to day

402
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.479
by making some of the small choices that we

403
00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:17.489
make potentially more exploratory. So, it doesn't mean we

404
00:22:17.489 --> 00:22:20.410
should always be satisfied that none, none of our

405
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.079
experiments are ever perfectly random or I don't know

406
00:22:24.079 --> 00:22:27.310
if we even want that, but there's always choices

407
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.150
that we make that could be made more or

408
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.890
less exploratory, and this, uh, this study kind of

409
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.209
speaks for the value of more exploratory studies.

410
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.510
So another topic I would like to ask you

411
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.689
about, what is concept-laden evidence?

412
00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:45.439
Yeah, that's a very related topic, of course. Um,

413
00:22:45.569 --> 00:22:47.890
THIS is something we thought about, uh, kind of

414
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.410
again inspired by the philosophy literature that is pointing

415
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.750
out the theory ladenness of scientific observation and how

416
00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:56.609
all of the things, all of the data that

417
00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:59.760
we are collecting actually is not neutral or pure

418
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.089
or theory-free. It's always ingrained with our way, the

419
00:23:03.089 --> 00:23:05.319
ways we, in which we are conceptualizing the world.

420
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.479
So, what we try to do with uh my

421
00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:10.890
advisor, Rob Goldstone, We try to think about the

422
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.410
ways in which concepts, specifically the ways we carve

423
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.510
the world into multiple parts. For example, in human,

424
00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:20.130
uh, in human life, it could be carving the

425
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.810
continuous color spectrum into discrete categories such as red

426
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.729
and orange and blue in one culture or some

427
00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:30.050
other categorization in the other culture. Um, IN the

428
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.270
science, it would be creating scientific taxonomies where we

429
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:36.510
kind of carve our phenomena into multiple parts. Uh,

430
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.430
THIS would, the example of this would be, for

431
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.349
example, in the human cognitive psychology, we conceive of

432
00:23:42.349 --> 00:23:46.449
human mind as consisting of multiple processes such as

433
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.310
attention, perception, memory. Memory is divided into long-term memory,

434
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.069
short-term memory, working memory, and things like that. So

435
00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:58.069
all of these are conceptualizations that we impose onto

436
00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:02.530
our phenomena of interest. So, the, we suggest in

437
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.650
this paper that our, uh, evidence that we're collecting

438
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.609
is influenced by these concepts or taxonomies that we

439
00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:12.130
are, uh, that we have when we are approaching

440
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.050
the, the subject matter. So, uh, specifically, we are

441
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.130
trying to say, uh, we're trying to make a

442
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.489
case in the paper that, um, A lot of

443
00:24:21.489 --> 00:24:24.209
the ways in which we have already noticed in

444
00:24:24.209 --> 00:24:27.010
human cognitive psychology that our concepts of the world

445
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.939
often influence our perception of the world. For example,

446
00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:35.270
having different color color categorizations may influence how, uh,

447
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.329
we, we would be perceptually discriminating different colors if

448
00:24:38.329 --> 00:24:41.209
we come from different cultures. Um, IN the same

449
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:43.689
way, we're saying that Uh, some of the same

450
00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:47.250
mechanisms may affect how concepts, these concepts in which

451
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.489
we divide the world into parts may affect scientific

452
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:55.329
experimentation, scientific theory building, uh, and, uh, scientific reassessment

453
00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:57.829
of the evidence in such a way that may

454
00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:02.250
sometimes instantiate these, these categories even when we're trying

455
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.199
to reassess them. Uh, I can talk more about

456
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:07.030
this, but that's kind of the big picture.

457
00:25:08.109 --> 00:25:10.109
I mean, would that be one of the reasons

458
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:14.900
why cognitive and cultural diversity in science is important?

459
00:25:15.189 --> 00:25:18.390
Because, I mean, people from different, uh, cultural and

460
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.869
cognitive backgrounds perhaps have something to add that if

461
00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:28.079
we only add, for example, people from Uh, countries

462
00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:32.680
where the, the dominant psychologies, to use Joseph Eric's

463
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.000
terms, uh, weird psychology, that would be limiting in

464
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.479
a way.

465
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.989
Absolutely, I think there are so many ways in

466
00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:44.359
which, uh, cultural diversity and in general, uh, epistemic,

467
00:25:44.479 --> 00:25:47.500
any kind of theoretical diversity in science, I believe,

468
00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:50.920
should be encouraged. Uh, THE main reason for this

469
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.280
is that we bring all of this historical and

470
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.719
cultural baggage with us when we construct. Uh, OUR

471
00:25:56.719 --> 00:25:59.760
conceptualizations of the world, even as, as scientists, and

472
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.040
science is not this magical way to basically transcend

473
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.040
all our, all of our human cognitive limitations and

474
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.819
human conceptualizations that we, uh, we have been, uh,

475
00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:14.060
ingrained with over, over the course of our lives.

476
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.079
Uh, AND actually what we, uh, what many people

477
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:20.180
have noticed is that a lot of scientific taxonomies

478
00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:23.560
are trait, have their traces in the folk taxonomies

479
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.359
of a given. Uh, OFTEN Western cultures. Uh, SO

480
00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:30.119
for example, uh, the way in which, again, we

481
00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:33.640
think about human cognitive, uh, cognitive processes, a lot

482
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.479
of these, uh, these concepts trace their roots in,

483
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.199
uh, in the Western conceptualization, uh, conceptualizations of how

484
00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:44.959
humans work, uh, even before psychology was created. Uh,

485
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.729
IN fact, I think It's not just about the

486
00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:50.770
concepts, but it's also about the ways in which

487
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.410
we approach the world and represent the world, and

488
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.530
it has been documented in a cross cultural psychology

489
00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.069
that there's a lot of variation in which people,

490
00:27:00.329 --> 00:27:03.989
uh, from different cultures, uh, might be even approaching,

491
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.369
uh, the, this activity of learning about the world.

492
00:27:06.489 --> 00:27:10.099
For example, Douglas Mine and Megan Bang and other

493
00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:12.729
have, others have done a lot of beautiful work

494
00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:17.550
on How, uh, native, uh, native people's conceptualizations of

495
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.510
nature actually sometimes are more consistent with the complexity

496
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.630
view where you consider all of the things to

497
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.829
be interrelated with each other as compared to kind

498
00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:30.949
of Western, uh, way of thinking about the world

499
00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.229
when we try to, sometimes it seems like we're

500
00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:37.670
trying to really Consider every variable in isolation and

501
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.739
which one is really affecting the, the target, uh,

502
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.869
target phenomenon, uh, and these are different high-level strategies

503
00:27:44.869 --> 00:27:46.989
in which we can even, uh, approach to learn

504
00:27:46.989 --> 00:27:48.709
about the world and some of them, them may

505
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:51.430
or may not be, uh, more useful or all

506
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.530
of them are useful, and we need to really,

507
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.109
uh, see where each approach would, would lead us.

508
00:27:57.699 --> 00:27:57.709
Mhm.

509
00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.349
Yeah, uh, no, I definitely have had several conversations

510
00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:03.550
on the show about that. For example, I've interviewed

511
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.989
Doctor Richard Nisbett about the cognitive differences between Westerners

512
00:28:07.989 --> 00:28:11.989
and Eastern Asians, and Eastern Asians, for example, tend

513
00:28:11.989 --> 00:28:15.650
to be more holistic in their thinking, more relational,

514
00:28:15.989 --> 00:28:20.140
and, uh, and, uh, I mean, approaches to, uh,

515
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.109
science in the East tend, uh, are more easily

516
00:28:24.109 --> 00:28:27.790
favored, for example, a process. Ontology instead of a

517
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.630
substance ontology and then there are work of people

518
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.349
uh that unfortunately is not very mainstream in the

519
00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:37.949
cognitive sciences and psychology yet, but there are people

520
00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:43.469
applying complexity science and dynamical systems theory specifically to

521
00:28:43.469 --> 00:28:46.390
psychology and cognitive science. I mean, I've interviewed people

522
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.550
like Naomi Reuter and Paul van Gert from the

523
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.109
Netherlands and they are doing fantastic work in that

524
00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:56.729
domain and Um, yeah, I, I mean, it's just

525
00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:59.770
that there are ways of thinking that perhaps are

526
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.410
harder for people who were brought up in the

527
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.869
Western culture.

528
00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:08.599
Absolutely, and I think what like this cognitive approach

529
00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:11.250
could add onto this is basically we can say,

530
00:29:11.369 --> 00:29:13.890
oh, these are the specific differences we have noticed

531
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.569
and how people Approach they're learning about the world

532
00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:19.930
in these different countries. For example, that could include

533
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.770
more holistic and relational thinking versus more, uh, kind

534
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.530
of reductionist thinking, uh, and of course, we are

535
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.920
not making a point that one of them is

536
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.869
better than another, but it's very important to understand

537
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.089
where some of our aspects of our existing science

538
00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:38.869
are coming from, whether it's really the world speaking

539
00:29:38.869 --> 00:29:42.550
to us and being all of, like, being, uh,

540
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:49.339
Kind of um Being Isomorphic to the structures that

541
00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:52.079
we typically use to think about the world versus

542
00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:55.890
if, if, if that's really our cognitive limitations and

543
00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.060
our cognitive predispositions are, are that we are imposing

544
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.939
onto the world, and I think both could be

545
00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:04.900
possible and it's very important to kind of document

546
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.479
some of these differences, some of these possible differences,

547
00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:11.300
uh, and to think about, um, how we could

548
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.819
Assess which, which aspect was uh in play, uh,

549
00:30:16.849 --> 00:30:19.410
when a certain piece of evidence has been gathered.

550
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.369
Of course that can never be achieved in perfect

551
00:30:22.369 --> 00:30:25.530
form, but I think just recognizing the differences is

552
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.310
the first step.

553
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.719
I mean, at least in the Western tradition, I

554
00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:33.869
think we've known at the very least since Kant

555
00:30:33.869 --> 00:30:38.150
that the pure empiricist approach, I mean that we

556
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.469
should assume that we just receive pure information without

557
00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:45.510
any. The cognitive filters from the world and process

558
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.199
it just doesn't work and isn't true, right?

559
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.430
Absolutely. I think in philosophy it has been recognized

560
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.420
for a very long time and I think many

561
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.510
scientists are aware of this, but I think when

562
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.630
it comes to very specific Day to day parts

563
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.910
of doing science, we somehow, often they're still, at

564
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.949
least in cognitive psychology, I feel like I personally

565
00:31:07.949 --> 00:31:10.109
have been trained with this kind of mindset and

566
00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:12.270
others have been trained, even though we do know

567
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.910
there are these biases that affect our cognition, still,

568
00:31:15.989 --> 00:31:19.229
we, we think that we're learning this, uh, ideally,

569
00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:22.380
the ideal is to find this one theory that

570
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.910
really explains the phenomenon and we often have these

571
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.890
fights over Attention and memory and attention and perception,

572
00:31:28.969 --> 00:31:32.209
these are really the modules of cognition. Um, BASED

573
00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:35.000
on, uh, based on looking at some of the

574
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.810
evidence when we don't really go into depth about

575
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.050
how this evidence has been collected in the first

576
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.089
place and how this evidence that we're using to

577
00:31:44.089 --> 00:31:46.640
justify again and again that perception and attention are

578
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.079
different processes might have been collected with these conceptualizations

579
00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:55.150
in mind where there are different cognitive psychology communities

580
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.250
that are studying these different processes and it's really,

581
00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:00.880
really hard to Backtrack and say, oh, let's just

582
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.199
look at the data and see if perception and

583
00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:07.040
attention are re-emerging as kind of joints of the

584
00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.319
mind, uh, when we have used them, uh, for

585
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:13.469
our entire activity. It's kind of hard to, uh,

586
00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:15.079
appreciate that in the moment sometimes.

587
00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:18.079
OK, so let me ask you about another topic

588
00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:21.420
that you've explored in your work, uh, because many

589
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.969
times, and I still hear this from many scientists,

590
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.219
we assume that parsimony is always better and that

591
00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:32.194
we should always apply the parsimon. On the principle

592
00:32:32.194 --> 00:32:36.045
or we should apply something like Occam's razor to

593
00:32:36.045 --> 00:32:40.944
science that is the, the most, uh, the simplest

594
00:32:40.944 --> 00:32:44.805
uh explanation with the fewest assumptions. It is always

595
00:32:44.805 --> 00:32:48.564
the better, that's the assumption. Um, I mean, is

596
00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:53.114
this, is the parsimony principle always the best to

597
00:32:53.114 --> 00:32:54.324
apply in science?

598
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.650
Um, I think it's not always the best, and

599
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.069
it depends on the context, uh, and in fact,

600
00:33:00.209 --> 00:33:03.670
something I'm very interested in is kind of mapping.

601
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.609
When and in which situations parsimony is the useful

602
00:33:07.609 --> 00:33:09.869
principle for a learning agent to learn about the

603
00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:12.930
world and when is it not a useful principle

604
00:33:13.069 --> 00:33:16.839
and again, that's where some of the cognitive, uh,

605
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.270
studies of other types of learners, for example, either

606
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.790
human learners learning about the world when we can

607
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.869
assess the progress or we can look at the

608
00:33:25.869 --> 00:33:28.910
machines or artificial learners who are trying to learn

609
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.829
about the set of data and we can basically

610
00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:35.050
manipulate. How, uh, what the degree of the parsimony

611
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.369
bias they have when they're trying to learn a

612
00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:40.410
representation of the data, and we have some really

613
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.410
interesting recent results from computer science and statistical learning

614
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.979
that basically is speaking. Against at least the most

615
00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:53.920
naive intuition that always just having trying to compress

616
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.280
the data into a smallest number of components or

617
00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.359
at least relatively small number of components is always

618
00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:02.949
the best. So, basically, some of these recent results,

619
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.209
it's um called the double descent of generalization error.

620
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.040
So, basically, when we think about scientific uh statistical

621
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.918
representation learning, Let's say we're trying to create either

622
00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:16.938
a linear model with multiple parameters to capture the

623
00:34:16.938 --> 00:34:19.080
set of data, or we can think about a

624
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.688
neural autoencoder, kind of, uh, there's an input data

625
00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:25.520
of a, of a given dimensionality and output data

626
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.270
of a given dimensionality, and the goal is to

627
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.600
construct a representation to capture as much of, as

628
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.780
much of the structure in the data as possible.

629
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.719
So when we think of these systems, uh, we

630
00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.080
can basically vary the degree, at least of the

631
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:44.870
parsimony that they are. Originally, uh, originally created with.

632
00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:47.708
So in this case, we can, for example, say

633
00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:50.790
this neural autoencoder could have a bigger bottleneck where

634
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.790
they're only one neuron, one single neuron that all

635
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.668
the information is passing through, or the linear model

636
00:34:56.668 --> 00:34:59.149
could have just one parameter to account for all

637
00:34:59.149 --> 00:35:02.360
the variants in the data. Uh, THE other option

638
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.679
would be, uh, to increase the number of neurons

639
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:07.840
that are, that are capturing the information and the

640
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.639
data, uh, or the, to increase the amount of

641
00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:14.360
parameters of this regression model. And traditionally we have

642
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.159
thought that increasing this number of parameters contra or

643
00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:23.370
very intuitively, it basically, uh, Increases our, uh, risk

644
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.030
of overfitting the data, overfitting the noise in the

645
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.750
data. So basically, the idea is that by compressing

646
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.350
the data, we find really the things that truly

647
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.939
matter and we rule out all the noise and

648
00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:37.199
everything else in our everyday observations. So, uh, none

649
00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:39.620
of the observations are exactly the same, so it's

650
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.149
useful to, when you're constructing a representation to basically

651
00:35:43.149 --> 00:35:45.790
rule out all of this, uh, noise as much

652
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.780
as possible to capture only the important elements of

653
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.100
it. Uh, AND that's kind of one of the

654
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.860
arguments for parsimony is that we, we basically aim

655
00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.219
right away to rule out all the noise in

656
00:35:58.219 --> 00:36:01.500
the data and, uh, try not to overfit this

657
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.979
noise in our representations because that would be not

658
00:36:03.979 --> 00:36:07.540
useful, not generalizable. We cannot reuse that representation to

659
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.080
guide our behavioral new situations. But, uh, something, uh,

660
00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.590
some the literature that I find really fascinating is

661
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.310
this literature in statistical learning on double descent, which

662
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.550
basically finds that this picture is not as straightforward

663
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.489
as we thought. So basically, it turns out if

664
00:36:25.489 --> 00:36:28.399
you start increasing, for example, the number of parameters

665
00:36:28.399 --> 00:36:32.229
in the linear model or the number of um

666
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.649
neurons in the autoencoder, well beyond the point where

667
00:36:35.649 --> 00:36:38.010
the model can perfectly account for literally everything in

668
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.649
the data, so now the, the error of the

669
00:36:40.649 --> 00:36:43.649
model is basically zero on the data. And now

670
00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:47.199
we keep increasing the number of parameters. For example,

671
00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.429
that would constitute learning a polynomial regression with 1000

672
00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:56.280
parameters to account for 20 observations or learning an

673
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.550
autoencoder with 1000 inner neurons to account for 10

674
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.939
dimensional data. This sounds like a really ridiculous concept.

675
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.239
Why do we imply, why do we construct this

676
00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:09.510
map that is potentially more dimensional than the data

677
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.360
itself? But what people tend to find in statistical

678
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.939
learning literature is that actually, these end up often

679
00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:20.229
being the representations that generalize the best, which is,

680
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.899
uh, from some perspective could be considered very counterintuitive,

681
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.199
where basically you're creating the representation that is at

682
00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:31.879
least more rich than the data itself. This representation

683
00:37:31.879 --> 00:37:35.560
is already memorizing every single data point and has

684
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.429
many more degrees of freedom. Then needed to capture

685
00:37:38.429 --> 00:37:41.560
this data, uh, but this representation ends up generalizing

686
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.270
very well. And of course, there is a lot

687
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.389
of, uh, very interesting technical literature trying to explain

688
00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.870
why this happens and why it may again go

689
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.149
back to this, uh, traditional trade-off between parsimony and

690
00:37:52.149 --> 00:37:55.229
complexity. Is there some notion of parsimony that emerges

691
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:58.479
there in that regime, but what we are, we're

692
00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:01.229
interested in is thinking about how this mode of

693
00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:04.340
learning in general. What it could teach us about

694
00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:07.560
this universal preference for parsimony. At least what this

695
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.520
is showing us is that there are modes of

696
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.189
learning that seem to be at least incompatible, partially

697
00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:17.199
incompatible with our traditional notions of how parsimony should

698
00:38:17.199 --> 00:38:20.739
be imposed on learning about the world, that nevertheless

699
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.639
lead one to learn a very successful representation of

700
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:26.030
the world, at least very useful for generalizing and

701
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.639
predicting, and we can ask whether that representation is

702
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.159
useful for other epistemic goals we can have.

703
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.540
OK, so one last question slash topic I would

704
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.229
like to explore here and it is very much

705
00:38:38.229 --> 00:38:41.590
related to the previous one, because of course in

706
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.169
science, we can't represent reality itself, or at least

707
00:38:46.169 --> 00:38:48.510
I think that's not possible. We always have to

708
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.669
model reality. Uh, I mean, I, I think this

709
00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:54.949
is sort of almost the reverse of my previous

710
00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:58.709
question. I mean, are more complex models better?

711
00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:02.070
I mean, I think it depends on the context.

712
00:39:02.179 --> 00:39:04.350
It depends on what are the observations we are

713
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.949
learning from. Uh, THERE are different, uh, goals in

714
00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:10.229
which complex models could serve us a really good

715
00:39:10.229 --> 00:39:14.310
role in originally exploring many, many patterns that may

716
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.629
be there in the data that we could eventually

717
00:39:16.629 --> 00:39:19.870
distill into a couple of intuitive, uh, principles that

718
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.949
we can comprehend. Um, SO these are the areas

719
00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:26.030
that have been explored, again, in computer science literature.

720
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.929
It's called, uh, distilled learning, for example, where often,

721
00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:33.479
There's a stage of learning in which constructing this

722
00:39:33.479 --> 00:39:36.439
very, very complex representation or a very high dimensional

723
00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:39.600
representation is actually useful, even if the goal eventually

724
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.419
is to come up with just a couple of

725
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.560
parsimon just a parsimonious model with two variables. So

726
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.439
basically, uh, if you learn the parsimonious model directly

727
00:39:49.439 --> 00:39:52.020
from the data, it often ends up not being

728
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.399
as successful as the model of the same data

729
00:39:55.399 --> 00:39:58.239
that is learned from this higher dimensional representation of

730
00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:00.989
the data we can learn first. So that's kind

731
00:40:00.989 --> 00:40:05.149
of hinting at a possibility of using more complex

732
00:40:05.149 --> 00:40:07.649
models at a different stage of the scientific process

733
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.429
where we, even if our goal is eventually to

734
00:40:10.429 --> 00:40:14.179
come up with a very, uh, intuitively understandable, uh,

735
00:40:14.189 --> 00:40:18.429
representation of the phenomenon, maybe the first stage usefully

736
00:40:18.429 --> 00:40:22.070
might be constructing this higher dimensional representation of it

737
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.629
that might be more complex than the phenomenon that's

738
00:40:24.629 --> 00:40:26.830
that even the data, uh, at least of the

739
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.679
phenomenon. Uh, SO I think Uh, back to your

740
00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:33.649
question, I think it's context dependent, depends on, uh,

741
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.040
what we're trying to achieve in science, but I

742
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.780
do feel like there, there are contexts in which

743
00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:42.899
complex models could be usefully utilized, and it is.

744
00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:46.780
It is a limitation of science if we don't

745
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.719
make use of this uh mode of learning.

746
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.090
OK, so Doctor Dubova, just before we go, would

747
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.409
you like to tell people where they can find

748
00:40:56.409 --> 00:40:58.330
you and your work on the internet?

749
00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:02.510
Yeah, totally. Uh, PEOPLE can go to my, uh,

750
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.580
Google Scholar profile or my website. It's M Duboba.com.

751
00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:08.959
Uh, THERE'S a lot of summaries of my research

752
00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:10.840
and some of the papers, and of course I'm

753
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.560
always happy to answer any questions that somebody may

754
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.199
