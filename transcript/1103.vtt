00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.010
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.170
today I'm joined by Doctor Paul Seabright. He is

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.770
British professor of economics in the Industrial Economics Institute

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.649
and Toulouse School of Economics at the University of

6
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.850
Toulouse in France. And today we're going to talk

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.969
about his book The Divine Economy How Religions Compete

8
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:27.530
for Wealth, Power, and people. So Doctor Seabright, welcome

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.690
to the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.520
Thank you. It's a great pleasure for me as

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.830
well.

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.119
So, uh, how did you connect economics to the

13
00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:42.759
study of religion and religious institutions? What led you

14
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:43.040
there?

15
00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.130
Oh, it's a long story. Um, I've been interested

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.700
in economic institutions of different kinds for years and

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.380
years, and I've been particularly interested in seeing the

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.860
economic aspects of many different kinds of institutions that

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.020
we don't necessarily think of that way. And to

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.379
me it's almost a no brainer. Um, uh, RELIGIOUS

21
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.089
movements do many things, but they have to stay

22
00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:09.940
solvent if they're to be able to do them.

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.449
And uh so I'm interested in the way in

24
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:18.610
which the logistics of economic survival and of economic

25
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.069
competition with rivals. Uh, SHAPES the way in which

26
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.779
religious movements function. Now people often say to me,

27
00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.940
yes, but surely religious movements aren't just economic, uh,

28
00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.550
businesses, and of course that's right. But then so

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.540
many other businesses are not just economic businesses either.

30
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.949
So you think about, I don't know, restaurants or

31
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:44.269
theaters or um platforms of all kinds, or you

32
00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:48.319
think about um. Innovative startups. You think about hospitals,

33
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.839
you think about all sorts of things which are

34
00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:55.160
populated by individuals who have ambitions, who have hopes,

35
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.940
who have plans, who have visions, and yet they

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.519
also have to stay solvent and to compete with

37
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.480
rivals in order to realize those visions. So for

38
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.240
me, the visionary side of religious movements and the

39
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.979
economic side. And not in conflict with each other,

40
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.779
they're complementary, just as they are in pretty well

41
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.940
every other uh economic institution you could choose to

42
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.259
name.

43
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.009
And how does your approach to religion uh relate

44
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.889
to other approaches like the cognitive science of religion?

45
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.929
I'm asking you that because I've already have on

46
00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:35.529
the show several cognitive scientists of religion. So what's

47
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.970
the relationship there, if any?

48
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.720
Well, um, when I started working on the economics

49
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.160
of religion, part of what, uh, motivated me was

50
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.710
to try to understand what this thing, religiosity was.

51
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.360
What was it that made people religious and what

52
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.279
was sort of going on in their heads. And

53
00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.000
the more I worked on this, the more I

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.520
think that's a bad question. Um, I don't think

55
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.320
there's a single thing going on in people's heads

56
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.360
when they engage in religious activity. There's an immense

57
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.199
range of different ways of being religious. So you

58
00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.759
can be religious when you're meditating. You can be

59
00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.679
religious when you're singing ecstatically with a group of

60
00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.259
other people. You can be religious when you're on

61
00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.990
a pilgrimage. You can be religious when you're serving

62
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.570
in a soup kitchen for refugees. You can religious,

63
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.979
uh, when you're going on a crusade or a

64
00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.050
jihad, you can be religious when you're praying together,

65
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220
uh, in a mosque or in a temple. You

66
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.300
can be religious when you're engaging in some other

67
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.059
kind of ritual. There's no single thing that people

68
00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.979
do when they're religious. And, you know, this isn't

69
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.059
a novel point to me. Um, IT goes back

70
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.740
to William James in his very aptly titled book

71
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.369
The Varieties of Religious Experience, in which he said,

72
00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.149
you know, um, There's no special characteristic which is

73
00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:59.139
religious devotion or religious awe or religious love. Um,

74
00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.839
THERE is just ordinary love, ordinary devotion, ordinary awe,

75
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.550
applied to religious objects. And I think that's a

76
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.789
profound insight, because what it says is that cognitive

77
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.990
science can tell us a lot about. How people

78
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.470
interact with religious movements, so long as they don't

79
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.029
try and pretend that it's a single thing that's

80
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.108
going on in their heads when they do, um,

81
00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:24.149
many, many different things are going on in people's

82
00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:27.279
heads, uh, in a way that just reflects the

83
00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:30.790
very large variety of different activities that religious movements

84
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.459
engage in.

85
00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:36.269
And what aspects of religious movements and institutions do

86
00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:39.980
you expect to be able to explain through economics?

87
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.519
Well, I think there's a whole category of activities

88
00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.519
where religious movements are doing things that are rather

89
00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:51.079
similar to secular movements. So I talk a lot

90
00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.549
in the book about how religious movements can supply

91
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.859
financial services, how they can supply health, education, how

92
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:01.250
they can act as. Um, PLATFORMS for people to

93
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.529
find marriage partners and so on. But I also

94
00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.670
want to emphasize that religious movements do it differently.

95
00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:11.769
They, uh, in particular, um, are able to offer

96
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.570
these other services because at the same time, they

97
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.809
offer a creative space in which people can come

98
00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.450
together to engage in various kinds of spiritual activities,

99
00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:26.839
including rituals, including prayer, including song. Yeah, um, and

100
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.529
also, uh, obtain, um, religious inspiration and moral, uh,

101
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.670
inspiration as well as, um, what you might think

102
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.200
of as narrative inspiration, um, in a way that

103
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.679
is intrinsically tied to the religious character of the

104
00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:48.470
platform. So, even though. Um, OF course, many other

105
00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:55.000
institutions supply these secular activities, education, health, finance, and

106
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.679
so on. They don't do so in that particular

107
00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:01.920
context in which the services are bundled with these

108
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.559
more spiritual activities. And uh I spent a lot

109
00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.119
of time in the book explaining how the bundling

110
00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.480
of the secular activities with the spiritual activities is

111
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.480
a source of strength for the religious movements.

112
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.649
So, but we are in the 21st century. Isn't

113
00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:25.660
religiosity in decline? How relevant are religious institutions today?

114
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.540
Well, it's clearly in decline in some countries and

115
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.339
some regions. So it's, uh, I would say in

116
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.459
decline, mostly in North America, though it remains to

117
00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:39.339
be seen how far that decline will continue, and

118
00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:42.220
we have to remember that in North America, uh,

119
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.440
really. Curiosity, however you measure it, uh, has started

120
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.679
at a much higher level, uh, than it did

121
00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:52.130
in Europe, uh, or in a number of other

122
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.869
parts of the world like uh East Asia, Japan,

123
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.420
uh, Taiwan, Korea, and so forth, um, let alone

124
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.320
mainland China. But, um, on the other hand, there

125
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.799
are many parts of the world in which it's

126
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:08.769
increased. So in all the Orthodox countries, uh, that

127
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:10.750
used to be part of the former Soviet Union.

128
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.269
Um, IN, but not just Orthodox countries. There are

129
00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:18.029
many countries that are either, uh, majority Catholic or

130
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:23.079
majority Protestant in Central America, in Africa. There are

131
00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:27.109
many Muslim countries where the, um, there's been a

132
00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:30.809
massive Muslim revival in the last half century. Um,

133
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.029
NOW, sometimes that's a little bit biased by reporting

134
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.470
bias. So in countries like Iran, for example, religiosity's

135
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.029
probably on the decline, although people are scared to

136
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.630
say so because it's a very authoritarian country. So

137
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.220
the picture is very mixed across the world, um,

138
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.869
but I don't believe there's a general global tendency

139
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:54.850
for religiosity to decline. And of course, you have

140
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.660
to think carefully about how you measure it. So

141
00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.390
if you take measures like how important is religion

142
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.579
in people's lives, or whether they believe in God,

143
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.829
there is globally no average tendency to decline, although

144
00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:10.940
there is decline in particular regions and particular countries

145
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.910
and increases in others. The one dimension in which

146
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.230
I would say there has been a decline on

147
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:22.070
average is how frequently people attend religious services. Now,

148
00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:24.320
if you were just looking at that measure, you

149
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.040
would say, oh, you know, people are becoming less

150
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.480
religious, but there's another way to interpret it, which

151
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.510
is consistent with the evidence that on the whole

152
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.320
people think religion is as important as they used

153
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.760
to, which is that people are doing more mixing

154
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.119
and matching in their religious activities. So many more

155
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.347
people are prepared to sort of. Um, YOU know,

156
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:45.278
go to, uh, a church for some things, but

157
00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:48.718
they also, uh, might say, uh, be joining a

158
00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:51.348
private Bible study group for another, or they might

159
00:08:51.348 --> 00:08:56.299
be doing some, uh, um, uh, uh, doing some

160
00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:59.629
ritual observance and, uh, a different kind of institution.

161
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.189
Um, AND I think that captures the fact that

162
00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.479
social media and online. Resources have provided people with

163
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.570
ways to link into a much wider range of

164
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.409
providers of religious services than they did before. So

165
00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:17.690
I would say no overall evidence that religiosity as

166
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.210
such is declining, but it is changing shape and

167
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.280
in particular, it's becoming somewhat more mix and match.

168
00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:26.650
But even that isn't. At everywhere. So for example,

169
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.140
in the United States, in spite of what we're

170
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.700
seeing about fewer and fewer people becoming members of

171
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.539
religious institutions, more and more of them are going

172
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:38.700
to these big mega churches where, you know, people

173
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.859
get a whole package of activities together and um

174
00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:47.080
the proportion of. Americans who go to mega churches

175
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.119
has increased by several percentage points over the last

176
00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:53.000
couple of decades, even as the proportion of Americans

177
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.520
saying they belong to a religious, a particular religious

178
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.909
movement has gone down. So the picture is quite

179
00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.010
varied, and I think we have to be very

180
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.960
careful not to overgeneralize from how it looks to

181
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.359
us in our particular corner, you know, if we're

182
00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:08.400
sort of mainline Protestant Americans, then it looks terrible.

183
00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:11.229
It looks as though everybody's becoming less religious. But

184
00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:15.849
you know, if you're a Pentecostalist in Ghanaa or

185
00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:22.590
um or Nigeria or um uh Tanzania or in

186
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:28.099
uh Zimbabwe, or in, um, uh, in the Philippines,

187
00:10:28.469 --> 00:10:32.190
or in Brazil, then it looks very, very different

188
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.900
and it looks much more dynamic to you.

189
00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:39.299
Mhm. What kinds of social roles do religion serve

190
00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:43.229
and what are the kinds of social activities they

191
00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:44.710
are associated with?

192
00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.460
Once again, it's, it's enormously varied, and part of

193
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.369
what has made so many religious movements so dynamic

194
00:10:55.369 --> 00:11:00.760
is that they have, uh, Being able to adapt

195
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.520
to the changing circumstances to their individual in their

196
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.119
individual countries. So, um, an important role that I

197
00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:13.479
think, um, many, particularly Protestant churches play in countries

198
00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:18.469
that are urbanizing rapidly is to offer families a

199
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.679
reassurance that the cities are not going to destroy

200
00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:24.940
the web of family life. So, You know, if

201
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.940
you have, if you're first generation migrant to a

202
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.979
city in Africa or Latin America or Asia from

203
00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:34.539
the countryside, um, one of the things you're gonna

204
00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:37.849
worry a lot about is how you can, well,

205
00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.739
in many cases, first of all find a a

206
00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:42.979
marriage partner if if that hasn't already been arranged

207
00:11:42.979 --> 00:11:46.239
for you by your family, but also. When you

208
00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.000
have children, how are you going to keep your

209
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.809
children from being led astray by gangs, by, uh,

210
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.710
uh, the sort of fragmentation of urban life, by,

211
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.960
uh, what you see as a lack of values

212
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.929
in The modern capitalist economy where people only care

213
00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:06.250
about money and they don't care about greater moral

214
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.090
principles. And so, it's clear that many families are

215
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.609
extremely anxious about this. And one of the things

216
00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:17.005
the churches do, and not, and not just At

217
00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:21.405
the churches, the mosques, the, the temples, um, as

218
00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:25.385
well, they offer families a kind of reassurance that

219
00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:28.344
we will help to keep your family values on

220
00:12:28.344 --> 00:12:32.934
track. Now, of course, family values can can mean

221
00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:36.320
anything, it can mean. Um, THE moral teachings which

222
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.010
keep the family together, but it can also mean

223
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.880
as things as practical as, you know, Sunday school

224
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.900
and, um, uh, sports for the teenagers and youth

225
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.650
clubs and, uh, all of that kind of stuff.

226
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.049
And the successful religious movements managed to do a

227
00:12:53.049 --> 00:12:55.450
lot of those things in a bundled way. So

228
00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.809
they say, yes, there's moral teaching, there's spiritual and

229
00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:05.369
ritual activity, you know. Him singing, uh, prayer, etc.

230
00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:09.880
BUT there's also, you know, sporting activity, um, ways

231
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.030
of bringing the teenagers together in a wholesome environment,

232
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:15.880
so they're not tempted to, uh, go out and

233
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.599
hang around in street corners where they might get

234
00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:20.010
recruited by gangs and so forth. And that's a

235
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.840
tremendously powerful selling point, uh, to, for many religious

236
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.799
movements in countries that are undergoing quite wrenching economic

237
00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:28.530
transformation.

238
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.359
In the book, at a certain point, you talk

239
00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:36.750
about religions as businesses. So, could you explain that

240
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.099
in what ways do religions operate as businesses?

241
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.090
Well, to make a very simple point, Even if

242
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.729
you have the most. Um, REFINED of spiritual messages

243
00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:54.330
that you want to transmit, you have to find

244
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.250
a way to transmit it. I mean, you know,

245
00:13:56.409 --> 00:13:58.409
you can go and stand on a street corner

246
00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:01.530
and preach, but pretty soon in most, uh, places

247
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.849
you'll be moved on. Uh, SO what you need

248
00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:05.989
to do, you need to find a room or

249
00:14:05.989 --> 00:14:08.289
a hall in which to transmit your religious message.

250
00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:11.409
Well, uh, somebody might give you free access to

251
00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:13.690
a garage or something, but if you want to

252
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.840
transmit your religious message to a few other people,

253
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:17.849
then you're going to need to rent a space.

254
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.679
So that means you're going to have enough, um,

255
00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:23.609
revenues to pay the rent on the building in

256
00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:25.210
which you preach and so on. And as soon

257
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.530
as you start getting a little bit active and.

258
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.520
Uh, PEOPLE want to listen to your, uh, spiritual

259
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.989
message, then you'd better get organized, and it can

260
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:37.950
be, uh, as, as banal and ordinary as, uh,

261
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.799
uh, acquiring the resources to pay the rent on

262
00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:43.950
the room in which you hold your Sunday meeting

263
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.469
or your Friday prayers or whatever it might be,

264
00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:50.510
but, um. Uh, THEN, once you try to do

265
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.190
things on a slightly more ambitious scale, you need

266
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.130
a budget, you need, uh, you need logistics, you

267
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.400
need maybe staff, you need, um, uh, you need

268
00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:05.099
everything to manage that activity. And that's not, uh,

269
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:09.320
belittling religious movements. It's just to say that. Since

270
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.960
the dawn of history, we've seen people with inspirational

271
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.489
messages disappear without trace because they didn't have the

272
00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:20.200
logistics to back them up. And every single religious

273
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.270
movement that has succeeded, has succeeded not just because

274
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.960
the founder had an inspiring message, but because they

275
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.840
had the logistics to deliver that message.

276
00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:32.500
So in the book, when trying to tackle the

277
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.419
question, why do religious religious movements take the variety

278
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:41.419
of forms they do, you talk about the business

279
00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:45.820
models of different secular firms and how they apply

280
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.979
to different religious movements. Could you tell us a

281
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:50.020
little bit about that?

282
00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:54.010
OK, well, um, so I think the first thing

283
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.570
to say is that I work a lot with

284
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.580
the idea that religious movements are platforms. Now, uh,

285
00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:02.409
not all secular firms are platforms, but many platforms

286
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:04.849
are secular and not at all religious. But what

287
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:07.849
platforms all have in common is that they create

288
00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:11.530
communities and in particular they create communities that consist

289
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.679
of relationships between two or more. Uh, USERS of

290
00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:18.849
the platform, which would not have been able to,

291
00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:22.330
uh, occur or develop, or at least not to

292
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.609
the same degree in the absence of the platform,

293
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.780
and the benefits that are created by those relationships

294
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:32.114
create some resources. Which the platform can derive its

295
00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:36.424
revenues and its its own ability to, to operate.

296
00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:39.724
Um, NOW, you know, platforms as such have been

297
00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:41.544
around since the dawn of history. I mean, even,

298
00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.474
say people who set up marketplaces on the Silk

299
00:16:44.474 --> 00:16:47.674
Road in the, uh, you know, in the uh

300
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:51.275
in the 14th century, or people who, um, or

301
00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:54.994
matchmakers in a village who would put, uh, you

302
00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:57.755
know, potential families of husbands and families of wives

303
00:16:57.755 --> 00:16:59.849
in touch with each other would take a Uh,

304
00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:03.580
a percentage from the, from the parents or, um,

305
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.310
uh, you know, uh, uh, intermediaries, middlemen who would

306
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.159
put. Um, MERCHANTS in touch with, with other, uh,

307
00:17:13.178 --> 00:17:16.279
other traders, uh, would also take a cut. So

308
00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:19.798
those are platforms in a sense. The, the, uh,

309
00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:23.029
in the modern world, many platforms are digital, uh,

310
00:17:23.038 --> 00:17:26.688
entities, so things like Facebook and Google and Amazon

311
00:17:26.688 --> 00:17:30.558
and so on, all create value by putting different

312
00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:32.558
users together and then they take a certain percentage

313
00:17:32.558 --> 00:17:35.640
of that value. So I use that general model,

314
00:17:35.719 --> 00:17:38.959
but of course, just as there are many different

315
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:41.920
kinds of platforms, so, you know, Amazon is a

316
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.599
massive e-commerce platform, but your local uh Facebook user

317
00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:50.199
group for, I don't know, the people who go

318
00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:54.329
hiking in the woods behind your house uh is

319
00:17:54.329 --> 00:17:56.359
also a platform, and they're very different kinds of

320
00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:01.479
platforms. Um, SO partly I just introduce the reader

321
00:18:01.479 --> 00:18:03.369
in the book to the idea that religious movements,

322
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.560
similar to other platforms can take many different shapes.

323
00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:07.959
They can be very big, they can be very

324
00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:11.599
small, etc. But what I also do is to

325
00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:17.920
take, um, inspiration from the, uh, history of many

326
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.790
different types of secular firm to help us understand

327
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.589
the way in which religious movements are born, grow.

328
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.819
Uh, EXPAND or contract or die, or disappear or

329
00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:31.859
flourish, or whatever. And so, I look at things

330
00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:37.780
like, um, uh, what's the, um, what's the mission

331
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.290
of the movement? I look at what happens when

332
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.260
the founders, uh, disappear, either because they die or

333
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.900
they retire, or they're banished by scandal, or they're

334
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.920
kicked out or whatever. And You know, there's lots

335
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.920
of um interesting parallels with the way that happens

336
00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.719
in secular firms. So most secular firms begin as

337
00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.319
family businesses, and then at some point the founder

338
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.000
moves on, uh, for whatever reason, and then the

339
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
question comes, who takes over from the founder? Is

340
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.359
it going to be a family member of the

341
00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.910
founder, or is it going to be an outsider?

342
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.300
And if so, what's the process for bringing the

343
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.469
outsider in and so on, and how does the

344
00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:21.140
choice between appointing a successor who's a family member

345
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.140
versus a successor who's an outsider, uh, affect the

346
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.819
different strategies of, of the firm. Now, you can

347
00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:29.964
ask all of those questions. ABOUT secular firms, and

348
00:19:29.964 --> 00:19:32.244
there's lots of insight to be had from looking

349
00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:35.665
at the history of secular firms. But then that

350
00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:38.604
turns out to be quite interesting and inspiring for

351
00:19:38.604 --> 00:19:41.604
understanding religious movements because they face exactly the same

352
00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:44.795
constraints at some point, the founder is going to,

353
00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:48.854
uh, is going to fade out. Uh, AGAIN, it

354
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.964
could be that the grim reaper carries them off,

355
00:19:50.974 --> 00:19:53.680
or it could be that. Um, THEY hand over

356
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.959
voluntarily to somebody else, or it could be that,

357
00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:58.640
uh, they're kicked out because of some financial or

358
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.479
sexual scandal or whatever. All sorts of possibilities, but

359
00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:04.920
then the question is what happens next? And time

360
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.040
and again in the history of religious movements, you

361
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.089
see. Um, EITHER that the movement collapses with the

362
00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:13.250
eclipse of the founder because there's nobody else who

363
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.969
can take over, or that the movement goes from

364
00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:18.729
strength to strength, when, as in the history of

365
00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:21.800
Christianity, for example, after the death of the founder,

366
00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:24.089
essentially the movement looked as though it was in

367
00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:28.050
deep trouble until an absolutely brilliant entrepreneur, uh, Saul

368
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.930
of Tarsus, um, took over and uh gave new

369
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.119
dynamism to the movement and took it to the

370
00:20:34.489 --> 00:20:36.640
uh place where it occupies today.

371
00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:41.569
What makes religions, or at least some of them

372
00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:45.319
so successful as cultural institutions?

373
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:52.050
Well, the important point that most distinguishes, I would

374
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:57.079
say, most religious movements from many of their secular

375
00:20:57.329 --> 00:21:02.650
counterparts is that they, Have become successful in part

376
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:08.209
by articulating a vision of the place of their

377
00:21:08.209 --> 00:21:14.439
members' lives in the wider universe. Um, NOW, many,

378
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.199
Individual secular businesses try to do that as well.

379
00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:21.410
So if you think a little bit about, let's

380
00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.890
say, the culture of innovation in Silicon Valley, a

381
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.810
lot of firms that are very innovative, create a

382
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.089
kind of aura around innovation, and people who join

383
00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:34.699
them tend to think of themselves as innovative people

384
00:21:34.699 --> 00:21:37.530
and so innovation is a sort of, uh, as

385
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.209
it were, uh, a, a story that people tell

386
00:21:40.209 --> 00:21:44.170
even around secular businesses. But many other secular businesses.

387
00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:48.239
Aren't really quite so able to articulate that. So

388
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.829
if you think about many of the big platforms,

389
00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:57.540
um. Uh, TAKE a platform like, say, Airbnb or

390
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.989
uh Uber. These are immensely successful platforms, but it's

391
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:05.270
a little difficult to know quite, if, if you're,

392
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.459
say, an Uber driver or if you're a, a,

393
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.930
a, a homeowner who's advertising on. Airbnb, you tend

394
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.339
to kind of think that you're doing your own

395
00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:16.060
thing, you're doing your own life and the platform

396
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.489
is just your sort of logistical tool to help

397
00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:23.020
you. The platform isn't giving you a story of

398
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.140
your life and why what you're doing makes sense

399
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.380
in in a bigger picture. Uh, IT'S kind of

400
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.619
left up to the individual members. Well, in most

401
00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:32.579
religious platforms, it's not like that. Most of the

402
00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:34.939
religious platforms are doing more than that. They're saying

403
00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:38.550
not just. OK, uh, you decide whether you come

404
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.670
to us because you want to find a marriage

405
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.319
partner or whether you want to, uh, uh, have

406
00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:45.930
somebody to send a moral message to your kids

407
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.699
in Sunday school, or whether you want to, um,

408
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.699
spend a lot of time singing in the choir,

409
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.069
or whether you want to, uh, spend your weekends

410
00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:57.369
in the youth club, um. Uh, YOU, you decide

411
00:22:57.369 --> 00:22:59.449
that by yourself and we don't do it. No,

412
00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:03.209
on the contrary, you do want the movement for

413
00:23:03.209 --> 00:23:04.449
all of those things, but at the same time

414
00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:07.729
you want to come together and in Friday prayers

415
00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:11.869
in the mosque or in uh in in uh

416
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.760
uh Sunday uh sermon, you want somebody to tell

417
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.449
you what is this all about. And um. Uh,

418
00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:23.859
SO people are very receptive to a narrative that

419
00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:27.589
fits all of these activities into some wider place

420
00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:30.099
in the universe. And I think that's what has

421
00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:33.949
made religious movements very successful, even if sometimes the

422
00:23:33.949 --> 00:23:36.510
bulk of what they're offering is also being offered

423
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.790
by other secular organizations. It's, it's, as it were,

424
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.900
the packaging that really does it all. I mean,

425
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.589
some secular businesses do it in a different way.

426
00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.849
So if you think about Some of the big

427
00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:53.530
luxury brands like um LVMH or Hermes or something

428
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.900
which are obviously French companies that are have been

429
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.209
fantastically successful. I mean, a lot of what they

430
00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:01.729
do is, you know, they make a lot of

431
00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:05.030
individual things, so LVMH has become particularly well known

432
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.369
for making handbags, and you might say, well, it's

433
00:24:07.369 --> 00:24:09.699
bizarre that they can charge so much for just

434
00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:12.050
a piece of leather that, you know, people stick

435
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.770
their keys and their wallet in. Um, BUT the

436
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.609
reason they can do that is that they have

437
00:24:16.609 --> 00:24:21.660
constructed a whole story around. You know, trade craft,

438
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.010
artisanship, the fact that, you know, when you buy

439
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.290
one of these things, you're in some kind of

440
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.199
mystical way connecting both to the artisans who made

441
00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:34.770
it and also to the group of very select

442
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.729
customers who also bought it and you feel yourself

443
00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:42.439
part of this great flowing river of artisan tradition

444
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.719
and at the same time, global luxury and so

445
00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:46.369
on. I mean, don't ask me because I don't

446
00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:51.160
buy LVMH uh leatherwear, but Um, what I, the

447
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.750
fact that I don't buy it doesn't make me,

448
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:59.150
um, at all. Uh, CYNICAL about or, or, or

449
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.510
mocking of the immense skill with which a company

450
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.630
like ALBMH has constructed this narrative around the products

451
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.660
that they sell, which means that they can sell

452
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.949
them for massive multiples of what it actually costs

453
00:25:10.949 --> 00:25:13.599
them to produce these, these goods. And so I

454
00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:16.550
think, uh, in, in the same way that I'm

455
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.599
not personally religious, um, and I don't think that's

456
00:25:19.599 --> 00:25:22.229
a problem for me in studying this, but that

457
00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:26.390
doesn't make me either cynical about or. Mocking of

458
00:25:26.709 --> 00:25:29.280
the immense skill with which many religious movements have

459
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.160
managed to construct a narrative around the way in

460
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.270
which all of their um activities fit together, which

461
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.319
clearly speaks to very many people. Um, I don't

462
00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:42.079
take the fact that I don't have a particular

463
00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:44.270
place for that in my own life as saying

464
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.829
anything about whether anybody else should, and I am

465
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.319
admiring of the immense skill with which many movements

466
00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:53.829
do construct that story.

467
00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.599
Mhm. So, uh, the question I'm about to ask

468
00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:02.229
you probably also speaks to the success of religions.

469
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.359
What are the individual needs of human beings to

470
00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:08.869
which religious movements speak?

471
00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:15.280
Oh, wow, those are enormously wide. Um, SOMEWHERE in

472
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.000
the book, I, I talk about the fact that

473
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.109
discussion of the psychology of religion has, I think,

474
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:24.949
been rather uh led astray by the fact that

475
00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:28.569
in the 1920s, I think it was, uh, Rudolf

476
00:26:28.569 --> 00:26:32.239
Otto wrote an immensely successful book called Das Heiliger,

477
00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:37.760
the, the Holy. Um, IT'S, uh, um. It's usually

478
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.680
translated as the, the sense of the holy. um,

479
00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:47.089
AND, um, he was speaking, I think, to a

480
00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:53.890
very particular, rather inward-looking Protestant tradition, which identified, um.

481
00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:59.300
Religiosity with a particular sensation that people feel, sort

482
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.760
of, uh, which is kind of or or uh

483
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.000
spelled AWE or um some kind of. Fear or

484
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.949
or terror at the vastness of nature and the

485
00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:15.790
universe. So it's the kind of thing that you

486
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.589
might feel, say if you were out in a

487
00:27:18.589 --> 00:27:21.780
rather wild area of countryside, when you see the,

488
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.469
the sun coming up in the morning, you would

489
00:27:23.469 --> 00:27:26.939
feel, Overwhelmed by and flooded by a sort of

490
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.199
combination of immense respect and love and honestly fear

491
00:27:32.729 --> 00:27:37.969
for the hugeness of the universe in which you

492
00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:42.160
are an insignificant part. Now, I don't want to

493
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.920
in any way belittle. The experience of people who

494
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.359
feel that, I've felt it myself. I don't, again,

495
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.800
it doesn't lead me in a religious direction, but

496
00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:55.319
I don't think that's definitive of um religion, or

497
00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:58.359
it's, is it, I don't think it's the dominant

498
00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:02.439
or even necessarily the, the most important of the

499
00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:05.729
needs that in that religions speak to. It's one

500
00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:08.520
of them. Um, IT'S one of many. Um, THERE

501
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.030
are a lot of people who never feel that,

502
00:28:10.199 --> 00:28:14.579
but who get a huge amount. Of, um, genuine

503
00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:19.780
satisfaction and fulfillment from, say, singing together in, uh,

504
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.229
a community. And, you know, not just singing any

505
00:28:22.229 --> 00:28:26.150
old, old song, but singing specifically devotional and spiritual

506
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.589
songs. There are people who get enormous pleasure from

507
00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:34.239
physical movement, from dancing. From crying out, so a

508
00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:37.280
lot of the Pentecostal movements provide a kind of

509
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.000
legitimating space in which people can really let it

510
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.680
all come out, and they can, they can speak

511
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.920
in tongues, they can shout, they can cry, they

512
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.349
can scream, they can wriggle on the floor, and

513
00:28:48.349 --> 00:28:51.680
that's immensely important for some people, not for others.

514
00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:55.680
I think other people prefer the quiet community of

515
00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:57.680
being with others who are like them, where they

516
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.449
don't necessarily. Have to impress anybody. They don't necessarily

517
00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:05.209
have to be, um, have to be very communicative,

518
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.060
but where they're just aware that there's a quiet

519
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.140
community of contemplative people a bit like them. There

520
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.089
are others who see their religion in a much

521
00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:17.619
more martial spirit. So whether it's jihadis in the

522
00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:20.550
certain radical brands of Islam or whether it's Christian

523
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.550
crusaders in the Middle Ages or whether it's Um,

524
00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:27.829
uh, whether it's, you know, uh, certain kinds of

525
00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:31.790
Hindu nationalists who feel that, uh, you know, your

526
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.000
religion isn't important to you if you're not prepared

527
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.040
to go out and fight for it. Now, I'm

528
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.160
not at the moment passing moral judgments on any

529
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.040
of these particular kinds of things, but if you

530
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.540
ask me what are the needs that people have

531
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.760
to which religion speaks, it's not any one of

532
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.339
those, it's all of them. Um, AND none of

533
00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:51.810
them is particularly privileged. And what makes religious platforms

534
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.849
so successful is that their leaders are very good

535
00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:58.920
at sort of sensing in a particular social situation,

536
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.359
which of those needs are not really being met

537
00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:06.239
by other institutions of modern society.

538
00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:08.969
So let me now ask you a question that

539
00:30:08.969 --> 00:30:12.959
is highly debated among the cognitive scientists of religion

540
00:30:12.959 --> 00:30:16.810
and even scientists of religion more generally. Uh, uh,

541
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.300
I would like to hear your opinion on this.

542
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.670
How has, uh, religion evolved? I mean, is, is

543
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.989
it an adaptation? Is it a byproduct of different

544
00:30:27.989 --> 00:30:32.260
adaptations, or is it a result of cultural evolution,

545
00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:35.069
for example, what is your take on this

546
00:30:35.069 --> 00:30:40.810
question? OK, last question. Um, WE don't absolutely know,

547
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.939
but I think we have some conjectures, and I

548
00:30:42.939 --> 00:30:45.859
devote a whole chapter in the book to setting

549
00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:48.219
out the alternative theories, and I can't summarize them

550
00:30:48.219 --> 00:30:51.300
all here. But what I think I can say

551
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:58.280
with reasonable confidence is that um, Religion has evolved

552
00:30:58.849 --> 00:31:02.290
um in virtually, well, in every society that we

553
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.900
know of. But, and this is very important, it

554
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.739
has not, um, not everybody in those societies, is

555
00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:14.030
religious. So, we have the puzzle that religion is

556
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.459
robustly universal across societies, but it's not robustly universal

557
00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:22.140
within societies. Now, why is that important? Because there

558
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.969
are a lot of features of, um, our human

559
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.520
existence, which are Universal across species and more or

560
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.180
less universal within them. So take our eyes, uh,

561
00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:40.550
some kind of organ for perceiving light and for

562
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:45.430
helping us to navigate with light is, um, pretty

563
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.469
much universal among vertebrates. Um, AND the only cases

564
00:31:50.469 --> 00:31:53.349
where we don't see it is in, say, fish

565
00:31:53.349 --> 00:31:56.430
that live in, uh, caves deep underground where there

566
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.150
is no light. Um. And so we can safely

567
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.310
say, and, and it's also true that, um, obviously

568
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.750
there are certain individuals who are blind, but that's

569
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.390
a huge adaptive handicap for them. OK? So we

570
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.520
can pretty much say, any vertebrate who's trying to

571
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.819
move around, um, needs a light sensing organ, and

572
00:32:17.189 --> 00:32:20.859
nature has found a huge number of. Ways to

573
00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:22.900
natural selection has hit on a huge number of

574
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.579
different designs for light sensing organs to enable us

575
00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:28.339
to do that. So in a certain sense you

576
00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:31.140
can say eyes are universal and they must have

577
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.810
had a huge adaptive advantage. Now there is no

578
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.770
equivalent of the religious eye, that is to say,

579
00:32:37.219 --> 00:32:41.680
there is no. Psychological capacity for sensing the presence

580
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.880
of God or gods, which, like the eye, is

581
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.000
universal across societies and universal in them. Instead, we

582
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.469
have a different, um, Situation in which pretty much

583
00:32:54.469 --> 00:32:59.780
every society has developed some form of religious activity.

584
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.229
But in all societies that we know of, there

585
00:33:03.229 --> 00:33:06.469
are many people who just don't particularly feel the

586
00:33:06.469 --> 00:33:09.910
need for religion. And that suggests that unlike the

587
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.989
case of the individual light sensing eye, where there's

588
00:33:12.989 --> 00:33:17.910
a huge individual advantage to um developing this capacity.

589
00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.979
In the case of religion, there almost certainly isn't

590
00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:24.349
a huge individual advantage that applies to everybody. What

591
00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:27.819
there is instead is a big group advantage to

592
00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:33.910
developing religious activity, and the group then has a

593
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.869
big incentive to try to make sure that the

594
00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:43.369
individuals um conform to that. And um uh uh

595
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.689
uh because it's costly to monitor people, not everybody

596
00:33:47.689 --> 00:33:51.619
is, uh, actually going to conform to that. Only

597
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:54.500
some people and the society is not going to

598
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.890
invest enormous resources into trying to ensure that absolutely

599
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:04.140
everybody has a religious, uh, uh, sensibility or capacity

600
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.099
or preferences or whatever you call it. Um, AND

601
00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:09.820
what therefore happens is that in every society settles

602
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.850
into some kind of what biologists would call, uh,

603
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.659
um, a, a polymorphism in which there are a

604
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.020
number of people, usually a majority who are broadly

605
00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.563
religious, and there's a minority who Not. And depending

606
00:34:23.563 --> 00:34:26.364
on how repressive the society is, the minority either

607
00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:29.324
feel free to acknowledge that they're not particularly interested

608
00:34:29.324 --> 00:34:31.804
in religion, or they have to be keep quiet

609
00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:34.925
about it. But basically, um, the nature of the

610
00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:39.195
religious preferences and the religious sensibility is absolutely not

611
00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:42.310
like the nature of the Uh, for example, the

612
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.668
organ for perceiving light. Now, going on from that,

613
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.659
if that's what you accept as the basic thing

614
00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.830
that's evolved, there's then a whole lot of questions

615
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.629
you can ask about how did it happen? And

616
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:53.708
I would say that there's broadly two schools of

617
00:34:53.708 --> 00:34:58.580
thought on this. One which is um uh characterized

618
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.350
by the work of Aaron Norenza and others like

619
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.189
Joe Henrick on so-called big gods, says that for

620
00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:08.750
some reason that we don't really know, um, Uh,

621
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.000
certain communities began to develop the idea that there

622
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.520
was a God who, uh, sort of looked over

623
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.229
what everybody was doing and made people feel very

624
00:35:19.229 --> 00:35:22.320
guilty if they were not conforming to various kinds

625
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.479
of pro-social norms. And societies which could develop that

626
00:35:26.919 --> 00:35:29.080
became much more cohesive and were able to compete

627
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.820
much more effectively against societies which didn't. Um, NOW,

628
00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:37.300
although it's, I think undeniably true that this idea

629
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.070
of a God who is watching us is present

630
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.479
in many large societies, I don't myself believe the

631
00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:49.030
Noranza and Henriks story about how it happened historically

632
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.320
or prehistorically. Instead, what I think happened was that

633
00:35:52.709 --> 00:35:58.550
small scale societies became big, not through developing. These

634
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.280
big gods, but instead they became big by coercion.

635
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.399
So, um, as soon as you had forager groups

636
00:36:07.399 --> 00:36:10.719
which developed agriculture and could settle down and create

637
00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:13.540
a surplus, basically you can use the surplus to

638
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:20.229
pay people, uh, police, um, mercenaries, whatever, to, uh,

639
00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:24.489
enforce. Uh, DISCIPLINE on your society so that people

640
00:36:24.489 --> 00:36:27.399
do not free ride. People do not cheat in

641
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:33.040
consuming their goods in secret. Instead, they contribute to

642
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.770
the general good. But the problem is that the

643
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:39.209
larger the society gets, the more resource intensive is

644
00:36:39.209 --> 00:36:41.250
it to run a police state. Running a police

645
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.439
state is spectacularly expensive, as we know from, say,

646
00:36:45.689 --> 00:36:48.330
Stalinism in the 1930s that not only do you

647
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.649
have to, or, you know, East Germany and the

648
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.189
Soviet era that not only do you have to

649
00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:55.239
pay a huge number of people to spy on

650
00:36:55.239 --> 00:36:58.070
others, but the knowledge that you're being spied on

651
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.030
by everybody, including your own children, makes everybody pathologically

652
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.229
risk averse and so the society is less dynamic

653
00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:07.399
and less. So instead, what happens is that as

654
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:10.750
societies get big. The leaders start to think, well,

655
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.679
look, rather than just employing enormous numbers of secret

656
00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:17.280
police, wouldn't it be simpler if we employ a

657
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.479
smaller number of priests who can get into people's

658
00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:22.760
heads and say, look, God is watching you, and

659
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.320
if you don't do what your religion prescribes, then

660
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.590
you're going to suffer. And because we know that

661
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.110
people are very prone to suggestion from those in

662
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.239
positions of power, that's sort of how it would

663
00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:41.889
work. So, I would say that um the Noranza's

664
00:37:41.889 --> 00:37:45.729
story about big gods is very good description of

665
00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:51.239
what many large world religions actually, um, uh, preach,

666
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.729
but it's not a good description of how we

667
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:54.449
got to that point.

668
00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:59.570
Mhm. So I've heard the claim many times that

669
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.969
women are on average more religious than men. Is

670
00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:04.570
that true?

671
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.969
It's true, broadly speaking, in Christian countries. It's not

672
00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:15.639
true, broadly speaking in the rest of the world,

673
00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:20.159
and indeed in some countries like Israel or um

674
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.330
in a number of Muslim countries, it's probably the

675
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.969
other way around. But once again, I'd want to

676
00:38:25.969 --> 00:38:30.139
emphasize that a lot depends on what you, uh,

677
00:38:30.169 --> 00:38:32.689
how you are going to define religiosity. If you

678
00:38:32.689 --> 00:38:36.929
define religiosity in terms of private devotion and private

679
00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:40.419
prayer. Then there are many countries in which um

680
00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:44.100
women would probably be as religious or more so

681
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.810
than men. If you define it in terms of

682
00:38:47.169 --> 00:38:51.250
um uh frequency with which they attend services, then

683
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:53.979
men are in many countries much more religious than

684
00:38:53.979 --> 00:38:55.379
women. And of course you can say, well, that's

685
00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:57.780
partly because of restrictions on women's movements and, and

686
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.330
so on. But all of that, um, I think,

687
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.729
uh, makes us reflect on the big point, which

688
00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:07.360
is that. There isn't a single dimension of religiosity.

689
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.409
It's extremely unlikely that uh even if there were.

690
00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:15.030
That it would appeal just to women or just

691
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.790
to men. Um, INSTEAD, there are multiple dimensions of

692
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.909
religiosity. Some of them appeal more to women than

693
00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:22.590
to men, some of them appeal more to men

694
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.469
than to women. And, uh, whether in a particular

695
00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:31.969
country you see men. Engaged more than women in

696
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.610
particular kinds of religious activities or vice versa, it's

697
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.189
going to depend more on particular social characteristics of

698
00:39:39.189 --> 00:39:42.449
that country, including things like restrictions on women's movement

699
00:39:42.449 --> 00:39:45.889
out of doors, um, restrictions on their ability to

700
00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:47.530
gather in the same space as men, and so

701
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.229
on, which are going to be the explanation for

702
00:39:51.229 --> 00:39:53.770
why you see this gender difference rather than some

703
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.330
intrinsic psychological difference between the, the two genders.

704
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:03.620
So why is it that so often religious movements

705
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:09.040
clash over abstruse, very hard to understand and follow

706
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.649
the points of theology and ritual that are hard

707
00:40:13.649 --> 00:40:17.050
for most of their members to understand? Why is

708
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.090
it that something like that happens?

709
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.389
Great question. I think the key to understanding the

710
00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:27.110
answer is to notice that it's very rare for

711
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.919
a religious movement to use its theology as a

712
00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:36.030
recruiting tool. Most, uh, religious movements recruit through other

713
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.709
means. They recruit because they offer a community. They

714
00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:44.229
recruit because they get people excited about the future

715
00:40:44.229 --> 00:40:48.879
of the movement. The theology becomes important to people

716
00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:53.229
once they're inside. So, um, uh, now you may

717
00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:55.989
say, well, still, that's a bit odd. Why, uh,

718
00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:00.469
try to persuade people that, um, a particular theory

719
00:41:00.469 --> 00:41:04.540
of the relationship between Uh, the three persons of

720
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.459
the Holy Trinity is the true one, rather than

721
00:41:07.459 --> 00:41:10.459
some rival theory, which was what, as you would

722
00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:14.040
know very well, led to the council of Nice

723
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.659
in the 4th century, which was, you know, threatening

724
00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:22.719
to split the entire Christian movement. And Um, uh,

725
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.070
the council of NIEA was not sort of trying

726
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.669
to solve a, a doctrinal question like you might

727
00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:32.689
try to, uh, figure out a scientific theory. What

728
00:41:32.689 --> 00:41:34.070
it was really trying to do is a piece

729
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.360
of factional politics to bring um people together who

730
00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:43.419
wanted to be together because they appreciated the community

731
00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:45.510
rather than because they all happened to have been

732
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:49.350
independently convinced of the truth of some rather abstract

733
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.949
piece of, of doctrine. Now, if you ask, why

734
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:56.239
does the doctrine have to be so abstract and

735
00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:58.679
so difficult to comprehend, wouldn't it be simpler to

736
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:01.270
have a simple doctrine? I think the whole point

737
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:05.719
is that it's a little bit like, um, loyalty

738
00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:10.389
programs in, uh, in, I don't know, say, uh,

739
00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:14.120
think about, say, airlines, you know, you, why, why

740
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.800
does an airline, uh, have a loyalty program? Well,

741
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.959
it has a loyalty program in order to stop

742
00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:22.300
you from switching to rivals. So if once you're,

743
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:25.189
uh, you know, once you've taken your first flight

744
00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:28.629
with a particular airline, uh, you're offered the chance

745
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:30.989
to build this up into points. And the whole

746
00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:33.540
thing about the points is that they're going to

747
00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.870
be a disincentive for you to choose a rival

748
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.860
airline for your next flight. So I, I see

749
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.750
a lot of doctrine as having a rather similar

750
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.909
function. It's of course, interesting for people to think

751
00:42:44.909 --> 00:42:48.360
about the nature of God. The nature of the

752
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.669
universe and so on, and to argue about particular

753
00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:54.510
theories of that. But in some sense, it's good

754
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.870
for the movement if the theories you sign up

755
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.590
to as a member, make it unattractive for you

756
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.270
to join a rival movement. So, think about, say,

757
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.270
the doctrine of um transubstantiation in Roman Catholicism, which

758
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.459
is the doctrine that the, in the, the, uh,

759
00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:16.169
the Eucharist, the. The wine and the, and the

760
00:43:16.169 --> 00:43:19.659
bread are transformed into the, literally not figuratively into

761
00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:22.879
the body and blood of Jesus. Well, now, um,

762
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.780
if you're really become convinced of that, it's kind

763
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.620
of hard to become a Protestant, uh, because the

764
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.729
Protestants. Deny that. And if that's become an important

765
00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:36.520
part of your relationship to the ritual you undertake,

766
00:43:36.729 --> 00:43:38.810
you're going to find it just less attractive to

767
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.889
become a Protestant. But of course there's a trade-off

768
00:43:40.889 --> 00:43:43.239
because of course the less believable the doctrine is,

769
00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:45.060
the more people are going to say, well, I

770
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.409
can't really believe that, so I'm maybe I should

771
00:43:47.409 --> 00:43:49.090
go to a church that isn't going to want

772
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.129
me to do that. And there, of course, you

773
00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.760
know, a lot of history of people who've left

774
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.250
the Roman Catholic Church because they couldn't believe doctrines.

775
00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.159
Like that. But the fact of the matter is

776
00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:01.840
that, I mean, the, I cite in the book

777
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.120
that a survey by the Pew Research Trust which

778
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.560
shows that in the US, roughly speaking, 1/3 of

779
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.439
Catholics believe transubstantiation, 2/3 don't. And that's interesting for

780
00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:15.679
two reasons. One is, it's interesting that 13 do

781
00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:18.760
believe it, given that nobody who's not a Catholic

782
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.340
would even consider that a believable theory. But it's

783
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.820
also interesting because 2/3 of Catholics seem to be

784
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.219
perfectly happy not to believe it. And so, it's

785
00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:31.379
part of, if you like, the, it's, it's a

786
00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:34.219
feature not a bug of the movement that it

787
00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:39.340
can. Contain doctrines that clearly appeal enormously to a

788
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.560
subset of their members, while not using those doctrines

789
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.020
as a, as a uh as a reason for

790
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.820
the others of their members to be forced to

791
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.169
leave.

792
00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.159
So talking about how different religions and religious movements

793
00:44:55.159 --> 00:45:00.239
organize themselves, how is it that some religious movements

794
00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:07.570
like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even Protestant Christianity maintain

795
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.560
fidelity or maintain the fidelity of their members to

796
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.800
their practices and rituals in the absence of centralized

797
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.469
authorities.

798
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.969
No, that's a great question and um I think

799
00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:25.290
the important answer is through the community of believers.

800
00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:29.580
Now, um, uh, a lot depends on whether you're

801
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.169
talking about the religions of the book or not.

802
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.949
So, let's look first at Protestant Christianity and Islam.

803
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.879
Um, AS you rightly say, There's no equivalent of

804
00:45:40.879 --> 00:45:44.360
the Pope in either of these, uh, in either

805
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.800
of these world religions. And so, you know, there's

806
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.590
no way in which people could be excommunicated by

807
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.959
the equivalent of the Pope for not believing in

808
00:45:55.959 --> 00:46:00.560
the doctrine. But People are still excommunicated in these

809
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.550
communities all the time. I mean, you know, uh,

810
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.040
uh, Muslim imams are constantly pronouncing fatwas and threats

811
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.199
of excommunication against uh other Muslims they think have

812
00:46:13.199 --> 00:46:18.080
the wrong beliefs. Um, Protestants are constantly, um, pronouncing

813
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.070
equivalent to excommunication against people they think have the,

814
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.320
the false beliefs and so on. But, um, the

815
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.530
point is that if you don't, um, Uh, accept

816
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.370
the doctrines of the particular movement, you can just

817
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.209
go and join another. And so, what keeps the

818
00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:37.600
fidelity is, first of all, the fact that there

819
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.760
is a text to which people make reference. Now,

820
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:45.090
both the Quran and the Bible are enormous bodies

821
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.320
of text. So it's actually pretty easy to Uh,

822
00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:54.590
turn to either of those, uh, books to, um,

823
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.409
support the particular interpretation you've got. So, I don't

824
00:46:57.409 --> 00:47:00.679
know, the question of, um, let's take stuff that

825
00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:05.000
is, uh, not in the, the, the Quran like,

826
00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.260
um, uh, wearing the veil. um. There's no specific

827
00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.139
verse in the Quran that makes it essential for

828
00:47:13.139 --> 00:47:15.139
women to wear the veil. There's lots of stuff

829
00:47:15.139 --> 00:47:17.699
about women being modest and so on, and so

830
00:47:17.699 --> 00:47:20.780
people who support the wearing the veil say, well,

831
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.820
the verses in the Quran that are about women's

832
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.780
modesty are best interpreted in terms of their obligation

833
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:30.010
to wear the veil. Similarly, you know, in Christianity.

834
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:34.040
There's no, I mean, the whole idea that priests

835
00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.429
in Roman Catholicism should be unmarried is not supported

836
00:47:37.429 --> 00:47:41.169
by anything in the Bible. Um, uh, THAT was

837
00:47:41.169 --> 00:47:43.399
a piece of doctrine that was bolted on afterwards,

838
00:47:43.729 --> 00:47:47.169
uh, by the Catholic Church. But for that very

839
00:47:47.169 --> 00:47:51.000
reason, Protestants don't think that's a big deal. Um,

840
00:47:51.129 --> 00:47:56.520
BUT things like, you know, um, Attitudes to homosexuality.

841
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.489
Well, there are some horrendous verses in the Bible

842
00:47:59.489 --> 00:48:02.250
in the Old Testament about how you should kill

843
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:06.120
people who are homosexual. Take Leviticus's book 20. Most

844
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.129
modern Christians conveniently ignore those, not everywhere. I mean,

845
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.689
in countries like Uganda where there is a vicious

846
00:48:13.689 --> 00:48:17.969
uh intolerance of homosexuality, people do appeal to verses

847
00:48:17.969 --> 00:48:22.010
like to books like Leviticus 20. But, you know,

848
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.830
in most sensible countries, they don't. And so, um,

849
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.520
uh, everybody kind of glosses over that part of

850
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.120
the Old Testament, and they kind of justify it

851
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.800
by saying, well, there's nothing really in the New

852
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.919
Testament against it. So, uh, you know, we should

853
00:48:36.919 --> 00:48:38.919
assume that the New Testament is a kind of

854
00:48:38.919 --> 00:48:42.000
improvement on the Old Testament. Um, ALL of that

855
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.709
is to say that essentially, um, there's no way

856
00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:51.590
in those traditions to, um, Determine what's authentic without

857
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.399
ambiguity. So instead, authenticity is determined really by a

858
00:48:57.399 --> 00:49:00.629
vote of the faithful. I mean, if a particular

859
00:49:00.959 --> 00:49:04.800
pastor is preaching stuff that everybody in their congregation

860
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.030
thinks is incompatible with the Bible, people will leave.

861
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.360
And so, um, you know, a pastor takes care

862
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.540
to try and uh use. Copious verses from the

863
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.739
Bible to support their particular interpretation. Although, as I've

864
00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:22.679
already said, um, you can use verses from the

865
00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:26.270
survival from the Bible to support many different interpretations.

866
00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.790
Now if you look at things like Hinduism and

867
00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.489
Uh, and Buddhism, where there aren't any sort of

868
00:49:33.489 --> 00:49:37.939
authoritative central texts in the same way, then, um,

869
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.219
it's even more true that people, that, that in

870
00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:44.020
some sense authenticity is enforced just simply by the

871
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.699
vote of the people. Um, IF a particular, uh,

872
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.820
individual is, um, say, running a temple and they

873
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.949
do things that are not recognizable as the set

874
00:49:56.949 --> 00:49:59.870
of rights, the puja, which You know, the Hindu

875
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:03.219
faithful are used to undertaking, then people will just

876
00:50:03.219 --> 00:50:05.429
go. But of course, there are, there's a huge

877
00:50:05.429 --> 00:50:10.260
range of different types of Hindu, um, uh, movement.

878
00:50:10.469 --> 00:50:13.550
There are, you know, traditional temples, there are ashrams,

879
00:50:13.629 --> 00:50:16.830
there are, uh, yoga movements. There are, you know,

880
00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:19.649
Hinduism is, is a vast and varied kind of

881
00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:22.270
movement and on the whole, it's different strokes for

882
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.669
different folks and people pick and choose. At what

883
00:50:24.669 --> 00:50:26.949
point do you want to say that the movement

884
00:50:26.949 --> 00:50:31.830
has become so Uh, removed from original authentic Hinduism

885
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.350
that it's no longer Hindu. I don't know, but

886
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.110
I don't have a horse in this race, and

887
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.320
what I can tell you is that people have

888
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.419
been arguing over that since the dawn of Hinduism.

889
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.310
So, did, you know, Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh, was he

890
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.510
a Hindu? Well, lots of, lots of Hindus would

891
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.350
say he wasn't. Um, HE was just a charlatan

892
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.629
who, um, you know, preyed on people who had

893
00:50:52.629 --> 00:50:55.750
rather vague and fuzzy ideas of Hinduism. But others

894
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.139
would say, no, he was. I mean, you know,

895
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.360
he may have engaged in various kinds of unacceptable

896
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.209
sexual abuse, but uh there was nothing un Hindu

897
00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:08.120
about the message that he was preaching.

898
00:51:08.909 --> 00:51:13.810
Mhm. What is the relationship between religious power and

899
00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:19.379
political power and are religion, religious institutions ever not

900
00:51:19.379 --> 00:51:19.979
political?

901
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.570
Well, there are clearly some religious institutions that try

902
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.270
to stay out of party politics. And I would

903
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:31.340
say also that, um, particularly in the modern world,

904
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:35.850
many kinds of religious movements have sought to be

905
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:42.350
broadly speaking, politically neutral. So, um, Uh, you know,

906
00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:45.429
I would say that the Roman Catholic Church in

907
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.830
some countries, and in particular this was true, I

908
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:52.060
think, of the United States, um. Did try to

909
00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.020
cater to people from all parts of the political

910
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.330
spectrum. Now, that didn't mean that, that didn't mean

911
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:03.860
that all Catholic churches in the US were politically,

912
00:52:03.989 --> 00:52:07.870
all individual Catholic churches were individually politically neutral, because,

913
00:52:07.919 --> 00:52:12.209
you know, if you were, say, um, A Catholic

914
00:52:12.209 --> 00:52:17.159
Church in Boston or in Chicago, you would have

915
00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:22.360
overwhelmingly people from, uh, say, Ireland, um, who would

916
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.969
be, um, for a large part of the 19th

917
00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:31.820
and 20th centuries, would have been relatively poor. Uh,

918
00:52:31.889 --> 00:52:35.060
WORKING class, they, and so the church would have

919
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.699
tended to be, um, on the left of the

920
00:52:38.699 --> 00:52:40.860
political spectrum, but it wasn't very active or very

921
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.100
vocal on that end of the political spectrum. And

922
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.860
other Catholic churches in more upscale neighborhoods would tend

923
00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.139
to be somewhat on the right, and that would

924
00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:51.540
kind of balance out as a whole. Um, uh,

925
00:52:51.879 --> 00:52:55.449
SIMILARLY, I, I use the example of Poland, where

926
00:52:55.449 --> 00:52:59.260
in the, in the communist era, the Polish Church

927
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.409
was to some extent, Anti-communist. But it was also

928
00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:07.090
much more importantly, a source of support for um

929
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:11.449
people, whoever they were, whether they were very, you

930
00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:14.889
know, intense Catholics, very fervent Catholics, or rather milder

931
00:53:14.889 --> 00:53:19.969
Catholics, whether they were rich or poor, if they

932
00:53:19.969 --> 00:53:23.800
were, um, in any sense threatened by the regime,

933
00:53:24.169 --> 00:53:26.840
then the church was supporting them. So, the church

934
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.870
was very broad-based and not very politically partisan. But,

935
00:53:32.189 --> 00:53:36.620
um, what's happened in both in the United States

936
00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:40.389
and in Poland in the last half century has

937
00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:43.659
been actually a bit longer than that in, in

938
00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:46.469
the United States, is that the churches have become

939
00:53:46.469 --> 00:53:50.419
much more visibly partisan. Um, IN Poland, because after

940
00:53:50.419 --> 00:53:52.959
the fall of communism, there was a huge surge

941
00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:57.729
in support for Catholicism and legitimacy of Catholicism and

942
00:53:57.729 --> 00:54:01.959
the Catholic Church, very unwisely in my view. Decided

943
00:54:01.959 --> 00:54:03.679
that it was going to use that new source

944
00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:07.429
of legitimacy to pursue the political agenda of a

945
00:54:07.429 --> 00:54:13.520
particular rather narrow class of very conservative priests who

946
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:18.639
then essentially teamed up in coalition with um a

947
00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:21.080
very right wing part of the political spectrum. And

948
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.040
that I think has hurt the legitimacy of the

949
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.520
Catholic Church in Poland quite a lot. In the

950
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.459
United States, it was more complicated because Um, the

951
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:35.060
movement of, uh, in particular, American Protestantism, away from

952
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:39.020
broad political neutrality, began not with the growth of

953
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.389
evangelical right wing movements, but much earlier in the

954
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.750
interwar years when mainstream Protestantism, which had been kind

955
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:54.649
of Socially rather conservative, but, but not. Associated very

956
00:54:54.649 --> 00:54:58.570
strongly with political conservatism, um, began to move in

957
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.629
a liberal direction, partly as a result of the

958
00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:04.689
Uh, sending of many missionaries to other parts of

959
00:55:04.689 --> 00:55:07.729
the world where they came back with a, a

960
00:55:07.729 --> 00:55:11.010
new awareness of injustices in their own society, and

961
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:15.129
also the many injustices uh raised by the relationship

962
00:55:15.129 --> 00:55:17.570
of uh rich countries to poor countries in the

963
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.770
world. And so, many of the, of the leaders

964
00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:24.270
of the Protestant movements began to move leftward, uh,

965
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.929
trying to agitate for civil rights and so on

966
00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:30.429
in the. In, in the US and that very

967
00:55:30.429 --> 00:55:33.629
much appealed to some part of their members, but

968
00:55:33.629 --> 00:55:35.429
many of their other members who were more conservative,

969
00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:36.870
were not very happy about this at all, and

970
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:40.189
that was part of what prompted the movement out

971
00:55:40.189 --> 00:55:44.629
of the uh mainstream Protestant churches to the evangelical

972
00:55:44.629 --> 00:55:47.620
movement, which was much more happy accommodating people who

973
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:52.550
were politically conservative. And so, in other words, in

974
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:58.070
other words, there have been, um, Periods in history

975
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:02.679
where, um, religious movements have been quite careful to

976
00:56:03.149 --> 00:56:07.510
try to remain relatively broad based in their political

977
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.340
alignment, and other periods where they've been much more,

978
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:15.949
um, uh, let's say, focused in, in aligning themselves

979
00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:19.540
with one or other political faction. Now, for most

980
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.229
of human history, until I would say, uh, the

981
00:56:23.229 --> 00:56:31.540
Reformation, um. Most uh uh rulers were, you know,

982
00:56:31.699 --> 00:56:36.379
had their, um their religious leaders to support them.

983
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.020
So whether it was Islamic rulers who would get

984
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.739
their, uh, favorite imams to speak up on their

985
00:56:42.739 --> 00:56:46.290
behalf, or whether it was, um, you know, uh,

986
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.479
Holy Roman emperors who would try to get the,

987
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.100
the popes on board. Um, BUT of course it

988
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.020
didn't always work because, you know, sometimes, as we

989
00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.419
know from the periods in Europe when there were

990
00:56:55.419 --> 00:56:59.669
rival popes, um, uh, the, or where the Holy

991
00:56:59.669 --> 00:57:02.459
Roman Emperor would be excommunicated by the Pope for

992
00:57:02.459 --> 00:57:06.739
some reason, um, sometimes the alliance broke down. Similarly,

993
00:57:07.389 --> 00:57:10.250
Um, in Islam, I mean, it's been widely documented

994
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:14.250
by people like Timouran and Jared Rubin and um

995
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.250
Eric Cheney that, um, you know, Muslim rulers would

996
00:57:18.489 --> 00:57:22.129
have their tame imams who tried to, uh, support

997
00:57:22.129 --> 00:57:24.830
what they were doing, um, but then, You know,

998
00:57:24.919 --> 00:57:27.479
any other imam could come and say, no, this

999
00:57:27.479 --> 00:57:29.479
ruler is a tyrant, and you shouldn't listen to

1000
00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.199
them, and you shouldn't listen to their corrupt imams

1001
00:57:32.199 --> 00:57:35.040
who are just supporting what the rulers are saying,

1002
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:38.000
you should listen to me. And so you would

1003
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.889
have a great deal of turbulence. And in fact,

1004
00:57:40.979 --> 00:57:45.959
um, So Jean-Philippe Plateau and Emmanuel Laurel, my Toulous's

1005
00:57:45.959 --> 00:57:48.860
colleague, have, have done a lot of interesting work.

1006
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.760
Jean Philippe has a book called Instrumentalising Islam, in

1007
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.679
which he, he talks about the way in which

1008
00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:59.679
rulers have constantly tried to gain legitimacy by bringing

1009
00:57:59.679 --> 00:58:01.280
rulers on board, except that they can always be

1010
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.199
undercut by new rulers, but sorry, by new religious

1011
00:58:04.199 --> 00:58:06.520
leaders who point to the way in which the

1012
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.659
old religious leaders have. Um, BECOME corrupt by associating

1013
00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:13.060
with the political power and then say, no, you

1014
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.139
should listen to me because I'm the the true

1015
00:58:15.139 --> 00:58:17.939
authentic uncorrupt version. So, I mean, there's this kind

1016
00:58:17.939 --> 00:58:20.699
of dance between religious power and political power been

1017
00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:24.379
going on forever. And I do say quite strongly

1018
00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:27.989
in the book that I think particularly with More

1019
00:58:27.989 --> 00:58:33.750
educated publics with um uh the spread of democratic

1020
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.459
spirit in the world, even if it's not necessarily

1021
00:58:35.459 --> 00:58:40.399
democratic institutions, it's actually quite dangerous for religious leaders

1022
00:58:40.629 --> 00:58:42.989
to sell out to political leaders because it may

1023
00:58:42.989 --> 00:58:44.830
be in their interests in the short run, but

1024
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.989
in the longer run, they risk losing legitimacy in

1025
00:58:47.989 --> 00:58:48.580
a big way.

1026
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.340
So let me ask you now about the worry

1027
00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:56.969
that many people express, particularly, for example, in the

1028
00:58:56.969 --> 00:59:00.899
US but also in other places. Is it possible

1029
00:59:00.899 --> 00:59:05.300
that religion could provide what is needed for a

1030
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:11.580
successful authoritarian backlash against the sort of hard-won gains

1031
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:14.820
of the last two centuries when it comes to

1032
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:20.129
equality, democracy, and freedom and rights for minorities?

1033
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.770
Well, we're certainly seeing many authoritarian leaders trying to

1034
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:29.050
do this. And, um, this is true not just

1035
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:34.320
of leaders like say, President Erdogan of Turkey who,

1036
00:59:34.689 --> 00:59:40.280
um, was a very, uh, how can I put

1037
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:46.239
it? I think authentically pious individual early in his

1038
00:59:46.239 --> 00:59:49.080
career when he was mayor of Istanbul. His personal

1039
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.820
piety was very important, even though Turkey, uh, was,

1040
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:57.520
is a secular state. Um, AND in the early

1041
00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.699
years of, uh, Erdogan's, uh, prime ministership, he became

1042
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.070
known, I think, as Uh, somebody who, although personally

1043
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.350
pious, did not try to leverage that into a

1044
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:12.909
source of, you know, he was apparently on board

1045
01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.629
with the, the, the secular state concept in Turkey.

1046
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.870
And of course, that began to change and has

1047
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.270
become um been radically overturned in recent years when

1048
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:28.379
he's, I think, rather. Um, DRASTICALLY, uh, reversed course

1049
01:00:28.379 --> 01:00:32.260
on his earlier pitch and has really tried to,

1050
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:38.810
uh, associate his regime with authentic Islam. Um, SOMETHING

1051
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.120
a little bit similar has happened in India, where,

1052
01:00:41.689 --> 01:00:47.959
uh, Narendra Modi was originally formed in the very,

1053
01:00:48.129 --> 01:00:53.550
uh, radical religious movement, the RSS, um, but. Sort

1054
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.840
of shape shifted as he became governor of Gujarat

1055
01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.469
to being apparently a technocrat who was interested in

1056
01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:05.949
launching Gujarat onto a kind of um innovative, modern

1057
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:13.719
technocratic economy. And since, uh, his, he has consolidated

1058
01:01:13.719 --> 01:01:19.120
his, uh, increasingly authoritarian regime has played, uh, more

1059
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.040
and more strongly and loudly to the Hindu nationalist.

1060
01:01:23.409 --> 01:01:28.520
Uh, MOVEMENT, um, and particularly saying that essentially, India

1061
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.929
is a Hindu country instead of what was always

1062
01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:37.080
understood under the post, uh, independence framework, as India

1063
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.959
being a, uh, let's say a comprehensive, open, secular

1064
01:01:40.959 --> 01:01:44.399
country in which Hindus are, have a very special

1065
01:01:44.399 --> 01:01:50.739
place. Um, NOW, in some cases, clearly, as in

1066
01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:54.649
President Trump in America, Uh, President Xi Jinping in

1067
01:01:54.649 --> 01:01:58.570
China, uh, President Putin in Russia, you have people

1068
01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:02.719
who have absolutely zero track record as being pious

1069
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.850
themselves, who have, I think, shamelessly been playing the

1070
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.320
religious card. It's a bit different in China where

1071
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.530
I think the Chinese regime's support for Buddhism is

1072
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:16.290
based on fear of, they have a sort of

1073
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:19.169
theory that this kind of Good Buddhism and bad

1074
01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:22.729
Buddhism, and Bad Buddhism is what prompts sec separatism

1075
01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:26.239
in Xinjiang and in in Tibet. Good Buddhism is

1076
01:02:26.239 --> 01:02:28.679
sort of the other kind. And so they're pro

1077
01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:31.639
they're trying to prop up what they see as

1078
01:02:31.639 --> 01:02:34.360
good Buddhism. But I don't think they're trying to

1079
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.229
say that every Chinese citizen should be a Buddhist,

1080
01:02:37.399 --> 01:02:41.360
whereas clearly in the case of Russia, um, they're

1081
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.969
trying to say that the Russian Orthodox Church should

1082
01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:47.070
be. Uh, THE, the source of authority, moral authority

1083
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.899
for every Russian citizen, and the fact that the

1084
01:02:50.469 --> 01:02:55.939
patriarch of the Russian Church has been outrageously supporting

1085
01:02:55.939 --> 01:03:01.989
the aggression and war of Russia against Ukraine is,

1086
01:03:02.389 --> 01:03:05.129
is part of what Putin hopes to get out

1087
01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:07.790
of that. In, in the US it's a sort

1088
01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:12.110
of rather bizarre and slightly surreal sight of an

1089
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:16.270
individual who was never remotely. Uh PIOUS himself, and

1090
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:20.909
indeed who, whose lists of sins, um, you know,

1091
01:03:20.949 --> 01:03:23.510
dwarf those of what would have been considered acceptable

1092
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:27.189
under any previous presidency has been taken up by

1093
01:03:27.189 --> 01:03:31.129
the religious right as a, as sort of the,

1094
01:03:31.149 --> 01:03:35.570
the instrument to save the country from godless atheism.

1095
01:03:35.639 --> 01:03:39.310
I mean, it's like so many things about the

1096
01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:42.030
Trump presidency would be hilarious if it weren't so.

1097
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.169
Uh, uh, SCARY. Um, I mean, let's not get

1098
01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:48.330
into that, but the point is, I think you

1099
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.850
can say that what's happened in the US is

1100
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:54.790
just like a, an extreme version of a tendency

1101
01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:57.570
that's true in many, many other countries in the

1102
01:03:57.570 --> 01:04:00.810
world. Now, is that gonna work? Well, you know,

1103
01:04:00.889 --> 01:04:04.050
we, we are seeing in Iran, I think, that

1104
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:10.169
increasing loss of legitimacy, not just of The regime

1105
01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:14.080
But importantly of the religious leaders who lent their

1106
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.389
support to the regime. And that suggests that, you

1107
01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:20.350
know, the people can be fooled for quite a

1108
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.750
long time, but they can't be fooled forever. And

1109
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:29.350
the more partisan is the message that the religious

1110
01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:34.550
leaders, uh, send, the, uh, bigger the cost of

1111
01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:36.939
their legitimacy in the long run. The problem is

1112
01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.429
that it may take a long time, and we

1113
01:04:38.429 --> 01:04:42.469
don't know whether the backlash uh to the legitimacy

1114
01:04:42.469 --> 01:04:45.850
of the Russian Orthodox Church. Of the Christian religious

1115
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:50.090
right in the United States, of um some of

1116
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.969
the Buddhists, the mainstream Buddhists in China, and so

1117
01:04:53.969 --> 01:04:56.989
on. We don't know whether that's that backlash is

1118
01:04:56.989 --> 01:05:01.120
going to happen fast or slowly or somewhere in

1119
01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.370
between. That's, I think, the big unknown question. So,

1120
01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:08.010
um, there will be a backlash. Um, IN the

1121
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.260
meantime, the politicians do benefit from some of the

1122
01:05:12.679 --> 01:05:17.639
Uh, the, the sort of the authoritarian messaging that

1123
01:05:17.639 --> 01:05:21.800
the religious movements send, um, and we don't really

1124
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.879
know whether the short-term advantage they gain out of

1125
01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.879
that, how long that will last before the backlash

1126
01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:29.209
really, uh, comes into effect.

1127
01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:32.580
So I think we have time for 2 more

1128
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.379
questions. So let me ask you now, how do

1129
01:05:35.379 --> 01:05:38.379
you look at the future of religion? Do you

1130
01:05:38.379 --> 01:05:42.179
see any particular trends when it comes to religiosity

1131
01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:43.300
and secularism?

1132
01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:49.070
Well, um, uh, it's a long, uh, it's a,

1133
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.620
there are many, many things you could say about

1134
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.860
that. I think the important point to notice is

1135
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.699
that religion is going to change and adapt. It

1136
01:05:56.699 --> 01:06:00.020
always has. OK. So when people say, I can't

1137
01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.340
believe that religion in its current form is really

1138
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.580
adapted to the changes of the challenges of the

1139
01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.129
21st century, they are of course right. But that

1140
01:06:08.129 --> 01:06:11.969
doesn't mean religion's going to disappear. It all depends

1141
01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.649
on whether and how religion can shift shape and

1142
01:06:14.649 --> 01:06:17.610
adapt to those challenges. So, in the 19th century,

1143
01:06:17.649 --> 01:06:21.540
people like James Fraser and in the early 20th

1144
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:26.250
century, um Max Weber and Emile Durkheim and so

1145
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:30.010
on, looks at, um, traditional religion as they'd seen

1146
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.489
it, and, uh, quite rightly, I think, said this

1147
01:06:34.489 --> 01:06:37.590
kind of traditional religion is not well adapted. To

1148
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:39.790
the challenges of the 20th century. Now some of

1149
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.750
them went further than others, claiming that it was

1150
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.500
going to disappear. But even Fraser and Durkheimer and

1151
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:48.629
and Weber, I don't think, predicted that religion would

1152
01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:50.709
die out. What they simply said is that it's

1153
01:06:50.709 --> 01:06:53.739
going to change shape. And whether it changes shape

1154
01:06:53.739 --> 01:06:56.540
in the sense of retreating into a much smaller

1155
01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.350
phenomenon in society, or whether it takes a very

1156
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:02.250
different shape altogether is, is hard to, it's hard

1157
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.110
to predict at any one moment. But let's say

1158
01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.550
religion. Um, IS going to adapt, as it always

1159
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.360
has. So, in the book, I give the analogy

1160
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.149
between the Reformation and the invention of printing, which

1161
01:07:15.149 --> 01:07:17.750
led to a huge increase in competition between religious

1162
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:21.280
movements. I think that the growth of, um, social

1163
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.804
media, excuse me, the growth of social media. Artificial

1164
01:07:24.804 --> 01:07:26.915
intelligence, and so on are going to be as

1165
01:07:26.915 --> 01:07:29.165
radical, if not more so, as the invention of

1166
01:07:29.165 --> 01:07:31.004
printing was. They're going to see, it's going to

1167
01:07:31.004 --> 01:07:33.725
see a huge increase in types of religious message

1168
01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:38.004
and competition between religious movements and churn of people

1169
01:07:38.004 --> 01:07:40.834
who leave some movements, join others, and so on.

1170
01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:43.445
I very much doubt religion will disappear, but I

1171
01:07:43.445 --> 01:07:46.614
do think it will look somewhat different in 30

1172
01:07:46.614 --> 01:07:48.155
years' time from what it does today.

1173
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.639
OK, so one last question then. Are there ways

1174
01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:55.879
we can use religious power to manage it for

1175
01:07:55.879 --> 01:07:59.209
the good of everyone, including the non-religious?

1176
01:08:00.699 --> 01:08:03.520
I do think so. It's a big project, but

1177
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.709
I would say, here's a start. At the moment

1178
01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:10.290
in um. Most countries in the world, in fact,

1179
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:15.689
I can't think of an exception, um, religious movements

1180
01:08:16.049 --> 01:08:18.500
do not necessarily have to pay any tax that,

1181
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:22.339
uh, so, you know, I can go out uh

1182
01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:26.129
into a city and I can rent a, a

1183
01:08:26.129 --> 01:08:29.410
small building and I can. Open it up to

1184
01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.649
the public and I can say, uh, come in

1185
01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.689
and this is my church. Now, normally if I

1186
01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:37.490
do that trying to sell something, then I may

1187
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.879
be kicked out if I haven't satisfied the registration

1188
01:08:40.879 --> 01:08:44.000
requirements, but at the very least, if people start

1189
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.930
paying me money because I sell them ballpoint pens

1190
01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:51.569
or iPhones or whatever, I will either have to.

1191
01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:54.660
Set up as a company, or I will be

1192
01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.379
expected to pay personal income tax on those, on

1193
01:08:57.379 --> 01:08:59.750
those earnings, and personal income tax is much higher

1194
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.899
than corporate income tax. So I have a pretty

1195
01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:06.899
strong incentive to um register as a company in

1196
01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.779
order to be able to deduct my expenses and

1197
01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.660
so forth and not have to pay personal income

1198
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.819
tax on all my revenues. The weird thing is

1199
01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:16.819
that in the United States, for example, the exception

1200
01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.850
to that is if I'm running a church. Because,

1201
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.930
um, uh, if I just say. I'm offering a

1202
01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:27.810
set of spiritual services and I'm the Seabright Salvation

1203
01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:32.209
Ministry. Um, IN principle, I don't, not only don't

1204
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.089
have to pay any taxes, but I don't have

1205
01:09:34.089 --> 01:09:35.810
to declare any accounts. I don't have to give

1206
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.129
any account. And the only thing that would stop

1207
01:09:38.129 --> 01:09:40.689
me from doing that is if the IRS launches

1208
01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:42.930
an investigation into me, which it might do if

1209
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.799
it has a tip off, a reliable tip off,

1210
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.370
but if not, I could get away with it

1211
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:53.509
for years. So, um. What I think is reasonable

1212
01:09:53.509 --> 01:09:57.319
is that religious movements should be constrained as ordinary

1213
01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:59.759
charities are. That is to say, if they can

1214
01:09:59.759 --> 01:10:02.439
make a case for being a charity for not

1215
01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:06.200
paying taxes, they should do so. But importantly, in

1216
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.259
return for that, they should have to publish accounts

1217
01:10:09.479 --> 01:10:12.240
and with some information that enables people to make

1218
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.720
sense of those accounts. That is not required in

1219
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.759
the United States. It's not required in a very

1220
01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:19.319
large number of countries around the world. That seems

1221
01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:23.899
to me. Um, UNREASONABLE. And furthermore, I think that

1222
01:10:23.899 --> 01:10:27.470
if you look at things like abuse within churches

1223
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:29.950
and so on, that is facilitated by a culture

1224
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:33.160
in which it's accepted that religious leaders should not

1225
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.209
have to, um, Give account for their activities to

1226
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:42.859
anybody else. Um, SO what I would suggest is

1227
01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:47.899
that, By breaking the presumption that what religious leaders

1228
01:10:47.899 --> 01:10:49.979
do is only their business and not the business

1229
01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:53.129
of the rest of society, we could reach a

1230
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:58.620
uh better equilibrium in which religions are considered as

1231
01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:02.009
legitimate businesses, but in return for being legitimate businesses,

1232
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.620
they should publish accounts, they should be subject to

1233
01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.140
basic legal provisions on the way they treat their

1234
01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:12.390
members. And um it should be understood that. In

1235
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.229
return for the privilege of being able to seek

1236
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:16.580
money and other resources from members of the public,

1237
01:11:17.029 --> 01:11:19.549
they have a duty to account for what they

1238
01:11:19.549 --> 01:11:21.419
do in return. We're a long way from that,

1239
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:23.589
but I think that doing that would be a

1240
01:11:23.589 --> 01:11:26.910
tremendous step forward and would benefit religious movements and

1241
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.060
their members, as well as the rest of society.

1242
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.134
So, the book is again the divine. Economy, how

1243
01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:37.694
religions compete for wealth, power, and people. Of course

1244
01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:39.895
I'm leaving a leaked tweet in the description of

1245
01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:43.245
the interview and Doctor Seabright, just before we go

1246
01:11:43.245 --> 01:11:46.404
apart from the book, where can people find your

1247
01:11:46.404 --> 01:11:47.685
work on the internet?

1248
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:54.319
Um, MY website is just Paul Seabright.com. OK? No,

1249
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:57.169
the word Paul and Seabright are run together in

1250
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:58.720
one word. Mhm.

1251
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.009
Great. I'm also leaving that in the description. And

1252
01:12:02.009 --> 01:12:04.609
