00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.630
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.079
today I'm joined by Doctor Andy Clark. He is

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.680
Professor of Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Sussex.

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.739
And today we're focusing on his latest book, The

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.850
Experience Machine, How our minds predict and shape reality.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.049
So Wendy, welcome to the show. It's a huge

8
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.270
pleasure to finally everyone.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.350
Thanks so much for having me. And uh yeah,

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.430
it took us a while to uh to get

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.219
the diaries to align, but it's great to be

12
00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.520
here.

13
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.939
Great. So let me ask you before we get

14
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.119
into more specific or concrete questions. What is the

15
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.650
main argument that you present in your book? What

16
00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.439
is this experience machine you're talking about?

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.159
Yeah, I mean, I guess that uh the core

18
00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:51.909
experience machine is a brain even though I'm really

19
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.610
interested in the the whole brain body environment kind

20
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.950
of uh nexus. But the core idea in the

21
00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.159
book is that we don't experience the world or

22
00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:04.319
our own bodies in what you could think of

23
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
as a kind of raw way. We never in

24
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:10.760
that sense, get the world or our bodies exactly

25
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.360
right. We don't even know really what that would

26
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.940
mean. Instead, what we experience arises at the meeting

27
00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:20.489
point of what our brains are predicting and what

28
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.489
the sensory information seems to be saying. But in

29
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.750
a way that's only half the story and the

30
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.989
other half is that, that meeting point is kind

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.440
of unstable. It's always um modulated or negotiated by

32
00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:37.930
another thing which is the brain's ongoing estimates of

33
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.610
the usefulness, the reliability, the certainty or uncertainty of

34
00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.139
the predictions versus the sensory information. And I think

35
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.330
it's that combination of a central role for pre

36
00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:53.680
prediction and a central role for self estimated uncertainty.

37
00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:55.639
That is the the sort of real core of

38
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.360
this story.

39
00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.019
So could we say then that our perceptions are

40
00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:06.940
constructs of our brains and do not correspond exactly

41
00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:10.570
to something out there in the world, at least

42
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.210
directly.

43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.910
Yeah, I mean, of course, venturing into a very,

44
00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.179
very delicate philosophical territory there. But um I would

45
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.699
certainly want to say that what we experience is

46
00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.220
if you like our brain's best guess at the

47
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.539
actionable world. So what you know what the actionable

48
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.000
world has to do with the world out there

49
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.889
as according to physics, for example, that's a whole

50
00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.770
other question. But what brains are good at I

51
00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.199
think is is estimating how best to act and

52
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.119
intervene on the world. And what we encounter is

53
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.509
a world that is presented to us in a

54
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.860
way apt for intervention and poking and prodding and

55
00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.899
grabbing things and throwing things all of that. So

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.139
I think that's what we experience. Um And is

57
00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.610
it just a construct? Well, no, because it is

58
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.429
deeply anchored in how things are in some way.

59
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.160
You know, if you get, if you put your

60
00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.190
foot in the wrong place on the, on the

61
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.600
bridge and you plum it into the ravine, you've

62
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.970
definitely got something wrong. The world is kind of

63
00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.250
telling you this is, this is not the right

64
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.589
way to go. Um And so what keeps us

65
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.179
in touch with the world are prediction error signals.

66
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.669
So the brain is constructing something, making this sort

67
00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:30.649
of picture of, of how things are. But when

68
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.919
that picture fails to accommodate the incoming sensory information

69
00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:41.134
fully, then prediction errors result, they ignore the mismatch

70
00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:44.345
between what the brain expects. And if you like

71
00:03:44.354 --> 00:03:47.255
what the brain body system is getting and they

72
00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.574
then propagate through the system to try to get

73
00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:52.175
a better get in place. Obviously, this all happens

74
00:03:52.184 --> 00:03:55.365
really fast and at multiple sort of multiple kind

75
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:59.074
of little uh little circuitry um areas in the

76
00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:02.615
brain. So we don't experience that, but as our

77
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:06.050
experience emerges in a way, we're guessing at the

78
00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.600
world, letting the world poke back through prediction errors,

79
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.539
guessing again, poke back again until we run out

80
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.660
of time, or we've accommodated enough prediction error to

81
00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.790
settle into uh uh a picture of how things

82
00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:22.519
are which we normally be kind of on the

83
00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.359
right track otherwise we wouldn't be here.

84
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.209
But when it comes to uh predicting the world,

85
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.790
uh they, they have our brain or mind as

86
00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:41.059
a prediction machine originally. Where do the predictions our

87
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.619
brains, our brains make come from? I mean, before

88
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.739
we start having more experience, uh perceiving the world

89
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.959
and then correct some of the things that we,

90
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.320
we're getting wrong. I mean, is there anything innate

91
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.230
to these predictions or not?

92
00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:03.279
Yeah, that's a really good, a really good question.

93
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.000
Um Obviously, if we're gonna construct experience around predictions,

94
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.410
the question arises. So where do the predictions come

95
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.720
from? And indeed, how good are they? Um One

96
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.500
of the really important early results in this kind

97
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.730
of area was that if you take an artificial

98
00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:24.739
neural network and you set it the the task

99
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.820
of um predicting the flow of sensory information, then

100
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.260
even if it starts with a really, really bad

101
00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.989
model of the world, just with random assignments to

102
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.250
its uh to its weights, the kind of artificial

103
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.179
synapses under those conditions because it's trying to predict

104
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.269
and getting a feedback signal saying no, you got

105
00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.640
that. Uh YOU got that wrong that it's not

106
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.109
a successful prediction over time, it will slowly come

107
00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.940
to a set of predictions that work in the

108
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.899
kind of uh environment that you set it to

109
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.010
work in. So that's an interesting existence proof. I

110
00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:02.369
think that and that these kinds of learning systems

111
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.809
can refine themselves just by trying to do the

112
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.769
prediction task. So you've got this wonderful chance of

113
00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.869
bootstrapping. But of course, the trouble is that evolved

114
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.410
creatures better not start with a really, really bad

115
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.160
model of the world and just rely on prediction

116
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.850
errors to tune it. Because if that was gonna,

117
00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.119
if they started from there, then I think they

118
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.049
wouldn't survive long enough to let the flow of

119
00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:28.170
prediction errors do the right work. So I think

120
00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.720
we've got to start with some sort of set

121
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.100
of innate broadly speaking, expectations about the kind of

122
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:37.779
world that we're going to inhabit. Um BUT they

123
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.179
can be very much refined during childhood, perhaps they

124
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.089
even start to be refined in the womb. You

125
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.200
know, there's interesting work about how the sounds that

126
00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:48.750
a child is hearing in the womb are actually

127
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.239
changing, the way that it will hear sounds when

128
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.899
it comes out of the womb. So, you know,

129
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.149
we're learning machines from the get go and uh

130
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.000
what nature and evolution have given us, I think

131
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.290
is kind of just enough expectations about our world

132
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.760
to kind of stay alive and keep going to

133
00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:09.160
do some better learning so that we can really

134
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.570
tune them so that we become good prediction machines

135
00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.209
on top of the kind of world we actually

136
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.579
live in, which may be very different to the

137
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:20.019
one that uh that was present when evolution selected

138
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.019
the broad structures of our, of our neural systems.

139
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.160
So um predictions come from the effort to predict

140
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.019
plus evolution.

141
00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:32.260
Mhm uh And this memory also play a role

142
00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:36.600
here. I mean, are our predictions informed also by

143
00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:37.720
our memories?

144
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.369
Yes, absolutely. I mean, so much for that, I

145
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.619
think that um that memory if you like is

146
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.679
nothing other than the generative model that iss issue

147
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.690
in the predictions. So, um and this is generative

148
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.320
model in the same sense as uh as as

149
00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.890
work in um generative A I that we're all

150
00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:01.290
seeing at the moment. It's a, it's an inner

151
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:05.529
organization that has the power to create simulations of

152
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.549
data structures for itself. Um I think that's what

153
00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:11.829
memory is. Memory is a way of um of

154
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:14.130
kind of self queuing. So as to create a

155
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.529
data structure that is very similar to the one

156
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.220
that you might have encountered previously in your existence.

157
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.880
So memory I think is a sort of in

158
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.269
a, in a way it's the heart of the

159
00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:28.010
prediction machine predictions are based on memory. But it's

160
00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:31.559
a very, it's this very structured kind of memory

161
00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:34.929
that allows the system to, to simulate the world

162
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.429
for itself. And that I think is uh it's

163
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.590
a kind of very special kind of memory. Um

164
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.698
Hawkins uh um who wrote one of the early

165
00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:46.249
books in this sort of area, actually described the

166
00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:49.129
brain, I think as a memory prediction machine

167
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:53.648
and tell us about this idea of perception as

168
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.169
controlled hallucination. What does that mean?

169
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.270
Yeah, that's, uh, I, I have a sort of

170
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.109
love hate relationship with that phrase. It's so, it's

171
00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:07.510
been around for a while. I've used it myself.

172
00:09:07.809 --> 00:09:10.450
I don't think anyone knows exactly where it comes

173
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.719
from. Some people think it comes from, um, max

174
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.909
Clauses, a machine learning theorist. Um, THERE are other

175
00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:20.270
possibilities. I've heard it used by annual Seth as

176
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.150
well. So, what does it mean? Perception has controlled

177
00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:28.010
hallucination? Um The core idea is just that perception

178
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.510
involves this process of construction where what you already

179
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.520
know is being used to try to construct a

180
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:37.599
picture of how things are that is then sent

181
00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:40.750
out to meet the sensory information. So that only

182
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.099
the differences between what you've constructed and what's indicated

183
00:09:45.109 --> 00:09:48.190
by the incoming information get to do further work

184
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.940
trying to draw out different more refined predictions. So

185
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.419
to that extent, we're kind of um if you

186
00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:58.479
like hallucinating our world, but we're doing it in

187
00:09:58.489 --> 00:10:01.960
a way that is highly controlled, hence the controlled

188
00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:07.580
in controlled hallucination. Um IT'S controlled by basically estimating

189
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.489
uncertainty properly. So knowing how much you should be

190
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.950
relying on current prediction error versus expectation that might

191
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.710
be very different on a foggy day compared to

192
00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:21.559
uh a non foggy day, for example. Um And

193
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.679
uh and also, you know, just the um the

194
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.460
goodness of the model that you started with. So,

195
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.739
so I think it's fine to talk about perception

196
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.640
of controlled hallucination. As long as we really, really

197
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.080
don't lose sight of the controlled bit in there.

198
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.580
We are, we are anchored in some way in

199
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.520
the world by pre prior learning and the prediction

200
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.530
error signal and, and that's hugely important. Otherwise, we're

201
00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:45.349
just making things up and there's no explanation for

202
00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:46.599
how can we survive,

203
00:10:47.549 --> 00:10:50.349
right? Uh So I would like to understand a

204
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:54.650
little bit better how the dynamic then between the

205
00:10:54.659 --> 00:11:00.030
world and our minds work. I mean, what is

206
00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:03.869
uh what do we get exactly from the world

207
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.304
that in forms our predictions? I would, I'm trying

208
00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:10.844
to understand a bit better uh what it is

209
00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:14.775
or, or if there's something about our predictions that

210
00:11:14.784 --> 00:11:20.405
corresponds to something in the objective world or how

211
00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:21.525
does it work? Exactly.

212
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.780
Yeah. Um So what is it that we're predicting

213
00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:31.539
um basically um waves of energy hitting the sensory

214
00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:34.820
receptors. So, ultimately, what the brain is trying to

215
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.099
predict is how its own sense organs are going

216
00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:42.869
to be modified by um by incoming energies from

217
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.770
the outside world, either, you know, uh pressure in

218
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.989
airwaves or um or you know, wavelengths of light

219
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.559
or, you know, all the stuff that we are

220
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:58.140
actually um uh getting information from. Um SORRY, was

221
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.830
there what there was something else in your question

222
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.309
there though? That's what we're trying to predict. But

223
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.390
of course, in order to predict that we use

224
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.869
a whole cascade of predictions starting from really abstract

225
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.690
predictions, like, you know, I'm in my office. And

226
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.390
so I predict uh I predict desk type things,

227
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.650
microphone, um ring lamps, all of this stuff. Um

228
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.309
But those predictions of course, then have to reach

229
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.119
down to the point where they're actually, now I'm

230
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.950
looking up at the ring lamp briefly. Um I'm

231
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.729
making quite fine grain predictions about where things are

232
00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:31.979
in space, how the kind of light and shadow

233
00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:35.359
is falling and prediction errors at that level are

234
00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:40.159
kind of much closer to the incoming sensory information.

235
00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:42.909
They then have to be used to, to correct

236
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.700
things in a way that might cascade all the

237
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.760
way up to the high level prediction. So that

238
00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:49.289
maybe it's like, oh no, my my ring light

239
00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:51.520
is broken today, I'm using someone else's and it

240
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.739
looks completely different, that kind of thing. So um

241
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.599
so there's a, there's a lot going on. Um

242
00:12:57.859 --> 00:13:01.330
BUT it's basically trying to get to grips with

243
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.159
waves of energy. And the best way of getting

244
00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:07.109
to grips with those waves of energy turns out

245
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.390
to be to hallucinate if you like or to

246
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.390
um I will say that word to hallucinate a

247
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.549
world of um of uh middle sized objects, things

248
00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:19.469
like ring lights and microphones and desks, cos they're

249
00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:22.380
the things that we can interact with. That's the

250
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.900
sort of right level of description to capture a

251
00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:29.719
world, which is apt for human interaction so that

252
00:13:29.729 --> 00:13:31.580
I can then decide oh I need to adjust

253
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.650
the angle of the ring light. Uh OK. This

254
00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.510
is what I need to do. That's, I think

255
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.640
that's what we're, that's what we're trying to get

256
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.679
with these flurries of prediction and prediction arrow.

257
00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:45.049
But I mean, this is more of a metaphysical

258
00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:48.190
question I think, but when it comes to what

259
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.299
we perceive, to what extent does that correspond to

260
00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:56.770
something really out there in objective reality?

261
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.809
See that I was hoping you'd forget about that

262
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.260
question along the way of that previous answer because

263
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.440
that is a really, really good question to ask.

264
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.599
Um, I think the answer is that we don't

265
00:14:08.609 --> 00:14:14.739
know, I, I don't actually know how anyone could

266
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.419
if you like sort of, um, put together what

267
00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:23.669
we learn about objective reality from physics, which I

268
00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:26.150
think is kind of our best shot at something

269
00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:30.440
like, um, reality as it is independent of, of

270
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.530
human thinking and reasoning. You know, it's probably not

271
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:37.070
completely independent, but at least it's a shot. Um,

272
00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:39.489
AND then the stuff that we see, you know,

273
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.090
you can, you can show that the stuff that

274
00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:44.650
we see is kind of, um, the stuff that

275
00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.719
we see is not impossible, given what we know

276
00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:50.890
about the ultimate nature of reality. If we take

277
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.679
contemporary physics seriously, it's not impossible. But if you

278
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.479
then ask so to what extent is it accurate

279
00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:01.729
or? Right, then I don't think there's any further

280
00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:05.909
answer than it's just, it's just the picture that

281
00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:09.159
does the best job of letting us interact with

282
00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:12.320
our world and agree with the other humans that

283
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.599
we share the world with. So I think there's

284
00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:17.729
those sort of two forces um kind of uh

285
00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:20.510
acting upon us to keep our pictures in line

286
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.650
with each other and that's agreement with each other

287
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.549
and in line with the world. And that's um

288
00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.669
the fact that my actions have to succeed or

289
00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:30.619
II, I kind of um fall off the bridge

290
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.330
and die. So beyond that, I don't think there's

291
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.640
anything to say about how close we are to

292
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.200
reality or far from it where most of the

293
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.590
time we're just good enough to get by. And

294
00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:45.619
I think that's, you know, that's all that evolution

295
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.950
wanted, didn't want to spend kind of extra money

296
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.659
and resources on kind of fine tuning how we

297
00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:55.080
see the world. If it's, if there's no benefit

298
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.020
in action, why, why would evolution care about that?

299
00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:01.590
So I think it's all about acting successfully. So

300
00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:03.549
when you've got a picture that lets you act

301
00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:06.679
successfully on the world and you're kind of able

302
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.520
to agree with the others that you're acting in

303
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.320
the world with, then I'm happy to say that's

304
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.619
as close to reality as we're gonna get. Thank

305
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.000
you. Uh

306
00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:18.429
Yes. But, but then let me ask you a

307
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.090
somewhat different kind of question related to that. So,

308
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.429
but can we say that the things we perceive?

309
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.909
I don't know the computer, the ring light, the

310
00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:33.409
microphone are real. I mean that, that were they

311
00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:37.080
real? Uh CAN we apply it to the kinds

312
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.469
of things we perceive or not?

313
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.989
Yes. OK. I want to say, I, I come

314
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.940
out to come clean here. I want to say

315
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.919
it's real. I want to say that I can

316
00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:48.940
say that the microphone in front of me is

317
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.619
real. You know, I can, I can raise it

318
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.739
up. There we go. Um It's definitely, you know,

319
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.320
uh what was that old philosophical slogan? Um Something

320
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.090
like if you can kick it, it's real or

321
00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:02.719
something. Um So yeah, I think, I think it's

322
00:17:02.729 --> 00:17:05.319
real but at the same time because I'm cons

323
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.709
because my view here is that rea reality is

324
00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:15.219
the interact space. If you like, then something that

325
00:17:15.229 --> 00:17:19.219
appears to me in a sufficiently complex virtual reality

326
00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:22.729
would be just as real as the, as a

327
00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:25.368
microphone because if I can interact with it and

328
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.410
I can agree with other people on, on what

329
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.719
it is and everything works well like that, then

330
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.060
that's as good as we've got in the real

331
00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:36.260
world. So yeah, real. But is it reality as

332
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.160
we might have pre theoretically wanted it to be

333
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.810
where it's really, really, really real? Um I don't

334
00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:46.880
think we can say that all we can say

335
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.869
is this is a, this is a picture that

336
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.189
lets us get by.

337
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.920
Mhm A and so if we were plugged into

338
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.229
Robert Nozick Experience Machine, the kind of information it

339
00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:02.939
would feed our brain. Could we say then that

340
00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:07.439
whatever kind of experiences we have there would be

341
00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:11.829
as real as what we perceive in the outside

342
00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:13.079
of the machine, let's say

343
00:18:14.199 --> 00:18:17.709
uh OK. Confession time. Um When I called the

344
00:18:17.719 --> 00:18:20.540
book The Experience Machine, I didn't even know about

345
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.500
the uh nos Thought Experiment. So the, the, the

346
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.869
book title has nothing particularly to do with that.

347
00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:28.770
Nor am I an expert on that thought experiment.

348
00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:32.459
Um My intuition is that I want to say

349
00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:34.739
yes, I want to say that, you know, um

350
00:18:34.959 --> 00:18:39.540
uh if you like uh uh as long as,

351
00:18:40.229 --> 00:18:43.199
as long as my grip on the world is

352
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:46.930
sufficient to interact with it properly, and I'm able

353
00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:49.530
to agree with others at that time, then I

354
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.670
can't think of anything else to demand. And if

355
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.520
I understand that thought experiment correctly, which I may

356
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.150
not, then that's what, that's what Nozick is trying

357
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.300
to give us a situation where we kind of

358
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.069
have some intuition that we're disconnected from the world.

359
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.719
And yet all of that all of that interaction

360
00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:12.000
and agreement space is somehow um preserved um to

361
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.810
the extent that that's possible. Then I'm happy to

362
00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:17.780
say that. Uh Yeah, that's just sort of more

363
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.430
reality. If you like a kind of extended version

364
00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:22.229
of, of, of the same reality.

365
00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:27.650
Mhm We're going to get more into extended cognition

366
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.609
later. But let me ask you now, how do

367
00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:35.449
you look at the relationship between sensory information and

368
00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:39.449
expectation? What is the expectation in this context?

369
00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:45.380
Yeah. So expectation here, I use the word um

370
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.729
pretty much synonymously with prediction here. Um So, you

371
00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:51.689
know, if I ever do try to make a

372
00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:54.199
distinction, it would be that expectations tend to have

373
00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:58.290
more to do with conscious expectations. Prediction captures a

374
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.150
lot of the unconscious stuff too. But a lot

375
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.790
of the time I just use them interchangeably. Um

376
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.660
So what, what do we say about that as

377
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:12.910
well? Um There, if you like structured linked representations

378
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.339
of an actionable world, that's I think that, that,

379
00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.099
that is the bedrock of what I think here

380
00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:22.260
is that um action is a kind of keystone

381
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.239
and you have structured linked representations that are doing

382
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.540
things like um helping, helping me locate objects in

383
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.160
space and helping me interact successfully with the object.

384
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.689
So I need to locate the microphone right now

385
00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:39.910
in space because I've decided to look at it.

386
00:20:40.069 --> 00:20:42.510
And if I was gonna pick it up, then

387
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.920
I need to understand pre understand stuff about where

388
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.869
the heavy bits are. Um HOW I should pick

389
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.130
it up if I want to use it in

390
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.810
a certain way. And all of that information is

391
00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:59.339
a sort of interlinked structure that um that if

392
00:20:59.349 --> 00:21:04.109
you like gets sent out towards the sensory peripheries

393
00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:08.939
so that it can meet incoming sensory information and

394
00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:12.219
work out whether all of those things were adequate

395
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.930
or not. Um And if they're inadequate, then I,

396
00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:18.800
my brain will have another go. Um And if

397
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.140
I judge them to be adequate, then my whole

398
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.030
brain body system will probably have a go at

399
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.609
picking it up. And if I got it wrong,

400
00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:28.119
then prediction error signals will gain a result. So

401
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.439
there are lots of places along the chain here

402
00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:34.040
where um where the world can correct me if

403
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.459
you like, it can correct me just by I

404
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:37.920
take a better look and it now looks a

405
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.359
little bit different. I didn't get, get the contour

406
00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:43.040
quite right first time or it can correct me

407
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.650
because I actually tried to use that information and

408
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.479
couldn't and sort of failed to pick it up

409
00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:51.989
properly. So that sort of it's an interlinked data

410
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.839
structure where everything is already bound together that is

411
00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:59.589
trying to predict the flow across the the time

412
00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:03.170
locked flow across all of the the sensory interfaces,

413
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.239
sight, sound touch. Um And that's of course, a

414
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.310
very complex and difficult task, but one that brains

415
00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:13.369
like ours seem enormously well adapted to, to perform

416
00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:16.859
but not that. No. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

417
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:23.270
So cognitively speaking, this process also ties to learning,

418
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.089
right? Because it's through learning that we kind of

419
00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:31.890
update our predictions about whatever we are perceiving.

420
00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:36.680
Yeah. So learning, I think learning is is kind

421
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:38.780
of it's happening all the time. It's not sort

422
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.339
of. So unlike actually a lot of uh a

423
00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:45.949
lot of contemporary um work in machine learning. Uh

424
00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:48.719
WHAT brain brains are always turned on in learning

425
00:22:48.729 --> 00:22:51.300
mode. So everything that's going on can if you

426
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:56.640
like affect the underlying generative model. Um And learning

427
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.000
just is the process of, of updating the generative

428
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:04.819
model. That is if you like um that is

429
00:23:04.829 --> 00:23:07.060
represent, I want to say represented in the brain.

430
00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:08.750
But I don't want that to, to, to sound

431
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.089
too much like classical forms of representation. Some people

432
00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:17.050
just like to say it's kind of structurally inherent

433
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.400
in, in, in how the brain becomes after, after

434
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.739
you've been engaged with stuff in certain ways. So,

435
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.150
you know, obviously there are real physical changes that

436
00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:29.310
um uh that, that correspond to the changes at

437
00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:32.829
this more abstract level in what's in the generative

438
00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:35.969
model and how it behaves. Um But yeah, so

439
00:23:35.979 --> 00:23:38.880
learning is updating the generative model and we're doing

440
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.500
it all the time

441
00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:46.250
and through this framework, how would we approach illusions

442
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.349
or what people in cognitive science and neuroscience call

443
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.060
illusions, how would we understand them and approach them?

444
00:23:54.859 --> 00:23:57.680
Yeah, illusions are really, really interesting, I think because

445
00:23:57.689 --> 00:24:02.170
what, what they're kind of, they're sort of one

446
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.689
of the places in which the fact that the

447
00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:09.329
brain is a prediction machine becomes apparent to us

448
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.589
because what the sort of illusory um contexts are

449
00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:18.140
doing in general is messing with our predictions by

450
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.719
um by, if you like sort of tripping us

451
00:24:20.729 --> 00:24:23.880
up because our prediction machinery makes assumptions about how

452
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.920
the world is and under, in a lot of

453
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.479
the illusions, those assumptions are, are not correct. So

454
00:24:30.489 --> 00:24:33.640
in, um in an Amy's room, for example, where,

455
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.119
you know, you see someone there and they look

456
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.439
really, really big at the, at the, at the

457
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:39.989
back of the room like giants. It's because of

458
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.459
sort of the, um the uh what's the word

459
00:24:43.469 --> 00:24:46.969
kind of like contours, the lines and shapes in

460
00:24:46.979 --> 00:24:50.739
the room are such that in the real world,

461
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.369
you would most normally come across those building kind

462
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.949
of square like structures. And if a person's head

463
00:24:57.959 --> 00:24:59.890
reached the ceiling there, then they would be really

464
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.680
big. But of course, in the actual Amy's room,

465
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.979
um the the the structures don't work like that.

466
00:25:05.989 --> 00:25:08.219
And so a small person is kind of reaching

467
00:25:08.229 --> 00:25:12.780
the ceiling um at one end. Uh So it's

468
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.810
so I think all illusions have something of this

469
00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:19.280
uh of this structure. Um Think about the favorite

470
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.949
in this uh maybe in this whole literature, the

471
00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:25.260
hollow mask illusion where you take a, a standard

472
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.689
joke shop mask and you turn it so that

473
00:25:28.699 --> 00:25:31.729
the concave side is facing you, you light it

474
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:34.079
from behind and you retire to about 5 ft

475
00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:38.410
away under those conditions, it looks like the convex

476
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.790
side of the mask is facing you. So you

477
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.699
see a face with the nose sticking out even

478
00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:47.010
though what you're actually in front of is um

479
00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.199
the side where the nose is sticking in and

480
00:25:49.209 --> 00:25:52.140
actually sticking out uh the back of it. Um

481
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.060
So what's going on there seems to be that

482
00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:58.400
we have such strong predictions about the typical shape

483
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.469
of faces with noses coming outwards that um the

484
00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:06.609
real information that's coming from the world specifying concavity

485
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.949
is just being trumped or um you know, being

486
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.420
superseded by a strong prediction. We've got a prediction

487
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.260
that we assign high or our brains automatically assign

488
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.959
high reliability to. And that means that real sensory

489
00:26:20.969 --> 00:26:24.819
information is being treated as noise and just ignored

490
00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:28.560
as the percept of the world emerges. And I

491
00:26:28.569 --> 00:26:30.180
think this is, this is what's going on in

492
00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:32.900
very, very many cases of illusions. It's sort of,

493
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:38.979
it's manipulating our expectations and, and certainties to um

494
00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:42.160
to allow the brain to force onto the world

495
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.109
something that in this case isn't actually there. Um

496
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.219
Anyway, there are many, many more cases there that

497
00:26:48.229 --> 00:26:50.000
we could talk about. There's a case of the

498
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.750
dress, the famous dress that people see in as

499
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.329
blue or gold. It's a very beautiful um account

500
00:26:56.459 --> 00:26:59.290
of, of how all that works. Um But maybe

501
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.319
we'll come to those later.

502
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.619
Mhm Yes. But let me ask you then when

503
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.550
it comes to illusions, would you call them perception

504
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.410
or prediction errors? Are they errors or are they

505
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.329
just the, the normal way? Our uh perception is

506
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:18.045
cognition?

507
00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:20.814
Yeah. Yeah. I think I, I think I prefer

508
00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:22.314
the latter. I think I say this is just

509
00:27:22.324 --> 00:27:25.185
the normal way that perception and cognition works. It's

510
00:27:25.214 --> 00:27:29.755
a, it's a process that is dependent on assumptions

511
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:34.810
and um to the extent that those assumptions are

512
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:37.219
sort of uh uh are in place in the

513
00:27:37.229 --> 00:27:40.040
particular context and you're going to perceive the world

514
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.609
as it is if you like and if you

515
00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:45.680
mess around with those assumptions, um then you will

516
00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:48.510
get some other kind of, of percept. So, you

517
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.900
know, in the case of the dress that we

518
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.949
just mentioned, the assumptions seem to be to do

519
00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:54.750
with where the light's coming from. Is it coming

520
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.849
from above or is it a more sort of,

521
00:27:56.859 --> 00:28:00.180
uh, diffuse light? So, um, is it the kind

522
00:28:00.189 --> 00:28:02.500
of light you'd have in an artificial setting where

523
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.329
the, the source is rather, um, rather simple and

524
00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:07.229
coming from a certain position? Or is it more

525
00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:10.640
like daylight? Uh, IT seems that, uh, people that

526
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.839
assume it's more like daylight, see the dress as

527
00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:17.099
gold, whereas people whose brains assume it's an artificial

528
00:28:17.109 --> 00:28:20.560
light, see the dress as blue. Um, THERE'S actually

529
00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:23.719
an interest in relation between whether you're a lark

530
00:28:23.729 --> 00:28:25.650
or an owl, whether you're someone that likes to

531
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.880
rise early in the morning or linger in bed

532
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.849
a lot longer. Um, IT turns out that people

533
00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:34.520
who are naturally larks tend to see the dress

534
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.130
as gold and people who are, are naturally owls

535
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.319
tend to see it as blue because they've had

536
00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:44.819
more experience of um artificial light versus natural light.

537
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:47.719
This is work by Pascal Wallis and uh and

538
00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:50.015
co in New York. And I, I think it's

539
00:28:50.025 --> 00:28:54.194
rather wonderful because it shows how little little features

540
00:28:54.204 --> 00:28:58.094
of our daily experience, install the kind of predictions

541
00:28:58.285 --> 00:29:02.255
that structure perception in ways that may hide unexpected

542
00:29:02.265 --> 00:29:05.555
differences between different individuals, like the people that see

543
00:29:05.564 --> 00:29:06.675
it as blue and the people that see it

544
00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:07.354
as gold.

545
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:12.089
OK? But in the case of the the dress,

546
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.819
the there's uh I mean, in that particular case,

547
00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:19.369
at least there's an objective answer, right? I mean,

548
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.550
if someone would bring would, would bring on the

549
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.699
dress, we would know for sure if it's blue

550
00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:27.410
or yellow

551
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.709
because the, you know, the actual photograph, if I

552
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:33.680
remember this right was taken in artificial light and

553
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:35.959
so blue is the correct answer. I think, I

554
00:29:35.969 --> 00:29:38.459
think that's right. Um And then the people that

555
00:29:38.469 --> 00:29:40.520
see it as gold like me, well, you know,

556
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.939
there it is, you know, I think it looks

557
00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:44.400
much prettier as a gold dress. So I'm pleased

558
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.219
to be seeing it as gold, but I am

559
00:29:46.229 --> 00:29:49.270
wrong in that case, in, in, in some, in

560
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.069
some reasonably objective sense, I think that's right. Yeah.

561
00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:57.939
Uh And how does this all relate to four

562
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.510
e cognition for recognition, being embedded and acted, extended

563
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.959
and embodied cognition. What is the relationship here?

564
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.829
Yeah. Um That is a, that is a question

565
00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:16.619
that many people ask me partly because I'm being

566
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.189
fairly strongly associated my own previous work quite strongly

567
00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:27.189
associated with both embodied and extended cognition. Um So,

568
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.790
you know, there's a sort of question arises why

569
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.099
on earth? Is, is, is Clark interested in predictive

570
00:30:33.109 --> 00:30:36.380
processing that to some people looks like a very

571
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:41.599
um disembodied brain centered um uh picture of what

572
00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:46.239
mind and cognition is. Um But deep down, I

573
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.229
think that actually, you know, there had to be

574
00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:51.160
some account of what brains do in these complex

575
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:56.160
brain body world systems and predictive processing seems to

576
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.000
me to be the best such account that has

577
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.520
emerged so far. And among the reasons why I

578
00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:07.400
think that that's if you like um good news

579
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.420
for four E cognition rather than bad news for

580
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.760
four E cognition is that um the the sort

581
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.000
of core of the of what the brain is

582
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.760
trying to predict is action. So, you know, I

583
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.670
think brains like this are really action systems. All

584
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.229
these predictions are constructed to so as to enable

585
00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:30.520
us to act better on the world. So embodied

586
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.709
cognition is is at the forefront, these are these

587
00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:36.880
are generative models that are there for creatures that

588
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.040
have bodies and want to use those bodies to

589
00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:42.979
do things in the world. But then there's one

590
00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:45.270
other thing that is worth bringing in which is

591
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:51.420
that um as action systems, what predictive brains are

592
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.790
are doing for the brain body system if you

593
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.619
like is exploiting it to get better information all

594
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:02.540
the time. So because of this constant estimation of

595
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.890
our own certainty or uncertainty, which is really the

596
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.829
core of the the predictive process in picture, then

597
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.880
um brains will control bodies to perform actions that

598
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.260
reduce their own uncertainty um so that they can

599
00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.140
get things done better. So if I want to

600
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.040
go and see a movie tonight, um then to

601
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.280
produce the right sequence of actions, I'm gonna do

602
00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.459
things like consult the web to find out what

603
00:32:26.469 --> 00:32:28.770
time the movie starts. Consult the web to find

604
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.920
out when the bus comes. Um THE the use

605
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.119
of the external world as an information resource flows

606
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:40.199
really automatically from the underlying way that predictive processing

607
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.510
um structures, information flows. They're all about um they're

608
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.589
all about gathering information to reduce uncertainty to act

609
00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:55.609
successfully. So for that reason, um the there's back

610
00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:56.890
in the day when I was working on the

611
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.630
extended mind, there was uh an ongoing puzzle which

612
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.160
was something like. So how does the right stuff

613
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.569
come together at the right time? There's something like

614
00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:09.130
there's some neural work going on and then there's

615
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.530
some physical stuff. Maybe I'm reaching out and looking

616
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.900
at a notebook or consulting an iphone or the

617
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.000
web and you know, how does how does the

618
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.430
right set of resources come together at the right

619
00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:22.630
time to solve the problem? Um Predictive processing I

620
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.630
think is the answer to that question and it

621
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.369
all comes together under ongoing estimates of what will

622
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.329
best reduce the uncertainties that need to be reduced

623
00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:33.880
as we get, as we try to do the

624
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.469
things we wanna do. So that's a kind of

625
00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:40.010
long winded answer. But, but basically, um I think

626
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.989
that what looks like a neuro centric framework here

627
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.989
turns out to be one that will automatically engage

628
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.920
the body in ways that minimize uncertainty, using resources

629
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.030
in the world. So then we've got extended cognition,

630
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.079
natural born cyborgs, all the, all the other stuff

631
00:33:56.089 --> 00:33:58.569
that I've kind of um uh cared about in

632
00:33:58.579 --> 00:33:59.170
the past.

633
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.599
Uh But uh I mean, if we, if we

634
00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:06.390
agree or if we accept this four e cognition

635
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.570
framework, then where exactly is the boundary between uh

636
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.040
ourselves and the outside world cognitively speaking? Or, or

637
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.469
is there even a boundary, a precise boundary or?

638
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:26.620
Yeah. Um BOUNDARIES are uh uh uh AAA very

639
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:30.320
hot topic in um in active inference and predictive

640
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.449
processing because there's an awful lot of work that,

641
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:36.540
that stresses and rightly in a way, the importance

642
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:40.478
of uh of a statistical um construct called a

643
00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.020
markoff blanket, which kind of sounds like it might

644
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.620
be a physical thing, but it isn't really, it's

645
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:50.320
just a statistical construct where um you um you,

646
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.580
if you like um you pause the, the information

647
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.040
flow within some large system in a way that

648
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.659
enables you to treat parts of that information flow

649
00:35:01.669 --> 00:35:05.179
as uh arising at the boundary and other parts.

650
00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:06.939
So some parts are on the outside, some are

651
00:35:06.949 --> 00:35:08.639
on the inside and some are on the boundary.

652
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.649
Um But it turns out that um because that's

653
00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:14.060
just a statistical construct, you can apply it in

654
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.729
all kinds of ways. If you're looking at the,

655
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:19.370
you know, the blind person with the cane, you

656
00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:22.949
can uh motivate a markoff blanket that includes the

657
00:35:22.959 --> 00:35:25.850
uh the edge of the cane uh as well.

658
00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:28.090
Um Or you can have a markoff blanket that

659
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.330
stops where the brain stuff stops, or you can

660
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.129
have a markoff blanket that stops where the hippocampus

661
00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:37.360
stops. So this is just to say that the

662
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.040
um I think the question where the boundaries really

663
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.639
are is a question that we shouldn't ask. We

664
00:35:42.649 --> 00:35:45.929
should just say um given what I'm trying to

665
00:35:45.939 --> 00:35:50.090
explain right now, where is it useful to think

666
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.659
about boundaries? Um And that depends on what you're

667
00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:56.500
trying to explain and uh not just what, but

668
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.350
um with what sort of perspective you're trying to

669
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.239
explain it. Uh So, you know, someone that uh

670
00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:06.540
someone that is interested in city planning is going

671
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.330
to be very interested in uh in a lot

672
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.159
of boundaries that lie outside individual brains, but include

673
00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:16.760
lines of sight with sort of um trees and

674
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.239
walls and fences and stuff like that. Um Other

675
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.290
people might be much more interested just in what

676
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.449
the brains do and kind of how it can

677
00:36:24.459 --> 00:36:28.239
sort of um how it can sculpt control a

678
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.729
very local interaction with uh with the world. So,

679
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:36.179
um so boundaries I think are super important but

680
00:36:36.189 --> 00:36:39.860
should never be taken. Um SO seriously that we

681
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.669
cease to look at what appears to be outside

682
00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:44.919
of them. And sometimes when we do that, we

683
00:36:44.929 --> 00:36:47.020
realize there's another whole way of looking at the

684
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.360
system where it's that larger perspective that is actually

685
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.629
more fruitful. And I think that's what the history

686
00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:58.350
of distributed and embodied and extended and inactive cognition

687
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.679
has really been doing for us is just kind

688
00:37:00.689 --> 00:37:02.520
of saying, hey, look at some of these larger,

689
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.810
larger holes and the patterns that uh that are

690
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.800
emerging in them.

691
00:37:07.629 --> 00:37:10.790
Mhm uh And but since you mentioned a concept

692
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.870
like the Markov blanket, does all of these, I

693
00:37:14.879 --> 00:37:17.090
mean, the the idea of the brain is a

694
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.570
predictive predicting machine and stuff like that. Does it

695
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.370
also connect at least to some extent with the

696
00:37:24.379 --> 00:37:26.949
free energy principle or not?

697
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:30.969
Yeah, I think it, yeah, I mean, yes, yes

698
00:37:30.979 --> 00:37:32.810
has to be the answer it connects, it connects

699
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:39.300
deeply with the free energy principle. Um Nonetheless, most

700
00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.159
of my own work steers slightly clear of the

701
00:37:42.169 --> 00:37:46.260
free energy principle, which kind of um does its

702
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:51.090
work at a very, very abstract theoretical level? That

703
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.179
is kind of, I think it is doing very

704
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:57.399
interesting work. Um It's trying to say from first

705
00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:59.639
principles like what does it take to be an

706
00:37:59.649 --> 00:38:01.770
object. What does it take to be a live

707
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.810
system? Um You can say things about um about

708
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.895
persistence in the face of perturbation that seem really

709
00:38:10.905 --> 00:38:15.334
interesting. Um THE mathematics, so I'm told looks an

710
00:38:15.344 --> 00:38:18.344
awful lot like some of the mathematics of predictive

711
00:38:18.354 --> 00:38:21.324
processing. So you can kind of see um you

712
00:38:21.334 --> 00:38:24.889
can kind of see um you can see a

713
00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:29.620
living system, for example, as morphologically a kind of

714
00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:32.719
prediction of the sort of environment that it's going

715
00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:35.040
to live in the shape of the fish is

716
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.919
a kind of prediction of the hydrodynamics of seawater.

717
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.800
So, you know, once you're using the free energy

718
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.060
principle, then I think a lot of things fall

719
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.969
into place, but the cost of them falling into

720
00:38:47.979 --> 00:38:51.100
place is that very often what you're dealing with

721
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.060
isn't sort of process level prediction in the way

722
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.419
that um the original computational explorations in this area

723
00:38:59.429 --> 00:39:03.600
were looking at sort of process level prediction um

724
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.679
that probably didn't really make all the sense I

725
00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:07.379
wanted it to. But I think the kind of

726
00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:09.580
idea there is that the free energy principle is

727
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.169
a really, really big picture that tells us a

728
00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:16.659
lot of things that are probably necessary truths about

729
00:39:16.669 --> 00:39:20.179
life and mind. They're very, very helpful because they

730
00:39:20.189 --> 00:39:22.570
put life and mind on a kind of uh

731
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.550
a continuous trajectory. Um But deep down my own

732
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.260
interest is in the process model that is implemented

733
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:33.250
by the human brain So to that extent, I'm

734
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.739
kind of, you know, I'm very interested in what

735
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.870
are the actual computations being performed by the brain

736
00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:42.929
when it solves problems? Like revealing a structured world

737
00:39:42.939 --> 00:39:45.790
to me in perception and deep down, I don't

738
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.469
think that every living system encounters a structured world

739
00:39:50.479 --> 00:39:53.449
in perception. I don't, I don't know, no one

740
00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:55.270
knows. But I don't think that a single celled

741
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.350
bacterium maybe not a, not a plant either encounters

742
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.040
a structured world um in perception or by perception.

743
00:40:04.389 --> 00:40:08.659
So I think there's something very interesting about what

744
00:40:08.729 --> 00:40:14.139
um what complex brains are doing that is somehow

745
00:40:14.149 --> 00:40:18.090
making experience of the kind that we recognize as

746
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.760
experience possible. And I think that's got an awful

747
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.810
lot to do with, you know, cascades of prediction

748
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.330
that bring together multiple sources of information and that

749
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.610
reach across multiple times scales. And at that point,

750
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.679
I think the um that's where if you turn

751
00:40:32.689 --> 00:40:34.979
up all those dials on a free energy account,

752
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.370
you get the kind of process level accounts that,

753
00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:38.580
that I've mostly looked at.

754
00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:42.780
Mhm So another thing that you also talk a

755
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.959
little bit about in the book has to do

756
00:40:44.969 --> 00:40:49.389
with the sort of implications that this framework would

757
00:40:49.399 --> 00:40:54.129
have for neurology and psychiatry. So, could you tell

758
00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:55.770
us a little bit about that? And then I

759
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.290
will ask some follow up questions about it?

760
00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:02.949
Yeah. So, you know, if, if you were to

761
00:41:02.959 --> 00:41:06.520
ask what's the practical um value or the cash

762
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.239
value of treating the brain as a as a

763
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.040
kind of prediction machine that is constantly estimating its

764
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:16.100
own uncertainty. I think the answer is computational psychiatry.

765
00:41:16.189 --> 00:41:21.679
I think the um what what you can, what

766
00:41:21.689 --> 00:41:25.129
it looks increasingly like you can do is apply

767
00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:28.489
this general picture of how brains like ours process

768
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.080
information and then ask the question um suppose that

769
00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.139
you change some of the settings so that you

770
00:41:35.149 --> 00:41:38.360
were put in. Um SO that you estimated the

771
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:42.000
certainty of sensory information more highly than other people,

772
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.879
or you estimated it more low, more, more, more

773
00:41:44.889 --> 00:41:48.000
low than other people. Um What would happen then?

774
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.489
Well, you, you know, it's uh it's being argued

775
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.879
here that if you put a extra weight on

776
00:41:55.889 --> 00:41:59.209
the sensory information so that you really enhance the

777
00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:03.110
value of the sensory information, um Think about what

778
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.050
that's gonna do. It's gonna make it harder to

779
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.050
bring your top down expectations to bear on the

780
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.610
sensory signal to make things fall into place. It,

781
00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.530
the world will seem to be throwing you important

782
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.840
information all the time that you need to be

783
00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:22.590
taken account of. And that corresponds fairly closely to

784
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.679
the phenomenology of autism spectrum disorder or autism spectrum

785
00:42:26.689 --> 00:42:32.330
condition, I should say. Um So conversely, if you

786
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.979
put a lot of value on your own predictions

787
00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:37.909
and less value on the sensory information, then you'll

788
00:42:37.919 --> 00:42:41.310
hallucinate things just because um your brain has started

789
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.909
to expect them. And so again, accounts of psychosis

790
00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:47.870
seem to emerge quite naturally from that setting of

791
00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:51.469
the dials. Um There's also some very interesting stuff

792
00:42:51.479 --> 00:42:56.389
on the way that um the way that cycles

793
00:42:56.399 --> 00:43:00.909
lock uh misguided predictions in, in the case of

794
00:43:00.919 --> 00:43:04.429
psychosis or chronic pain, that is it where your

795
00:43:04.439 --> 00:43:09.649
expectations and predictions help construct a sensory realm that

796
00:43:09.659 --> 00:43:13.620
seems to confirm the expectations and predictions. So no

797
00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:16.510
matter how many times you sort of encounter things,

798
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.229
you're kind of morphing them into the shape that

799
00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:23.830
confirms the predictions that led to the altered experiences.

800
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.000
So it can be very hard to break out

801
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.439
of some of those um cycles of uh depression,

802
00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:34.699
chronic pain, um functional neurological disorders, they all have

803
00:43:34.709 --> 00:43:38.850
this kind of cyclic thing where um expectations that

804
00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.620
things are gonna hurt or they're not gonna go

805
00:43:40.629 --> 00:43:43.360
well all to the way you experience the world

806
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.439
and the way that you interact with the world

807
00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:48.280
and you can't gather new information that would revise

808
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.139
your estimates of how things are gonna go and

809
00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:52.439
how much pain you're feeling. So I think that,

810
00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:55.439
that, that, that this general picture has a lot

811
00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:59.110
of promise for one day delivering a much more

812
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.870
nuanced understanding of the whole range of human experience.

813
00:44:03.879 --> 00:44:06.239
If you think of us as as kind of

814
00:44:06.479 --> 00:44:12.120
having multilevel sensory expectations, multilevel predictions, little dials all

815
00:44:12.129 --> 00:44:14.969
the way through the brain body nexus that are

816
00:44:14.979 --> 00:44:18.949
set in different ways in different people, constructing worlds

817
00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:24.780
of um emotion experience uh and pay differently. Um

818
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:27.300
So that's, that's a very long answer again. But

819
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.409
the, the, the, the kind of um computational psychiatry

820
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:34.419
I think is uh is a really, really exciting

821
00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:38.020
area and one that these accounts can contribute to.

822
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.520
Mhm. But then if someone suffers from some sort

823
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.899
of mental illness, like for example, you gave the

824
00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:49.060
example of depression and I think we can also

825
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.949
talk about schizophrenia and stuff like that. I, is

826
00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:57.199
it the case or are the cases of our

827
00:44:57.209 --> 00:45:03.860
unconscious expectations malfunctioning? Can we talk about malfunctioning here

828
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:04.500
or not?

829
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.969
Um Well, that's a very, very delicate question. Um

830
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.770
BECAUSE in a way it looks as if the

831
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.989
system is just doing what it ought to be

832
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.360
doing but, but very often um just doing it

833
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:27.229
with a AAA kind of a strange estimate of,

834
00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:30.689
of what's reliable or what isn't reliable um or

835
00:45:30.699 --> 00:45:34.860
on the basis of aspects of information that are

836
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.659
really there, but they're not the only aspects. So,

837
00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:39.870
you know, um you, you probably are getting all

838
00:45:39.879 --> 00:45:42.320
kinds of signals from the world saying that um

839
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.379
you're not putting on a good show at this

840
00:45:44.389 --> 00:45:46.479
party or, you know, this talks not going. So

841
00:45:46.489 --> 00:45:48.100
as well as I wanted it to or, or

842
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.840
something, you know, there are real signals there. Um

843
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.620
But if you focus on those and kind of

844
00:45:52.629 --> 00:45:56.489
amplify those, then of course, um then of course

845
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.709
you end up with a, with a take on

846
00:45:58.719 --> 00:46:00.760
the world that will incline you to act in

847
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.500
the world in ways that harvest the sort of

848
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.429
information that confirms your predictions, you know, you avoid

849
00:46:06.439 --> 00:46:09.600
the party or you um or you start to

850
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.830
um to mess up your explanations and so on.

851
00:46:12.879 --> 00:46:19.159
Um So, so is it malfunctioning? Um THERE must

852
00:46:19.169 --> 00:46:21.919
be cases where there's something like a very physical

853
00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:25.570
malfunction involved. So, you know, if, um if dopamine

854
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:30.969
weighting, dopamine systems and other neurotransmitter systems are playing

855
00:46:30.979 --> 00:46:34.419
the major role that predictive processing thinks they're playing,

856
00:46:34.649 --> 00:46:39.409
they're the encoders of these precision weightings that modulate.

857
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.179
Um HOW, how much you uh how much value

858
00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:46.659
you're putting on prediction versus sensory information. If that

859
00:46:46.669 --> 00:46:49.840
stuff really, really starts to um to, to fire

860
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.689
almost randomly, then all kinds of crazy things are

861
00:46:52.699 --> 00:46:55.560
gonna happen to you. So that's malfunctioning, I think.

862
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.399
But it's quite likely that in an awful lot

863
00:46:58.409 --> 00:47:00.459
of the cases that we encounter in the real

864
00:47:00.469 --> 00:47:04.350
world like chronic pain and depression, there's no malfunction.

865
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.179
It's just a sort of a, it's just a

866
00:47:07.189 --> 00:47:11.320
history of kind of evidence accumulation and habit that

867
00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.379
is sort of slowly put you into a certain

868
00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:17.070
kind of hole and that hole is really, really

869
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.479
hard to get out of because you seem to

870
00:47:19.489 --> 00:47:22.540
be constantly getting information that confirms that your estimates

871
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.719
of how things are are correct. Um There's a,

872
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:28.280
there's some nice experiments with heat pads that show

873
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.620
these effects in perfectly normal subjects you know, you,

874
00:47:31.629 --> 00:47:34.179
you sort of, um, you, you set them up

875
00:47:34.189 --> 00:47:36.830
with a little um geometric cue that predicts a

876
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.080
certain kind of high or low intensity heat. Um

877
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:45.590
And then you, the subjects are all given, although

878
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.820
they don't know this the same amount of heat

879
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.560
through a heat pad. Now, unsurprisingly, the ones who

880
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.290
saw the geometric queue associated with a high reading

881
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.469
on the temperature scale report experiences of more heat,

882
00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:02.659
more pain than the others. But interestingly, no one

883
00:48:02.669 --> 00:48:07.159
ever updates their um no one ever updates their

884
00:48:07.169 --> 00:48:12.600
expectations after they've been uh presented with manipulated with

885
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:15.239
the real heat patch because they just think this

886
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:20.229
confirms their expectations of more or less heat because

887
00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:22.760
their sensory experience has been morphed in that direction.

888
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.790
So it's a sort of self fulfilling prophecy. There's

889
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.199
a a lot of these cycles of self fulfilling

890
00:48:28.209 --> 00:48:30.959
prophecy that float around in these, in these accounts.

891
00:48:30.969 --> 00:48:32.870
And I think they all have the same, the

892
00:48:32.879 --> 00:48:36.439
same character predictions in train experience that seems to

893
00:48:36.449 --> 00:48:39.739
confirm the predictions even when it would be a

894
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.679
lot better for you as an agent to push

895
00:48:42.689 --> 00:48:45.800
outside of that little bubble of prediction.

896
00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:51.439
Mhm But when it comes to neurology specifically, and

897
00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:55.280
the way we classify diseases or mental illnesses in

898
00:48:55.290 --> 00:49:00.300
psychiatry and psychology, would it would this framework have

899
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.419
implications there as well? I mean, in terms of

900
00:49:03.429 --> 00:49:07.000
how we think and theorize about mental illness.

901
00:49:08.189 --> 00:49:11.270
Um Yeah, I mean, nosology is one of those

902
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.750
words where I've never quite, it was a new

903
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.909
word to me when Carl Kristen introduced me to

904
00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.389
it. Um I think it means something like a,

905
00:49:17.399 --> 00:49:19.550
sort of, is it like a taxonomy? Something like

906
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.840
that? It's a sort of a, it's kind of

907
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:24.350
like a taxonomy into which these things fall and,

908
00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:27.459
yeah. So I think it would really make a

909
00:49:27.469 --> 00:49:31.879
difference to that because at the moment, the standard

910
00:49:31.889 --> 00:49:37.159
practice is still to taxonomies according to symptoms, really,

911
00:49:37.169 --> 00:49:40.649
it's to gather things together as you know, schizophrenia

912
00:49:40.659 --> 00:49:44.030
or autism spectrum condition or, you know, whatever um

913
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.719
depression PTSD according to patterns of symptoms. But it

914
00:49:48.729 --> 00:49:52.229
would be a lot more interesting if you could

915
00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:56.080
um gather things together, if you could taxonomies on

916
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.469
the basis of underlying causes, something like the, you

917
00:49:59.479 --> 00:50:02.320
know, the dial on prediction is turned up in

918
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:05.280
this particular area. The dial on sensory information is

919
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.050
turned up in this other area that, that sort

920
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.729
of stuff that might yield a different carving of

921
00:50:11.739 --> 00:50:19.260
the space of um both neurotypical and atypical response.

922
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.399
So, so maybe one day, I, I've sort of

923
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:23.010
said this a couple of times in talks, but

924
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.760
I still quite like the image. Um MAYBE one

925
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.000
day we'll have a sort of periodic table of

926
00:50:29.104 --> 00:50:33.125
experiential variation. So you can see how if these

927
00:50:33.135 --> 00:50:35.784
different dials are turned differently, you get stuff that

928
00:50:35.794 --> 00:50:38.304
looks like depression or it looks like PTSD or

929
00:50:38.314 --> 00:50:41.235
it looks like autism spectrum condition, but you get

930
00:50:41.245 --> 00:50:44.324
them in a whole range of different flavors and

931
00:50:44.334 --> 00:50:47.625
ways according to the precise settings on those dials,

932
00:50:47.635 --> 00:50:50.485
that would be, that would be such an exciting

933
00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:54.165
development in a way because just like the periodic

934
00:50:54.175 --> 00:50:58.250
table was it would, it immediately, um it immediately

935
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.449
suggests experiments and interventions and you know, what would

936
00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:04.370
happen if we did this or could we control

937
00:51:04.379 --> 00:51:07.620
this by some kind of, you know, maybe even

938
00:51:07.629 --> 00:51:09.770
by some kind of gene intervention. And,

939
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.590
and do you think that this approach or this

940
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.679
framework could also pave the way toward more effective

941
00:51:19.689 --> 00:51:22.290
treatments in the case of psychiatry?

942
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:28.209
Um Yes, I think so. Um AT the same

943
00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:30.860
time, so, so OK, let me um let me

944
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:33.030
pick on what, what I think is the best

945
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.110
um poster case for this, which is so called

946
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:40.050
pain reprocessing theory. So people that have chronic pain

947
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.250
and chronic back pain is a great example. Um

948
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.899
CHRONIC back pain in about 82% of cases, there

949
00:51:46.909 --> 00:51:51.620
seems to be no sufficient underlying structural cause that

950
00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:55.570
correlates with the, the way the pain is experienced,

951
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.600
the degree of pain, the context of pain. And

952
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.260
this is not just across individuals, but even, you

953
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.280
know, the same individual uh in different times of

954
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:09.070
day and different weeks. Um So, so if you

955
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.560
take something like that, one of the interventions um

956
00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:16.189
goes by the name of pain reprocessing theory is

957
00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:19.949
to get people to first of all, first of

958
00:52:19.959 --> 00:52:23.820
all, you introduce people to the general theoretical understanding

959
00:52:23.989 --> 00:52:26.830
that we've been sharing today, the general idea that

960
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.469
experience is always constructed on the basis of this

961
00:52:30.479 --> 00:52:35.219
mixture of prediction and um sensory information. So you

962
00:52:35.229 --> 00:52:38.020
are getting the sensory information from, you know, various

963
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.120
um various nerves and you know, used to be

964
00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:44.030
called noso seor, but that seems wrong because, you

965
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.820
know, pain is just not the sort of thing

966
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:48.659
that you exactly sense. You know, things happen to

967
00:52:48.669 --> 00:52:51.780
those nerves and then pain happens to us because

968
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.620
of the way we're crunching that information together with

969
00:52:55.629 --> 00:52:57.889
our own expectations, with our own assessment of the

970
00:52:57.899 --> 00:53:01.350
context, with our own um estimates of certainty and

971
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.600
uncertainty when all of that comes together, pain is

972
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:10.120
experienced. So once people are introduced to that, then

973
00:53:10.129 --> 00:53:12.280
it's a fairly small step to say. So, you

974
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.260
know, well, there's actually wiggle room in here, you

975
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:19.750
can control your own pain experiences to some extent

976
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.280
by changing the the set of predictions that your

977
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.870
brain is bringing to bear. How do you do

978
00:53:25.879 --> 00:53:30.110
that? You mostly do that by acting in ways

979
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.080
that go beyond where the current pain signal is

980
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.919
kind of telling you to go. So people often

981
00:53:37.929 --> 00:53:40.340
talk here about uh pain as a kind of

982
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.399
warning light as if it's a kind of warning

983
00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:44.879
light that is telling you don't keep doing this

984
00:53:44.889 --> 00:53:46.429
cos if you do any more of this, you're

985
00:53:46.439 --> 00:53:48.729
really gonna hurt yourself and, you know, that's true

986
00:53:48.739 --> 00:53:50.919
for acute pain. That's true. If I've just, um,

987
00:53:50.929 --> 00:53:53.239
twisted my ankle on a mountain walk or something.

988
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.899
Yeah. Don't keep walking on that. It's gonna get

989
00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:58.219
a lot worse. Um, CHRONIC pain doesn't seem to

990
00:53:58.229 --> 00:54:00.750
behave like that as people say, it's more as

991
00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.379
if the warning light itself starts to be the

992
00:54:03.389 --> 00:54:06.110
problem. You've got the warning light on, it's saying

993
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.989
don't do anymore. But actually if the warning light's

994
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.020
malfunctioning because it's your own predictions of the pain

995
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.120
you're about to experience that are causing um at

996
00:54:16.129 --> 00:54:19.949
least part of that pain. Then um the right

997
00:54:19.959 --> 00:54:24.070
thing to do is to behave, to behave um

998
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.310
in ways that for a while you will find

999
00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.709
uncomfortable, you know, for a while, this is sort

1000
00:54:29.719 --> 00:54:31.739
of like this is like continuing to drive with

1001
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.479
the warning light flashing. But the good thing is

1002
00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:36.489
that over time, it looks as if just by

1003
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.360
continuing to drive the vehicle, the warning light gets

1004
00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.689
a bit dimmer. It's as if your brain starts

1005
00:54:41.699 --> 00:54:46.090
to learn that actually the expected consequences weren't quite

1006
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.570
as bad as you kind of thought. They were

1007
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.290
gonna be. You can keep on acting. For example,

1008
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.629
it's not painful enough to stop you acting, you

1009
00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:56.449
then downgrade your sort of um picture of how

1010
00:54:56.459 --> 00:55:00.159
bad the pain actually is. And so these interventions

1011
00:55:00.169 --> 00:55:02.929
are all really go through action, I think, push

1012
00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:06.689
back against the hidden unconscious predictions that are structure

1013
00:55:06.699 --> 00:55:10.080
in the experience of chronic pain. And this is

1014
00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.370
the um chronic back pain is the one case

1015
00:55:12.379 --> 00:55:14.239
that has been studied by a couple of pretty

1016
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:20.189
big, um you know, proper controlled randomized, um big

1017
00:55:20.199 --> 00:55:23.750
um big numbers of participants stuff. There's a couple

1018
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.449
of papers out there that show that there are

1019
00:55:25.459 --> 00:55:28.169
some very, very good results here, sort of, you

1020
00:55:28.179 --> 00:55:32.020
know, 70 to 80% of the of the chronic

1021
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.520
back pain patients reported improvement in ways that went

1022
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.229
beyond the improvement you got with placebo um under

1023
00:55:39.239 --> 00:55:43.469
randomized conditions. So no, it's a pretty, pretty promising

1024
00:55:43.479 --> 00:55:45.169
that I think is a general picture. These are

1025
00:55:45.179 --> 00:55:47.610
the sort of interventions that we knew about. Anyway,

1026
00:55:47.669 --> 00:55:51.429
think about cognitive behavioral therapy um for um for

1027
00:55:51.439 --> 00:55:54.959
depression, for example. Um BUT they now fall into

1028
00:55:54.969 --> 00:55:59.250
place as part of this as flowing naturally from

1029
00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.989
this picture of prediction is doing a lot of

1030
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.429
the heavy lifting and constructing experience.

1031
00:56:04.709 --> 00:56:08.679
So one aspect of our cognition or at least

1032
00:56:08.689 --> 00:56:10.870
I think it's part of our recognition as well

1033
00:56:10.879 --> 00:56:13.600
that I haven't asked you about yet has to

1034
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.919
do with emotion. So what is the emotion and

1035
00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:20.300
how do you understand the emotion according to this

1036
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:20.909
framework?

1037
00:56:22.229 --> 00:56:25.540
Yeah. So emotion, that's the other big player I

1038
00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:29.709
think really um action is, is I think the

1039
00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:32.929
sort of the the biggest player in the predictive

1040
00:56:32.939 --> 00:56:37.820
process in arena, but emotion is somehow um right

1041
00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.949
in there sculpting action patterns after all, you know,

1042
00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:44.250
um what emotion in some ways is, is a

1043
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.510
kind of extra waiting um either in favor of

1044
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.580
or against particular patterns of response and action. So,

1045
00:56:51.919 --> 00:56:54.189
if we want to start thinking about emotion, using

1046
00:56:54.199 --> 00:56:57.310
this framework, I think we need to look at

1047
00:56:57.379 --> 00:57:02.820
two things. One of them is um interception. So

1048
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.949
uh our sense of what's going on or our

1049
00:57:05.959 --> 00:57:08.229
brain sense of what's going on in our own

1050
00:57:08.239 --> 00:57:11.219
bodies, um our brains, sense of our heart rate,

1051
00:57:11.229 --> 00:57:13.139
our brain's sense of what's going on in the

1052
00:57:13.149 --> 00:57:18.149
gut. Um AND so on. So it, it, it

1053
00:57:18.159 --> 00:57:19.760
does seem this is the sort of stuff that

1054
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.580
William James as you know, is, is kind of

1055
00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.229
most famous for, for saying it does seem as

1056
00:57:25.239 --> 00:57:28.989
if the felt nature of emotion is linked in

1057
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.070
some deep and important way to our appreciation of

1058
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.760
our own bodily responses. Um uh In, in William

1059
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.709
James is sort of a famous phrase of feeling,

1060
00:57:39.729 --> 00:57:41.699
you know, that there would be nothing left of

1061
00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:44.219
the feeling of fear if you subtracted the fast

1062
00:57:44.229 --> 00:57:47.030
beat in heart. Um You know, that's probably not

1063
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.570
quite right actually. Um BUT nonetheless, what's emerged in

1064
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.409
quite a lot of experiments is that if you

1065
00:57:55.419 --> 00:57:59.870
do give someone sensory information about say a fast

1066
00:57:59.879 --> 00:58:02.350
beating heart, then that can change the way that

1067
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.129
they perceive the world. So false cardiac feedback and

1068
00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:07.889
my heart beating quicker than it really is can

1069
00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:10.149
make me see what would otherwise be a neutral

1070
00:58:10.159 --> 00:58:13.570
face as an angry face. Um And so my

1071
00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.090
sort of pick up on emotions in others, there

1072
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.070
is being constructed through my pickup on my own

1073
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.909
bodily state. Um And in general, I think emotions

1074
00:58:22.919 --> 00:58:26.790
involve bodily states in ways that are deeply interleaved

1075
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.709
with our best grip on the context. Um Think

1076
00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:31.709
about the emotion of fear that I might feel

1077
00:58:31.719 --> 00:58:34.719
if my heart is just suddenly beating quickly, very,

1078
00:58:34.729 --> 00:58:37.889
very different to if my heart's beating quickly because

1079
00:58:37.899 --> 00:58:39.830
I've been exercising at the gym, you know, I'm

1080
00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.929
not gonna, not gonna feel fear at that point.

1081
00:58:41.939 --> 00:58:44.340
Not, not, not for a minute or two anyway.

1082
00:58:44.729 --> 00:58:49.790
Um So, um so yeah, so that's one element

1083
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.719
is this uh that what whatever felt emotion turns

1084
00:58:53.729 --> 00:58:56.669
out to be, it's linked in some important way

1085
00:58:56.709 --> 00:59:00.209
to appreciation of our own bodily states. And then

1086
00:59:00.219 --> 00:59:04.010
the other thing is, and this is slightly technical,

1087
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.219
but I think it's worth doing is our appreciation

1088
00:59:07.229 --> 00:59:10.580
of the um what is sometimes called the slope

1089
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:13.489
of our own prediction error minimization. So I better

1090
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.379
unpack that a bit. But, you know, brains like

1091
00:59:16.389 --> 00:59:20.469
ours are trying to quash prediction error. That's kind

1092
00:59:20.479 --> 00:59:22.300
of what they like to do, bring prediction error

1093
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:28.489
down within acceptable levels. Um But because we're evolved

1094
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.489
creatures, I think we've actually ended up with brains

1095
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.300
that don't just want to quash prediction error. What

1096
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:38.500
they really want to do is to curate useful

1097
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.790
prediction error so that they can learn more about

1098
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.469
the world that they inhabit or that we inhabit.

1099
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.629
Um That means actually acting in the world in

1100
00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:51.040
ways that will cause some prediction error, the kind

1101
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.780
of prediction error that you can resolve by getting

1102
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.250
a better grip on how your world is. Um

1103
00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.979
So, so the the the work that I'm trying

1104
01:00:00.989 --> 01:00:02.810
to point to here is sometimes called work in

1105
01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.510
artificial curiosity. And the idea is that if you

1106
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:12.239
have AAA prediction based system that is interested in

1107
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.020
getting just the right amount of prediction error to

1108
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.949
do good learning, then it will avoid situations that

1109
01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:21.540
are too boring because you're not getting prediction error,

1110
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.159
you can't really learn anything from them. It will

1111
01:00:24.169 --> 01:00:27.709
avoid situations that are too difficult because in those

1112
01:00:27.719 --> 01:00:30.729
situations, you're getting loads of prediction error and you

1113
01:00:30.739 --> 01:00:33.629
can't tune your model or improve your model to

1114
01:00:33.639 --> 01:00:35.790
get rid of it. Um So we tend to

1115
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.080
avoid those and then there's the little sweet spot

1116
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:42.090
where you're getting enough new information from the world

1117
01:00:42.169 --> 01:00:45.110
to, to do some useful learning, but not so

1118
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.840
much that you can't cope with it or so

1119
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.110
little that you're bored. And that I think is,

1120
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.860
I think a lot of our, our sort of,

1121
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.669
I was gonna say human level emotions, I don't

1122
01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:57.879
know, probably all animals have bits to, to, to

1123
01:00:57.889 --> 01:00:59.889
be honest. But a lot of what we think

1124
01:00:59.899 --> 01:01:03.100
about when we think about emotion, I think is

1125
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:07.520
our grip on our own um rate of minimization

1126
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.889
of prediction error. We like those situations in which

1127
01:01:10.899 --> 01:01:12.610
we're doing better than we thought we would at

1128
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.840
minimizing error, we avoid situations in which we're doing

1129
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.010
worse than we thought. And situations in which there's

1130
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.060
none to minimize are just too boring to worry

1131
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:24.979
about. Um So, so those are the two things

1132
01:01:24.989 --> 01:01:28.149
that I think um this framework can bring to

1133
01:01:28.159 --> 01:01:31.649
the study of emotion. One is let's look at

1134
01:01:31.659 --> 01:01:34.899
predictions of bodily state and the other is let's

1135
01:01:34.909 --> 01:01:39.340
look at um let's look at the, the actual

1136
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:43.520
profile of prediction error minimization and see where it's

1137
01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:45.679
most effective for driving learning.

1138
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.600
And would this framework also have something to say

1139
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:56.639
about consciousness and more specifically, even the hard problem

1140
01:01:56.649 --> 01:01:57.830
of consciousness?

1141
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:01.330
Yeah. Uh ALMOST made me choke on my water

1142
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:09.790
there. Um Yeah. Well, who can say um I

1143
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.530
want to say yes, but I, but the only

1144
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.139
way I can say yes is by doing what

1145
01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:17.850
many people would say is changing the subject and

1146
01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:22.129
not talking about consciousness at all. So, um I

1147
01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.510
want to say yes, because I think it helps

1148
01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:30.290
us make progress with both the nature of feeling

1149
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.719
in, in the ways that we were just talking

1150
01:02:31.729 --> 01:02:34.770
about. Um That's to say the role of um

1151
01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:39.760
bodily prediction in the construction of response. Um And

1152
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:44.679
also um our tendency to think that there's a

1153
01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:48.219
hard problem. So what I think these frameworks can

1154
01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:51.729
do, but this is ridiculously speculative. But I think

1155
01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:54.810
that these frameworks fall into place alongside stuff a

1156
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.860
little bit like um Michael Graziano's attention schemer account,

1157
01:02:59.129 --> 01:03:03.270
um sort of they fall into a space where

1158
01:03:03.439 --> 01:03:07.020
the where brains like ours are going to yield

1159
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.850
pictures of how the world is that present the

1160
01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.510
world as a very puzzling place to us a

1161
01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.649
place. So if I want to predict my own

1162
01:03:14.659 --> 01:03:17.540
behaviors, a good way to do it is for

1163
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.500
me to think about myself as a system that

1164
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.560
has some likes and dislikes. Um You know, this

1165
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.520
is a Dan Dennett example. Um uh You know,

1166
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:27.469
I I I'm the kind of person that uh

1167
01:03:27.479 --> 01:03:30.340
that likes cheese and doesn't like honey or something

1168
01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:33.270
like that. Um And so we sort of populate

1169
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.899
our own picture of the world with these very

1170
01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:41.020
simple atomic notions like liking or disliking of uh

1171
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.479
of cheese or honey. Um When of course, what's

1172
01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:46.659
really going on underneath is uh a long trajectory

1173
01:03:46.669 --> 01:03:50.580
of encounters, some of which um some of which

1174
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:55.520
activated enough, uh enough, sort of um enough of

1175
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:57.659
the, the pleasure circuitry in the brain if you

1176
01:03:57.669 --> 01:03:59.580
like to get me to come back for more.

1177
01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.100
Um A lot of this is context dependent. A

1178
01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:04.689
lot depends on also on stuff that I may

1179
01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:08.870
have just accidentally run across in my explorations of

1180
01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:12.320
the world, what your parents said, et cetera. Um

1181
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.679
Maybe even some stuff at the level of, of,

1182
01:04:14.689 --> 01:04:17.479
of the distribution of taste receptors in, in the

1183
01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:19.149
mouth. So, you know, there's a lot you could

1184
01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:23.590
say from a, a kind of non Cartesian standpoint

1185
01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.439
here. And I think if you end up with

1186
01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:30.120
a picture where you can say something like this,

1187
01:04:30.129 --> 01:04:32.090
if I built a robot like this, it might

1188
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.780
start to say things like, oh, I think I

1189
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.729
must be a Cartesian mind because I don't really

1190
01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:41.689
understand how all these thoughts and feelings that I've

1191
01:04:41.699 --> 01:04:45.510
populated my picture of the world with um can

1192
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.409
correspond to um you know, whatever physics tells us

1193
01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.429
is going on. How could that be? Um Well,

1194
01:04:52.439 --> 01:04:55.050
it doesn't have to be, you know, basically, we've

1195
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.399
um this is just what's in our representation of

1196
01:04:58.409 --> 01:05:01.040
the world if you like. So if in our

1197
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:04.080
representation of the world, we have all those things

1198
01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:07.469
that's not a problem for physical is, that's not

1199
01:05:07.479 --> 01:05:10.639
a problem, you know, that's not the, that's just

1200
01:05:10.649 --> 01:05:13.050
the sort of thing that physical is um can,

1201
01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.810
can easily accommodate because, you know, uh that's what

1202
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.010
the brain is busy doing. You know, look, even

1203
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.570
I don't feel satisfied with this response. It doesn't,

1204
01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.050
it does seem to me when I, when I

1205
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.870
chat with Dave Chalmers, he will always say, yeah,

1206
01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:29.429
but I can kind of see there's a coherent

1207
01:05:29.439 --> 01:05:31.810
story to be told there. But do you really

1208
01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.620
think that um you know, the, the particular way

1209
01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:38.370
that this microphone feels if you run your hands

1210
01:05:38.495 --> 01:05:40.985
around it or the particular taste of the Pina

1211
01:05:40.995 --> 01:05:43.274
Colada or, you know, the look of the sunset.

1212
01:05:43.284 --> 01:05:46.274
Can they really just be, um, you know, what's

1213
01:05:46.284 --> 01:05:50.955
going on in my current most successful predictive model

1214
01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:53.625
of how things are, why would run in that

1215
01:05:53.635 --> 01:05:55.514
model feel like anything at all? Why wouldn't it

1216
01:05:55.524 --> 01:05:58.084
just feel like nothing or feel like making some

1217
01:05:58.094 --> 01:06:01.125
judgments about the world but not real feelings? I

1218
01:06:01.135 --> 01:06:04.270
think that's a real challenge. Um But at the

1219
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.570
same time, I think that if we did start

1220
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.969
to be able to build systems that um that

1221
01:06:13.649 --> 01:06:16.479
seem to get puzzled about their own experience in

1222
01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:18.929
the ways we do, that would be a really,

1223
01:06:18.939 --> 01:06:22.129
really, maybe a bit of a turning point in

1224
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:26.030
uh our sort of confrontation with a hard problem.

1225
01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:28.830
And also if we had something like that periodic

1226
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.469
table of experiential variation that I was talking about

1227
01:06:32.479 --> 01:06:35.469
earlier, if we had that and we could use

1228
01:06:35.479 --> 01:06:40.090
that to uh launch interventions that would change people's

1229
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.850
experiences in ways that we could now predict. Then

1230
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.949
I think we might start to think, oh, maybe

1231
01:06:45.959 --> 01:06:48.370
that was a hard problem. You know, now we've

1232
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.530
got a picture we can intervene on the world.

1233
01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.729
Maybe if you live with that for long enough,

1234
01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.389
you just start to think, oh, I don't know

1235
01:06:54.399 --> 01:06:55.939
why we ever thought there was a hard problem.

1236
01:06:55.949 --> 01:06:58.370
You know, this, this, this is, this is the

1237
01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:03.840
solution and we've not reconstructed anything terribly unexpected there.

1238
01:07:04.189 --> 01:07:08.219
Um So, so, yeah, but anyway, the, the my

1239
01:07:08.229 --> 01:07:09.629
sort of history with the hard problem is a

1240
01:07:09.639 --> 01:07:13.750
lot of skirmishes. Never, never quite uh no surprise,

1241
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.469
never quite, never quite get in anything that I

1242
01:07:16.479 --> 01:07:19.129
think is fully satisfactory. But I do think it's

1243
01:07:19.139 --> 01:07:25.370
worth exploring. Um If you like how a, how

1244
01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:32.709
a intercept inflected prediction machine capable of launching actions

1245
01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:36.320
in the world would end up depicting its own

1246
01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:38.939
mental space if you like its own, you know,

1247
01:07:38.949 --> 01:07:43.580
the the originations of its own actions, maybe that's

1248
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.719
a way to proceed

1249
01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:49.649
a and are there any ways for us to

1250
01:07:49.659 --> 01:07:53.389
take control of our own experiences? I mean, the

1251
01:07:53.399 --> 01:07:55.669
ways we experience the world?

1252
01:07:56.649 --> 01:07:58.909
Yeah. So that one, that one I think is,

1253
01:07:58.919 --> 01:08:00.590
is a lot of, thank thank you for that.

1254
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.510
It's a lot more tractable than the hard problem.

1255
01:08:02.889 --> 01:08:06.810
Um Yeah. So, you know, I think just by

1256
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.620
appreciating the the role of prediction in the construction

1257
01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:15.919
of experience, we can start to um understand the

1258
01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:18.569
kinds of interventions that are likely to be helpful

1259
01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.520
and some of those are interventions that we can

1260
01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:24.799
do for ourselves. Um So reframing is, I think

1261
01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:28.009
maybe the easiest of all the examples here. Um

1262
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.520
If you take something like my feeling of nervousness

1263
01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.950
before going on stage or doing a talk, I

1264
01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:36.069
was, I was getting those uh those tingles, you

1265
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.220
know, about half an hour before we, we fired

1266
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:41.390
this session up and I've learned to reframe them,

1267
01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:43.779
not as sort of nervousness or, oh, you know,

1268
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.580
I'm gonna be so nervous. I, I mess my

1269
01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:49.330
performance up but rather, uh, chemical readiness to deliver

1270
01:08:49.339 --> 01:08:51.299
a good performance. You know, it's a tingle of

1271
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.430
adrenaline. It's, uh, it's a good thing. So that

1272
01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:59.060
reframing really helps cos it stops you feeling nervous

1273
01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.959
because of your feelings because you no longer interpret

1274
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.569
those feelings as nervousness, you interpret them in some

1275
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.990
other way. Um So that's reframing like that or

1276
01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.009
it's the same thing the dentist is trying to

1277
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.549
do to you when they say this will just

1278
01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.379
be a gentle tickle or you might feel a

1279
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:16.660
little pressure here. Um These things are, are very

1280
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:21.649
useful interventions. Um The pain reprocessing theory stuff, that's

1281
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.950
another kind of intervention which is basically just um

1282
01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:28.890
remember that we're, we're machines that learn by action.

1283
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.569
And so we can't reprogram ourselves in the most

1284
01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:37.919
interesting and powerful ways. Normally, just by saying things,

1285
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.759
you know, I think verbal reframing is powerful. It

1286
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:45.299
often can do some work. But where you've got

1287
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.169
something that is really, really deeply ingrained and is

1288
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.500
causing all sorts of um of trouble and self

1289
01:09:51.509 --> 01:09:55.140
fulfilling um action loops, then you need to change

1290
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.270
the actions before you can change the flow of

1291
01:09:57.279 --> 01:10:01.209
unconscious prediction that is um that is causing the

1292
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.330
trouble. And there, I think that just uh sort

1293
01:10:04.339 --> 01:10:07.680
of appreciating that you've often got to um got

1294
01:10:07.689 --> 01:10:09.399
to as they say fake it before you make

1295
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.149
it, you know, start to start getting out there

1296
01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.859
and doing more despite the pain, despite the depression,

1297
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.660
despite the nervousness and in some cases that's, uh,

1298
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:20.910
that's gonna help. Um, THERE'S no one size fits

1299
01:10:20.919 --> 01:10:23.359
all here. Uh, YOU know, that, that, that can

1300
01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:26.629
make it sound far too good. Uh, ONE good

1301
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.439
thing I think about these frameworks is that although

1302
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:32.759
they can occasionally sound a little bit like the

1303
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.330
power of positive thinking, they're really enormously far away

1304
01:10:37.339 --> 01:10:41.520
from that because just positive thinking won't really do

1305
01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:44.580
you any good. Um What you need to do

1306
01:10:44.589 --> 01:10:48.209
is is in train a whole cascade of predictions

1307
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.939
that get things done and reveal the world to

1308
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.009
you. Most of those are unconscious and you just

1309
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.529
have to um repeat the cycle of interaction in

1310
01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.899
the world again and again and again to tune

1311
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:02.939
that machinery. So it's a little bit like becoming

1312
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:05.689
an expert car driver. If I just start to

1313
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.330
predict that I'm gonna be able to drive the

1314
01:11:07.339 --> 01:11:10.100
car through this tiny little opening in the traffic.

1315
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:12.089
Uh That's not a good thing for a novice

1316
01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.459
to try and do because they just don't have

1317
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.319
the underlying structure of skills to cash that prediction

1318
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:21.609
out in bodily action. So you then need, you

1319
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:24.120
need the full training regimes of learning to drive.

1320
01:11:24.479 --> 01:11:26.799
And once you've done all that, then of course,

1321
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:29.080
what you want to do sometimes is make a

1322
01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.899
a kind of optimistic but realistic prediction that I

1323
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:34.970
can get through that space. Um You know, maybe

1324
01:11:34.979 --> 01:11:37.490
it's important, maybe you're taking someone to hospital in

1325
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.359
an emergency run or something. So it's really important

1326
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:43.370
to get through that space, then you want um

1327
01:11:43.379 --> 01:11:47.470
realistic yet optimistic prediction. Uh And that I think

1328
01:11:47.479 --> 01:11:49.399
is the uh is the kind of take home

1329
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:53.000
message for uh self care here is that very

1330
01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:57.240
often uh realistic but mildly optimistic prediction is where

1331
01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:57.910
we want to be.

1332
01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.089
And what do we know specifically about the effects

1333
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.209
of psychedelic drugs do does that also apply here

1334
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.180
in the context of this framework?

1335
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.220
Yeah, that's a really interesting case. It's not my

1336
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:14.850
specialty, but I've hung out a little bit with

1337
01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:17.339
Carhart Harris and others that work on uh that

1338
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:22.319
work on these things. Um The, the picture that

1339
01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:25.799
I take away from that is that um there

1340
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:28.080
is a kind of, there's a sort of dose

1341
01:12:28.089 --> 01:12:32.990
dependent response where at low doses you're kind of

1342
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.020
intervening on um low level predictions. And so, you

1343
01:12:38.029 --> 01:12:40.750
know, you may get visual effects, for example, with

1344
01:12:40.759 --> 01:12:42.450
um with a kind of low dose of uh

1345
01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:46.830
psilocybin or um or uh a ouca or something.

1346
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.169
Um But then at higher doses, it looks as

1347
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.220
if the cell groups that are affected are preferentially,

1348
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:57.270
those that are deeper in the processing pathways. So

1349
01:12:57.279 --> 01:12:59.970
more abstract stuff to do with your picture of

1350
01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:03.390
yourself and your place in the universe. Um Now,

1351
01:13:03.399 --> 01:13:06.500
if you can uh relax the grip of our

1352
01:13:06.509 --> 01:13:10.540
self predictions at those high levels, that could be

1353
01:13:10.549 --> 01:13:13.729
very beneficial. You know, if you've been um chronically

1354
01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.339
depressed for, for, for many, many years, relaxing the

1355
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:19.640
self predictions that might be at the heart of

1356
01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:22.600
some of your depression and just experiencing the world

1357
01:13:22.609 --> 01:13:27.560
without, that could be really revelatory. Um, THE same

1358
01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.680
for sort of, um kind of, uh uh sort

1359
01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:32.899
of end of life. Uh And the way you

1360
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:36.700
treat your own, um your own end of life,

1361
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:40.060
um stuff, if you've been diagnosed with terminal cancer

1362
01:13:40.069 --> 01:13:43.399
or, or something, um again, these are all cases

1363
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:47.299
where it looks as if even a single experience

1364
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.470
of, of feeling the world differently by relaxing those

1365
01:13:50.479 --> 01:13:53.959
high level self predictions can really change the way

1366
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:55.669
that you feel for a long, long time, like

1367
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.500
maybe for a year or a couple of years

1368
01:13:57.509 --> 01:14:01.979
or longer. Um So it's a really interesting account.

1369
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:06.950
It's about the role of psychedelics in relaxing high

1370
01:14:06.959 --> 01:14:11.640
level self predictions, enabling you to enabling other other

1371
01:14:11.649 --> 01:14:14.040
pictures of how things are and what your relation

1372
01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:16.899
to the universe is to fall into place. Um

1373
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.520
What is it? Uh THE Rebus model? That's what

1374
01:14:19.529 --> 01:14:22.279
I think Carhart Harris somewhere calls it relaxed beliefs

1375
01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:26.569
under psychedelics. Um And it's this sort of relaxing

1376
01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.529
of the predictions that are um that are currently

1377
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.350
structuring your, your picture of yourself and your relation

1378
01:14:33.359 --> 01:14:35.919
to the universe. And allowing new stuff to, to

1379
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:39.240
take shape. So another metaphor people use there is

1380
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.589
shaking the snow globe, you know, like those little

1381
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.569
little toys with, with snow in them, shake it

1382
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.229
up and then you can uh then you can

1383
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.970
maybe get some new patterns to fall.

1384
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.819
So we're talking about different kinds of interventions. My

1385
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:57.129
last question will be about meditation. So what do

1386
01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.629
we know about what we can do through meditation?

1387
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:04.470
Yeah. Meditation is a very, very interesting 11 of

1388
01:15:04.479 --> 01:15:07.509
my, um one of my ex colleagues, uh Mark

1389
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.830
Miller has uh an awful lot of work on

1390
01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:14.180
this. Um IS I think director or co-director of

1391
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:17.500
a meditation center in Australia uh sort of meditation

1392
01:15:17.509 --> 01:15:23.799
and cognitive science center. Um So it looks to

1393
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.649
me as if for those, for whom it really

1394
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.640
works and maybe that's those who put in the

1395
01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.830
hours uh cos it's never really worked for me.

1396
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.810
Um But for those for whom it really works,

1397
01:15:33.819 --> 01:15:36.959
it seems as if meditation uh gives you greater

1398
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:42.040
control over your own precision waiting mechanism. So, you

1399
01:15:42.049 --> 01:15:44.919
know, the precision waiting stuff here is the um

1400
01:15:44.979 --> 01:15:50.180
is the the self estimated uncertainty that balances the

1401
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:54.950
role of prediction against sensory information. So suppose that

1402
01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:58.330
um meditation by training you to, you know, to

1403
01:15:58.339 --> 01:16:00.680
focus all your attention on the breath or to

1404
01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.649
focus all your attention on uh on the stone

1405
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.810
or something like that or to experience your thoughts

1406
01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:09.310
without holding on to them just letting them kind

1407
01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:11.830
of come and go. If you do that enough

1408
01:16:11.839 --> 01:16:16.770
and you gain more control over precision assignments, then

1409
01:16:16.779 --> 01:16:18.669
it looks as if you gain more control over

1410
01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.529
your own experience of the world, you can, um,

1411
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.660
you should be able to confront what would otherwise

1412
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:27.740
be very uncomfortable situations in a way that is

1413
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.240
a bit less uncomfortable because you don't allow that

1414
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:36.540
information, the high precision it would otherwise be allowed.

1415
01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:39.490
So that means it doesn't drive all of your

1416
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.729
ongoing processing. There's some space for other stuff to,

1417
01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:48.080
to still go on. Um There's also some evidence

1418
01:16:48.089 --> 01:16:53.810
that highly experienced meditators have some power over um

1419
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:57.970
over the, the way that they experience certain kinds

1420
01:16:57.979 --> 01:17:01.629
of um manipulation that are common in cognitive science

1421
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.229
like binocular rivalry where you're kind of there, there,

1422
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.459
there are two coherent interpretations of an image that's

1423
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:11.160
in front of you. Um People tend to flick

1424
01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:14.169
from one to the other one interpretation. Uh SORT

1425
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.589
of takes root does all the prediction, but you've

1426
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.750
still got little bits of prediction error coming up

1427
01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:21.049
from the other one. So that pushes the first

1428
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.290
one out. The other one comes in that cycle

1429
01:17:23.299 --> 01:17:27.319
keeps on repeating. Um EXPERIENCED meditators seem able to

1430
01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:30.689
intervene on that cycle. Just hold the mixed position

1431
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.609
where you're seeing both images at once or hold

1432
01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.609
one of the two positions that suggests to me

1433
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.129
um real control over precision. Waiting.

1434
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.529
Great. So the book is again the experience machine,

1435
01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.189
how our minds predict and shape reality. I'm leaving

1436
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.950
a linked with in the there it is very

1437
01:17:49.959 --> 01:17:53.279
nice cover. By the way, I'm leaving it, I'm

1438
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.770
leaving a link with, sorry, in the description down

1439
01:17:55.779 --> 01:17:59.209
below. And uh Andy just before we go. Are

1440
01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:02.319
there any places on the internet where people can

1441
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:04.160
find you and your work?

1442
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:09.109
Uh Yeah. Um Well, there's um if you just

1443
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.299
Google Andy Clark Sussex, you will get sent towards

1444
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:14.669
the. Um I think it's called the Sussex Research

1445
01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.979
Explorer or something where all the, all the publications

1446
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:21.490
are, there are some talks that are available online

1447
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.350
and the one that I would most point people

1448
01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:29.049
to is um uh a royal institution discourse. Um

1449
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.569
So the royal institution has a series called Discourses.

1450
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.020
And I, I think that was a really, really

1451
01:18:34.029 --> 01:18:36.450
fun session. It was quite a long session. The

1452
01:18:36.459 --> 01:18:39.270
questions went really well. And so you want this

1453
01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:41.569
sort of account put together in a, in a

1454
01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.240
kind of way that seemed to make sense to

1455
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.569
me at the time, run through all the stuff

1456
01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:48.600
we talked about today. Um Well, not all of

1457
01:18:48.609 --> 01:18:51.290
it didn't do emotion, I think. Um BUT quite

1458
01:18:51.299 --> 01:18:54.009
a lot of it uh with um further examples

1459
01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.680
and some of the big questions that are left

1460
01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:59.049
open, like stuff like um what really is the

1461
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:04.100
relation between um between if you like conscious prediction

1462
01:19:04.109 --> 01:19:06.740
and all that unconscious prediction that you know, there

1463
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.899
are lots of big questions left and that's one

1464
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.169
of them. So yeah, thank you.

1465
01:19:11.009 --> 01:19:13.930
Yeah. So thank you so much for again, for

1466
01:19:13.939 --> 01:19:16.470
