00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.450
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.489
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:09.890
today I'm joined by Doctor Ian James Kidd. He's

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.239
an associate professor at the Department of Philosophy at

5
00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.729
the University of Nottingham and today we're talking about

6
00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:21.010
philosophical misanthropy. So, Doctor Kidd, welcome to the show.

7
00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:22.879
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.489
Thank you, Ricardo. Pleasure to be here. Looking forward

9
00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:26.290
to our conversation.

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.159
OK, so let's start perhaps with the most basic

11
00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.599
question here. So, what is philosophical misanthropy? And since

12
00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:41.650
we are talking the uh philosophical take on misanthropy,

13
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.380
how does it differ from the way people commonly

14
00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:48.639
talk about misanthropy?

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.090
Well, there's a distinction I want to draw between

16
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.299
philosophical and vernacular misanthropy. So in everyday vernacular language,

17
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.439
misanthropy means something like a hatred or a distrust

18
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.819
or contempt for human beings, maybe individuals or the

19
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.339
collectives. And I want to say that at best

20
00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.629
is one extreme kind of misanthropy. So in the

21
00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.489
philosophical sense, misanthropy is not defined as a set

22
00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.900
of emotions. It's a judgment or a verdict on

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.989
the moral condition of human beings. Like any verdict

24
00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:24.989
or judgment, it will express itself in certain emotions,

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.830
but misanthropy in its philosophical sense is a judgment.

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.309
It's a verdict based on evidence, reasons, arguments, assessments,

27
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.559
um, and I think there's quite a big difference

28
00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:37.430
between the philosophical and the vernacular sense of misanthropy.

29
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.069
Because if you ask someone, are they a misanthrop,

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.069
they'll usually say, no, I don't, I don't hate

31
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.540
people. I don't feel contempt for human beings. Um,

32
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.750
AND that makes them think that misanthropy is, it's

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.930
not a position to endorse, whereas in the philosophical

34
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.449
sense, if you ask, do you think that humankind

35
00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:56.430
collectively is morally pretty dreadful, I think more people

36
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.919
will be inclined to answer yes.

37
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.629
Right. And, and why would anyone be a misanthrope?

38
00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.309
I mean, what are the reasons behind that?

39
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.657
Well, it, it varies a lot by the individual

40
00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.018
misanthrope. I mean, some people describe themselves as natural

41
00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:17.328
born misanthropes, and they'll claim that they've always had,

42
00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.768
uh, some vague feeling that humankind is pretty dreadful,

43
00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:22.979
that the human world is full of cruelty and

44
00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.018
greed and injustice. Um, AND there might be such

45
00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:29.639
people who've always had that pre-philosophical sense that our

46
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.488
moral condition as a species is pretty bad. Uh,

47
00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.298
BUT the misanthropes I'm interested in, they usually come

48
00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:39.690
to their misanthropy through a combination of. Um, EXPERIENCES

49
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.490
of their own, usually bad experiences, um, certain kinds

50
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.479
of reflection on humankind in our moral performance. Um,

51
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.520
THEY might have had what can't cause long, sad

52
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.500
experience of the ingratitude, injustice, and cruelty that seems

53
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.660
to infect the human world. Some of them might

54
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.580
have been inspired by certain arguments, including arguments given

55
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.619
by the philosophical misanthropes. Uh, FOR other people it

56
00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.279
might be the inspiration of, of philosophical or religious

57
00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.979
tradition, um, because I think many philosophies and religions

58
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.690
have misanthropic, um, components. And maybe for other people

59
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.809
it's, it's probably some combination of all of these

60
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.559
things. I mean, at least in my own case,

61
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.089
I wouldn't describe myself as a natural born misanthrope.

62
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.570
I remember being fairly sort of optimistic, uh, romantic,

63
00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.020
philanthropic, wanting to think the best of people. But

64
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.970
in my case it was a combination of lots

65
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.300
of philosophical work on vices and wickedness and evil,

66
00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.770
and then it was reading books about misanthropy by

67
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.289
modern philosophical misanthropes like David Cooper, uh, or David

68
00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.440
Benatar. And then using those philosophical ideas to rethink

69
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.080
certain experiences and and learning to look at the

70
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.240
world again in a different way. And for me

71
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.559
that process was fairly quick. It took about a

72
00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.320
year to become converted to misanthropy. For some people

73
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.589
it's much longer, for some people it's much slower.

74
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.250
And a lot of people also resist their misanthropy.

75
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.320
Um, THERE'S a great paper by um Catherine Norloch,

76
00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.039
the Canadian philosopher. And she points out that many

77
00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.419
people have misanthropic thoughts and ideas and feelings, but

78
00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.339
they want to resist them. Maybe because they're not

79
00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.779
persuaded by the arguments, maybe because they are um

80
00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.100
slightly disturbed by the content of misanthropic ideas, or

81
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.579
they're aware that becoming a misanthrope would damage some

82
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.820
of their values or some aspects of their identity

83
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.820
that mattered to them. And I think there's, there's

84
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.380
quite a range of conversion processes that make a

85
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.059
person a misanthrope. But what's crucial for the philosophical

86
00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.929
misanthrope is. At least a lot of that conversion

87
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:36.320
is done by reasons and arguments and evidence.

88
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.320
Mhm. Is there an emotional component to being a

89
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.980
mis a misanthrope? I mean, what kinds of emotions

90
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.489
do misanthropes experience toward humanity? I'm not saying that

91
00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.950
even if there's that emotional component, it is necessarily

92
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.380
very relevant to philosophical misanthropy, but what could you

93
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.459
tell us about that?

94
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.329
Well, the, if you look at the testimonies of

95
00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:10.970
misanthropes, that they always mention an extreme range of

96
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.489
emotions, um, and they usually emphasize pretty negative emotions.

97
00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.309
So, for example, Kant and Schopenhauer talk about sadness,

98
00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:24.290
woe, disappointment, frustration, uh, the Buddha mentions dispassion, disgust,

99
00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:28.690
and anxiety, and, and I think these, these misanthropic

100
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.209
emotions, they appear in a misanthropic process of conversion

101
00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:35.309
in different stages. So it's clear that many misanthropes

102
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.429
begin their journey of conversion through certain negative moral

103
00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:42.230
emotions. They feel fear, um, at the, the evils

104
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.600
that human beings do. They feel grief and anxiety.

105
00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.869
They feel worry and loss and disappointment, and those

106
00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:52.149
emotions can help to motivate a person to start

107
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.609
thinking in misanthropic ways. But over time, as your

108
00:05:55.609 --> 00:05:59.010
misanthropic verdict starts to sink in. Then I think

109
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.529
a further set of emotions comes in, because when

110
00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.609
people come to a misanthropic judgment on humankind, they

111
00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:07.850
often experience a further set of emotions. Anger is

112
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.000
often mentioned, distrust, uncertainty, sometimes shame at being part

113
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.399
of such a dreadful species, certain kinds of sadness

114
00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.890
and regret at the, at the way that humankind

115
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.839
has developed. And one function of philosophical misanthropy, I

116
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.160
think, is to guide people through these emotional processes,

117
00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:27.839
which can be very difficult and for some people

118
00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:32.519
very traumatic. I mean, there's real moral disorientation in

119
00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:36.279
becoming a misanthrope, and most misanthropes need good guidance

120
00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.720
on how to manage and regulate these emotions. And

121
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.399
I think there can be sometimes positive emotions as

122
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.359
well. For example, certain misanthropes report a sense of

123
00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:48.670
relief at finally seeing human beings for what they

124
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.390
are. Um, BUT it's pretty clear to me that

125
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.899
most misanthropes find it a very difficult emotional process,

126
00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:58.790
becoming and being misanthropic, especially if you want to

127
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.869
sustain your misanthropy into the long term, then you

128
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.910
have to identify what kinds of negative emotions you're

129
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.390
susceptible to, develop ways of coping with them. And

130
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.149
that will usually involve some readjustment of your values,

131
00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:14.329
your ideals, your expectations, your habits, your ways of

132
00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.630
relating to other people. And that I think is

133
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.309
part of the difficulty of being a misanthrop. It's

134
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:22.839
emotionally turbulent for most people, and that requires real

135
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:23.459
management.

136
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.079
So give us some examples of what misanthrops consider

137
00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.679
to be the failures or the moral failures of

138
00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:34.399
humanity.

139
00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.459
Well, I think there are for most misanthropes historically

140
00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.820
and cross-culturally, I think that there are, there are

141
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.859
3 main routes into misanthropy. Um, THE first route

142
00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:47.809
is reflecting on how human beings treat non-human animals,

143
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.500
and the failings people mention there include, uh, greed,

144
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.140
selfishness, malevolence, cruelty, brutality, exploitativeness, uh, willing to exercise

145
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.239
power over other creatures. Uh, A second way into

146
00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:04.119
misanthropy is a reflection on how we relate to

147
00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:05.989
and treat the natural world. So there are eco

148
00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:09.320
misanthropes. Uh, THEY mention some of the same failings

149
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.440
like greed and destructiveness, but they also mention hubris,

150
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.190
mindlessness, recklessness, stupidity, short-sightedness. And then the third way

151
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.679
into misanthropy is reflection on how we treat other

152
00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:25.589
human beings. And here the failings include greed, jealousy,

153
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:32.940
malevolence, selfishness, betrayal, treachery, insouciance, lack of care, callousness,

154
00:08:33.308 --> 00:08:36.380
and one task for the philosophical misanthrop is to

155
00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.658
look at these different routes into misanthropy. And then

156
00:08:39.658 --> 00:08:42.388
try to map out the kinds of vices and

157
00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.658
failings that are common to each path. So in

158
00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.299
David Cooper's book Animals and Misanthropy, he identifies, I

159
00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:53.018
think, 7 clusters of failings that people often display

160
00:08:53.018 --> 00:08:54.939
in the ways that they think about animals, how

161
00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:57.018
they treat animals, and so on. And you can

162
00:08:57.018 --> 00:08:59.379
do a good bit of moral philosophy by taxonomizing

163
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.299
these failings. Now there is a lot of consistency

164
00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:06.460
across different misanthropes. For example, everyone mentions greed, hatred,

165
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:12.140
stupidity, dogmatism, malevolence, selfishness. Uh SOME misanthropes also point

166
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.530
to different kinds of failings that other misanthropes don't

167
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.340
mention. For example, for some people, there are aesthetic

168
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.849
or spiritual failings as well, that should be part

169
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:23.369
of a condemnation of human beings. Uh, SOME misanthrops,

170
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.059
um, like to give very systematic lists. So if

171
00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:30.260
you read the Buddha's discourses, he gives enormously elaborate

172
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.380
lists of the cankers, taints and defilements of human

173
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.179
beings, and they're systematized, numbered and analyzed in exhaustive

174
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.929
detail, whereas in other traditions they content themselves with

175
00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:44.299
looser, less systematic lists. Um, SO if you look

176
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:47.099
at a, a recent misanthrope like Giacomo Leopardi, the

177
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:49.700
Italian misanthrope, he doesn't give a list of the

178
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.859
failings of humankind. He just gives examples um of

179
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:56.179
the failings of human beings and how they show

180
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.700
up in human life. So there's, there's no exhaustive

181
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.820
and definitive list. Um, ON my computer somewhere, I

182
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.820
have a list of the vices and failings that

183
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.520
Misanthrope's list. I think I stopped at 500. Um,

184
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.010
SOME of them have names like greed and cruelty.

185
00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:12.049
Some of them don't have names at all yet.

186
00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.000
Um, AND that's another task for a moral philosopher,

187
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.960
is trying to identify failings that we, we can

188
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.799
tune into but that we haven't described and also

189
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.559
trying to identify failings that are not yet studied

190
00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:28.080
and analyzed. I call these esoteric failings, um, and

191
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.039
one contribution of philosophers has been to give us

192
00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:33.369
vocabularies for thinking about these failings. Um, SO there's

193
00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:36.130
no definitive list, and there is huge variation in

194
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.450
part because your condemnation of humankind will reflect your

195
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.609
sense of what the ideals and values of humankind

196
00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.210
should be. And one of the reasons that misanthropes

197
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.809
disagree with one another, they disagree about what's wrong

198
00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:50.659
with us, um. And that, that is one of

199
00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:53.119
the reasons I think that philosophers should study misanthropy.

200
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.229
Even if you don't want to be a misanthrope,

201
00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:57.250
I think it's a really useful way into doing

202
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.530
a kind of moral, social and political philosophy.

203
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:07.229
So when misanthropes pass moral judgment on humanity as

204
00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:12.349
a whole, are they also doing it on individuals

205
00:11:12.349 --> 00:11:12.979
or not?

206
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.650
No, I, I think one of the mistakes people

207
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.570
make about misanthropy is to think that it's a

208
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.289
judgment on individuals. So in the vernacular sense, misanthropy

209
00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.239
is a hatred or distrust of individual human beings.

210
00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:25.969
Uh, BUT, but I, I think that's a mistake.

211
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.179
Philosophical misanthropy is a verdict passed on something more

212
00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:32.690
abstract and more collective, like humankind, human forms of

213
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.130
life, human existence. So this is the way that

214
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.780
David Cooper characterizes misanthropy. It's a judgment on. Something

215
00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.780
broader and more collective, humankind, human forms of life,

216
00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:47.309
the institutions, practices, structures, the systems of ambitions and

217
00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:49.989
desires that have come to characterize human forms of

218
00:11:49.989 --> 00:11:53.630
life. Now that is consistent with the misanthrope having

219
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.789
specific views on individuals. For example, there will be

220
00:11:56.789 --> 00:12:00.909
certain individual human beings who stand out as exemplars

221
00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:03.809
of our collective failings. You might, so you might

222
00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:05.760
point to a certain person, maybe a political leader,

223
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.570
and say that, you know, they are a living

224
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.729
symbol of the greed, cruelty and indifference that characterizes

225
00:12:13.729 --> 00:12:16.640
human life. So for the misanthrope, certain individuals are

226
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.770
exemplars of our collective failings. They are all that's

227
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.210
wrong with us, or all that's wrong with patriarchy,

228
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.200
or all that's wrong with capitalism in human form.

229
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.210
But likewise, there can be certain individuals who stand

230
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.179
out because they are exemplars of virtues. These people

231
00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:34.190
will stand out as morally admirable because they are

232
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.969
relatively free of the failings of our collective forms

233
00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:40.169
of life. But it's crucial for philosophical misanthropy. The

234
00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:43.000
judgment is being passed on something abstract like human

235
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.530
forms of life or human existence. Now one complication

236
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.340
is. Does that include a judgment being passed on

237
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.809
human nature? Because in Western kinds of philosophical misanthropy,

238
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.780
it's been very common to include human nature as

239
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.929
part of a condemnation. Uh, FOR example, Bernard Williams,

240
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:04.400
uh, at one point remarks that Lutheranism is misanthropic

241
00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:07.460
because of its conceptions of human nature as corrupted

242
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.179
by original sin. And I think that in some

243
00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:14.729
traditions it will make sense to include human nature

244
00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:16.750
if it's part of your way of thinking. But

245
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.260
if you look at, say, the philosophical misanthropies of

246
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.679
India and China. They don't pass judgment on human

247
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.460
nature at all. So you can have it, you

248
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.099
can have misanthropy without human nature. And I think

249
00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:30.979
in part because misanthropic verdicts are consistent with either

250
00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:33.330
a positive or a negative view of human nature.

251
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.059
You know, you might look at the the human

252
00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:37.299
world as we know it and conclude that it's

253
00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:40.659
suffused with cruelty, arrogance, dogmatism, and all these other

254
00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:44.140
vices, but that's consistent with our being, um good

255
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.500
by nature, but also without being bad by nature.

256
00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:49.080
I mean, it's perfectly possible that human beings could

257
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.039
by nature be disposed towards kindness, generosity and trust,

258
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:55.520
and the other other virtues. It's just that we

259
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.760
get socialized within a corrupting world that tends to

260
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.510
suppress our vices and draw out our failings. And

261
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.349
for this reason, at least in my own work,

262
00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:07.390
I want to exclude human nature um from misanthropy.

263
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.799
The judgment is not being passed on human nature,

264
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.960
it's being passed on the collective structures and forms

265
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.400
of human life, and at least in some cases.

266
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.280
The concept of human nature becomes very problematic, either

267
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.419
because people understand that concept in very one-sided ways,

268
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.070
or they try to use it as a strategy

269
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.150
for undermining misanthropy by insisting that even if collectively

270
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.309
we're very bad, individually deep down, we are very,

271
00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:35.789
very good. But that's irrelevant to misanthropy because the

272
00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:38.020
question is not what are we like deep down,

273
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.549
it's what are we like in large scale collective

274
00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:44.030
societies bound by institutions and practices. Um, WHAT we're

275
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.289
like deep down is irrelevant to that. So I

276
00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:49.169
think that we should leave out human nature and

277
00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:51.409
not focus on individuals. It's being a jud the

278
00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:54.520
judgment is passed on the collective structures of human

279
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.400
forms of life.

280
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.940
OK, so that that's a very important clarification because

281
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.369
I mean, I was thinking that. Uh, MAYBE I'm

282
00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:07.809
wrong, of course, but it could be the case

283
00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:10.049
that I'm wrong. But it is, it seems to

284
00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:15.570
me that most people, most of the time are

285
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.890
decent. I'm not saying that, uh, there's, there's not

286
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.710
any vices that all people tend to suffer a

287
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.409
little bit from. I mean, I guess that every

288
00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:30.390
one of us suffers from at least a small

289
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.590
number of vices, but isn't it, uh, I mean,

290
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:40.590
when it comes to humanity's failures, isn't it mostly

291
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.270
a small number of individuals that tend to be

292
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:50.469
responsible for humanity's biggest, uh, failings or, or not?

293
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.390
I mean, what do you think about that?

294
00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:55.719
Well, well I I think one advantage of using

295
00:15:55.719 --> 00:15:59.799
the term failings is that. Uh, IT doesn't bring

296
00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.590
to mind individuals in the ways that the term

297
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.280
vices does. So, you know, in David's work, he

298
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.200
says, I use the word failings because if you

299
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.869
say vices, people immediately think of individuals, which then

300
00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:12.960
reinforces a misconception about misanthropy. Whereas I think we

301
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.520
do talk quite naturally of the failings of institutions

302
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.559
or societies. Um, SO failings, I think, is, is

303
00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:20.440
the more useful term. And it will be the

304
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.000
case that there will be a dialectic between the

305
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.919
vices of individuals and. Failings of social institutions. You

306
00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.630
know, for example, I take it, um, if you

307
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.760
think that certain kinds of capitalist economy are greedy,

308
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.200
exploitative, and destructive, well, those systems couldn't function without

309
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.719
people who had at least some individual version of

310
00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:42.679
those failings. There has to be a dialectic between

311
00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.919
the individuals and the collectives. I mean, if people

312
00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:48.080
were genuinely incapable of greed, then you couldn't develop

313
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.280
greed economic systems, or so I assume. Um, BUT,

314
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.400
but to the claim that it's really a small

315
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.030
number of individuals who are causing all the trouble,

316
00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:00.909
I think the misanthrop will be cautious about that,

317
00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:04.439
because there are, there are two standard ways historically

318
00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:06.199
that people have tried to push back against a

319
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:09.358
misanthropic verdict. One is to is to acknowledge the

320
00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:12.800
reality of our failings, but confine them to unusually

321
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.920
awful people, uh, psychopaths, moral monsters, dictators, tyrants. The

322
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.598
other is to try to confine our failings only

323
00:17:20.598 --> 00:17:24.680
to certain unusually awful conditions like uh civil war,

324
00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:28.239
for example, or, or maybe conditions of poverty or

325
00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:31.760
society collapse. Now, of course, the misanthrop can acknowledge,

326
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.719
there are some people and some groups who are

327
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.680
unusually awful and bear a special responsibility for the

328
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.900
worsening of human society. So if you're an ecom

329
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.780
misanthrope, you might point to uh the big fossil

330
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.699
fuel companies. You know, it's, it's not just that,

331
00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:50.500
uh, carbon intensive economic systems are causing a huge

332
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.060
amount of environmental damage. We also know that they

333
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.699
engage in doubt mongering, and they, they have been

334
00:17:55.699 --> 00:18:00.050
trying and succeeding to manipulate political and public understanding

335
00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:03.410
of the relationship between fossil fuels and climate change.

336
00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:07.099
And in his book, um, on environmental pessimism, Toby

337
00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:11.229
Svoboda says, Um, this doubt mongering about climate change

338
00:18:11.229 --> 00:18:13.819
is a genuine kind of evil because it causes

339
00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:16.920
such enormous harm on an enormous scale. So the

340
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.000
misanthrop can acknowledge that certain failings are more intense

341
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.400
in certain groups, and they can also acknowledge that

342
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.599
certain failings are much worse in certain kinds of

343
00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:30.119
hostile social conditions. Maybe people do become more selfish

344
00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:33.589
and aggressive and violent under conditions of civil war.

345
00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:36.560
However, the misanthrope will also emphasize that the failings

346
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.119
that they're interested in are not confined to awful

347
00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.829
people in awful circumstances. They are, as David Cooper

348
00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:46.030
says, entrenched and ubiquitous within the normal course of

349
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.349
human life, but often in ways that people don't

350
00:18:48.349 --> 00:18:50.510
see. And I think one of the best examples

351
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.469
of this is to look at the work on

352
00:18:52.469 --> 00:18:56.349
animal focused misanthropy. Now, if you look at the

353
00:18:56.349 --> 00:19:00.260
sorts of failings mentioned by the animal centered misanthropes,

354
00:19:00.589 --> 00:19:04.949
they emphasize that failings like greed, destructiveness, cruelty and

355
00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:10.469
brutality, these are. Typically located in institutions and practices

356
00:19:10.469 --> 00:19:14.229
like industrial animal agriculture, certain kinds of scientific and

357
00:19:14.229 --> 00:19:18.270
medical experimentation on animals, the the institutionalized ways we

358
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.030
have of engaging with animals, that's where you locate

359
00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:24.469
these failings. So of course there are greedy individual

360
00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:27.069
people, people with the vice of greed, but greed

361
00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:30.229
should also be located within modern systems of industrial

362
00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:34.339
agriculture. And for that reason, the misanthrope says the

363
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.760
failings are much more continuous features of human life

364
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.359
than people think. But because they're located in systems

365
00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:43.500
that we don't often think critically about or systems

366
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.500
that we are not informed about, we don't tend

367
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.219
to notice those failings. And you know, this is

368
00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:52.180
why for the misanthrope, it's very, very important that

369
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.180
people should have a philosophical misanthropy that's based on

370
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.739
investigation and research. For example, there's a huge amount

371
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.010
of cruelty in industrial animal agriculture. But I take

372
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.810
it the majority of people just don't know about

373
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.130
it because those companies work hard to prevent you

374
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.010
from finding out what they do. And of course

375
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.089
most people don't really want to have detailed information

376
00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:14.849
about how animals are treated in factory farms because

377
00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:17.449
it's pretty terrible. Um, I mean recently I, I

378
00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:20.410
had a discussion with someone who insisted that animal

379
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.859
agriculture in factories isn't cruel. And when I asked

380
00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:27.689
him what he thinks about practices like debeking, he

381
00:20:27.689 --> 00:20:30.290
quickly admitted he didn't know what that was, but.

382
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.410
Debeaking is a primary example of a cruel practice.

383
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.020
It is a practice which is premised upon cruel

384
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.979
treatment of animals, but if you don't know about

385
00:20:38.979 --> 00:20:41.099
the practice, it's easy to think that it's less

386
00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:44.150
cruel than it is. And so for the misanthrope,

387
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.060
these these vices and failings are much more distributed

388
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.300
in the human world than people think. They're more

389
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.459
common, more pervasive, and more entrenched. It's just that

390
00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:57.060
people have certain epistemic habits that turn their attention,

391
00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.579
their moral concern away from them.

392
00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:03.040
So, just to clarify this point, what is then

393
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.650
the relationship between vices, corruption, and misanthropy?

394
00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:13.540
Well, 11 relation is that, uh, vices for the

395
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.459
misanthrope are the terms of condemnation. So when they

396
00:21:16.459 --> 00:21:20.489
condemn humankind as awful, dreadful, or a moral disaster,

397
00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:23.939
what they're doing is arguing, um, to use David

398
00:21:23.939 --> 00:21:27.060
Cooper's terms, that a whole variety of vices and

399
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.339
failings have come to be entrenched within the ways

400
00:21:30.339 --> 00:21:32.900
that we live, think and feel. So if you

401
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.390
were to describe a range of human practices, structures,

402
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.390
ambitions, and so on. You would have to use

403
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.189
certain vices to describe them. Um, SO certain human

404
00:21:42.189 --> 00:21:45.630
ambitions are hubristic, certain ways of thinking about animals

405
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.750
are, uh, insouciant. Many ways of treating animals are

406
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.329
cruel and brutal. And for the misanthrope then vices

407
00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:54.890
are the terms of condemnation. What they are condemning

408
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.969
are the vices and failings built into human forms

409
00:21:57.969 --> 00:22:01.689
of life. Now the connection to corruption is that

410
00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:05.329
for the misanthroppe, these vices and failings aren't just

411
00:22:05.329 --> 00:22:08.010
features of the system. They have a a sort

412
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.369
of toxic or poisoning effect upon people, because if

413
00:22:11.369 --> 00:22:14.329
you are living and working within social systems that

414
00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:17.930
are contaminated with vices, one consequence can be that

415
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.390
you yourself start to develop them. And that's the

416
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.069
technical sense um of corrupting that I want to

417
00:22:23.069 --> 00:22:25.989
use. Something is corrupting if it tends to erode

418
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:30.069
your moral excellences and feed your moral failings. For

419
00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:31.790
example, if you live within a system that is

420
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.699
premised upon cruel and brutal treatment of animals, then

421
00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:38.790
that system will will persist if you yourself start

422
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.500
to acquire those traits. So a system is corrupting

423
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.109
when it's morally damaging, when living within that system

424
00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:47.469
is itself a source of moral damage and injury.

425
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.400
And this is, this is a concept I'm taking

426
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.680
from Claudia Card's work. And the connection then to

427
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.560
misanthropy is for the misanthrope, the human world as

428
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.839
we know it is both vicious and corrupt, but

429
00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:02.199
also corrupting, which is why misanthropes will describe the

430
00:23:02.199 --> 00:23:06.800
human world as poisonous, toxic, uh, dangerous. It's, it's

431
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.959
polluted, as the Buddha says, the human world is

432
00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:13.959
burning, burning, burning with the fires of greed, hate,

433
00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:16.479
and delusion. And the function of these metaphors is

434
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:19.880
to emphasize that. If you continue to live within

435
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.849
a corrupting human world, you yourself will become corrupted

436
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:27.319
and morally damaged, which is why for some misanthropes,

437
00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:30.609
the correct response to misanthropy is to withdraw from

438
00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:33.520
mainstream human life. And these are the misanthropes that

439
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.969
can cause fugitives from mankind. These are the misanthropes

440
00:23:37.969 --> 00:23:41.020
whose whose dominant emotion is fear, fear at being

441
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.030
corrupted. If they remain within a human world which

442
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.150
is poisonous and toxic, and so these misanthropes respond

443
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.270
by trying to withdraw from mainstream human life, maybe

444
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.030
to isolated religious communities, or they live off the

445
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.790
grid, or they try to separate themselves psychologically and

446
00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.540
physically from the mainstream human world. They become hermits.

447
00:24:00.869 --> 00:24:05.229
They live all alone. They withtreat and withdraw. Um,

448
00:24:05.349 --> 00:24:07.180
SO that there's a deep connection between, I think,

449
00:24:07.209 --> 00:24:10.430
vices, failings, corruption and misanthropy, because one of the

450
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.829
questions a misanthrop has to answer is, well, if

451
00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:14.510
there are all these vices and failings, and they're

452
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.910
so dreadful, why have they persisted? Um, WHY don't

453
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.989
we do something about them? Why are they continuous

454
00:24:19.989 --> 00:24:22.790
features of human life? And one answer is that

455
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.540
the human world has multiple systems of corruption which

456
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.579
entrench, reinforce, protect, and conceal the failings of our

457
00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:30.979
world.

458
00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:35.500
So, yes, and later, I'm going to ask you

459
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.099
more about the different kinds of attitudes that people

460
00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:42.420
can have toward misanthropy and also the different types

461
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.969
of misanthropes out there. But do misanthropes include themselves

462
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.699
among the rest of humanity? I know that you've

463
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:53.810
already told us. Misanthropy is not really about passing

464
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.839
judgment on specific individuals, but more on humanity as

465
00:24:57.839 --> 00:25:02.130
a whole and the systems, uh, humanity inhabits. But,

466
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.750
uh, do they include themselves among the, the rest

467
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.760
of humanity or do they position themselves as sort

468
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.709
of morally superior to the rest of us?

469
00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:21.719
In my experience, most misanthropes will include themselves within

470
00:25:21.719 --> 00:25:24.560
the within the terms of condemnation. So one particular

471
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.569
class of emotions that I think are very interesting

472
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:31.369
and misanthropy are certain kind of self-directed emotions. So

473
00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:34.810
many misanthropes will feel guilt and shame and regret.

474
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.069
As they come to recognize that their moral failings

475
00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:40.780
are continuous with the failings of the wider world,

476
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:43.300
uh, for some misanthropists, it's a kind of shame,

477
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.719
um, in coming to realize that your own failings,

478
00:25:46.729 --> 00:25:49.229
um, are so entrenched, that you yourself are part

479
00:25:49.229 --> 00:25:52.160
of a wider problem. So most misanthrops do include

480
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.630
themselves in the terms of condemnation, and for many

481
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.910
of them that that can be a motivation to

482
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.989
try to engage in certain kinds of practices of

483
00:25:58.989 --> 00:26:03.099
moral repair and restoration. Now there are a minority

484
00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:06.739
of misanthropes who do regard themselves as privileged and

485
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:10.449
superior. Um, FOR example, they will insist that they

486
00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:14.770
are purified, they are, uh, too self-conscious, too wise,

487
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.640
um, and too self-disciplined to be corrupted by the

488
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.300
world, but they do tend to be an extreme

489
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.780
minority, and at least some of the misanthropes who

490
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.939
insist that they are, uh, morally superior, I think,

491
00:26:25.949 --> 00:26:29.810
are clearly joking. Um, BUT most misanthropes will recognize

492
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.300
that. A consequence of their socialization in the world

493
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.449
is that they become corrupted, not, not irreversibly corrupted,

494
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.859
um, just that they have acquired the kinds of

495
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:42.699
moral damage you would expect by living within a

496
00:26:42.699 --> 00:26:45.859
corrupting human world. And one place to look for

497
00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:48.660
this is in the work on animal centered misanthropy.

498
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.569
So a common theme of lots of those misanthropes

499
00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:53.890
is, you know, for example, for all of my

500
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.010
life, um, I, I was a carnist, I ate

501
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.930
animals. I didn't think about what happens to them

502
00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.209
in laboratories. But then I, you know, I converted

503
00:27:01.209 --> 00:27:03.010
to become a vegan or I became an animal

504
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.739
activist, and now I've tried to change my life.

505
00:27:05.849 --> 00:27:08.339
I've changed the ways that I think and feel

506
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:10.829
about animals, and I've tried to improve my moral

507
00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:14.380
practice. And insofar as I do this, I become

508
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.989
less guilty of the failings um of uh a

509
00:27:18.989 --> 00:27:22.290
carnistic society. And I think that's probably the sensible

510
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.630
way to think about it. I mean, as you

511
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.430
said earlier, no one escapes having certain vices and

512
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.589
failings. That's part of the package of being a

513
00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:31.349
human being. And the, I think the relevant moral

514
00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:33.910
task is to try to identify your moral and

515
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.219
epistemic failings. And try to correct them as much

516
00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:39.229
and as far as you can. Now for some

517
00:27:39.229 --> 00:27:42.050
misanthropes, the only way to really purge yourself of

518
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.790
failings is to withdraw from the human world, and

519
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.949
they're the fugitives. But that's a radical option. For

520
00:27:47.949 --> 00:27:50.790
many misanthropes, the sensible thing to do is to

521
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.310
remain within the human world, try as far as

522
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.979
you can to minimize your own vices and failings,

523
00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:58.949
maybe identify your worst fight, vape vices and failings

524
00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:02.290
and and focus on them. But also don't give

525
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.650
in to the idea that you could become a

526
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.010
morally perfected being who has no vices and failings.

527
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.369
You know, most human beings are not going to

528
00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:12.930
be capable of that kind of moral self-perfection, and

529
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.410
there are probably vices like self-delusion and hubris in

530
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.209
even entertaining that ambition. I mean, I think the

531
00:28:19.209 --> 00:28:21.010
aim for a misanthropy is to be better than

532
00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.569
you were before, even if you could never attain

533
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:24.089
perfection.

534
00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:30.300
Tell us about the difference between religious and secular

535
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.739
misanthropy and give us at least 11 example of

536
00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:35.650
each of them.

537
00:28:36.219 --> 00:28:39.540
OK. That's, that's a big topic and at the

538
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.260
moment, there's relatively little academic work exploring religion and

539
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.060
misanthropy. Uh, THERE are a few discussions of this

540
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.900
in the work of David Cooper, um, Catherine Norlock

541
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.390
has done some work on this. One problem is

542
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.949
that when people do discuss misanthropy in relation to

543
00:28:54.949 --> 00:28:58.229
religion, they always mean, uh, the vernacular sense of

544
00:28:58.229 --> 00:29:02.390
misanthropy is hatred of humankind. And naturally, pretty much

545
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.910
everyone in all the religions want to uh reject

546
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.630
that conception of misanthropy. I mean, for example, if

547
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.589
the core Christian virtues are, you know, compassion and

548
00:29:10.589 --> 00:29:13.310
benevolence for your fellow people. You're not going to

549
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.750
endorse hatred of humankind. If you think that human

550
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.290
beings are created in God's image, you don't, we

551
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.229
won't want to hate human beings. Or if you're

552
00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:22.349
a Buddhist and you think that compassion and loving

553
00:29:22.349 --> 00:29:24.670
kindness are some of the core virtues, you won't

554
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.109
want to hate. So there's there's a big obstacle

555
00:29:27.109 --> 00:29:30.550
to thinking about religion and misanthropy, which is the

556
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.310
extreme distorted, vernacular sense of misanthropy. Now there are

557
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.310
a couple of exceptions. Um, THERE have been a

558
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.630
couple of Christians who have described themselves as misanthropes.

559
00:29:40.099 --> 00:29:42.500
Um, Soren Kiera Gore in some of his writings

560
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.609
has, uh, described himself as a kind of misanthrope.

561
00:29:46.939 --> 00:29:50.089
But even when people don't use the word misanthropy,

562
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.060
I think you can give misanthropic readings of various

563
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.900
religions. Uh, FOR example, I think that, um, some

564
00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.180
of the Christian tradition contains misanthropic elements. So if

565
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.400
you think about the tradition in Christianity that emphasized

566
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.020
that we are corrupted and depraved and that we

567
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.050
are contaminated by original sin. Such that various fightings

568
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.530
are inescapable. Well, I think there's a kind of

569
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.520
misanthropy there. It's a misanthropic conception of human nature,

570
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.050
and it might include, for example, Saint Augustine, it

571
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.410
might include Calvin as well. And the people in

572
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.489
that tradition might not like the word misanthropy, but

573
00:30:26.489 --> 00:30:31.229
if you ask them, uh, Are these theologians endorsing

574
00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:33.270
a picture of human beings according to which they

575
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:37.790
are systematically morally damaged in ways that generate vices

576
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.189
and failings? The answer might be yes. They just

577
00:30:40.189 --> 00:30:43.270
use a different vocabulary of original sin or vices

578
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.910
and so on. So you can give a misanthropic

579
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.849
reconstruction of certain traditions. I mean, in my work,

580
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.209
I think the best example I've found is early

581
00:30:52.209 --> 00:30:54.569
Buddhism. I mean, the Buddha doesn't use the word

582
00:30:54.569 --> 00:30:58.099
misanthropy, and nothing like that word existed in ancient

583
00:30:58.099 --> 00:30:59.930
India. But when you look at the ways that

584
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:04.329
the Buddha describes ordinary human forms of life, I

585
00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:07.739
think he's clearly misanthropic. So when he describes the

586
00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:11.339
existence of uh uninstructed worldlings like you and I,

587
00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:15.500
basically unenlightened people, he says, uh, these people are

588
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.979
canquered, tainted and defiled with a whole array of

589
00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:22.500
vices and failings, and in his suitass he lists

590
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.689
an enormous number of them, uh, greediness, laziness, selfishness,

591
00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:31.810
distraction, anger, hatred, delusion, willful ignorance, and so on.

592
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.819
Um, YOU know, he described the human world as

593
00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:38.800
burning, as poisonous. Um, HE said it's like, um,

594
00:31:38.989 --> 00:31:42.630
you know, living within a conflagration. He says human

595
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.869
desires, ideas, ways of thinking, their views about the

596
00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:50.500
world are dogmatic, deluded, cruel, and sensitive. And he

597
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.280
always says to his monks, you know, the sensible

598
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.530
thing to do is to withdraw from the world,

599
00:31:55.619 --> 00:31:58.739
to go forth into homelessness. When the Buddha argues

600
00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:02.739
that monastic life is morally superior, it's partly because

601
00:32:02.739 --> 00:32:06.550
monastics don't live within a corrupting. Human world. In

602
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.510
fact, he describes the monastic community, the sanga, as

603
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.430
a refuge, a place of security away from mainstream

604
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.079
human life. Because for the Buddha, the idea is

605
00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:18.949
that in a monastic life you live within highly

606
00:32:18.949 --> 00:32:22.229
disciplined ways of living that are designed to remove

607
00:32:22.229 --> 00:32:25.969
all the temptations and pressures and structures that feed

608
00:32:25.969 --> 00:32:29.390
vices in ordinary forms of human life. So although

609
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.859
the Buddha doesn't use the word misanthropic. His vision

610
00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:35.859
of human life is clearly misanthropic in the philosophical

611
00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:38.459
sense. He issues a condemnation of human forms of

612
00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:41.619
life. He identifies and catalogs an enormous range of

613
00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:44.819
failings, and he describes how they are entrenched and

614
00:32:44.819 --> 00:32:49.140
ubiquitous within unenlightened forms of human life. So I

615
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.020
think the Buddha is clearly misanthropic. Now I, I

616
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.170
know from experience that contemporary Buddhists really don't like

617
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.550
this idea. Because the image of Buddhism that predominates

618
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.819
in many Western societies is that Buddhism is optimistic,

619
00:33:01.989 --> 00:33:06.939
philanthropic, positive, cheerful, optimistic. But I think you just

620
00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:09.949
can't sustain that rosy image of Buddhism if you've

621
00:33:09.949 --> 00:33:12.829
actually read the suitors, because if you look at

622
00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:16.020
the discourses of the Buddha, they are overwhelmingly negative

623
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.589
in their characterizations of human life. So I think

624
00:33:18.589 --> 00:33:21.260
the Buddha is misanthropic, even though he doesn't use

625
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.030
the M word.

626
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.380
Mhm. Uh, AND about uh secular misanthropy, I mean,

627
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.020
what would be an example of a secular approach

628
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.819
to it?

629
00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:35.670
Oh, it's it's perfectly popular to be a secular

630
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.619
misanthrope. I mean, one difference would be that, uh,

631
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.750
your sense of the the range and kinds of

632
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.250
human failings will be different. For example, I imagine

633
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.910
a secular misanthroppe wouldn't include various spiritual or religious

634
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.030
failings, uh, like impiety or godlessness or certain failures

635
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.949
of humility. Um, BUT there could still be plenty

636
00:33:53.949 --> 00:33:55.949
of vices and failings that would stand out for

637
00:33:55.949 --> 00:34:00.219
a for a secular misanthrope, um. For example, uh,

638
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.770
it seems to me that many modern eco misanthropes

639
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.489
are largely secular but very misanthropic because, you know,

640
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:12.330
failings like destructiveness, selfishness, recklessness, stupidity, these aren't tied

641
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.929
to religious visions of the world. They're perfectly consistent

642
00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:18.610
with various kinds of secular moral philosophies. Uh, FOR

643
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.409
example, uh, in a lot of animal misanthropy as

644
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.530
well, you know, the, the favorite vices include cruelty,

645
00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:30.659
injustice, discrimination, abusiveness. And those aren't necessarily religious concepts.

646
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.500
And even where those concepts have religious forms, you

647
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.260
can dissociate the religious and the secular forms. In

648
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.820
fact, it seems to me that there's far more

649
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.219
misanthropy out there than people think, um, because it

650
00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:45.020
involves such a diverse range of emotions and vices.

651
00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:46.768
Mhm.

652
00:34:47.569 --> 00:34:53.059
So in your work, I, you identify three different

653
00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:59.749
kinds of attitudes toward misanthropy, namely optimism, pessimism, quietism.

654
00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:01.849
Uh, COULD you tell us about each of them?

655
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.360
Yeah, so 11 question misanthropes always get is, um,

656
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.090
can you be a to be a misanthropist, you

657
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.149
have to be pessimistic as well. Now, they are

658
00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:13.929
obviously related in various ways. For example, misanthropy and

659
00:35:13.929 --> 00:35:17.560
pessimism in their philosophical senses are both judgments on,

660
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.929
on the human condition. I mean, for the misanthrope,

661
00:35:20.949 --> 00:35:23.570
our collective moral condition is very bad, and for

662
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.729
the pessimist, our collective existential condition is very bad.

663
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.060
And there are lots of different interconnections between misanthropy

664
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.840
and pessimism. So in some recent work I've suggested

665
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.060
that for the pessimists, um, one of the things

666
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.379
that's really bad about human life is precisely our

667
00:35:39.379 --> 00:35:42.489
moral failings. You know, it's when pessimists talk about

668
00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:46.580
the, the disappointments, the regrets, the sufferings and the

669
00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.060
miseries of human life, well, many of these are

670
00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.899
caused or intensified by our moral failings. So it's

671
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:54.979
very easy for pessimism and misanthropy to be mutually

672
00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:59.260
reinforcing. And you see this in Schopenhauer, the Buddha,

673
00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:03.010
Leopardy, David Cooper and David Benatar. But I suppose

674
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.649
it is possible that you can separate misanthropy and

675
00:36:05.649 --> 00:36:08.929
pessimism. Uh, FOR example, you might think that we

676
00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:12.370
have a range of entrenched vices and failings, but

677
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.969
you might also think that these aren't fixed features

678
00:36:15.969 --> 00:36:19.010
of human life. Uh, YOU know, maybe our society

679
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.290
has become contaminated by greed and hatred because we've

680
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.250
made a series of bad decisions in the past

681
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.850
about how to organize our societies. But if that's

682
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.850
right, maybe we can make better decisions and we

683
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.810
can slowly remove these failings from human life. So

684
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.530
you can be an optimistic misanthrope. You can acknowledge

685
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.169
that we have moral failings, but also insist that

686
00:36:37.169 --> 00:36:40.449
we can translate them into moral successes by reorganizing

687
00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.610
our societies. We can, we can engage in what

688
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.010
the pragmatists call meliarism. We can try to intelligently

689
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.929
identify collective ways to remove these vices and failings

690
00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:53.290
from the structures of human life. And I think

691
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.610
there are plenty of optimistic misanthropes like that. Um,

692
00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.560
AT the same time, I think there are plenty

693
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.360
of pessimistic misanthropes. So if you think that our

694
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.520
vices and failings flow, not from bad decisions, but

695
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.399
from deep structural features of the human condition, then

696
00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:11.280
there's probably very little that we can do to

697
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.030
remove them. Um, THIS is the way that the

698
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.639
Buddha reasons, so the Buddha is a pessimistic misanthrope,

699
00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:19.479
because for him, what really generates greed, hatred, delusion,

700
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.679
and the other failings is the inseparability from human

701
00:37:22.679 --> 00:37:25.320
life of certain structures of craving and desire and

702
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.820
attachment. And he says these can't be removed from

703
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.419
human life, so as long as you live in

704
00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:33.459
unenlightened forms of existence, you're stuck with those failings.

705
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.080
So there are different kinds of misanthropes. Some are

706
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.679
optimistic and some are pessimistic. Um, I mean, in

707
00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:41.600
my work, the name I give to the optimistic

708
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.800
misanthropes is the activist. So the activist misanthrop acknowledges

709
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.639
the scale and complexity of our moral failings, but

710
00:37:48.639 --> 00:37:50.360
they also insist there are things that we can

711
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.909
do about this. You know, we can engage in

712
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:58.560
collective projects of reform, educational, social, political, whereby we

713
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.449
try to reconstruct the human condition. For example, by

714
00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:06.370
identifying the structural features that intensify our failings, or

715
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.260
by identifying the perverse incentives that feed abusiveness and

716
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.060
other failings and and reorganize the human world. So

717
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.100
there are activistic misanthropes, and I think many eco

718
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.620
misanthropes are also activistic. You know, they describe the

719
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.659
failings of the human world in relation to the

720
00:38:22.659 --> 00:38:25.620
environment, but they also make more or less dramatic

721
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.820
proposals for restructuring the world. Now there are some

722
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.300
activists who who think that we should engage in

723
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.250
these projects, but also think that they will fail.

724
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.840
For example, Aldo Leopold, the American environmentalist. You know,

725
00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:40.830
he's very misanthropic, I think, and he also says

726
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.429
that we should take action to try to repair

727
00:38:43.429 --> 00:38:46.909
environmental damage, but he then very quickly says, ultimately,

728
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.070
ultimately it's impossible. Greed and destructiveness, the desire for

729
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.110
convenience and luxury are just too strong, but we

730
00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.909
should resist them anyway. We should go down fighting

731
00:38:57.129 --> 00:38:59.909
for the sake of our own moral self-respect. So

732
00:38:59.909 --> 00:39:03.340
there are optimistic misanthropes, the activists, but there are

733
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.360
also activists who think that it's still doomed, but

734
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.159
we should go down fighting. Now the pessimistic misanthropes,

735
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.610
these would mainly include what I call fugitives and

736
00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.729
quietists. So the fugitives are the ones who think

737
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:19.250
that the human, the failings of the human world

738
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.879
are too entrenched, they're too many, they're too powerful.

739
00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:25.050
They can't be removed or corrected. We can't put

740
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.169
out the fires, as the Buddha says. So in

741
00:39:27.169 --> 00:39:29.389
that case, what they do is they withdraw. They,

742
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.439
they try to escape from the human world, either

743
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:36.840
literally by living in isolated locations or in specialized

744
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.350
moral and religious communities or they become hermits, um,

745
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.239
or they try to psychologically withdraw from the human

746
00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:46.639
world. Um, SO they are pessimistic. If you remain

747
00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:48.479
within the human world, there is nothing you can

748
00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:52.600
do to significantly or permanently reduce um the range

749
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.760
of our moral failings. For them, the best option

750
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.939
is if you can escape. The other kind of

751
00:39:57.939 --> 00:40:01.899
pessimist is the quietest. So the quietest thinks the

752
00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:05.370
human world is saturated with vices and failings. These

753
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.770
can't really be removed or corrected in any significant

754
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.840
way, but also the quietest thinks. We shouldn't try

755
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.959
to escape from the human world, because for all

756
00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:16.800
of its dreadfulness, there are good things in the

757
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.639
human world. For example, if you value family relationships,

758
00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:24.719
friendship, taking part in cultural and social activities, you

759
00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:27.520
have to remain within the mainstream world. And so

760
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.879
the quietest decides to remain within a world that

761
00:40:29.879 --> 00:40:33.639
they recognize as corrupting, but try to structure their

762
00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:37.189
life to minimize their exposure to these corrupting forces.

763
00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:40.429
So they live, they live quietistically. They try to

764
00:40:40.429 --> 00:40:42.300
live within the world but keep their head down,

765
00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:47.939
and they exercise virtues like carefulness, humility, diffidence, modesty,

766
00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:51.179
and they try to carefully move through the human

767
00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:52.949
world, which they might view as a kind of

768
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:55.989
assault course full of dangers and risks, but where

769
00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:57.790
it's worth staying in that world for the sake

770
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.429
of the good things that are within it. So

771
00:40:59.429 --> 00:41:01.870
there are lots of combinations between pessimism, activism and

772
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.760
optimism. And there can also be misanthropes who genuinely

773
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.060
don't know whether to be optimistic or pessimistic. I

774
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.580
mean, I think Catherine Norlock in her work, says

775
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.540
that she's in that position. She says experience has

776
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.219
taught me to be very pessimistic about the prospects

777
00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:19.939
for serious positive social change. And yet at the

778
00:41:19.939 --> 00:41:22.500
same time, I do see cases where we have

779
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.070
done good things, and I see cases where, where

780
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.260
good can be done and. She might also say,

781
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.590
I'm very wary of pessimism becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

782
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.959
So there are people who are unsure whether to

783
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.719
be optimists or pessimists, and these are people that

784
00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.830
I'm, I will put in what I call the

785
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.120
the misanthropic predicament, where you are a misanthrope, but

786
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.090
you don't know what kind of misanthrope to be.

787
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.649
You can't choose a way of being a mis

788
00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:50.560
a misanthrope because you haven't decided on how optimistic

789
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.879
or pessimistic to be. And there are probably a

790
00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:55.260
lot of misanthropes in that position, because one of

791
00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.250
the problem with pessimism, of course, is. It's partly

792
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.409
a claim about the future course of humankind, and

793
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:04.169
that's very difficult to justify. I mean, unless like

794
00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:06.209
the Buddha, you have psychic powers and you can

795
00:42:06.209 --> 00:42:08.969
see the future, how do you know whether the

796
00:42:08.969 --> 00:42:11.570
world can be improved? The world sometimes might surprise

797
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.709
you. And I think a lot of, for a

798
00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:16.379
lot of misanthropes, that's the problem that they have.

799
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.010
It's not, should I be a misanthrop or not.

800
00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.770
For many of them, the evidence is overwhelming. The

801
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.010
question is what kind of misanthrope should I be?

802
00:42:24.169 --> 00:42:25.389
That's the difficult question.

803
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.500
So when it comes to the types of misanthrops,

804
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.100
you told us about the activist, the fugitive, and

805
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.979
the quietist, but in your work, I think you

806
00:42:35.979 --> 00:42:39.750
also identify 1/4 type that is the, the enemy,

807
00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:42.449
right? So, what is that about?

808
00:42:42.979 --> 00:42:46.439
So the enemy is the type of misanthrope that

809
00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:48.860
most people think of when they think of misanthropy.

810
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.080
So the enemy of mankind, this is one of

811
00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.560
Kant's terms, and he says that this kind of

812
00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:00.520
misanthrop is animated by hatred, contempt, um, and negative

813
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.320
feelings towards humankind. They, they are the, the, the

814
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.679
hater of humankind. And for Kant, the enemy is

815
00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:10.080
therefore disposed towards violence. Um, YOU know, they are

816
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.159
the ones who either want to. You know, literally

817
00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:17.399
destroy humankind, tear it down, destroy it all. They're

818
00:43:17.399 --> 00:43:20.239
the ones who talk about, um, wanting to bring

819
00:43:20.239 --> 00:43:23.159
about the extinction of humankind, or they might engage

820
00:43:23.159 --> 00:43:27.040
in more symbolic kinds of actions. For example, insulting

821
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.399
human beings, deriding human cultural achievements. So that's the

822
00:43:31.399 --> 00:43:33.399
kind of misanthrope most people think of. It's, it's

823
00:43:33.399 --> 00:43:36.169
the enemy of mankind. Um, BUT as Kant says,

824
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:38.760
this is a very extreme stance, and it's clearly

825
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.300
a morally vicious one. Because, you know, it's it's,

826
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.379
it's no fun to be an enemy misanthrop because

827
00:43:43.379 --> 00:43:47.219
it's characterized by hatred, disgust and contempt. It encourages

828
00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:50.340
distrust and alienation, and it often leads to practices

829
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.860
of violence. And for that reason, of course, I

830
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.699
don't want to endorse it. You know there are

831
00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:57.580
very good criticisms of the enemy misanthrope, for instance,

832
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.500
by Lisa Gerber and Judas Sklar. One problem though

833
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.699
is that it's also true that there are lots

834
00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:06.260
of enemy misanthropes. For example, if you look at

835
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.360
some of the radical eco misanthropes. It seems to

836
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.840
me they're clearly enemies, you know, so some of

837
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.760
the more radical and anarchistic environmental misanthropes, they'll talk

838
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.760
about, you know, tearing down the human world, unmaking

839
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.919
civilization. They're the ones who insist that it'd be

840
00:44:23.919 --> 00:44:26.320
a good thing if we went extinct, if a

841
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.449
comet was to smash into the world and destroy

842
00:44:28.449 --> 00:44:32.120
us, if COVID-19 had wiped out humankind, this would

843
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.040
all be for the best. So there are lots

844
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.260
of enemy misanthropes out there. But given the obvious

845
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.610
moral problems, I don't want to endorse it. Um,

846
00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:42.459
IT might be the case that for many people,

847
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.629
they, they pass through an enemy stage in their

848
00:44:45.629 --> 00:44:48.469
movement through misanthropy, but it'd be crucial for me

849
00:44:48.469 --> 00:44:50.909
that they move through the enemy stage and that

850
00:44:50.909 --> 00:44:53.149
they don't indulge it. I mean, it does seem

851
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:56.250
to me from the enemy misanthropes I've studied. That

852
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.500
being a misanthrope won't by itself make you an

853
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.169
enemy. There has to be other things at work

854
00:45:01.459 --> 00:45:04.260
that would toxify your misanthropy and make it enemy

855
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.570
style. You know, so in the case of the

856
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.770
eco misanthropic enemies, it's a combination of their misanthropy,

857
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.370
um, their idealized images of the natural world as

858
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.780
pure and innocent. There's usually a background sense of

859
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.879
alienation from human people, um, certain kinds of extremist

860
00:45:21.879 --> 00:45:26.290
political views, all of those things toxically together. Will

861
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.810
feed enemy style misanthropy. It's also worth noting with

862
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.520
the enemy stance, there are some people who call

863
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.239
themselves misanthropes when they're clearly not, they're something else.

864
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.889
So these are what I call false misanthropes. So

865
00:45:39.889 --> 00:45:41.770
there was a group of these in the United

866
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.209
States in the 1980s, um, people who call themselves

867
00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:48.489
misanthropes, and they said humankind is dreadful, humans are

868
00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:52.429
destroying the natural world. However, the proposals they made

869
00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:55.550
for dealing with this was first of all, to

870
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.199
cease all research and medical treatment of HIV and

871
00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:01.469
AIDS, to reduce the human population and to stop

872
00:46:01.469 --> 00:46:06.500
all um food and medical assistance to Africa. And

873
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.300
it seems to me that if you look at

874
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.379
their proposals, they're not misanthropes at all. They're homophobes

875
00:46:10.379 --> 00:46:14.290
and racists because the rhetoric is humankind is dreadful,

876
00:46:14.459 --> 00:46:15.540
but if you look at the people that they

877
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.219
want to hurt, it's very specific groups of human

878
00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:21.919
beings. So these people are false misanthropes. They describe

879
00:46:21.919 --> 00:46:24.770
themselves as misanthropes, but they're clearly not. They're using

880
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:28.780
it to describe different and much more problematic attitudes

881
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.659
towards humankind.

882
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:34.810
So when it comes to the activist misanthrop specifically,

883
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:40.060
or the more optimist kind of misanthrop, uh, earlier,

884
00:46:40.209 --> 00:46:44.530
you told us that at least some kinds of

885
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:50.179
eco misanthropes can be activists as well, but there

886
00:46:50.179 --> 00:46:53.580
are other kinds of activism, right, or other forms

887
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:58.649
of activism like transhumanism and anarcho-primitivism,

888
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:02.520
correct. Yes, so one thing to note about the

889
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.679
activist and the fugitive stances is they both have

890
00:47:05.679 --> 00:47:10.830
radical variations. So in the standard case, the activist,

891
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.629
uh, misanthrop is someone who wants to. Dramatically transform

892
00:47:15.629 --> 00:47:18.179
the human world, but they also want to ensure

893
00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:21.229
it's still a world that contains human beings, whereas

894
00:47:21.229 --> 00:47:24.590
the transhumanists, they want to radically transform the human

895
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.350
world, but if they're successful, there won't be human

896
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.189
beings in it. So these are radical activists, you

897
00:47:30.189 --> 00:47:33.969
know, so for most of the transhumanists. Um, THE

898
00:47:33.969 --> 00:47:36.179
creatures that should live in the world will be

899
00:47:36.179 --> 00:47:39.219
posthuman creatures. They will be so transformed that they're

900
00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:42.219
not recognizable anymore as human beings. They'll be, for

901
00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.060
example, immortal, or they won't have permanent physical bodies.

902
00:47:45.139 --> 00:47:49.699
They'll be morally perfect. They'll have elevated intellectual powers.

903
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.699
But the crucial point is they won't be human

904
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:55.340
beings anymore. And I describe that as radical activism

905
00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.620
because it is misanthropic. It's based on a perception

906
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.969
that vices and failings are constitutive of human life.

907
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.340
The correct response is to take dramatic measures to

908
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.179
transform human beings, but into something else that that's

909
00:48:09.179 --> 00:48:12.610
no longer human. So the transhumanists are radical activists.

910
00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:16.699
Um, LIKEWISE, I would include some of the antenatalists

911
00:48:16.699 --> 00:48:20.379
in that category because antenatalists like David Benatar are

912
00:48:20.379 --> 00:48:23.679
usually misanthropic. Um, YOU know, human beings are cruel,

913
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.939
greedy, violent, selfish, and we are the cause of

914
00:48:26.939 --> 00:48:29.419
all the world's moral problems. You know, no human

915
00:48:29.419 --> 00:48:33.439
beings, no vices and failings. And of course, their,

916
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.550
their, their activist measure is something like um the

917
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:42.360
voluntary cessation of procreation, gradually, nonviolently bringing the human

918
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.830
population down to zero. Now I would count that

919
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.149
again as radical activism, because it's misanthropic and it's

920
00:48:48.149 --> 00:48:50.919
activistic, but it doesn't honor the idea that the,

921
00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:53.870
the, the improved world contains human beings. For the

922
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.909
transhumanist, there are no human beings, there are transhumans.

923
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.389
For the antenatalists, ideally. There are no human beings,

924
00:49:00.639 --> 00:49:03.120
so they're radical activists. And again, they, they have

925
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.800
plenty of contemporary enthusiasts. There are lots of antenatalists

926
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.030
out there. Um, AND again, they might not use

927
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.919
the word misanthropic to describe themselves, but if you

928
00:49:13.919 --> 00:49:16.320
look at their moral evaluations of humankind, they're clearly

929
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.040
misanthropic. And in my terms, they're activistic because their

930
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.479
main response is to undertake dramatic transformations of human

931
00:49:23.479 --> 00:49:26.610
life. But if the dramatic transformations include getting rid

932
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.250
of human beings, then you're a radical activist.

933
00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:33.790
Uh, HOW about the anarcho-primitivists?

934
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.159
Um, That's a good question, but I think I

935
00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:41.320
don't know enough about narco primitivist, no. I mean,

936
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.169
I, I suppose if their aim is something like

937
00:49:45.479 --> 00:49:49.419
the replacement of. The forms of large scale complex

938
00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:53.780
social and political life with something far simpler, far

939
00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.750
less complex, far less structured. That would be still

940
00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.870
consistent with activist misanthropy, but it would be, it

941
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.399
will be leaning towards. It would be leaning towards

942
00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:06.639
the radical kind, but they wouldn't count as as

943
00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:08.679
radical activists because for me, what makes you a

944
00:50:08.679 --> 00:50:12.159
radical activist is that your vision of the future

945
00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:14.560
world is one in which there are no humans.

946
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:20.239
Right. OK, I understand. Uh, WHEN it comes to

947
00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:26.320
the types of misanthrop, how about simply embracing the

948
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.840
evils of humanity? I mean, couldn't there also be

949
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.550
such a misanthropic stance?

950
00:50:33.439 --> 00:50:37.030
That's interesting. I've I've encountered a couple of folks

951
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:40.639
on YouTube who are self-identified misanthropes who recommend something

952
00:50:40.639 --> 00:50:44.360
like this for you. um. I think that's intriguing.

953
00:50:44.479 --> 00:50:46.510
I mean, there, there are misanthropes I can think

954
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.600
of who I've seen in online discussion boards who

955
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.620
make something like this view. You know, they think,

956
00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:53.840
look, if, if the misanthropes are right and these

957
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.360
vices and failings are part of the human condition,

958
00:50:56.399 --> 00:50:59.679
then we should embrace them. Um, AND we should

959
00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:02.760
kind of exalt in a kind of uh human

960
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.040
depravity. I mean, those people, I suppose, might be

961
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.870
closely related to the enemy misanthropes, um. And it

962
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.110
will be interesting to know what their justifications for

963
00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:17.919
this is. Um, I mean they. I suppose they

964
00:51:17.919 --> 00:51:19.879
could say that they're a kind of quietist because

965
00:51:19.879 --> 00:51:21.679
if vices and failings are part of the human

966
00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:24.679
condition, then embracing your vices and failings is a

967
00:51:24.679 --> 00:51:28.010
way of embracing being a human being. And maybe

968
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.649
some misanthrops will say, well, actually, we shouldn't try

969
00:51:30.649 --> 00:51:32.889
to get rid of our vices and failings because

970
00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:35.969
they are part of the complexity and richness of

971
00:51:35.969 --> 00:51:39.189
human life. I mean, in, in some writings, Nietzsche,

972
00:51:39.209 --> 00:51:42.570
I think, voices attitudes like this, you know, when,

973
00:51:42.639 --> 00:51:46.080
when he urges that we should radically rethink our

974
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.169
tables of the values um and reassess what we

975
00:51:49.169 --> 00:51:51.810
think are the good and bad qualities of human

976
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:55.459
beings. Maybe he's thinking in that direction. Um, BUT

977
00:51:55.459 --> 00:51:57.169
in this case, I'd have to, I'd have to

978
00:51:57.169 --> 00:51:59.260
read more about these people and know what is

979
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.090
their, what is their motivation for doing this, and

980
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.449
how would they reconcile it with their misanthropy? Are

981
00:52:04.449 --> 00:52:06.889
they just thinking if we can't get rid of

982
00:52:06.889 --> 00:52:08.929
them, we might as well embrace them. If you

983
00:52:08.929 --> 00:52:11.129
can't beat them, join them, or are they thinking

984
00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:13.540
that there's, there is some other kind of value

985
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.050
to embracing human failings?

986
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.129
Mhm. Fair enough. So let me just ask you

987
00:52:19.129 --> 00:52:21.770
one last question. And of course, I, I guess

988
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.129
that uh your answer would depend on, on what

989
00:52:26.129 --> 00:52:30.550
kind of misanthrope you identify with, but uh how

990
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:34.649
do you think we can deal with humanity's malevolence

991
00:52:34.649 --> 00:52:36.409
without losing hope?

992
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.719
Well, my, my own sympathies are, are very much

993
00:52:41.719 --> 00:52:45.639
with quietest misanthropy. Um, I, I, I, I am

994
00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:49.639
largely persuaded that, uh, the vices and failings of

995
00:52:49.639 --> 00:52:53.919
misanthropes, that misanthropes identify, that they, they could never

996
00:52:53.919 --> 00:52:56.399
be permanently removed from human life. I mean, it's

997
00:52:56.399 --> 00:52:59.199
very sobering, for instance, if you read the Buddha's

998
00:52:59.199 --> 00:53:01.989
catalogs of our vices and failings, which were written

999
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.719
2.5 1000 years ago in India. It's all they're

1000
00:53:05.719 --> 00:53:08.040
all perfectly familiar. None of them have gone extinct

1001
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.979
in the last 2.5 millennia. Greed, cruelty, selfishness, lasciviousness,

1002
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.159
distrust, and so on. It does seem historically that

1003
00:53:17.159 --> 00:53:19.679
these vices and failings are permanent features of human

1004
00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:24.360
life. Now, of course the. The vices and failings

1005
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.560
we have can vary over time. They can be

1006
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.639
more or less frequent, more or less intense, more

1007
00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:31.469
or less severe, and there might be certain ways

1008
00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:34.679
in which we could make some modifications to the

1009
00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:39.840
human world to at least reduce their intensity and

1010
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.110
severity. Um, I mean, for example, Rousseau says that,

1011
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.479
you know, maybe certain kinds of human failings have

1012
00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:50.239
become weaker over time, but new ones have come

1013
00:53:50.239 --> 00:53:53.310
to take their place. I mean, by analogy. Um,

1014
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.219
CERTAIN diseases have been eradicated in the course of

1015
00:53:56.219 --> 00:53:59.419
history through vaccination campaigns, improvements in hygiene, and so

1016
00:53:59.419 --> 00:54:03.010
on. But many other, uh, kinds of diseases are,

1017
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.810
are here to stay. They're permanent. And I suppose

1018
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:08.899
the quietest misanthrope thinks something like that. We might

1019
00:54:08.899 --> 00:54:12.179
be able to minimize or reduce or limit certain

1020
00:54:12.179 --> 00:54:15.139
forms or expressions of our vices and failings, but

1021
00:54:15.139 --> 00:54:20.330
they really are here to stay. And. Whether, whether

1022
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:24.510
that would be uh. A mess a message of

1023
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.149
hopelessness, I don't know. I mean, certainly I don't

1024
00:54:27.149 --> 00:54:29.550
think there's, I don't think there's nothing that we

1025
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.870
can do. Um, THERE are always small scale measures

1026
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.229
we can take, and I suppose it might depend

1027
00:54:35.229 --> 00:54:38.139
for the, the misanthrope. Whether hope is to be

1028
00:54:38.139 --> 00:54:42.139
defined in terms of personal improvements in one's own

1029
00:54:42.139 --> 00:54:46.219
character, habit and lifestyle, or collective improvements, you know,

1030
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.169
so I, I have at least some hope that

1031
00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:51.939
individual misanthroppes can make some improvement to their own

1032
00:54:51.939 --> 00:54:53.659
moral character. They can do a little bit of

1033
00:54:53.659 --> 00:54:56.639
good in the world. But the idea of large

1034
00:54:56.639 --> 00:54:59.459
scale improvement, I have much less hope there. But

1035
00:54:59.459 --> 00:55:01.699
one characteristic of the quietest is that they focus

1036
00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:07.209
upon. Um, INDIVIDUAL self cultivation and small modest local

1037
00:55:07.209 --> 00:55:11.209
acts of goodness. For example, maybe you recognize I

1038
00:55:11.209 --> 00:55:13.709
can't reduce the failings of humankind as a whole,

1039
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.330
that's beyond my moral powers, but I can try

1040
00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:18.810
to be a better person myself. I can try

1041
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.560
to raise my children to be good, virtuous people,

1042
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.729
and I can try to improve the lives and

1043
00:55:23.729 --> 00:55:25.570
maybe the moral characters of some of the people

1044
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:28.050
in my local world. So you have a very

1045
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.000
small scale modest sense of what you can do.

1046
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.949
So maybe the question of hope depends upon the

1047
00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:35.310
scale of your ambitions. Because one problem with the

1048
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.310
activist misanthropes is they set their moral ambitions at

1049
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.629
a very high level. You know, the improvement of

1050
00:55:41.629 --> 00:55:44.469
the human condition, the abolition of greed, the extinction

1051
00:55:44.469 --> 00:55:47.969
of hatred. But if your moral ambitions are enormous,

1052
00:55:48.419 --> 00:55:50.949
then as the Buddha would warn you, you're setting

1053
00:55:50.949 --> 00:55:53.139
yourself up for frustration and disappointment because for the

1054
00:55:53.139 --> 00:55:55.860
Buddha, suffering is partly measured by the gap between

1055
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.750
your desires and ambitions, um, and, and the realities

1056
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.739
of the world, which I think is a good

1057
00:56:01.739 --> 00:56:03.939
reason to be a quietist. I mean, the quietest

1058
00:56:03.939 --> 00:56:06.659
doesn't give up on moral action. They are committed

1059
00:56:06.659 --> 00:56:09.620
to the moral project, but they do so on

1060
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.320
a small, modest local scale. And I think that

1061
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.800
if you're a quietest misanthrope and you carefully manage

1062
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.550
your hopes, you can maintain a kind of hope

1063
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.399
because your hopes are careful, modest and sensible. And

1064
00:56:23.399 --> 00:56:26.000
the the question would be is that hope enough

1065
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:26.989
for the misanthrope?

1066
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:32.090
OK, so just before we go, would you like

1067
00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:35.159
to tell people where they can find your work

1068
00:56:35.159 --> 00:56:36.139
on the internet?

1069
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.120
Yes, if you, uh, if you Google Ian Kidd

1070
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.320

1071
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.919

1072
00:56:44.919 --> 00:56:48.199
essays, there are some popular public essays, um, and

1073
00:56:48.199 --> 00:56:50.629

to tell me about their, their own experiences and,

1079
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.040
and conversions. Um, THAT'S always very valuable to me.

1080
