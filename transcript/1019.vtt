00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.769
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.220
joined by Reka Blazek. She is a phd candidate

4
00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.300
at Jesus lab that is the adaptive Cognition and

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.720
Economics and Society lab of the Department of Cognitive

6
00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.799
Science at Central European University. She is interested in

7
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.120
the cognitive and evolutionary roots of economic and political

8
00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:27.334
institutions. In other words, what are the links between

9
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:29.995
the design of the mind and the design of

10
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:34.255
institutions? And today we're talking basically about how social

11
00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:39.654
minds generate social phenomena, social norms, ownership and also

12
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.415
a little bit about a mental health uh for

13
00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:47.275
phd students. So RCA, welcome to the show. It's

14
00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:48.615
a big pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.505
Yeah. Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.560
OK. So when it comes to the topic of

17
00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:59.200
how social minds might generate societal phenomena, I mean,

18
00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.400
what exactly are you interested in understanding here and

19
00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.000
particularly linking to things like uh the roots of

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.239
economic and political institutions?

21
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:16.379
Yeah. So this is a huge topic and this

22
00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.569
um I, I could talk a lot, a lot

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.069
about this and in, in fact, in our, in

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.940
our lab at uh it it, it is our

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
uh pri primary goal is to, is to find

26
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.419
the links between the, the design of the mind

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.650
and uh and several um phenomena that, that, that

28
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.279
we see in, in our societies. So, for instance,

29
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.650
um some, some of the topics that we, that

30
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
we deal with include uh ownership, which is, which

31
00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.199
is my my topic, but we also have uh

32
00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.949
responsibility, fairness, uh leader of F fo follower games,

33
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.620
mi mi misinformation, uh commitment and trust. And uh

34
00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.360
so these are very di diverse uh diverse topics.

35
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.539
And what is in uh what is in common

36
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:17.369
is that um we all all approach these topics

37
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.399
uh from their uh co co uh cognitive and

38
00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.740
um evolutionary point point points of view. So, in

39
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.130
other words, we, we try to answer the, the

40
00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.610
question is that why uh did these things uh

41
00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.240
evolve in the, in, in, in, in the first

42
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.699
place? So what sort of um problems in, in,

43
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.880
in society do they try to, to, to solve?

44
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:52.309
And um the main reason why, why we, why

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.570
we would even have, have this approach is that

46
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.050
uh as we all know from, from many different

47
00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:02.649
uh fields of study, uh hu hu humans are

48
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.389
an ultra social uh uh species. So we are

49
00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.250
much more social than any other uh gray tapes.

50
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.440
And um the, the main uh evidence for this

51
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.559
is that we uh humans care about the uh

52
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.000
the, the mental states of, of uh Ooo other

53
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.610
humans. So we want to affect how the other

54
00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:32.639
person thinks and, and what the other person uh

55
00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:38.500
uh believes, whereas gray tapes by, by and large,

56
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.910
they only care about the behavior of the other

57
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.979
gray tape. And um so this, this is one

58
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:56.570
of the um starting points and um a further

59
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.190
starting point um be before we go down to

60
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.100
the, to the specifics. Um IS that we, we

61
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.740
have these incredible um um social cognitive uh capacities.

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.269
And um so basically, we, we, we, we want

63
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:22.059
to see how these um social cognitive capacities translate

64
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.739
into things like like laws and um social norms.

65
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.480
Mhm

66
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700
A

67
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.869
and so just before we get more specifically into

68
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.329
some of the work you're specifically doing on ownership,

69
00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.649
for example. So how does all of that, how

70
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.070
do do all of those starting points then connect

71
00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:50.100
to the study and understanding of how economic and

72
00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:55.209
political institutions develop ba based on the fact that

73
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.540
we have these, as you said, ultra social minds.

74
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.339
Uh HOW do, how do we build from one

75
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.049
to the other, let's say?

76
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.750
Yeah. Um So in uh economics, which is my

77
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.209
uh original academic background, uh there is a, a

78
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.730
very influential uh definition of um institutions by uh

79
00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:26.380
Douglas North, which is that um ins institutions are

80
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.450
the humanly devised, formal and informal constraints. Uh THAT,

81
00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:36.500
that shape uh how we interact in the, in

82
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:44.390
the economic sphere. Within uh within our societies and,

83
00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:49.760
and groups and uh in the uh political arena.

84
00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.089
And um so I was very inspired by, by,

85
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.609
by this quote when I, uh when I first

86
00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.929
came across it in my uh political economy uh

87
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.329
courses and uh and, and, and there is a

88
00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.589
great uh in, in interest in this, within the

89
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:18.149
um ee economist um community. But uh one thing

90
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.220
that left me a bit um unsatisfied is that

91
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.059
uh economists tend to treat these um institutions as

92
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.630
uh exogenous to the uh uh to the, to

93
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.179
the model. Uh But I thought that I'm not

94
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.410
sure if, if, if that's right because on the,

95
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.420
on the other hand, uh we have uh Pascal

96
00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:47.980
boys book uh Minds Make Societies. And uh and

97
00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:51.269
I wanted, uh and, and I want, wanted to

98
00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.549
join a lab uh that, that connects the two

99
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.549
and uh and that's what it is, is a,

100
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.700
is um so to be a bit more uh

101
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:11.309
uh a bit more specific, um we have this

102
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.920
uh not uh this norm um not, nor I'm

103
00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:18.890
sorry, um notion from a game theory called uh

104
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:24.029
common knowledge. It's also um very well studied in,

105
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.220
in psychology. Um One starting point in, in this

106
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.959
uh field in this uh so field is uh

107
00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:37.339
Xing's work on uh on uh uh conflict and

108
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.500
um in, in, in, in my own work, I

109
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.970
try to see how um people I identify what,

110
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.290
what is in the, in the common ground with

111
00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:53.220
uh with other people that allow them to uh

112
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.350
coordinate with each other. So, uh this is a

113
00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:05.779
bit abstract and uh by uh coordinations, I mean

114
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.940
that um so in our social interactions in our

115
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.970
uh in our day to day lives, um one

116
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.470
of our main goals is that we want to

117
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.339
avoid conflict with each other. Uh But, but we

118
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.109
also want to get uh as, as many resources

119
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.220
uh as, as, as it is uh as it

120
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:38.469
is possible. And um the theory that I'm, I'm,

121
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.869
I'm building to explain uh ownership is that um

122
00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:47.159
is that as we go about our lives, uh

123
00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:49.799
try, trying to uh trying to meet these 22

124
00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:54.140
goals. We, we, we try to read other people's

125
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.320
minds uh which is not an esoteric thing but

126
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:03.320
uh but the psy psychological uh uh process uh

127
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.229
uh this is what I mean by the, the

128
00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:11.909
social cognitive capacities uh is that in, in the

129
00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:16.219
technical jargon, it's that we, we have a mental

130
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:23.929
representation of other people's mental representations. And so we

131
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:28.719
utilize this to, to try to understand what the

132
00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:32.030
other person uh what, what wants to do with

133
00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:37.020
the, with the resources uh around us. And um

134
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:41.059
when, when, when we come across a resource that

135
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.849
we, we both want to use. Uh But uh

136
00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:47.330
there is no way to, to, to use it

137
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.369
at the same time then uh we have a

138
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.219
few uh options in uh ga game theoretic terms.

139
00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:58.049
It means that we, we, we have a choice

140
00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:02.969
between several uh uh uh pp payoffs. And the

141
00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:09.070
best um uh pay off is when I either

142
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.109
uh take the resource and you, you don't or

143
00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:18.039
you don't take the resource. Uh And uh I

144
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:22.229
do it. Yeah. So in uh in other words,

145
00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:25.630
we, we have a choice between usage and no

146
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.630
usage or no usage and uh and usage. And

147
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.979
if we both want to try to use it

148
00:10:33.989 --> 00:10:36.710
at the same time, then we have costs of

149
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.500
uh of fighting with each other. And if none

150
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.109
of us uh u uses the resource, then we

151
00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:48.099
miss out on the, on the benefits that may,

152
00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:52.530
that the, the resource may yield us. And um

153
00:10:53.109 --> 00:10:55.080
so to give you a bit more uh con

154
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.559
context about this uh uh for formulation. So this

155
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.520
is called the, the usage game that is used

156
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.114
to, to model uh ownership in uh uh Chea's

157
00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:13.715
book understanding in, in institutions. But this, this sort

158
00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:17.364
of uh uh payoff pay of matrix has also

159
00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:21.265
been called the hog dove game in uh evolutionary

160
00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:27.135
biology, but also the chicken game in uh in

161
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:33.229
uh uh economics. Um And it, the, the, the

162
00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:38.039
chicken game is about um letting the other, other

163
00:11:38.049 --> 00:11:41.119
person know that you're, you're just about to make

164
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.630
a move or you're not just about to make

165
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640
ma make a move and then what, what connects,

166
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.729
uh, all, all of these games is that, um,

167
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.090
it's a bit counterintuitive to, to, to, to think

168
00:11:57.099 --> 00:12:00.909
that. So some, sometimes I'm, I would be more,

169
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:04.630
uh, better off if I don't go for, for,

170
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.979
for, for, for, for the research that I want.

171
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.190
Um, AND yeah, so, uh, I, I don't want

172
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.969
to talk to too much about game theory.

173
00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:19.210
Uh, OK. So let me ask you because you've

174
00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:22.210
just described a little bit or gave us a

175
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:26.229
broad idea of the kinds of games specifically, I

176
00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:31.179
guess coordinations that you use in behavior economics here

177
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.229
to then, right, to go from there to I

178
00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:38.890
guess modeling social norms, right? So, uh I mean,

179
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.320
you, you do you have those kinds of studies

180
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.979
based on those games? And so uh how do

181
00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:51.489
you, do you go from there to modeling social

182
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.140
norms? Exactly.

183
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.229
Yes. Um I understand the question. I'm trying to

184
00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.739
think of the best way to.

185
00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.229
No, of course. Thank you.

186
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:10.809
No worries uh to, to explain it. So when,

187
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.309
when we are faced with this uh with these

188
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.849
payoffs, uh then we have this um uh selection

189
00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:23.320
problem. So we, we, we have to choose between

190
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.590
who, who goes for the resource and, and who,

191
00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:30.440
who, who, who, who, if it draws. And this

192
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.710
is where uh so social norms come in or

193
00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:36.880
in, in my, in my specific work. Uh This

194
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.469
is where beliefs about uh on ownership uh coming

195
00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:46.750
coming coming to the model um in um in

196
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.669
um in the theoretical framework that uh Francesco coa

197
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.979
uses in, in, in his book, uh he has

198
00:13:54.989 --> 00:14:00.609
this notion um correlation device and uh the uh

199
00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:08.679
correlation device is any sort of um norm or

200
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.280
anything that, that sends a, a signal to the,

201
00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:16.400
to the 22 parties about uh how, how, how,

202
00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:19.989
how, how they should behave. Uh So to make,

203
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.429
make it uh a bit less uh AAA abstract,

204
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.780
we have uh the traffic lights. So when, and

205
00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:34.469
uh traffic lights send um a clear signal about

206
00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:37.429
who should go, go, go ahead and uh and

207
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.549
who, who should wait. And um the fact that

208
00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:44.080
it's that it's a red light and the, and

209
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.179
the, and the green light makes it very easy

210
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.000
to be instantly recognized. Uh WHO should do what.

211
00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:56.780
And um, and we also know that everybody around

212
00:14:56.789 --> 00:15:00.890
us who, who takes part uh in uh in

213
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.820
traffic also knows what these, uh what these lights

214
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.700
mean. And we, we follow what the, what the

215
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.859
lights uh tell, tells us to do, knowing that

216
00:15:15.869 --> 00:15:20.650
everybody else uh around us uh does this and

217
00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:23.109
it's not because we have all signed some, some,

218
00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:26.710
some sort of form that I, I uh promise

219
00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:31.299
to not run into you. And uh but it's

220
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:39.500
um it's this um uh sort of in invisible

221
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:44.219
but not quite uh invisible uh on, on unwritten

222
00:15:44.229 --> 00:15:48.770
rules uh that, that govern our lives. And, uh,

223
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.419
and this is where, uh, common knowledge comes in.

224
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.969
So, uh, common knowledge is, is defined as the

225
00:15:56.979 --> 00:16:00.909
thing that I know you, you, you know, and

226
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.619
we both know that, that, that, that we both

227
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.479
know and the fact that we both know that

228
00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:12.119
uh, red means stop changes how we, how, how,

229
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:19.539
how we behave. And, um, and this is where,

230
00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:30.320
um, the model, OK. Um, TO, to scale up

231
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.559
and start. Mhm

232
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.809
So, uh I mean, perhaps to get into a

233
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.780
more concrete example, you've already told us a little

234
00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:46.419
bit about uh how, then you study ownership and

235
00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:50.309
how you're interested in ownership, but perhaps getting more

236
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.679
specifically into that, let me ask you a few

237
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.210
more specific questions about your work on ownership and

238
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.289
how it applies to our lives basically. So, uh

239
00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:06.719
uh I mean, uh where exactly what are the

240
00:17:06.729 --> 00:17:12.050
domains of our lives where ownership applies? Because perhaps

241
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.199
there are a few more domains where it applies

242
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:19.329
that perhaps we commonly do not think about it

243
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:24.310
as having anything to do with ownership. Exactly. So

244
00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.689
tell us a little bit about that.

245
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.640
Actually, I would say that ownership applies to every

246
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.660
domain uh in our lives. So we, if you,

247
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.869
if, if you think about it, we, we talk

248
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.869
about lots of different things in terms of ownership.

249
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.560
So of course, we have our uh belongings at

250
00:17:45.569 --> 00:17:50.109
home that um that are, of course uh ours,

251
00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:54.790
but we also use the term uh ownership to,

252
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.849
to talk about i ideas. Uh So uh a,

253
00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:02.839
a tune or some sentences in a, in a

254
00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:07.280
book or in a, in a scientific paper. Um

255
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:13.349
We also uh talk about the uh public space

256
00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:16.770
that, that surround us in, in terms of ownership.

257
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.839
So, like the uh our park or our uh

258
00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:26.010
street which scales up to uh con concepts like

259
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.339
our nation as opposed to their nation. Um I

260
00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:34.880
would say that our bodies is a, is a

261
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:41.229
special case of uh of ownership. Mhm And there

262
00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:46.530
are many uh uh many, many questions at the

263
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.430
fringes of ownership that, that are, are highly uh

264
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.770
uh topical right now. So for, for, for instance,

265
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.729
it's not clear who, who owns the uh uh

266
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:05.930
uh uh output of Chad GP T. Um And

267
00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:09.790
uh it's also not clear who, who will own

268
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.739
um outer space. And does this even make, make

269
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.250
any sense to ask who would own uh outer

270
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.750
space?

271
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.640
A and also at a certain point, you mentioned,

272
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.479
when I asked you about how you model social

273
00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:30.859
norms about how beliefs in this specific case about

274
00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:34.969
ownership really play a role here. But what are

275
00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:39.770
these beliefs about ownership? I mean, are there specific

276
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.050
kinds of beliefs that people have that perhaps are

277
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.359
more or less universal across human societies, for example.

278
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:56.000
Yes, there are 22 beliefs about ownership that are

279
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:02.930
uh near universal across uh across cultures the one

280
00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:06.000
that is very well documented is the first possession

281
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.560
assumption. Uh Orie Friedman has done a lot of

282
00:20:09.569 --> 00:20:14.010
work. Uh SH showing that uh this not only

283
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.770
emerges at a very young age, but it also

284
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.219
emerges at roughly the same ages across, across many

285
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:24.930
cultures. And it means that the, the first person

286
00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:29.209
who was seen with an object owns the object.

287
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.930
Um And actually this, this is the basis of

288
00:20:33.939 --> 00:20:38.170
many uh, laws in us, uh, uh, property loan

289
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:45.199
based on, um, 1/19 century, uh, uh, court case

290
00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:49.890
called, uh, Pearson versus Post. And they were fighting

291
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.920
about, uh, a fox that they were goes hunting.

292
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.959
Uh, WELL, one of them, uh, saw it first

293
00:20:56.969 --> 00:21:00.540
but the other, uh, shot it first and then,

294
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.770
so the dispute was over who actually gets to

295
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.209
keep the, the, the fox. And the court ruled

296
00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:12.609
that, uh, the person who c first can claim

297
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:17.689
ownership, uh, over it. The other, uh, that is

298
00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:24.170
somewhat universal, um, is the importance of the last

299
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.270
piece of food. Um This is based on, uh,

300
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.209
anecdotal, um, evidence that I've been, uh, collecting in

301
00:21:33.219 --> 00:21:39.050
recent weeks. Um And, uh, what, what I, what,

302
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.060
what I have found that many, many languages across

303
00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:47.140
the world have a special phrase or saying that,

304
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.089
that suggests that, that, uh, that taking the last

305
00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:55.030
piece of food is, uh, either, uh, shameful or

306
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.939
that the last piece of food is, uh, uh,

307
00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:03.750
special. So only the the special person gets to,

308
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.410
gets to take it. And if I'm not mistaken,

309
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.140
there are actually two phrases in uh in Portuguese,

310
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.069
one about the um the last biscuit in the

311
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:18.550
uh in the uh package.

312
00:22:19.329 --> 00:22:23.160
Yeah. Yeah. By the way, the phrase in Portuguese

313
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.229
is a whole mob. So

314
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.780
yes. And the other other one is that I,

315
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.719
I feel like the last uh slice of bread

316
00:22:32.729 --> 00:22:36.729
in the loaf uh which I'm told is a,

317
00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:41.199
is a way to express that you feel abandoned

318
00:22:41.209 --> 00:22:41.790
somehow.

319
00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:43.349
Mhm

320
00:22:43.699 --> 00:22:43.709
uh

321
00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:46.329
But uh by the way, you, you mentioned uh

322
00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:51.420
two or three beliefs about ownership that at least

323
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.760
according to the best evidence we have. And according

324
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.229
to what you said are at near universal, but

325
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.849
it's one thing for us to have those beliefs

326
00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:04.869
across human societies. But do we have any idea

327
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.469
of why we have them? I mean, where exactly

328
00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:13.699
they come from because why these beliefs specifically? That's,

329
00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:15.109
I guess the question here.

330
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.189
Yeah. The short answer to that question is that

331
00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:22.589
we have no, no, no idea where, where, where,

332
00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:26.630
where they come from. Um That there hasn't been

333
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.790
uh too much research about, about uh the uh

334
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.979
evolutionary roots of the, of, of these beliefs. Um

335
00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:46.390
WE have and uh a lot of um ethnographic

336
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.329
uh evidence about uh ho ho how much uh

337
00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:55.939
norms vary when it comes to uh giving sh

338
00:23:55.949 --> 00:24:00.449
sharing and, and um uh uh gifting and, and

339
00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:04.760
we also know that, uh, theft is, uh, very

340
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:10.569
much, um, ff, frowned upon, uh, and it's, it's,

341
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:16.150
uh, p punished in, in, in severe ways. Um,

342
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.900
BUT where they, where they come from exactly is

343
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.810
not, not explained that. Well, uh, there is some

344
00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:29.739
re re research, um, about it, um, which I,

345
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.969
I would put in, um, uh, on a, on

346
00:24:33.979 --> 00:24:37.040
a spectrum and at the 11 end of the,

347
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.339
one end of the spectrum, these beliefs and, and

348
00:24:40.349 --> 00:24:44.300
norms of that ownership would be explained uh purely

349
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.920
in terms of so social learning and uh and

350
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.640
following rules. So uh this is um th th

351
00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:55.640
th this, this would be the uh purely ga

352
00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:03.510
game theoretic uh ex explanation of beliefs. Um And

353
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.109
the main, main point here is that uh we

354
00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:11.020
just simply acquire these norms uh as we, as

355
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.430
we as, as, as we grow up. Um But

356
00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:18.319
um we don't, we, we are not born with

357
00:25:18.329 --> 00:25:22.959
any specific ideas about uh about ownership or uh

358
00:25:22.969 --> 00:25:27.479
sharing resources. And at the other end of the,

359
00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:32.130
of the spectrum, um we, we have this idea

360
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.229
that uh on ownership is a core uh cog

361
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:41.290
cognitive uh capacity so that it, it's uh it's

362
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:47.150
specifically evolved and it's uh it's like uh um

363
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.479
naive uh uh physics or naive uh uh so

364
00:25:53.489 --> 00:25:58.890
sociology, meaning that uh that we are born with,

365
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.550
with some very basic ideas uh about uh in,

366
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.260
in, in interactions between other people or uh that

367
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.140
we, we have this uh uh expectation that um

368
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.890
objects fall, fall down when we let go of

369
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.229
them. That's uh that, that, that is what called

370
00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:24.439
uh naive um uh physics. Uh And this, this

371
00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:28.989
idea is uh uh has been developed by uh

372
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.060
Friedman and uh uh others. And um we also

373
00:26:36.069 --> 00:26:39.900
have a, a newer um uh theory of the

374
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.489
psychology of ownership by uh by Pascal Boyer. And

375
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.660
he explains it as the in interaction of uh

376
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.880
two cognitive um sys systems, which is um cooper

377
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:59.880
operation and co com competition. And that's where uh

378
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:05.410
uh beliefs about on ownership are born. And I

379
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.420
would put my own uh developing series somewhere somewhere

380
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:16.790
in the middle that um that we primarily want

381
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.650
to coordinate with uh with other hu hu human

382
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:27.219
beings. So we use um anything that we expect

383
00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:31.780
uh the other person to uh to know about

384
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:39.599
the uh social environment around us. Um So we

385
00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:42.050
use what whatever is in the, in the uh

386
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.260
common ground in order to coordinate with each other

387
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:54.469
about the use of resources. And that could explain

388
00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:57.410
why, why we have uh such a big uh

389
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.910
diversity in uh in uh own she believes.

390
00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:07.790
Uh And so, I mean, just to summarize it

391
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.930
a little bit before we move on to the

392
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:12.729
last topic of our conversation today. So there's an

393
00:28:12.739 --> 00:28:16.599
array of theories out there from the ones that

394
00:28:16.609 --> 00:28:21.770
are, that propose perhaps some more innate mechanisms or

395
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.770
some innateness to the idea of, or being attuned

396
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.079
to ownership in some way, all the way to

397
00:28:29.175 --> 00:28:34.375
the ones that are perhaps more developmental based or

398
00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:39.594
more sociologically based where you are really socially exposed

399
00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:43.814
to beliefs about ownership and that's how you acquire

400
00:28:43.824 --> 00:28:46.375
them. But I mean, even I, I would imagine

401
00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:49.704
that, uh first of all, at this point, we're

402
00:28:49.714 --> 00:28:53.675
still not sure which of these theories is correct

403
00:28:53.685 --> 00:28:57.699
or at least more correct than the others. Or

404
00:28:57.709 --> 00:29:01.050
perhaps, or perhaps they might be correct in some

405
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.520
aspects but not others and they then might complement

406
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.500
each other. I don't know. But uh even if

407
00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:11.420
there are some near universality to some of these

408
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.979
ownership beliefs, it uh uh that in and of

409
00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:21.739
itself does not indicate necessarily that uh the beliefs

410
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.290
themselves are somewhat innate, right? Because, I mean, it's

411
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.479
just that we, even if there's some innateness to

412
00:29:30.489 --> 00:29:35.650
our, we're being attuned to pay attention to perhaps

413
00:29:35.709 --> 00:29:40.569
uh social information about ownership or ownership beliefs and

414
00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:45.800
practices, uh that's not the same as those beliefs

415
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.239
being uh innate, right? It's something that we might

416
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.310
just acquire through, I don't know, some game theoretical

417
00:29:55.319 --> 00:30:00.119
phenomena or some other sort of uh social psychological

418
00:30:00.369 --> 00:30:04.849
uh mechanisms uh that we might acquire from other

419
00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:08.000
people in our society and culture. Right.

420
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.500
Yeah. Yeah. II, I think that the way you

421
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.930
put it is uh is exactly right. So I,

422
00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:19.130
I don't believe that um the first possession assumption

423
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.530
for instance, is uh in and of itself um

424
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.890
innate. It's the, it's the fact that it's so

425
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.849
intuitive is what, what makes it uh a cultural

426
00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:37.709
um universal. So, uh as you said, the innate

427
00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:43.500
mechanisms that uh we all share um as a

428
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.290
h humans is the, is the ability to, to

429
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.089
be uh ultras social and the, and the ability

430
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.310
and the desire to uh to, to cooper and

431
00:30:56.319 --> 00:31:03.560
coordinate with others. And this um this manifests uh

432
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.439
it. So this is uh manifest from or in,

433
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:12.670
in uh a white uh range of uh cul

434
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.640
cultural be, be, be behaviors or to put it

435
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.199
in a, in a slightly different way. The uh

436
00:31:22.439 --> 00:31:28.219
uh there are cultural uh evolutionary processes that cater

437
00:31:28.229 --> 00:31:33.060
to the uh cognitive capacities of humans that are

438
00:31:33.069 --> 00:31:37.819
uh scaffolded on, on top of uh bi biological

439
00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:44.199
evolutionary processes. And to uh translate that um I

440
00:31:44.209 --> 00:31:48.130
would say that there is a, that there are

441
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.949
two sets of in intuitions. Uh DIVIDER set is

442
00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:59.420
the, the uh biological set and the uh the

443
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:04.180
local uh the local culture uh makes it more

444
00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:06.979
uh uh specific to the. So, so that it

445
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:10.939
fits the, the, the highly specific local uh en

446
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.260
environment. So to give an example, we have um

447
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.420
in, in, in, in inheritance and um usually in

448
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:30.849
most, most societies, the uh offspring uh gets some

449
00:32:30.859 --> 00:32:34.939
of the wealth or uh land or whatever that

450
00:32:34.949 --> 00:32:38.050
the, that their uh that, that their parents had

451
00:32:38.349 --> 00:32:41.630
because, uh, it's more, more beneficial if, if it

452
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.020
stays within the, uh, within the same, uh, kinship

453
00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:50.939
structure and it's, um, but it's ba based on

454
00:32:50.949 --> 00:32:57.589
the, the specific, um, society uh, uh structure, uh,

455
00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:01.250
that who, who, who gets to in, in inherit

456
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.510
first, the, the first born son or the 1st,

457
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.310
1st born daughter.

458
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:10.910
Mhm. Ok, great. So, um, I guess that, uh,

459
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.420
now we can move on to the last topic

460
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.739
of our conversation today, which has to do with

461
00:33:17.939 --> 00:33:21.989
mental health in phd students. I mean, you are

462
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.290
a phd student. I myself have never been a

463
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.260
phd student but I have a master's degree. So

464
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.040
it was already a bit stressful back then. So

465
00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:37.250
tell us a little bit more about that. So,

466
00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.140
uh I, I mean, o of course, this is

467
00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:44.050
not a strictly academic topic but since you are

468
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.469
a phd student and you are interested in this,

469
00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:51.079
I mean, in the challenges and mental challenges and

470
00:33:51.089 --> 00:33:55.969
anxieties that the phd student usually goes through. What

471
00:33:55.979 --> 00:33:59.000
are your, uh I mean, what would you have

472
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.119
to say about the topic here?

473
00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:06.400
Yeah, I, I think it's important to uh talk

474
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.760
about it and e especially in, in your uh

475
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.250
uh show because I assume most of your audience

476
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.918
are uh in uh academia uh either at the

477
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.989
phd student level or, or at the faculty level.

478
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.659
And um so what, what I the, the mo

479
00:34:26.668 --> 00:34:32.458
most, most important thing that um that I think

480
00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:38.290
every phd student goes through is that when we,

481
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.539
when we start this um journey, we, we have

482
00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:46.289
to make the mental switch from consuming knowledge to,

483
00:34:46.299 --> 00:34:51.989
to producing knowledge. And um that's not easy at

484
00:34:51.998 --> 00:35:00.839
all and all the um series and uh scientific

485
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:04.958
um uh paradigms that, that we had to master

486
00:35:05.178 --> 00:35:09.378
in our master's degrees. And, and before that they,

487
00:35:09.529 --> 00:35:13.358
we, we, we find out that they are actually

488
00:35:13.368 --> 00:35:17.339
not that much um set in stone. And uh

489
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:22.329
everything is much more uh mu much more flexible

490
00:35:22.339 --> 00:35:27.370
and much less uh uh predictable than then, than

491
00:35:27.379 --> 00:35:32.360
we thought it would be. And um and this

492
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.600
is, this is where the, the challenge uh uh

493
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:41.330
stems from because when, as, as we, as, as

494
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.939
we try to find our uh uh specific fields

495
00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:48.800
that we uh that, that we write our diseases

496
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.520
on. We, we have to, we, we have to

497
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:57.080
find a way to, to make a meaningful contribution

498
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:04.360
to uh to academia and um uh that's not

499
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.699
easy at all. Um And the, and the other,

500
00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:12.659
other thing that's uh that's uh specific to uh

501
00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:16.080
to the position of phd students is that um

502
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.629
the whole, the whole uh structure uh of most

503
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:26.260
phd programs around the world uh is uh that

504
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.870
we are basically our, our own boss and that

505
00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:35.379
the uh mo motivation it has to come from

506
00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:41.989
viz because um the, the fruits of our, our

507
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.520
labor. Um, IT'S not that it, it doesn't come

508
00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.659
then the next day. In fact, it, it, it,

509
00:36:50.669 --> 00:36:55.409
it takes years to, to, to see some actual

510
00:36:55.419 --> 00:37:02.250
tangible results. And, um, and then, you know, you,

511
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.090
you have to be able to, to, to find

512
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.010
what, uh, what motivates you on the, on the,

513
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.530
on the day to day basis.

514
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.090
A and so, basically, I guess that the main

515
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.110
challenge here is that as you move from your

516
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.850
master's degree to a phd, uh you have basically

517
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.580
to become a theoretician yourself, right? I mean, you

518
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.080
have to try to start to develop your own

519
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.360
hypothesis and not just consume the work of other

520
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.129
people uh and try and try to make work

521
00:37:37.209 --> 00:37:40.030
on that basis. And you also have to try

522
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.620
to be to become more and more aware of

523
00:37:42.629 --> 00:37:45.830
the fact that perhaps if you're trying to study

524
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.189
or understand the particular phenomena in this case, for

525
00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:54.379
example, a psychological phenomenon, um you have to look

526
00:37:54.389 --> 00:37:58.979
across the different hypotheses out there are different theories,

527
00:37:58.989 --> 00:38:01.469
some of them with more or less support and

528
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:05.239
you have to try to basically weigh them. Uh

529
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.030
And then uh uh also, I, I would imagine

530
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.929
that at the end of the day, you also

531
00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:13.429
have to decide on the theoretical framework that you're

532
00:38:13.439 --> 00:38:16.879
going to apply in your specific work, which is,

533
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.540
I would imagine very complicated. I mean, I, I'm,

534
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.739
I'm uh an interview or a science communicator to

535
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.760
some extent. As I said, I've never been a

536
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.159
phd student, but just because I talk with people

537
00:38:30.169 --> 00:38:35.909
from many areas and disciplines and sometimes we, we

538
00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:39.060
end up covering the same topics but from different

539
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:44.139
perspectives. And I myself many times find myself thinking

540
00:38:44.149 --> 00:38:48.060
about, ok, so there's this theory, that theory and

541
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.239
then of course, it's not for me to decide

542
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.010
which one is correct. I just ask the questions

543
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.409
and many times if people are honest, they say,

544
00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:59.600
oh, we're still not sure. Uh I have this

545
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.379
and that idea. I don't know. Or I think

546
00:39:03.389 --> 00:39:06.629
that the, this theory has more support to it

547
00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:09.620
than the others. And I'm going to explain why,

548
00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:12.560
but we're still not sure, something like that. And

549
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.719
uh but, but um in most cases, I mean,

550
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:22.050
I'm interviewing already, professors, tenured professors, people that have

551
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.699
been doing this for sometimes decades and for a

552
00:39:25.709 --> 00:39:29.590
phd student to really get into that mindset and

553
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.850
to really uh by themselves trying to evaluate all

554
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.070
that kind of information I would imagine is very

555
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080
complicated,

556
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:44.770
right? Yes. Um It is. Um And it's, it's

557
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:51.500
important to um understand that um on, on, on

558
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.629
the one hand, all the uh uh theoretical frameworks

559
00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:58.649
that, that we use, they ha they have their

560
00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:03.459
limits and uh and every sort of um empirical

561
00:40:03.469 --> 00:40:09.129
work also has, has their, their, their limits. Um

562
00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:13.820
So, uh so, as I said, in the, in

563
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.610
the first part of this uh interview II, I

564
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.120
use insights from, from, from game theory, but also

565
00:40:21.129 --> 00:40:25.959
from uh anthropology and uh uh and cognitive science.

566
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:30.959
Uh Because I, because I, I think that every

567
00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:35.250
academic field has, has their uh advantages but also

568
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:41.570
also their limits and um uh the, the best

569
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:46.560
way to, to, to find the, the richest um

570
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.969
explanation or the or the, or the best uh

571
00:40:49.979 --> 00:40:54.050
uh mo model is to, is to combining insights

572
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:59.610
from uh from multiple fields. And that means that

573
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:04.800
um that it's hard to, it's hard to reconcile

574
00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:13.280
established um frameworks with other established frameworks. And uh

575
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.679
it takes, I would say years of um or,

576
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:25.100
or, or lots of time to, to, to sharpen

577
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.530
your um argumentative skills and to, and to really

578
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.229
try to understand what uh CRE A uh tr

579
00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:38.600
tries to explain um and what uh Creb tr

580
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.360
tries to do and how, how they can uh

581
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.459
or where they, where they co co co compliment

582
00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:47.040
each other. And yeah, as, as, as you said,

583
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:54.129
we, um we, we will never know the full

584
00:41:54.139 --> 00:41:58.810
truth about um our fields and about uh anything

585
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.149
to be, to be honest, we can just get

586
00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:05.929
better at better at uh creating tools that help

587
00:42:05.939 --> 00:42:07.149
us understand it.

588
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.500
Yeah. And even when it comes to the sort

589
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.050
of need for interdisciplinary, I mean, getting familiarized with

590
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.350
different fields and different methodologies, different theories that that's

591
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.229
also a very big challenge, right? Because for example,

592
00:42:23.239 --> 00:42:26.070
if someone in your particular case, is tried to

593
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.449
bring, to bring to the table tools from psychology,

594
00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:33.854
economics, anthropology, cognitive science. I mean, that's not easy

595
00:42:33.864 --> 00:42:36.135
at all because I would imagine that if someone

596
00:42:36.264 --> 00:42:39.475
was to get into a phd, that is so

597
00:42:39.485 --> 00:42:43.895
interdisciplinary and they come from, for example, anthropology or

598
00:42:43.905 --> 00:42:47.725
economics or psychology, I mean, they have been trained

599
00:42:47.735 --> 00:42:52.675
and they are familiarized with the particular math methodologies,

600
00:42:52.685 --> 00:42:57.199
uh ways of theorizing from there are those specific

601
00:42:57.229 --> 00:43:00.399
areas, right? And so uh when they go into

602
00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:03.820
the phd, they also have to try to train

603
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.060
themselves uh when it comes to all of those

604
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:14.139
different um ways of theorizing and methodologies from uh

605
00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:17.439
fields that they are not familiar with that. And

606
00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:19.485
I, I mean, I'm not, uh I'm not saying

607
00:43:19.495 --> 00:43:24.955
that these also cannot really be a collaborative enterprise

608
00:43:24.965 --> 00:43:29.175
because uh you also might collaborate with other people

609
00:43:29.185 --> 00:43:32.314
in your phd and get insights from them. But,

610
00:43:32.324 --> 00:43:36.185
but still, I mean, you, you've already went through

611
00:43:36.195 --> 00:43:41.104
several, several years acquiring knowledge and training yourself in

612
00:43:41.114 --> 00:43:43.699
how to be a, I don't know, as, and

613
00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:47.770
a scientist in psychology, anthropology, economics or whatever. And

614
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.889
now suddenly you also, you have to expand and

615
00:43:51.899 --> 00:43:56.090
what, what you've learned from one area does not

616
00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:01.189
necessarily apply or work the same for other areas.

617
00:44:01.199 --> 00:44:04.729
Right. Yeah. Um Yeah, that, that is exactly right.

618
00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:08.629
So in um um economics, the sample sizes tend

619
00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:11.149
to be much, much bigger than in, in psychology,

620
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.439
And in the, in the first couple of months,

621
00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:19.179
I was uh surprised at this frankly that, um

622
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.050
uh but then I understood that the, that the

623
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.989
goal of data collection in, in one field and

624
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.629
in, and in the other is, is not the

625
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:36.570
same. Um And then same, same goes for the,

626
00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:43.139
for the statistical methods themselves. Um There are certain

627
00:44:43.149 --> 00:44:48.040
models that uh that are uh favored in, in,

628
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.659
in, in, in psychology. Uh BUT they are not

629
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:57.040
used at all in, in uh uh economics. And

630
00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:01.100
if you ask um uh professors, then they, they,

631
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.750
they might say that that, yeah, don't, don't use

632
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.750
that because um um it, it introduces uh too,

633
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.979
too much noise in your, to your, to your

634
00:45:11.989 --> 00:45:15.350
results and, and it's very hard to interpret them.

635
00:45:16.129 --> 00:45:20.100
But in, in psychology, it's um it seems to

636
00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.459
be fine and, and also we uh we have

637
00:45:23.469 --> 00:45:27.479
to understand that these, these fields are also a

638
00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:36.060
collection of um conventions. So uh how you, how,

639
00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.379
how, how you write a ho how you write

640
00:45:38.389 --> 00:45:41.060
a, a AAA paper, how you formulate a question,

641
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:45.939
how you uh choose your specific uh method? They

642
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.459
to uh to some extent they are, they are

643
00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:52.729
based on the, the, the conventions in that, in

644
00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:57.570
that specific field. Um And then, yeah, you, you,

645
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.600
you said uh collaboration with other fields. So um

646
00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:06.530
one very rewarding thing of being part of the

647
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.409
AC lab is that um uh every member comes

648
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:15.560
from, uh, from a, from a different field. Uh,

649
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:20.030
MANY are trained in, uh, anthropology. Some, some people

650
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.590
are trained in, uh, uh, political science. Um, AND

651
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.179
of course, uh, everybody has, uh, some training in,

652
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:35.330
in psy psychology. So, um, that not only means

653
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.709
that collectively we have quite a big, uh, wealth

654
00:46:39.719 --> 00:46:44.909
of, um, ideas and, uh, and, uh, and knowledge,

655
00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:49.100
it also means that, uh, we can really learn,

656
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.100
learn from each other and, and um and we

657
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.770
can um he help each other to come up

658
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.649
with a, with a richer uh ex ex explanation

659
00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:03.790
of the, of the uh PP phenomena that we

660
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.580
are uh uh uh studying and to come back

661
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.159
to the very beginning of the interview, we are,

662
00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:16.389
we are all um interested in um coming up

663
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:20.739
with explanations that, that really get them to the

664
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:24.350
core of the, of these weird things that we

665
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.060
see uh happening in, in society every day.

666
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.870
Mhm Y Yeah. And I would imagine also here

667
00:47:32.879 --> 00:47:36.280
that uh I mean, the there's this common idea

668
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:40.719
there that there's one way of doing science and

669
00:47:40.729 --> 00:47:43.949
you learn how to do it, you learn, for

670
00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:47.290
example, how to read the paper, you learn statistical

671
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.909
analysis and all of that and uh you're fine,

672
00:47:50.919 --> 00:47:57.229
you can properly evaluate scientific information from all areas.

673
00:47:57.239 --> 00:48:00.070
But uh I mean, uh sometimes I've talked with

674
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.110
people who do work in education, educational psychologists, for

675
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.389
example, people from cognitive science that also do work

676
00:48:07.399 --> 00:48:09.889
on that. And I think that the correct term

677
00:48:09.899 --> 00:48:15.500
mirror would be uh context independent critical thinking skills.

678
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.489
That is uh suppo supposed set of critical thinking

679
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.020
skills in science that you could apply across all

680
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.590
disciplines and domains. But uh I, I guess that

681
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.510
the uh it doesn't really work that way because

682
00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.370
to pro to be able to properly evaluate work

683
00:48:35.389 --> 00:48:41.169
in anthropology, psychology, economics and so on, you really

684
00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:46.850
have to do the work and learn the, the,

685
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.530
the theories there and learn how to properly evaluate

686
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:57.429
evidence there, learn the methodology, particularly the methodologies vary

687
00:48:57.469 --> 00:49:02.489
a lot across different disciplines and learn how to

688
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.074
really, I mean, so I've read the paper, what

689
00:49:06.084 --> 00:49:10.655
can I conclude from these, from these data? Uh

690
00:49:10.665 --> 00:49:14.425
I mean, i it's, it's not the same across

691
00:49:14.435 --> 00:49:18.235
different domains, right? I mean, of course, you are

692
00:49:18.274 --> 00:49:21.504
more aware of this than I am, I guess.

693
00:49:21.514 --> 00:49:24.304
So, do, do you agree with that or, or

694
00:49:24.314 --> 00:49:24.475
not?

695
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:31.909
Yeah. Uh I do so. Um HISTORICALLY, uh and

696
00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:36.780
an anthropology and psychology has been um uh pitted

697
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:41.610
against because um um you know, to, to be

698
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.250
very um to put, put things in a nutshell.

699
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:51.530
Uh An, an anthropology tries to explain things uh

700
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.209
from the, from the perspective of how the that

701
00:49:55.219 --> 00:49:59.570
specific context uh shapes the, the, the, the behavior

702
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.770
of the, of, of the person or, or, or

703
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:06.530
the group. And uh psychology is the opposite in,

704
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.790
in the sense that it, it, it, it assumes

705
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.370
that there are that there are universal things about

706
00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:19.659
uh every human being. And um when you, when

707
00:50:19.669 --> 00:50:22.239
you read a paper in, in one field and,

708
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.909
and then the other, then, then, then you have

709
00:50:23.919 --> 00:50:30.179
to keep this um um this um main as

710
00:50:30.189 --> 00:50:34.770
assumption in mind or uh or another example is

711
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.810
um economics and, and, and, and psychology, so many

712
00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:45.250
models in micro uh economics um assume rational choice.

713
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.600
And then um many findings in, in psychology have

714
00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:54.129
shown that uh people are not always rational. Uh

715
00:50:54.139 --> 00:50:57.850
So those uh these deviations from the, from the

716
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.520
rational choice uh have been called uh uh cognitive

717
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:07.280
biases. But actually, I, I wouldn't recall them uh

718
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.590
that because they are not, they are, they're not

719
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.469
a mistake. They are, these uh biases would be

720
00:51:14.479 --> 00:51:20.550
better called as uh mental shortcuts that evolved to

721
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:27.560
make uh uh decision making easier. But when they

722
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:30.330
are taken to a, to a slightly different uh

723
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:34.409
con context, then uh they, they might lead to

724
00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:38.840
a worse outcome. So, having a strong uh uh

725
00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:44.560
preference for calorie rich uh food or sweet, sweet,

726
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.879
sweet foods is not um uh a fundamental mistake

727
00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:51.709
that we have to correct that this evolved in

728
00:51:51.719 --> 00:51:55.629
a, in an environment where uh where food was,

729
00:51:55.639 --> 00:51:58.459
was scarce and you couldn't go to the supermarket

730
00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:00.139
and we,

731
00:52:00.149 --> 00:52:03.419
we were, we were more calorie restricted.

732
00:52:03.689 --> 00:52:09.239
Right? Yes, exactly. So, um you said something about

733
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.159
one way to do science. Right. And I, I

734
00:52:12.169 --> 00:52:18.169
think the one that, um, the, the one good

735
00:52:18.179 --> 00:52:21.100
way or to, to do science, right is to

736
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:26.919
stay open minded and, uh, uh, curious and, um,

737
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:34.600
um, well, try to read across fields and also

738
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:42.870
to, to have, uh, hobbies outside academia because, uh,

739
00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:47.129
as phd students it's easy to, to, to think

740
00:52:47.139 --> 00:52:50.169
that we have to spend 12 hours a day

741
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.870
on our, on our thesis. But um I don't

742
00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:58.020
think that that's um that's the right thing to,

743
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.500
to do.

744
00:52:59.659 --> 00:53:01.699
Uh A and by the way, and this will

745
00:53:01.709 --> 00:53:05.580
probably be my last question since uh I introduced

746
00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:09.929
the topic by mentioning mental health in phd students.

747
00:53:09.939 --> 00:53:12.979
So I, in your experience, what would you say

748
00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:17.560
are some of the mental health consequences of really

749
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:22.669
having to make this shift into becoming a phd

750
00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:23.399
student?

751
00:53:24.689 --> 00:53:29.929
Well, a common thing is the impostors, impostors syndrome

752
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.669
where you, where you think that you, you don't

753
00:53:33.679 --> 00:53:38.620
actually belong or you, you are a fraud, you

754
00:53:38.629 --> 00:53:42.909
are not cut out to, to do the work

755
00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:47.290
that you are supposed to be doing, right? But

756
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.300
um I guess in 99% of the cases that's,

757
00:53:52.310 --> 00:54:00.560
that's not true. Um Some, some something else that

758
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.639
that's common is that in my experience that some

759
00:54:03.689 --> 00:54:11.500
phd students feel uh isolated. Um But when you

760
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.739
know that um most people around you struggle with

761
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.169
the same things, then that knowledge should make you

762
00:54:19.179 --> 00:54:24.300
feel less isolated So this is also an example

763
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.969
of how common knowledge changes our behavior.

764
00:54:29.129 --> 00:54:31.590
And I would imagine that, of course, I haven't

765
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.340
looked at the data for a while now, but

766
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.189
I remember reading some studies a few years ago

767
00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:44.989
where if I remember correctly, um phd students suffer,

768
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.310
tend to suffer from anxiety, depression and other conditions

769
00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.760
like that. I, I mean, they, when I say

770
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.969
they tend to suffer, it's uh higher proportion than

771
00:54:57.979 --> 00:55:00.679
the general population. I, I guess,

772
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.610
yeah, I, I think I've seen that too but

773
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.590
I'm not sure what explains that. So it, it,

774
00:55:06.909 --> 00:55:11.620
I, I don't think that um people who are

775
00:55:11.629 --> 00:55:17.540
not prone to uh an anxiety and depression suddenly

776
00:55:18.629 --> 00:55:22.939
and develop them when they start their phd s,

777
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:27.409
it's maybe it might be the case that people

778
00:55:27.419 --> 00:55:30.479
who are already prone to these, uh to these

779
00:55:30.489 --> 00:55:35.949
conditions sort of self select themselves into, into the,

780
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:40.889
into the phd. Um But in a, in a

781
00:55:40.899 --> 00:55:44.350
sense it, it doesn't really matter what, um what,

782
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.780
what the, what the source of, of this is

783
00:55:47.169 --> 00:55:52.850
because um uh what, what is the point is,

784
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:56.649
what, what can be done to, to make it

785
00:55:57.479 --> 00:56:04.149
easier. Um And so many, many universities or have

786
00:56:04.159 --> 00:56:06.979
a, have a uh some sort of in House

787
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:12.520
uh Psychological Council. Um And in, in general there,

788
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.320
there's a lot of focus on, on mental health

789
00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:20.590
and all sorts of social media platforms. And um

790
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.370
if supervisors are, are aware of this, that um,

791
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:31.169
that their students are also human beings and they

792
00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:33.340
are, it's, it's not just that the, that, that

793
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:36.020
the two of them were gonna, we gonna work

794
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:40.379
on a topic together but uh that both of

795
00:56:40.389 --> 00:56:43.850
them or the, the students have, have these uh

796
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:50.510
sorts of um challenges then most supervisors in, in

797
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:56.639
my experience try to um accommodate for this and,

798
00:56:56.649 --> 00:56:59.679
and make it uh a smoother ride.

799
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.760
Mhm. Yeah. And, and also I would imagine that

800
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:08.550
another thing that it has been implicit and in

801
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.810
what we were saying here is that when you

802
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.280
move from, for example, a master's degree to a

803
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:21.120
phd, the workload also goes uh I, I mean,

804
00:57:21.129 --> 00:57:22.770
increases a lot,

805
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:29.209
right? Well, in, in my case, it's not, it's

806
00:57:29.219 --> 00:57:33.149
not, not exactly the true. So when I was

807
00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:36.560
a master student, I uh I felt that I

808
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:39.739
had much more work to do on a day,

809
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:43.820
day, day by day basis. But that, that's because

810
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.260
my task at the time was to master all

811
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:50.520
these, all these different uh concepts and fields, etcetera

812
00:57:51.669 --> 00:57:56.120
and as, as a phd student, you are your

813
00:57:56.129 --> 00:58:01.419
own boss. Uh So it's really up to you

814
00:58:01.429 --> 00:58:04.850
how much you, you work on a on a

815
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.760
on a given day. I think there are two

816
00:58:09.629 --> 00:58:12.770
key key things in, in uh managing the the

817
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:17.149
workload. One is to be to be consistent and

818
00:58:17.159 --> 00:58:20.149
do a bit every day. And of course, what

819
00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:22.929
is the bit that, that you do every day

820
00:58:22.939 --> 00:58:25.409
is up, up to you. So you have to

821
00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:30.159
spend some time on, um, on, on discovering what

822
00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:35.870
works for you. Um The other thing is that

823
00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:40.320
you have to be clear about uh your goals

824
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.080
so so that you can be intentional about how

825
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:48.350
you spend those 5688 hours per, per day on,

826
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.310
on your work. Because um it's a policy to

827
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.030
think that you have to read everything that's been

828
00:58:55.040 --> 00:59:01.830
ever written before before you can actively uh actively,

829
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.100
actively contribute. And I, I fall into this trap

830
00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:12.320
sometimes too and it's uh an idle reading. It's

831
00:59:12.969 --> 00:59:19.110
pleasant, but it's, it's not always the most useful

832
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.800
thing, thing to do, right? Um So I would

833
00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:29.429
say that um the phd journey is a lot

834
00:59:29.439 --> 00:59:33.860
is, is uh similar to art because it's a

835
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:38.889
creative uh uh process where nobody tells you what

836
00:59:38.899 --> 00:59:41.280
the end goal is supposed to be like. But

837
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:44.689
it's, it comes from you and from your, from

838
00:59:44.699 --> 00:59:49.209
your ideas and from your own uh influences. And

839
00:59:49.219 --> 00:59:54.989
um you will know when it's the most um

840
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.030
the most ready to be for the, for the

841
00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.419
uh public eye.

842
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:05.310
Mhm Great. Sore. Uh Let's send the interview here.

843
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.550
Would you like to tell people just before we

844
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.070
go where they can find you and your work

845
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.010
on the internet?

846
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:17.379
Uh Sure. So, um I recently became active on

847
01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:22.209
Blue Sky, which is the new uh social media

848
01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:25.570
app uh for academics and for other people too.

849
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.750
And because Twitter is not what it used to

850
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.939
be. Um So you can, you can find me

851
01:00:32.949 --> 01:00:36.280
on blue sky and also on the uh a

852
01:00:36.489 --> 01:00:40.120
web website which is Ac dot C eu.edu.

853
01:00:40.899 --> 01:00:45.600
Mhm. Great. So I'm leaving uh links to that

854
01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:48.189
in the description box of the interview. And thank

855
01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:50.120
you so much for taking the time to come

856
01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:51.969
on the show. It's been fun to talk to

857
01:00:51.979 --> 01:00:52.189
