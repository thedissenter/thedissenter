Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.730
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.369
today I'm joined by Doctors Melissa Shu and Kimberly

4

Garsher. Melissa is currently the associate director of Teaching

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.879
Excellence at Marquette University, where she is also the

6
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:24.940
faculty director of their executive MBA program. And Kimberly

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.959
is associate professor of philosophy at Kent State University,

8
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.580
and they are authors of Philosophy for Girls and

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.259
Invitation to the Life of Thought, and we're going

10
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:39.810
to talk about the book today. So, yeah, there

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.900
it is. Melissa and Kimberly, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.500
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:47.099
Thank you so much for having us.

14
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:48.919
Thank you so much for having us.

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.959
Great, so, OK, so philosophy for girls, what is

16
00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:56.619
the premise of the book?

17
00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.240
So the premise of the book is that when

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.760
the word philosopher springs to mind, you usually picture

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.000
someone in a toga or someone with some arm

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.800
patches and smoking a pipe or someone with a

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.400
beret, and that someone is usually a man. And

22
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
there is nothing about philosophy as a discipline that

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.800
makes it be for men. Yet, throughout the history

24
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.379
of philosophy, and our focus is going to be,

25
00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.440
uh, mainly on the history of Western philosophy, but

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400
throughout the history of Western philosophy, philosophers have tended

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.599
to be represented as men. And so the premise

28
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.699
of the book is, what if that's not true?

29
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.760
What if philosophers don't have to be men? What

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000
if there are a lot of philosophers in our

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.319
midst and throughout history who haven't been men? Yet

32
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.940
we have these going ideas that they are only

33
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.410
men. So the premise of the book is not

34
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.519
an anti-man book, but it's an intentional expanding of

35
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:57.019
what philosophy means and who it's for, to include

36
00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:59.500
more than men. By that, we mean women and

37
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.099
non-binary people as well. So, the book then has

38
00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.860
that premise, which is, if philosophy were to be

39
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.460
open to more than men, what might it look

40
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.009
like? Who might write it and who might it

41
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.929
be for. There's an additional premise as well, which

42
00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.169
is what if philosophy were to be written with

43
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.208
clarity and were to be written with accessibility and

44
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.679
um not lose any of its rigor. So the

45
00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.688
other premise is, how can we understand philosophy to,

46
00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.089
to be accessible to more than just professional philosophers

47
00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.768
as well. And so that's the, the start of

48
00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:36.048
the book. I'll just add a little story here,

49
00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:38.048
which is that just the other day, even when

50
00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:40.929
I was talking about this book with someone, They

51
00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.809
said, what do you mean? Of course women do

52
00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.910
philosophy. And I said, name a woman philosopher. And

53
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.139
there was just crickets. And this is from a

54
00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.050
younger person who's pretty well read and pretty hip,

55
00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.589
um, and couldn't do it. And so that shows

56
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.229
that this book is, for better or worse, and

57
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.449
I think for better, um, still needed today.

58
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.440
Right, you've already partially answered my next question when

59
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.839
you mentioned the audience or the target audience of

60
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:13.500
the book, but who is its target audience actually?

61
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.960
Because the, since the title is Philosophy for Girls,

62
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:21.000
is it primarily young women or can it be

63
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.520
people of any age and any gender?

64
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.169
Thank you for that question. So one of this

65
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.130
book's contributors is Gillian Russell, and I think she

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.259
really answered this question nicely. At one point when

67
00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.229
the book was coming out a few years ago.

68
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.889
She said, imagine that you cook a great meal,

69
00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.869
um, and I actually do love to cook, and

70
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.190
so does Kim, so this is an appropriate analogy

71
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.110
here for us. But imagine that you cook a

72
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.470
great meal, and someone special is coming, and you

73
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.639
know that they're really going to enjoy that meal,

74
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.750
but everyone else will enjoy it as well. That's

75
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.190
kind of like this book. So, this book has,

76
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.589
um, I guess it's special guests, younger women and

77
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.750
non-binary people in philosophy, but it is to be

78
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.699
enjoyed. As a great meal is for everyone. I'd

79
00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.740
add to that Kim and I think that some

80
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.779
of the most important readers of the book, and

81
00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:13.500
I use important with quotation marks here, but some

82
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.289
of the most important readers of the book are

83
00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.640
men, because men need to know what is going

84
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
on, um, with their younger non-male counterparts as well.

85
00:04:24.049 --> 00:04:26.459
Also, we think that the anecdotes that open each

86
00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.579
chapter are especially relevant to the lived experiences of

87
00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.149
young women, so that resonates too. So I guess

88
00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:36.429
the answer is the book is for everyone, but

89
00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:40.089
its special audience is um kind of younger versions

90
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.190
of the contributors themselves. And, and that's actually what

91
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.209
we prompted. Our authors to start with. Imagine an

92
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:52.589
18 to 22 year old version of yourself. What

93
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:54.540
book do you wish you would have found on

94
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.609
a bookshelf? And it's kind of that poetic image

95
00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:59.910
of just running your fingers down books as we've

96
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.750
all done in the bookshelf and just going through

97
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.910
this, that, whatever book and seeing a title on

98
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.670
a cover that strikes your fancy. And our hope

99
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.750
is that this book is especially for our younger

100
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.510
counterparts, um, both here and around the world.

101
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.369
But why a philosophy for girls then? Why do

102
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.369
we need it and what is a philosophy for

103
00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:24.390
girls exactly?

104
00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:30.019
So, girls have been 100% systemically excluded from the

105
00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:32.779
history of philosophy and thought. You can look at

106
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.500
marginalization, both in the Western world and around the

107
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.760
world for that. They haven't been at the table.

108
00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:41.660
If you look at, for example, even women's leadership,

109
00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.380
women are not promoted as much. They aren't in

110
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.260
leadership positions as much. And another area of my

111
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.059
research shows that women are overly punished for contributing.

112
00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:53.763
Ideas, even in a workplace. So, why do we

113
00:05:53.763 --> 00:05:56.363
need a philosophy for girls? We need a philosophy

114
00:05:56.363 --> 00:05:59.083
for girls because we need girls to feel empowered

115
00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:03.062
in their intellectual thoughts. And this book is explicitly

116
00:06:03.282 --> 00:06:05.842
for that. And so by working through some of

117
00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:09.583
the major themes in philosophy and making it relatable,

118
00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:12.963
but still rigorous, we aim to empower our younger

119
00:06:12.963 --> 00:06:16.662
counterparts. In the introduction, Kim uses a really nice,

120
00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:18.665
um, Line. So I'm sorry, Kim, if you were

121
00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:21.175
going to say this later, but she uses a

122
00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:23.305
really nice line, which is, if you see a

123
00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:26.705
girl reading at her table at her desk, leave

124
00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:29.585
her alone. She is in training, and I love

125
00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.265
that idea.

126
00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:35.385
QUOTATION though, and I don't recall the author, but

127
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:35.936
that is. Yeah,

128
00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:38.985
well, you, well, you use the line and

129
00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:41.526
I use the line, but I, it, I'm not

130
00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:45.026
the originator, and that's like, oh, go ahead,

131
00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:46.066
no, go ahead.

132
00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.230
I was just going to add one of the

133
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.779
early reviewers of the book, um, to build on

134
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.100
exactly what Melissa said in this, in response to

135
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.850
this question and the earlier question. Um, ALL reviewers

136
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.049
found that it was very empowering for young women,

137
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.170
young girls, um, non-binary people, basically not men, but

138
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.170
they encouraged men and young men to read it

139
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.399
because it made them more aware. Perhaps if they

140
00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.160
were less aware to begin with, they became more

141
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.140
aware of the philosophical work that young girls do

142
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.179
on a regular basis in living their lives, in

143
00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:33.320
moving about the world. They engage in philosophical thought,

144
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:37.059
they have philosophical questions, they wonder at the world.

145
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.109
And sometimes the life of that mind or the

146
00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.570
life of mind is a little hidden if it's

147
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.589
not displayed, um, Thoroughly in academia.

148
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.459
Right, and what are the goals of the book

149
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:56.640
then? There are a couple different goals of this

150
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.089
book, um, So, Kim and I are both parts

151
00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.890
of various online teaching communities. Well, they're teaching community

152
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.119
supported by social media online, like teaching philosophy and

153
00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.200
a bunch of different philosophy, nerdy groups and so

154
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.540
on. And I'd say that one of the goals

155
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.859
of this book we're seeing kind of come through

156
00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.899
there, which is this book is getting into classrooms.

157
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.739
This book is helping to shape curriculum at the

158
00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:23.059
1000 level, at the core required philosophy levels. This

159
00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:25.420
book is finding its way into high schools, which

160
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.260
is really appropriate for advanced high school students, and

161
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.119
this book is finding its way. Um, AS kind

162
00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:35.229
of a companion as well to what people are

163
00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.960
doing in their curriculum. So just the other day,

164
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.039
for example, someone was commenting on a forum that

165
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.960
they use a chapter that's about credibility, which is

166
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.359
a great chapter, um, that draws upon the myth

167
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:48.859
of Cassandra, who knew the truth of a situation.

168
00:08:48.914 --> 00:08:50.945
That was about to happen, and no one believed

169
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:52.955
her. And so they were using that chapter to

170
00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:55.234
pair on some work they were doing with epistemic

171
00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.594
injustice. So, on one hand, part of the goal

172
00:08:57.594 --> 00:09:02.554
is to, frankly, infiltrate philosophy curriculum and what it

173
00:09:02.554 --> 00:09:05.434
is that we understand philosophy to be um in

174
00:09:05.434 --> 00:09:09.034
a classroom and beyond. Another goal, though, of course,

175
00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:11.929
is to And going back to that idea of

176
00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:13.750
just kind of finding a book on the shelf

177
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.609
to be able to get this book into the

178
00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:17.640
hands of as many people who want and need

179
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.210
it as possible, and whether that's um in the

180
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.210
English speaking world or elsewhere. So, for example, this

181
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.489
book most recently has been translated into Persian slash

182
00:09:27.489 --> 00:09:30.789
Farsi, and before that, it was translated into Vietnamese.

183
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.942
Right now, it's being translated. Into Chinese and um

184
00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:39.672
also into Japanese. And this is wonderful for us

185
00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:43.773
because we hoped that philosophy for Girls would become

186
00:09:43.822 --> 00:09:46.122
a little bit of a murmur around the world

187
00:09:46.122 --> 00:09:49.033
so that people would be kind of encouraged to

188
00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:51.713
take up these kinds of projects. The translators have

189
00:09:51.713 --> 00:09:54.526
been amazing. Um, AND it's all these women. And

190
00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:56.135
then there's one guy too, who are doing this

191
00:09:56.135 --> 00:09:57.935
work of translation. And so we've been able to

192
00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:00.486
be in correspondence with them as well. But I'll

193
00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:03.096
say that as a goal of the book, the

194
00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:05.796
goal is not to say, this is what philosophy

195
00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:07.935
is, this is all it is, and that's that.

196
00:10:08.176 --> 00:10:11.116
It's really to open up those conversations and dialogues,

197
00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:14.046
um, cross culturally and across histories and with our

198
00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:17.409
own selves. So to that end, You know, those

199
00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.570
are really two of the goals, to help shape

200
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.500
how we understand kind of introductions to philosophy and

201
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.250
what philosophy entails, and then to make sure that

202
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.409
this gets into the hands of a whole bunch

203
00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:31.210
of people, so that they have the opportunity to

204
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.169
read it, and not just learn from it, right?

205
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.409
I mean, the conversations that Kim and Kim and

206
00:10:35.409 --> 00:10:37.979
I have Had with the translators, we are learning

207
00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:41.340
just as much from them, um, then I think

208
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.659
they're learning from this book. But the whole idea

209
00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:45.780
is that we should be doing more of stuff

210
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.179
like this to get it to younger people who,

211
00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:51.260
I mean, cliche as it is, really are the

212
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.940
future of our thought here and hopefully some better

213
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.750
world making.

214
00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:58.450
Mhm. No, you, uh, you know, I, one of

215
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.210
the reasons why I asked you to do an

216
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.210
interview with me about the book is, first of

217
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.809
all, I found the idea behind it very interesting

218
00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:10.890
and uh it's very important to talk about representation

219
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.289
in philosophy and I guess academia more broadly, but

220
00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.609
also because uh some of these things like what

221
00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:22.039
I'm about to ask you, uh, regarding the gender

222
00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:25.510
gap in philosophy. Uh, I have, I have also

223
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.469
to learn about them because for me it's not

224
00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:33.049
foreign or alien at all to think about philosophers

225
00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:36.710
as also women because I've had a ton of

226
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.049
them on the show. If people go to my

227
00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:43.580
philosophy playlist, I mean, probably still the majority is

228
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.950
men, but I have many, many women philosophers on

229
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.489
the show, so I'm not unfamiliar with the. Uh,

230
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.989
CONCEPT at all, but tell us then about the

231
00:11:54.989 --> 00:11:58.109
gender gap in philosophy and I mean, is it

232
00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:02.590
mostly in academia when you go to academia, do

233
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:08.020
you tend to find more, uh, male, uh, Students

234
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.650
and professors there than female ones or

235
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.869
not. Yes, so the gender gap exists in philosophy,

236
00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:20.789
at least academic philosophy, and we're academics, so that's

237
00:12:20.789 --> 00:12:23.179
the field we're most familiar with. But the gender

238
00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:27.570
gap actually exists both in representation in student body

239
00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:31.119
as well as representation at the faculty level. So,

240
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.890
what we find typically is that you have a

241
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.530
fairly evenly distributed um enrollment in, in the introductory

242
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:47.609
classes across genders. Um, And somehow, the movement from

243
00:12:47.609 --> 00:12:52.729
the introductory level classes to upper-level classes starts to

244
00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:56.309
become heavily gendered. So, you see, by the time,

245
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.770
um, students are graduating, you already see many more

246
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.809
male students, um, graduating with that degree than female

247
00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:09.169
students. And then if you look at the faculty,

248
00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:13.539
Some people might say, well, then that explains the

249
00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:18.679
faculty gender difference, but that's not quite true, um,

250
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.739
because it, it is the case that there are

251
00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:26.739
more men than women in academic philosophy, but the

252
00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:31.090
The skew of by, or the, the difference by

253
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.849
gender is, is quite dramatic and one might think

254
00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:39.289
that, well, um, if we were going to simply

255
00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:42.330
say that there were more boys interested in philosophy,

256
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.729
therefore, there are more male philosopher professors, that should

257
00:13:46.729 --> 00:13:49.130
hold true for other fields too that have been

258
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.090
heavily dominated by men, such as, say, physics or

259
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.760
engineering. Um, SOME of the latest data, and we

260
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.809
don't have a lot of very recent data, but

261
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.890
some of the most recent data that we have,

262
00:14:03.289 --> 00:14:07.289
um, on representation of women at the faculty level,

263
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.869
uh, there are fewer female philosophy professors by percentage

264
00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:19.340
than there are female physics professors. And it's about,

265
00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:23.130
uh, at that time, it was probably 18%. I

266
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.880
would guess that it's up to about 2021 now.

267
00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:31.359
But that is, uh, fairly dramatic. And um we

268
00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:38.559
are uh regularly surprised at how very few women

269
00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:42.200
not only go into professional philosophy, but then also

270
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.919
how rarely they get promoted and tenured compared to

271
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:52.169
their male counterparts. And when there's several flawed arguments

272
00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:55.469
as to why that is, um, but we see

273
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.880
all sorts of drop off along, along the way,

274
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.159
such that by the time you're looking at, um,

275
00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:07.570
senior faculty members, The difference is quite, quite distinct,

276
00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:08.299
in fact.

277
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:14.289
Mhm. Right, so before we get into the causes

278
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.179
behind that gender gap which you also talk about

279
00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:19.859
in the book, uh, in the book you focus

280
00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:23.940
on gender and not sex. What is the difference

281
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.200
between sex and gender and why does that matter?

282
00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:31.059
Sure. Um, SO I can talk about that again

283
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:35.219
for coming from an academic perspective and I'm going

284
00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:39.020
to say things that most academics across sciences and

285
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.200
across humanities agree upon, um, but clearly it is,

286
00:15:43.219 --> 00:15:47.219
uh, still a very, um, contentious subject, especially in

287
00:15:47.219 --> 00:15:50.760
our country. Um, WE tend to think of sex

288
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:57.479
as the biological conditions of reproductive organs, OK? So

289
00:15:57.479 --> 00:16:02.280
we're talking about gametes or testes, ovaries, these sorts

290
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.640
of things. So, when we talk about sex, we're

291
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.919
talking, talking usually about male or female and what

292
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:14.479
is one's reproductive capacity. And that doesn't mean that

293
00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:17.320
one has to be able to reproduce to be

294
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.880
sex, and we understand that there's a huge phenomenon

295
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.940
of intersex people and there's a huge phenomenon of

296
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.539
um Uh, variable genetic conditions. So we're not talking

297
00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:33.580
about just say, the physical existence of the testes,

298
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:36.900
which would be the phenotype or the genotype of

299
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.500
XY versus XX, but any combination of those biological

300
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.099
factors that are represented, um, such in the person's

301
00:16:47.099 --> 00:16:53.390
body, sort of from, from birth. That's sex. Gender

302
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.070
can be related to sex, but it's not the

303
00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.270
same thing. So gender is an expression of self,

304
00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:06.030
typically influenced by cultural norm, as well as possibly

305
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.150
sex. Um, SO I tend to think of these

306
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:14.790
two things as connected, um, but sliding scales, right?

307
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.160
Such that sometimes, often, they tend to line up,

308
00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:26.000
such that People who tend to have, um. XX

309
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.920
chromosomes and ovaries tend to identify as women or

310
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.829
girls. Not always. We have queer peoples, we have

311
00:17:34.829 --> 00:17:37.959
trans peoples, we have non-binary peoples. So, we can

312
00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:41.260
get that slippage here, and we're not exactly sure

313
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.800
exactly where the connection is, whether it's hormonal, whether

314
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.839
it is in fact, um, gestational. We have all

315
00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:51.900
sorts of different information, but they can, they can

316
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.560
affect each other. Certainly, I'm not claiming that they're

317
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.619
entirely Unrelated. But they are not, they are not

318
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:01.780
related in a 1 to 1 relationship the way

319
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.180
that many of our schemas assume. And then you

320
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.780
could add a third kind of slider on top

321
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.689
of that, which would be sexuality, which is the

322
00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:17.319
expression. Of sexual desire. And that, again, can be

323
00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:21.709
influenced by gender and sex, but it's not necessarily

324
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:26.199
determined by it. So, these three topics are connected,

325
00:18:26.569 --> 00:18:30.270
but we don't have the information. We need to

326
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.020
make sure, to make claims that are certain about

327
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.209
precisely how they are connected. All we know now

328
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.050
is that they can be connected and they tend

329
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:46.510
to move across spectrums that are mostly I won't

330
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.209
say mostly, but sometimes correlated. And we can predict

331
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.520
some of those correlations, but not always.

332
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.130
Um, AND why does the underrepresentation of women in

333
00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:04.739
philosophy historically and contemporarily matter? Because, you know, someone

334
00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:08.260
could just say or could just reply to what

335
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:13.390
you've said there earlier. Regarding the, the percentage of

336
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.510
women in academic philosophy, oh yeah, but whatever, they're

337
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.910
making their choices, probably there are more men than

338
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.270
women who like philosophy. I mean, what would you

339
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.270
reply to that?

340
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.319
Shall I take the first stab at that, Melissa,

341
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.989
or would you like

342
00:19:29.989 --> 00:19:32.920
to? Yeah, OK, I know where you're going. Yeah,

343
00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:40.349
I hope so. Um, SO number one, because we

344
00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:44.670
live in a gendered society, a patriarchal society for

345
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.770
the most part, the experiences of women are different

346
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.339
than the experiences of men. And, um, those experiences

347
00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:58.650
deserve to be examined philosophically, voiced philosophically, and incorporated

348
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.089
into the larger conversations we have about society. That's,

349
00:20:03.099 --> 00:20:07.959
in my mind, the most important reason for voicing

350
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.650
the philosophical work of women. And that's connected to

351
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.140
another, uh, question that you'll ask, I think, down

352
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.250
the line, but I'll let Melissa jump in here

353
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.670
as well. OK.

354
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:21.550
Yeah,

355
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.290
so.

356
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.630
I think there's a very real way in which

357
00:20:26.329 --> 00:20:31.000
things matter to the degree. We invest them with

358
00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.050
importance. And I have Simone de Bevoir in my

359
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.180
mind, and she says, there's no kind of value

360
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.339
or good that exists by itself out there in

361
00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:45.859
the ether, but rather, things are important and meaningful

362
00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:49.780
insofar as we invest them with intelligence, sensitivity, and

363
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.469
vitality. And so, I think that it matters because,

364
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.939
so that is gender representation in in philosophy matters,

365
00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:00.880
because we still believe that philosophy is a discipline

366
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.479
worth pursuing and doing, and that that should be

367
00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:06.020
open to all. I'm gonna tell a quick story.

368
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.189
So I started teaching at Marquette University when I

369
00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:12.109
was 29 years old, and my own background is

370
00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:14.869
in ancient Greek philosophy. I mean, Socrates is the

371
00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:16.949
goat, we can all agree on this. I'm writing

372
00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:19.790
a chapter as I did on questions without invoking

373
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.060
Socrates, um, it was actually easier than I thought,

374
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.949
but I mean, I'm obsessed with the guy, right?

375
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.910
And a lot of people in this book who

376
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.280
contributed to this book have, um, their own favorite

377
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.869
obsessions, whether they're men or women philosophers and so

378
00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:35.760
on. But anyhow, so I got my PhD in

379
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.219
in philosophy from the University of Oregon, where Kim

380
00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:41.839
and I met as grad students and became um

381
00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:44.979
philoso sisters and kind of best friends. And so

382
00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:48.880
I'm teaching at Marquette, and I'm 29 years old,

383
00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:52.130
and I'm just teaching Greek philosophy and all the

384
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.680
things I know to teach. And I just kind

385
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.160
of assumed that by virtue of me teaching them

386
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.680
as a younger woman in philosophy, that there would

387
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.199
therefore be great conversation, and that therefore would be

388
00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:05.770
some kind of equity or parity. And that was

389
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.989
not the case, in fact. And so what happened

390
00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:13.770
was, and this was back in 2008, 2009-ish, what

391
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.650
happened was, these women in my classes would write

392
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.250
their butts off in their essays, but they wouldn't

393
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.810
really speak in class without saying something like, I

394
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.449
don't know, but, or it's only my opinion, or

395
00:22:24.449 --> 00:22:26.810
I'm really unsure, I don't know. But then they

396
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.969
would write circles around a lot of people in

397
00:22:28.969 --> 00:22:30.650
the class. And so I, I started reading their

398
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.339
essays. And I started calling them into my office,

399
00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:37.510
and I'm like, why? I mean, I'm teaching this

400
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.739
class. I'm a young woman in this discipline, like,

401
00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.550
why aren't you talking? And everything started to come

402
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.510
out in those 1 to 1 conversations. Um, AND

403
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.000
it's a lot of what Kim was saying about

404
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.910
those gendered expectations and who gets to have a

405
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.150
right to have a voice. Um, AND I have

406
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.109
a little bit more to say on that in

407
00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:57.510
a second, but, But what started to come out

408
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.989
was that these women in my classes, and this

409
00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:03.390
is not unique to Marquette University, this is around

410
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.750
the country, these women didn't know that they could

411
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.709
speak with confidence their ideas without being punished or

412
00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:13.260
humiliated in class or a fear of retaliation. By

413
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.599
the way, that is still a major problem in

414
00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:20.520
companies and corporations and organizations and such today, that

415
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.920
when women put an idea out there, if it

416
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.800
gets shut down, then they are um overly punished

417
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.959
for it, or they're retaliated against for it, and

418
00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:31.079
that's a big problem. But so these women started

419
00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:34.420
to kind of share their ideas in my office.

420
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.400
And I thought to myself, you know, it's not

421
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.079
enough to have a woman in front of the

422
00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:41.000
classroom. And sometimes it's not enough to even have

423
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.280
a representation in your materials, but we need to

424
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.959
be doing philosophy in a kind of way that

425
00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:51.099
encourages and doesn't just shut down discussion and debate.

426
00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:54.000
And so, another aspect of this book, Philosophy for

427
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.040
Girls, is that it's intentionally dialogical. All the chapters

428
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.319
are kind of in conversation with each other, because

429
00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:02.400
it's a, it's a different way of trying to

430
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.239
do philosophy. Now, that is not a more woman

431
00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:09.479
or female way. OF doing philosophy. This is actually

432
00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:11.880
how Kim and I think philosophy is best done

433
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.160
through collaboration and discussion and dialogue rather than just

434
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.760
smashing people down in debate. That's entertainment, but it

435
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.680
doesn't necessarily get us any closer to those ideas

436
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.719
of vitality and sensitivity, um, and importance.

437
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.250
Mhm. But, but historically speaking, is it that there

438
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.250
have been very few women philosophers, or is it

439
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.810
rather that they tend to be omitted? I mean,

440
00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:47.170
is it that we know about Socrates. Is Plato,

441
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:53.930
Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Descartes, Hume, Kent, and Nietzsche, because

442
00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:56.609
we tend to talk about them and not so

443
00:24:56.609 --> 00:25:00.319
much about Hypatia and Simone de Beauvoir, or, or

444
00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:04.630
is it that they're just fewer women than men?

445
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.270
I will take this one first if that's OK.

446
00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.989
So, and then I'll kick it to Kim. So.

447
00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:14.189
Um, IT'S a both and, exactly. And it's a

448
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:18.060
both and because fewer women have been allowed to

449
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.219
be in a position where they can think about

450
00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:23.739
ideas and not just about other concerns and cares

451
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:27.219
of the house. And it's also been, um, I

452
00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:29.380
mean, the history of philosophy is a history of

453
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.099
erasure in a certain way, and erasing those voices

454
00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:36.260
of women. Now, there have been a wonderful number

455
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.959
of recovery projects in philosophy right now, and Ricardo,

456
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.040
I think you know these as well, to go

457
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.560
back and see who's writing with Descartes, where are

458
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.439
the women, where are the non-white philosophers, and to

459
00:25:47.439 --> 00:25:49.719
see if we could do some kind of historical

460
00:25:49.719 --> 00:25:53.839
recovery of them. And those people doing that work

461
00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:56.109
are doing the work of the gods and goddesses,

462
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.959
as far as I'm concerned, to make sure that

463
00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:02.915
they are not permanently erased. From that history. But

464
00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:05.275
I would say that it's certainly a both and

465
00:26:05.275 --> 00:26:07.114
women haven't tended to be privileged to be in

466
00:26:07.114 --> 00:26:09.494
positions of being at the table with their ideas.

467
00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:12.354
And so there's been that omission, whether it's intentional

468
00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:15.935
or um just by neglect. And then there are

469
00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:19.314
historically kind of fewer. So, Kim, go ahead.

470
00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:22.954
Yeah, I would agree completely. It's both and um

471
00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:25.834
I will also add that, uh, sometimes what we

472
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:28.314
find is that women who were doing philosophy at

473
00:26:28.314 --> 00:26:32.790
the time. Um, WERE so denigrated, uh, by their

474
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.900
colleagues at the time that their work was overlooked.

475
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.709
Going back to Melissa's point, which is that there

476
00:26:38.709 --> 00:26:41.510
are a number of recovery projects, um, at work

477
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:46.089
here. So, for example, in American philosophy, um, there

478
00:26:46.089 --> 00:26:50.819
have been several amazing, powerful women philosophers who were

479
00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:57.560
dismissed as social critics or, um, uh, Not even

480
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.359
sociologists, but just, you know, they were working on

481
00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:03.800
women's issues. They were never given the title of

482
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.560
philosopher and therefore, they weren't read by others who

483
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.319
are studying philosophy and therefore weren't taught. That's changing

484
00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:11.599
now.

485
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.489
OK, so what do you think are the causes

486
00:27:17.489 --> 00:27:21.569
of the gender gap in academic philosophy then?

487
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.650
Um, THERE are, I think, multiple causes, and, uh,

488
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.859
the phrase that one of our, um, one of

489
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:34.599
our sources uses is that it's a perfect storm

490
00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:38.650
of multiple causes. So, and we've already talked about

491
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.569
uh some of these causes, so I won't, uh,

492
00:27:41.579 --> 00:27:46.449
belabor them. But the first is, um, Implicit bias,

493
00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:51.290
which is, uh, the idea that certain genders are

494
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.859
expected to behave in certain ways. And what happens

495
00:27:55.859 --> 00:28:01.180
is when we move. In our heads, which always

496
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.579
happens, from just saying, oh, genders are, certain genders

497
00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:09.229
are associated with certain behaviors to certain genders must

498
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:14.300
do these behaviors, um, it becomes incredibly limiting in

499
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.939
terms of what can be accomplished by those people

500
00:28:16.939 --> 00:28:21.260
because when we see, uh, women, we expect only

501
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.800
certain behaviors and those are dictated by general. Gender

502
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.170
schemas or norms. Um, WE can also talk about,

503
00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:36.069
uh, stereotype, um, worries about stereotypes, and this again

504
00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:40.250
goes to something Melissa has already mentioned, which is

505
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.410
that, um, what we often see are young women,

506
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:49.829
girls, women, even at the professional level. WHO are

507
00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:54.989
afraid to voice their philosophical ideas because they are

508
00:28:54.989 --> 00:28:58.109
afraid of repercussion, because they are afraid that they

509
00:28:58.109 --> 00:29:01.689
will be dismissed because it has happened so much

510
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.219
in the past. Um, SO we see these things,

511
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.880
we see a lack of representation, uh, we see

512
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.150
lacks, you know, young girls do not see as

513
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.219
many women professors as they see men. We see

514
00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:20.099
other, uh, issues that exist across a number of

515
00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:25.359
disciplines, including the fact that, um, when you research,

516
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:32.660
um, perceived dominance of, say, classroom conversation time, Um,

517
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.160
typically, you find that boys or men, um, they

518
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.800
speak most of the time, um, a lot of

519
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.160
the time. And the time that women or girls

520
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.760
actually speak is so far overestimated by men that

521
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.319
it, it's actually a little bit absurd. So, I

522
00:29:55.319 --> 00:29:57.400
don't have the numbers directly in front of me,

523
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.650
but let's say, uh, I think Melissa, you might

524
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.969
know this off the top of your head more

525
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:06.510
than I at the moment, but I think roughly

526
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.119
it's about 75% of conversation is usually dominated by

527
00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:12.849
men and boys. But when you ask men and

528
00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:16.410
boys how much girls talk, they will tell you

529
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.510
more than 50%, right? So they assume that women

530
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.670
are speaking far more than they actually are. So

531
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.930
we see all, and that's not just in philosophy,

532
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.849
that's in the STEEM, that's in. Um, YOU know,

533
00:30:31.339 --> 00:30:35.260
public health, that's across the board. So, I think

534
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.390
we see a lot of converging reasons. Go ahead,

535
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.589
Melissa. If I

536
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:41.770
can just pipe in, so I have a, um,

537
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.689
a research interest in intellectual joy for women's leadership,

538
00:30:45.739 --> 00:30:49.339
and so I have A good amount of research

539
00:30:49.339 --> 00:30:52.420
about what happens kind of post-graduation and what this

540
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.540
looks like for women at work. And so, Kim,

541
00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:57.420
just to amplify a point you were making, study

542
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.949
after study shows that non-white women in particular, do

543
00:31:02.949 --> 00:31:07.920
not even have what they say in meetings attributed

544
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.939
accurately to them. That's right. And so, so what

545
00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:15.900
happens is, right, not only are women kind of

546
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.900
misrepresented more, and they speak less, but they're thought

547
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.140
to be, you know, a squeaky wheel or grinding

548
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.739
the gears, but what they say is literally Really

549
00:31:24.739 --> 00:31:28.979
not attributed to them correctly, especially for non-white women.

550
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.900
So that becomes deeply problematic in all aspects of

551
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.979
our lives in which we're trying to exist and

552
00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:38.380
flourish, as Kim was saying. Um, SO, I just

553
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.689
wanted to kind of amp that up, and I'd

554
00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:42.699
say that women too, in terms of leadership, whether

555
00:31:42.699 --> 00:31:45.140
it's in a boardroom and so on, um, are

556
00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.569
retaliating. AGAINST for their ideas a lot more than

557
00:31:48.569 --> 00:31:51.219
men. And so, for example, just a few quick

558
00:31:51.219 --> 00:31:53.979
data points. And so Kim is also a bioethicist

559
00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:56.180
and works with medical doctors, and here's a relevant

560
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.500
example that connects with her world. When a male

561
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.219
surgeon loses a patient, there's no decline in referrals,

562
00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:06.380
but when a woman surgeon does, referrals decline by

563
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.790
33%. Women CEOs are 40% more likely to be

564
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.040
fired than their male counterparts, and so on. And

565
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.920
so what you have here, and again, to bring

566
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.109
this back to the realm of ideas, what you

567
00:32:18.109 --> 00:32:20.800
have here is people leading with their ideas and

568
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.640
what they think is right and so on, being

569
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.280
overly punished if they're women and especially if they're

570
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.560
non-white women, to the point of not even having

571
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.510
what they're saying attributed to them correctly. OK, Kim,

572
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.099
back to you.

573
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.479
Yes, yes, indeed.

574
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.579
OK, so would you say that this is then

575
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.280
a matter of cognitive bias,

576
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.439
cognitive bias on behalf of, or who's, who's cognitive

577
00:32:47.439 --> 00:32:50.140
bias, um, and I guess, could you say a

578
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.739
little bit more about what you have in mind

579
00:32:51.739 --> 00:32:53.250
by cognitive bias?

580
00:32:54.709 --> 00:32:59.280
Yeah, when, for example, you mentioned that even when

581
00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.199
women intervene, and men tend to remember more other

582
00:33:05.199 --> 00:33:08.239
male interventions and female interventions. I mean, is that

583
00:33:08.239 --> 00:33:11.300
a matter of cognitive bias of a certain kind

584
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:11.390
or not?

585
00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:16.380
It, go ahead, Melissa. That's

586
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.939
OK. So, I would say yes, and I have

587
00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:23.900
a philosopher named Miranda Fricker on my mind right

588
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.300
now, in terms of what she calls credibility excess

589
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:32.140
and credibility deficit. So, what that idea means is

590
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.089
that if a And I have so many examples

591
00:33:36.089 --> 00:33:37.530
from my own life, and so does Kim as

592
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.369
well. But credibility excess happens when someone is automatically

593
00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:47.449
granted, potentially even more credibility, so more belief than

594
00:33:47.449 --> 00:33:51.369
is necessarily warranted by virtue of their identity markers,

595
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.599
right? Um, AND by the way, it's not just

596
00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:55.810
about being a woman in a man's space or

597
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.170
something like that. It's kind of relative to any

598
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:02.839
situation. Incredibility deficit happens when someone is not granted

599
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:07.010
credibility based on certain kinds of identity markers. And

600
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.770
so I think that that is a cognitive bias,

601
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.649
and I think it's one that women experience. So

602
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:14.850
just a, a quick example for me, I teach

603
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.570
a lot of core required philosophy 101 classes, and

604
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.290
I know that on day one, and I'm, you

605
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.228
know, a woman in my late forties right now,

606
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.290
I'm not the 29 year old when I started

607
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.485
teaching. Well, I started teaching earlier than that, but

608
00:34:28.485 --> 00:34:30.885
that's neither here nor there. But I know that

609
00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:33.725
still, on that first day of class, at some

610
00:34:33.725 --> 00:34:36.445
point, I'm going to be talking about philosophy and

611
00:34:36.445 --> 00:34:38.445
trying to get people hyped up and jazzed and

612
00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:40.364
to believe in it. And then I'll walk over

613
00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:42.333
to the board and I'll write something in Greek.

614
00:34:42.764 --> 00:34:45.645
I'll write usually Gnohi Seatan, which means know yourself.

615
00:34:45.725 --> 00:34:48.225
I'll write something in Greek, and then turn around

616
00:34:48.225 --> 00:34:51.524
and I will see students kind of calibrate, oh

617
00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:55.319
my gosh, she knows things. Now you would think

618
00:34:55.319 --> 00:34:58.479
that having a PhD and teaching for 20 some

619
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:00.559
odd years and researching and so on and so

620
00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:04.590
forth would automatically grant you that. But in some

621
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.909
cases, it doesn't, whereas I have a great dear

622
00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:10.830
colleague who is an older British guy with a,

623
00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:14.060
a nice Downey or Downton Abbey accent, and he

624
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.989
walks into a room and of course, he knows

625
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:18.179
what he's talking about, and I say this with

626
00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:20.669
great affection, he's wonderful, but that is a kind

627
00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:23.419
of cognitive bias. And so what we see then,

628
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.149
again, study after study are these repercussions. I wanna,

629
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:28.070
I wanna share one more example, please, if you

630
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.129
don't mind. Which is, I have an interest as

631
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.209
well in what's happening in the art world, and

632
00:35:34.209 --> 00:35:37.729
there's a study that was done by amazing feminist

633
00:35:37.729 --> 00:35:42.570
archivists and museum curators to show that um there

634
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:46.479
is an incredible bias against women artists, which we

635
00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:50.030
might kind of intuitively know, but it's shocking how

636
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.260
much cognitive bias there is against women's artists. So,

637
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.659
for example, 1.6 million pieces of artwork were examined

638
00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:01.820
at auction, and what happened was all the names

639
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.060
were removed from the works of art, and then

640
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.600
the works of art were valued at whatever amount.

641
00:36:06.899 --> 00:36:09.780
And then when the names are attached, if the

642
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.580
artist were a woman, the value of that work

643
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:17.800
of art plummeted by 47.6%. So, nearly by 50%,

644
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.370
and I think that art is a representation of

645
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.290
someone's ideas. And so the second, and this is

646
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.689
to your question on cognitive bias, the second a

647
00:36:25.689 --> 00:36:28.729
woman's name is attached, the value plummets by 50%.

648
00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:31.610
And so, in all realms of life, whether it's

649
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:36.850
leadership, philosophy, art, education, we still see this bias

650
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.729
very alive, um, unfortunately. And this book, of course,

651
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.370
is helping, trying to help counter that to some

652
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:42.709
degree.

653
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.040
Mhm. And I would add, I, I agree with

654
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.159
everything you've just said. I just, um, was, because

655
00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:51.510
I have all of these same ideas in mind,

656
00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:55.360
I was a little hesitant to restrict the label

657
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.320
of bias to simply a cognitive one, but I

658
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.959
absolutely agree that, um, it is an issue of

659
00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:04.719
bias on, I would say a number of levels,

660
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.219
yeah.

661
00:37:05.969 --> 00:37:09.979
Mhm. But do you know if the way philosophy

662
00:37:09.979 --> 00:37:13.699
is done is gendered in any way? I mean,

663
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:19.449
is there anything distinctly male about philosophical methodology? And

664
00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:23.020
of course, I, I know that uh depending on

665
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.435
the way some people might interpret this question. It

666
00:37:27.435 --> 00:37:33.274
could allude to, uh, sex differences in cognitive ability

667
00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:36.235
or something like that, but I mean, it's not

668
00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:38.995
necessarily that it could just be, for example, a

669
00:37:38.995 --> 00:37:43.114
matter of socialization and um men and boys and

670
00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:48.304
girls being socialized to prefer different kinds of um

671
00:37:48.314 --> 00:37:52.955
intellectual or cognitive methodology, something like that, but is

672
00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:56.435
there something like that playing out here or not?

673
00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:59.120
I think, uh, thanks for that question and thank

674
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.620
you for the nuance because I would say that

675
00:38:02.629 --> 00:38:07.600
there's no, um, inherent intellectual difference between the sexes

676
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.300
or genders. Um. What I will admit is that

677
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:17.800
there are very different social expectations, gender schemas, um,

678
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:22.699
custom, ritual, all of these things that contribute to

679
00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:24.899
the way that we exist in the world as

680
00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:29.179
human beings. And because philosophy is done in certain

681
00:38:29.179 --> 00:38:33.219
settings, which are largely in the United States at

682
00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:42.540
least, um, white, uh, male-dominated, um, Ciss dominated, uh,

683
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.129
dominated by straight people, these sorts of things, those,

684
00:38:47.949 --> 00:38:51.550
those, those expectations and ways of being in the

685
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.469
world do come out in the work that people

686
00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:59.530
do, but there's nothing inherent in those differences. So,

687
00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.590
what I would say is, can we recognize difference

688
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.909
right now? Yes. Is there anything to say that,

689
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.750
that, that, that difference is necessary? Absolutely not. And

690
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.429
so part of this book in my mind is

691
00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:16.540
trying to call attention to. The current ways that

692
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.659
we think um about philosophy differently, but also the

693
00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:28.080
way that there's a universality of philosophical wonder across,

694
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.139
um, any number of spectrums. So, yes, I think

695
00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:35.179
that because philosophy is currently done in a patriarchal

696
00:39:35.179 --> 00:39:38.120
system and a racist system and all of these

697
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.899
other systems, we can point to differences in the

698
00:39:41.899 --> 00:39:45.760
way that people do philosophy. Um, THAT doesn't mean

699
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.840
there's anything inherently different. So for example, again, Gillian

700
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.639
Russell, who, um, is a fabulous contributor that Melissa

701
00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:59.000
mentioned earlier, her chapter is on logic, and, um,

702
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.879
one would say, well, logic is simply logic. There

703
00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:05.320
is no logic for girls, and yet she is

704
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.989
the one who said, look, Think of making a

705
00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:13.610
beautiful meal for guests, but you have a particular

706
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.870
guest in mind when you make that meal. The

707
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.830
meal is gorgeous for all guests. Logic is logic

708
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.870
for all guests, but it could be that the

709
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.889
way that it's presented is special for one person,

710
00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:27.709
or it could be that the way that it's

711
00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:31.429
made relevant is special for a different person. And

712
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.510
that I think is where we see a lot

713
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.610
of the difference. So some of the questions raised,

714
00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:41.330
The experiences that we point to, what counts as

715
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:48.389
evidence or epistemic, um, uh, Uh, authority. These sorts

716
00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:56.489
of things are definitely affected by, um, the different

717
00:40:56.489 --> 00:41:00.010
biases that we see at play in society. There's

718
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.229
nothing inherent about those biases.

719
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.790
And I'm thinking about, so, I have a little

720
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.189
smile on my face because I'm thinking about how

721
00:41:09.189 --> 00:41:12.929
the history of Western philosophy is really the history

722
00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:18.389
of people being brilliant geniuses suddenly, whether it's Descartes,

723
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.590
right, kind of sitting in his room in his

724
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.310
nightgown by a warm fire. Thinking about his life,

725
00:41:23.729 --> 00:41:26.959
whether it's Thoreau, whose mom brought him food out

726
00:41:26.959 --> 00:41:29.689
at Walden, he has this time to himself. We

727
00:41:29.689 --> 00:41:33.449
have this idea that philosophy takes an isolated genius

728
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:37.530
mind to unfurl into the heavens, some brilliance of

729
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.419
thoughts. And I think that that is false. And

730
00:41:41.419 --> 00:41:44.699
I also think that um how we've happened to

731
00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:47.209
understand philosophy according to the status quo, and Kim,

732
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.020
I think you just beautifully said so much of

733
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.020
that. According to the status quo, that doesn't have

734
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.300
to be the future of philosophy, nor does it

735
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.070
have to be the nature of philosophy. So, I

736
00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.550
think about, um, for example, in the sciences, how

737
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.830
you have multiple contributors on a paper, philosophy still

738
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.870
has the dominance of one author, right? One author

739
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.989
usually combating or countering someone else's minor position and

740
00:42:11.989 --> 00:42:14.149
so on. And if you read a lot of

741
00:42:14.149 --> 00:42:16.889
academic philosophy, and I say this with some affection

742
00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:21.459
to even myself and my friends, it's painfully boring,

743
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.610
really tedious, and, um, often very poorly written. And

744
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.510
so, I think that the future of philosophy, as

745
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.370
anticipated by this book, a lot of other great

746
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.429
work in philosophy as well, is collaborative, it's dialogical,

747
00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:39.929
and it doesn't have to be as painful, both

748
00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:42.729
academically and otherwise, as it has been in the

749
00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:45.389
past. And I'd wait, I'd make one bigger claim,

750
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.850
um, related to academia as well, which is, I

751
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.843
think that if philosophy as a discipline doesn't kind

752
00:42:50.843 --> 00:42:52.762
of wake up to that. I think it's going

753
00:42:52.762 --> 00:42:55.302
to be squished out of more and more universities.

754
00:42:55.562 --> 00:42:57.722
And I think that that is a shame. I

755
00:42:57.722 --> 00:42:59.883
think that what's happening to the humanities and social

756
00:42:59.883 --> 00:43:03.562
sciences kind of broad scale, um, is nothing short

757
00:43:03.562 --> 00:43:06.163
of a modern tragedy. But I think that if

758
00:43:06.163 --> 00:43:08.482
we were to lean into some of the strengths

759
00:43:08.482 --> 00:43:11.416
of philosophy and discussion and dialogue, And this goes

760
00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:13.385
all the way back to ancient Greece, really. And

761
00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:16.835
if we were to kind of remember, um, those

762
00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:18.785
sorts of things, we could in fact build a

763
00:43:18.785 --> 00:43:21.956
better world in philosophy. And again, I think there

764
00:43:21.956 --> 00:43:23.756
are some great people doing that work, and I

765
00:43:23.756 --> 00:43:26.025
think there are some amazing scholars, and you've interviewed

766
00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:29.075
many of them, who are writing rigorous philosophy in

767
00:43:29.075 --> 00:43:31.446
a more public facing way, and I think that

768
00:43:31.456 --> 00:43:33.216
that's good for everyone as well.

769
00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:37.550
I mean, in, in regards to the bit about

770
00:43:37.639 --> 00:43:42.590
uh individual, about the myth of it, it being

771
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:46.989
individuals in is in isolation producing philosophy. I mean,

772
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.060
I guess it applies to any kind of intellectual

773
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.959
endeavor. It, it's Not really individuals, it's collectives of

774
00:43:54.959 --> 00:43:58.149
people. And, I mean, at the very, very least,

775
00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.560
you always are influenced by the work of other

776
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:07.159
people and sometimes even shamelessly steal ideas from other

777
00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:12.239
people, right? Or not so shamelessly. Sometimes we share

778
00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:13.580
an attribute, right?

779
00:44:14.449 --> 00:44:16.919
Yeah, I, I, I mean, I mean, but sometimes

780
00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:18.050
that also happens, right? Yeah,

781
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.229
yeah, absolutely.

782
00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:23.699
Totally, and I think again, um, in the world

783
00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:28.060
of generative AI and a whole bunch of other

784
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.219
things, I, I think getting back to the basics

785
00:44:30.219 --> 00:44:33.330
of what does something mean? Why is it important?

786
00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.219
How can I know it? How can we commit

787
00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:39.020
to certain ideas, whether it's ethics or metaphysics with

788
00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.229
each other? I think that Just that movement is

789
00:44:42.229 --> 00:44:44.219
going to become more and more important as we're

790
00:44:44.219 --> 00:44:47.699
facing any number of different challenges, and especially in

791
00:44:47.699 --> 00:44:49.790
education, because as you both were talking, I was

792
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:53.750
thinking about how at a bare minimum, dialogue should

793
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.989
be happening in our classrooms, and that too is

794
00:44:55.989 --> 00:44:57.209
a kind of community.

795
00:44:57.969 --> 00:45:02.389
Mhm. Right. Exactly. So how did you select the

796
00:45:02.389 --> 00:45:05.909
topics and questions you explore in your book? Because

797
00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:11.590
I mean philosophy is a hugely vast field. I

798
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.389
mean, you could have picked thousands of different topics,

799
00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:20.709
so you went through things like identity, justice, wonder,

800
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:27.550
virtue, reality, deliberation. Why these topics and questions specifically?

801
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.250
So, this was really fun to work out together

802
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.810
in terms of the general breakdown and vision of

803
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.649
the book, because you're right, it could go any

804
00:45:37.649 --> 00:45:39.679
number of ways, and at a certain point, we

805
00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:42.050
just needed to choose. But what we did was

806
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.520
we book, we broke the book down into 4

807
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.810
sections that map onto kind of known areas of

808
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:53.090
philosophy, whether that's ethics or social and political, um,

809
00:45:53.169 --> 00:45:56.310
metaphysics, and so on. And then what we decided

810
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.520
to do, because we wanted, we wanted the book

811
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.050
to relate to academic philosophy and to be usable

812
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.949
in different classrooms and such and have some identifiable

813
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.770
categories there. But then what we did was we

814
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.676
reached out to some Excellent writers who are great

815
00:46:12.676 --> 00:46:16.075
philosophers or philosophers who are excellent writers, and we

816
00:46:16.075 --> 00:46:19.075
invited them to contribute on their area of expertise

817
00:46:19.075 --> 00:46:22.875
to the book within those different sections, and we

818
00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:24.916
were very happy that a good number of people

819
00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:28.676
said yes. However, since we are also equity-minded and

820
00:46:28.676 --> 00:46:32.196
justice-oriented for a whole variety of reasons, we did

821
00:46:32.196 --> 00:46:36.135
not just want to handpick people for the book,

822
00:46:36.416 --> 00:46:39.375
um, but we wanted to do an open call

823
00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:41.941
to see What people were getting up to. And

824
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:44.302
so, we put out a call and we worked

825
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:48.822
very hard to get a nice range of contributors

826
00:46:48.822 --> 00:46:51.342
from a lot of different roles and positions in

827
00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:55.422
philosophy, writing awesome chapters with the requirement being that

828
00:46:55.422 --> 00:46:58.582
each chapter needed to start with an anecdote from

829
00:46:59.062 --> 00:47:04.172
history, philosophy, myth, not philosophy, history, myth, literature, whatever,

830
00:47:04.342 --> 00:47:06.981
science, in order to open up the topic so

831
00:47:06.981 --> 00:47:08.842
that it would be coherent all the way through.

832
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.590
So, then what we ended up with were 20

833
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:15.989
chapters written by women and non-binary contributors, broken down

834
00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:19.280
into 4 sections, but according to some main questions

835
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.040
and themes that people tend to have in philosophy

836
00:47:22.399 --> 00:47:27.679
about identity, about autonomy, um, about questions, about courage,

837
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:31.715
and so on, Thus, trying to make an accessible

838
00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:35.395
but and digestible book that would invite people into

839
00:47:35.395 --> 00:47:38.415
philosophy without saying this is the final word, you

840
00:47:38.415 --> 00:47:41.135
know, there are some big gaps in here, there's

841
00:47:41.135 --> 00:47:43.655
some things that are missing, and uh we hope

842
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:46.235
that that'll be in future volumes and maybe that

843
00:47:46.495 --> 00:47:48.135
we will be able to do that down the

844
00:47:48.135 --> 00:47:48.475
road.

845
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.969
And if I could just add a story, um,

846
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.449
when this book was being reviewed for potential publication

847
00:47:57.449 --> 00:48:01.520
by Oxford, um, reviewers were for the most part,

848
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:06.239
positive, hence the publication, um, but we got a

849
00:48:06.239 --> 00:48:10.879
number, a number of comments that were, um, why

850
00:48:10.879 --> 00:48:14.840
aren't you addressing love? Why aren't you addressing religion?

851
00:48:15.209 --> 00:48:18.850
Why aren't you addressing mind? Um, THESE sorts of

852
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.870
things, and when we tallied those, there were actually

853
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.209
more suggestions about topics we had missed than topics

854
00:48:27.209 --> 00:48:32.129
we had included. And so we, again, to follow

855
00:48:32.129 --> 00:48:34.409
up with what Melissa is saying here, we hope

856
00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:37.449
to have additional volumes, but you can only do

857
00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:40.360
so much in a particular book. So narrowing it

858
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.110
down in the way that we did, um. It

859
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.580
was partly because of the kinds of contributions that

860
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.139
we got, um, and the people who submitted, um,

861
00:48:52.149 --> 00:48:57.149
proposals, but also because we recognize the, the pragmatic

862
00:48:57.149 --> 00:49:00.949
needs of, of getting a book done, um, but

863
00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:03.909
there are any number of topics that could have

864
00:49:03.909 --> 00:49:06.229
been in this volume that are not that we

865
00:49:06.229 --> 00:49:10.469
hope to include later and, um. The those topics

866
00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:13.949
are in no way diminished because they weren't addressed

867
00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:17.469
in this first go round. Simply, this is how

868
00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:18.389
it worked out.

869
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.149
Absolutely, and then at the beginning of the book.

870
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.389
Not the very, very beginning, which I'll talk about

871
00:49:25.389 --> 00:49:26.870
maybe later, but at the beginning of the book,

872
00:49:26.949 --> 00:49:29.590
we laid out some threads, um, kind of like

873
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:33.020
some pathways through, because as the book was coalescing

874
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.750
as a book and not a random assemblage of

875
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.669
essays on different topics, we were able to see,

876
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.699
and I think it's in part because Kim and

877
00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:43.070
I are lifelong educators, we're able to see these

878
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.310
different overlapping threads and kind of ways through. And

879
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.989
so the book doesn't need to be read from

880
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.389
beginning to end straight through. This is not that

881
00:49:50.389 --> 00:49:54.370
kind of book. Um, THE chapters are in conversation

882
00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.360
with each other, and there are different questions that,

883
00:49:56.419 --> 00:49:58.409
that go all the way through the book, and

884
00:49:58.409 --> 00:50:00.689
so that is exciting for us as well. And

885
00:50:00.689 --> 00:50:02.729
again, we call it an invitation to the life

886
00:50:02.729 --> 00:50:05.330
of thoughts, not the final word in philosophy.

887
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.300
Right. So let me ask you a different kind

888
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.219
of question now. Do you think that women can

889
00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:17.459
be empowered through philosophy, and if so, how?

890
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.300
Do you wanna start? Go ahead, Melissa. I'll, I'll

891
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.280
formulate here.

892
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.040
I think absolutely, and I think I've really thought

893
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.379
a lot about this question over the past few

894
00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:37.689
years. And If I had to make kind of

895
00:50:37.689 --> 00:50:42.399
a provocative claim here, I'd say that intellectual empowerment

896
00:50:42.899 --> 00:50:48.459
for anyone might happen only through philosophy. And I

897
00:50:48.459 --> 00:50:50.100
know, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna put it out

898
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:56.840
there, because what I see. In our classrooms are

899
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.590
a lot of people, and we mentioned AI earlier,

900
00:50:59.929 --> 00:51:05.040
a lot of people immediately surrendering their autonomy and

901
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.209
their own right to their own ideas to other

902
00:51:07.209 --> 00:51:10.959
people. And whether that's to whatever AI spits out,

903
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.169
so you put in a question to chat GPT

904
00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:15.679
and this is actually an enormous problem for undergraduates

905
00:51:15.679 --> 00:51:18.239
right now, that they'll put a question in, and

906
00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:21.260
the answer comes out, and then they immediately think

907
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.540
that that must be right, right? That's the authority.

908
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.580
And so, I think that especially for young people,

909
00:51:29.879 --> 00:51:34.159
and especially for young women right now, The way

910
00:51:34.159 --> 00:51:38.010
to be empowered is through philosophy. That is, being

911
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.719
able to have confidence in who you are, and

912
00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:43.770
your right to have ideas, even when they're wrong,

913
00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:47.199
is the way to be fully empowered. If you

914
00:51:47.199 --> 00:51:50.840
can read, write, and think with some competence, and

915
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.270
you can know why you think what you do,

916
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.959
then that is empowerment. It also means that a

917
00:51:57.959 --> 00:52:01.399
person will be resilient without having to simply have

918
00:52:01.399 --> 00:52:04.774
grit to make Get through and I believe very

919
00:52:04.774 --> 00:52:08.604
much in intellectual resilience. Now what that means though

920
00:52:08.604 --> 00:52:10.604
is that we need to have social structures in

921
00:52:10.604 --> 00:52:13.364
place where students, for example, aren't just punished in

922
00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:16.745
their education or marked down for getting things wrong

923
00:52:16.745 --> 00:52:20.810
all the time and instead they're able to. EARN

924
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:24.729
their credit, and they're able to feel their accomplishments

925
00:52:24.729 --> 00:52:27.729
and also be able to take some failures. One

926
00:52:27.729 --> 00:52:30.610
big problem I see going on right now, an

927
00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:34.530
enormous problem, especially in education, is that students are

928
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:37.129
afraid to voice an opinion because they think they're

929
00:52:37.129 --> 00:52:39.489
just going to be canceled or wrong. I think

930
00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.449
we see this in social media, I think we

931
00:52:41.449 --> 00:52:43.969
see this through AI and so on. And I

932
00:52:43.969 --> 00:52:47.229
think we see people who have historically been marginalized,

933
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.794
like women. AND people of color, they are especially

934
00:52:50.794 --> 00:52:54.395
susceptible to this. And so I think if I

935
00:52:54.395 --> 00:52:57.395
really needed to make a provocative claim, the only

936
00:52:57.395 --> 00:53:01.114
way to intellectually empower someone is through having them

937
00:53:01.114 --> 00:53:04.405
engage with the ideas that they're actively having. One

938
00:53:04.405 --> 00:53:06.554
quick anecdote about this, as I said, I've done

939
00:53:06.554 --> 00:53:10.395
some work on intellectual joy and intellectual empowerment. And

940
00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:14.580
this year at my university, I asked several 100

941
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.530
first-year students, so these are students who, most of

942
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.570
whom just graduated from high school because I teach

943
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.489
at a traditional university, and I asked them, and

944
00:53:22.489 --> 00:53:25.330
they're all in these required biology classes that they

945
00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:27.520
stress out about all the time. And so I

946
00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.729
asked them about their studying for biology, and they

947
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:33.250
all say they study a lot individually and together

948
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.989
and so on. And then they take the test.

949
00:53:36.449 --> 00:53:39.570
And I ask them how they feel after they

950
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:42.449
take that test, that first kind of bio test.

951
00:53:43.199 --> 00:53:47.149
And students report that they freak out, this is

952
00:53:47.149 --> 00:53:51.679
their language, until they get their score, right? And

953
00:53:51.679 --> 00:53:55.840
so all that studying, all that work that they

954
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.389
put in, after they finish the test, they immediately

955
00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:06.320
surrender their work, their efforts, their intellectual resilience, what

956
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.360
they did and didn't do, they surrender it to

957
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.429
whether they got something right or wrong. I think

958
00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:16.320
that that is totally intellectually disempowering. So, I, I

959
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.120
was trying to convince them, I didn't, of course,

960
00:54:19.199 --> 00:54:21.560
succeed in the time that I had. I was

961
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.939
trying to convince them that they should be able

962
00:54:24.939 --> 00:54:27.040
to think about their effort, they should be able

963
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.080
to review what they did and did not do.

964
00:54:30.399 --> 00:54:33.620
They should be able to come to peace with

965
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.639
whether they felt like they succeeded or failed before

966
00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:41.270
they even get back the test. But because young

967
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:47.689
people generally feel so, just again, generally, intellectually disempowered,

968
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:50.790
they just want to know if, if what they

969
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:54.530
did was right or wrong. And study after study

970
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.439
shows that women are brought up as children, from,

971
00:54:58.449 --> 00:55:00.899
from being children, to be right or wrong, to

972
00:55:00.899 --> 00:55:04.340
be perfect or imperfect, whereas boys tend to be

973
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.260
raised and brought up to be courageous or brave

974
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.439
or to make some mistakes. Yet, on a large

975
00:55:10.439 --> 00:55:14.544
scale, so many young people now are are kind

976
00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:17.534
of in a position of giving up that autonomy

977
00:55:17.534 --> 00:55:20.024
or their own agency and so on. So, in

978
00:55:20.024 --> 00:55:23.745
terms of intellectual empowerment, telling students that they have

979
00:55:23.745 --> 00:55:26.625
the permission to have their ideas, and that they

980
00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:29.264
can have ideas that are worth having, and also

981
00:55:29.264 --> 00:55:31.584
not worth having, that they can discard and have

982
00:55:31.584 --> 00:55:35.340
some intellectual agility with, that seems important. Now, for

983
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.979
that to happen, it means that we need psychologically

984
00:55:37.979 --> 00:55:42.020
safe spaces without what is called now by Jonathan

985
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.139
Hay and some others, safetyism. That is, it can't

986
00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:47.780
be the case that anytime someone says something that

987
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:51.100
I disagree with, I'm immediately offended, right? Or I'm

988
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.520
immediately undone. But rather a psychologically safe space in

989
00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.639
a classroom and otherwise means that the conditions are

990
00:55:58.639 --> 00:56:02.280
there for the possibility of authentic conversation, and it

991
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.280
means that a student should be able to ask,

992
00:56:04.399 --> 00:56:06.520
why do we have this assignment or why is

993
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.459
this like this. And there should be able to

994
00:56:08.459 --> 00:56:12.149
be reasons, right? And so psychologically safe spaces, which

995
00:56:12.149 --> 00:56:14.489
are especially important for women and people of color,

996
00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.060
means that they're not going to be retaliated against

997
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.659
if they ask a question or more than that,

998
00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.580
you know, try to um offer a counterpoint.

999
00:56:23.669 --> 00:56:26.520
And I've, I'll, I'll take it in a slightly

1000
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.810
different direction. I agree with everything Melissa has just

1001
00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:33.560
said. But as um you were asking the question

1002
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.949
Melissa was answering, I was thinking of the way

1003
00:56:35.949 --> 00:56:38.800
that I try to introduce the topic of philosophy

1004
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.959
to students. And obviously, you will know this, Ricardo,

1005
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.040
as will most of your listeners, but the word

1006
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.860
philosophia or philosophy means love of wisdom. And I

1007
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.120
spent quite a bit of time talking about how

1008
00:56:53.419 --> 00:56:57.459
it's not knowledge. First of all, it's wisdom, um,

1009
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:02.439
which implies an ability to seek clarity and act

1010
00:57:02.439 --> 00:57:06.620
appropriately, right? Um, BUT then I turn to and

1011
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:11.250
emphasize the love aspect and why it's not ownership,

1012
00:57:11.459 --> 00:57:15.260
right? It's not, um, possession, that what do we

1013
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.300
know about love? Love is typically a lifelong pursuit.

1014
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:24.570
It's a relationship between multiple beings who are agents

1015
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.250
usually in their own rights. Um, IT is something

1016
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.479
that is very hard work. It takes listening to

1017
00:57:31.479 --> 00:57:35.310
other people. It takes changing your mind. It takes

1018
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:39.469
out, um, reaching out, it takes being vulnerable, it

1019
00:57:39.469 --> 00:57:44.070
takes offering forgiveness, it takes asking for forgiveness. All

1020
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:50.590
of these things that students tend to typically associate

1021
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:54.409
with the word love is not what they associate

1022
00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:59.489
with academia. And they don't think of the work

1023
00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:02.780
of academia as being something that is a loving

1024
00:58:03.169 --> 00:58:06.610
work. And I'm not trying to be overly romantic

1025
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.610
here. I'm simply trying to say, philosophy, it, your

1026
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:14.969
question, you know, is it empowering? Or can it

1027
00:58:14.969 --> 00:58:19.280
be philosophically empowering to teach these, these topics? Yes,

1028
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:26.860
because it's encouraging people to pursue good lives, right?

1029
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.330
And to recognize that sometimes we get off track,

1030
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.379
to seek help, to assert ourselves when we believe

1031
00:58:35.379 --> 00:58:37.550
we are right, and that they know this about,

1032
00:58:37.699 --> 00:58:42.659
say, relationships, but they don't associate those things necessarily

1033
00:58:42.659 --> 00:58:49.429
with Understanding with knowledge, with um virtue or value,

1034
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.850
um, with uh morality or ethics or justice or

1035
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:54.929
any of these ideas.

1036
00:58:57.129 --> 00:59:00.129
Right, so this is a question that is in

1037
00:59:00.129 --> 00:59:02.810
a way linked to the one where I asked

1038
00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:06.209
you if philosophy is gendered and if you, if

1039
00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:09.850
there's something about philosophy that is tailored in terms

1040
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.129
of its methodology more toward men than women. But

1041
00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:17.810
if philosophy is still dominated by men, do you

1042
00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:21.370
think that for women to be successful there, they

1043
00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:24.969
have to adopt any norms of masculinity?

1044
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.709
My first response to this is no. Um, I

1045
00:59:30.709 --> 00:59:32.790
actually think that the change should come on the

1046
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:38.030
other side, which is that perhaps men should pay

1047
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.550
attention to the ways that norms of masculinity are

1048
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:46.429
problematic for many people in the world. Um, SO

1049
00:59:46.429 --> 00:59:50.419
I don't want to couch it in terms of

1050
00:59:50.419 --> 00:59:54.709
a masculine feminine dynamic in answering this particular question,

1051
00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:58.850
although I understand what you're asking. Um, SO, is

1052
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:04.260
it possible that women can take on, um, norms

1053
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.090
typically associated with men and, and succeed in various

1054
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:11.669
fields? Absolutely, of course, of course. And do I

1055
01:00:11.669 --> 01:00:15.260
encourage that for women who choose those routes? Yes,

1056
01:00:15.419 --> 01:00:18.899
absolutely. Um, BUT is it the case that women

1057
01:00:18.899 --> 01:00:23.959
must simply conform? No. Uh, AGAIN, this is about

1058
01:00:23.959 --> 01:00:27.439
a better life for everyone, about a better world

1059
01:00:27.439 --> 01:00:30.590
for us, and a better world for the future,

1060
01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.590
and that means that the change cannot be one-sided,

1061
01:00:34.889 --> 01:00:40.610
um, and we have to be critiquing those norms

1062
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:44.090
even as we say things like, well, we can

1063
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.889
understand why assertive leadership is important sometimes. That's fair.

1064
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:54.800
Um, BUT we have to understand also why empathy

1065
01:00:54.979 --> 01:01:01.580
and intellectual, um, awareness and, uh, intelligence is as

1066
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.929
important. Um, SO I would say, Not necessarily. Some,

1067
01:01:07.139 --> 01:01:09.879
some people can and some people do, and when

1068
01:01:10.179 --> 01:01:14.439
they choose that, yes, good on them, but um

1069
01:01:14.939 --> 01:01:18.139
we need not look for a one-sided change.

1070
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.850
Mhm. Uh, ANYTHING you'd like to add to that,

1071
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.959
Melissa, or?

1072
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:27.070
I just want to listen to my friend talk

1073
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.389
all the time now, but, um, I'll just add,

1074
01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.030
you know, again, kind of broader than philosophy, when

1075
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.479
we're thinking about people in their work lives, There

1076
01:01:37.479 --> 01:01:42.770
are some serious challenges to Kind of what's what's

1077
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.330
called a lean-in model by Sheryl Sandberg, and Bell

1078
01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.250
Hooks is one of my favorite philosophers slash kind

1079
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:54.179
of critics of everything. And several years ago, when

1080
01:01:54.179 --> 01:01:56.739
that book called Lean In came out, which is

1081
01:01:56.739 --> 01:01:58.580
premised on the idea that women need a seat

1082
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.219
at the table, this is true, and that women

1083
01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:03.739
essentially need to do what men do in boardrooms

1084
01:02:03.739 --> 01:02:05.860
to, to get ahead. So that's the basic premise.

1085
01:02:05.969 --> 01:02:08.969
So, it's a training program on how women, for

1086
01:02:08.969 --> 01:02:12.179
example, can learn to golf like men and therefore

1087
01:02:12.179 --> 01:02:14.100
be part of those conversations to get that seat

1088
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.350
at the table. Bell Hooks and myself and a

1089
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:18.820
good number of people, and then I'm thinking about

1090
01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.719
liberation theologists like Paulo Freiri and um people who

1091
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:26.520
are into Education as a, as a way to

1092
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.899
be free, they all push back on that conception

1093
01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:33.429
that to be a leader is to be like

1094
01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:36.199
a, someone who's always been in that leadership position,

1095
01:02:36.389 --> 01:02:37.959
whether that's been a white man or whatever it

1096
01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:41.040
is. And what they're interested in, and Kim is

1097
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.560
very much speaking to this, is an entire culture

1098
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.199
change. And so, you know, what does that table

1099
01:02:47.199 --> 01:02:50.919
need to look like? What are the conditions for

1100
01:02:50.919 --> 01:02:55.070
people to be in leadership positions? Um, WHOSE voices

1101
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:57.500
are missing, we should always be asking that, who

1102
01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.739
needs to be heard? And it's not that everyone

1103
01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:01.620
needs to be heard all the time. And this

1104
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.899
is also to Kim's point about, you know, we

1105
01:03:03.899 --> 01:03:07.649
need assertive leaders, right? But that assertive leadership doesn't

1106
01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:10.159
always have to be how it's always always been.

1107
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.419
And I would say that academia is very slow

1108
01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:17.139
to change. It's extremely status quo. Um, IT reinforces

1109
01:03:17.139 --> 01:03:20.715
higher Hierarchies all the time, even while academics are

1110
01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:23.915
writing about justice, there are injust practices and unjust

1111
01:03:23.915 --> 01:03:26.524
practices in their own houses, and we should put

1112
01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:28.635
all of this on the table. And I think

1113
01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:31.695
that academia, so to again, take that big picture,

1114
01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.915
is itself in a really precarious position right now,

1115
01:03:35.024 --> 01:03:37.074
at least in the United States, but I know

1116
01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:39.705
elsewhere around the world. And so, I think it

1117
01:03:39.705 --> 01:03:43.620
would be in, Everyone's best interest in higher education

1118
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.659
to be thinking about these things, whether it's for

1119
01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:48.820
academic philosophy or for what the future of learning

1120
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.780
looks like, especially in constantly having to make a

1121
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.979
case that it should exist and um that thinking

1122
01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:59.419
and learning and seeking truth in, you know, a

1123
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:03.399
time of rampant misinformation is maybe more important now

1124
01:04:03.399 --> 01:04:05.590
than ever. Mhm

1125
01:04:06.199 --> 01:04:10.959
So are there any strategies we can adopt to

1126
01:04:10.959 --> 01:04:15.179
address the gender gap in philosophy, and if so,

1127
01:04:15.679 --> 01:04:18.020
what would you say are the main ones?

1128
01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.070
I can, I'll take lead and then kick it

1129
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:26.080
to Melissa, um, or not lead, but first answer.

1130
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:31.189
Um, FIRST, I think we can have better representation.

1131
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:35.090
Girls and women need to see themselves in philosophical

1132
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:39.739
inquiry. Um, THIS book attempts to begin that project.

1133
01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:43.500
We need to recognize the kinds of questions that

1134
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.699
girls and women may ask that are different than

1135
01:04:46.699 --> 01:04:51.879
the ones that are typically asked, again, stereotypically. By

1136
01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:55.830
men or boys or those in dominant positions. We

1137
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:59.600
need to be asking not just about um what

1138
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.060
the experience of, of women and girls are, but

1139
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.020
um non-white peoples, queer peoples, these sorts of questions.

1140
01:05:07.399 --> 01:05:12.199
And so we, we need to um have better

1141
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:16.489
representation. We need to see ourselves in the texts.

1142
01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:19.989
Again, one of the strategies of this book. Um,

1143
01:05:20.139 --> 01:05:24.419
WAS, as you noted earlier, um, to show the

1144
01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:28.290
breadth of women philosophers and the work that they

1145
01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:31.020
have done. So girls and women can say, oh,

1146
01:05:31.149 --> 01:05:35.459
yeah, OK, it's not all Descartes, it's not all

1147
01:05:35.459 --> 01:05:41.129
Socrates. Hail to the king. Um, BUT that we

1148
01:05:41.129 --> 01:05:44.070
see, you know, we're seeing all of these different

1149
01:05:44.449 --> 01:05:48.250
reclaimed figures and figures that haven't needed to be

1150
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:55.350
reclaimed, Beauvoir and contemporaries. Um, SO, We, we, these

1151
01:05:55.350 --> 01:06:00.270
are some initial strategies. Uh, THEY center around representation,

1152
01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:05.510
identification, um, and, and being heard, but I will

1153
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:08.110
now kick it to My friend.

1154
01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:12.159
Yeah, so, we wanted the book not to just

1155
01:06:12.159 --> 01:06:15.439
be, it's interesting, actually, I think, because we wanted

1156
01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.600
the book not to just be about political issues

1157
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.879
or social issues or identity issues. We really didn't,

1158
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.840
you know, philosophy is about more than that, and

1159
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.054
I think once The stereotype and philosophy is that

1160
01:06:26.054 --> 01:06:28.864
if you're a woman working in philosophy, you have

1161
01:06:28.864 --> 01:06:30.945
to be working on certain kinds of topics. And

1162
01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.344
I'll say that in my own life, being a

1163
01:06:32.344 --> 01:06:35.225
woman in ancient Greek philosophy, I was subjected to

1164
01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:37.205
some of those critiques as well. Well, she can't

1165
01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:39.145
be a feminist because she works in ancient Greek

1166
01:06:39.145 --> 01:06:45.495
philosophy. False dichotomies everywhere. But in terms of representation,

1167
01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:49.215
you know, we asked our authors to use mainly,

1168
01:06:49.385 --> 01:06:54.239
not exclusively, but mainly, Historical and contemporary sources, so

1169
01:06:54.239 --> 01:06:59.300
secondary literature and primary literature, not written by men,

1170
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.879
in part because we know all those, or a

1171
01:07:01.879 --> 01:07:06.340
lot of them. And, you know, It's our experience

1172
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.239
as kind of micromanaging editors of this book, um,

1173
01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.520
We don't miss them. We don't miss the men.

1174
01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:16.419
And I will say that, because, as it turns

1175
01:07:16.419 --> 01:07:19.209
out, when you look closely enough, there are an

1176
01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:24.060
abundance of women philosophers, both to be recovered and

1177
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.580
then writing now to be discovered. There are some

1178
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.939
movements going on in philosophy about citation, attribution, and

1179
01:07:31.939 --> 01:07:36.300
making sure that in papers, say, written in disciplines

1180
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.520
that are traditionally male dominated, that women are included,

1181
01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.850
or at least referred to, or at least considered.

1182
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:45.340
There is a movement that started a few years

1183
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.739
ago called, congratulations, you have um an all-male panel,

1184
01:07:49.939 --> 01:07:53.479
right? Because so many panels in philosophy are simply

1185
01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:55.760
men and so on. I will say that I

1186
01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.959
think it's a complicated issue because you also don't

1187
01:07:57.959 --> 01:08:00.719
want tokenizing and you also don't want to have

1188
01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:04.129
a woman on just because she's a woman, um,

1189
01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:06.830
so that tokenization, but because she has something to

1190
01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.360
contribute, but we do see people kind of making

1191
01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.669
a, a show of simply reinforcing the status quo.

1192
01:08:14.239 --> 01:08:18.169
So, we hope that this book then through the

1193
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:22.810
clarity that each contributor writes with through the coherence

1194
01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.899
and discussion that arises through the combination of chapters,

1195
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.430
through the citations and references, and through just kind

1196
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:32.790
of the passion and sincerity with which every chapter

1197
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:35.189
is written. I mean, this book, um, by many

1198
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:38.069
people's accounts is a labor of love with, again,

1199
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.669
Kim, you know, as you so beautifully emphasized that

1200
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:42.939
love is leading the way here. We hope that

1201
01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:47.049
this book shows that philosophy can be done for

1202
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.399
People not traditionally included in it, and then represent

1203
01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.689
people who have been doing philosophy all along that

1204
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:57.000
maybe haven't been noticed. Um, ONE last word on

1205
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.120
my end is that the book opens with, and

1206
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.279
so I showed it here, so on the cover,

1207
01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:04.520
there is a picture of a pomegranate, and you

1208
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.879
might wonder why is there a pomegranate on the

1209
01:09:06.879 --> 01:09:10.319
book of uh called Philosophy for Girls. Well, it's

1210
01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.799
because the book opens with, um, a retelling of

1211
01:09:13.799 --> 01:09:16.750
the Persephone story. So to come back to this

1212
01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:20.149
idea of naming and representation, in ancient Greek myth,

1213
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:23.750
poetry, and philosophy, You know, we know a lot

1214
01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.870
of the gods and goddesses, but we actually don't

1215
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:28.990
know much about Persephone. Persephone is the daughter of

1216
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.970
Demeter, who, of course, is one of the great

1217
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:37.549
Greek goddesses, and What happens is Persephone is abducted

1218
01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:40.629
slash seduced slash raped, it's all the same word

1219
01:09:40.629 --> 01:09:43.310
in Greek, by Hades, the king of the underworld,

1220
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:46.549
and is brought down to Hades and um ends

1221
01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:50.250
up spending 6 months underground and 6 months aboveground,

1222
01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:53.410
um, the only goddess to rule in two realms,

1223
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:56.189
and she has those 6 months because she eats

1224
01:09:56.189 --> 01:10:00.390
6 pomegranate seeds. Now, we retell the story of

1225
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:04.879
Persephone to be the story of this imagined. Young

1226
01:10:04.879 --> 01:10:08.609
woman coming into her own consciousness and coming to

1227
01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:11.600
her own kind of authority and autonomy and having

1228
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.160
to, frankly figure things out. In fact, before she

1229
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.509
was abducted, Persephone was never called Persephone, she was

1230
01:10:18.509 --> 01:10:21.319
just called Korre, which means girl, and it's not

1231
01:10:21.319 --> 01:10:23.200
until she grows into this power that she really

1232
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.830
grows into her name. And then just an interesting

1233
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:28.370
bit of trivia is that once she does become

1234
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:31.149
this queen of the underworld, um, almost every time

1235
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:34.470
her name is mentioned in Homer or in Greek

1236
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:37.470
myth, Persephone is always preceded by a word that

1237
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:41.910
translates into thoughtful or circumspect, but she's incredibly wise.

1238
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.930
AND she's incredibly clever, and she's a little bit

1239
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:48.129
feared because she is a powerful goddess. And we

1240
01:10:48.129 --> 01:10:50.129
love this as the opening of this book, to

1241
01:10:50.129 --> 01:10:52.290
think about what it is to be a girl

1242
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.890
coming into her own, having to traverse many different

1243
01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:58.970
realms of life, and becoming who she is all

1244
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:59.390
along.

1245
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:04.229
Mhm. What do you call this book, uh, feminist

1246
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.649
book?

1247
01:11:05.379 --> 01:11:10.009
It is a book of philosophy done by women

1248
01:11:10.589 --> 01:11:14.129
compiled in a feminist spirit. How is that for,

1249
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:18.549
you know, using some, some, uh, word like or

1250
01:11:18.549 --> 01:11:21.229
word garbage there, but what I mean is the

1251
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:29.390
topics are universal topics, um, identity, autonomy, uh, Uh,

1252
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:33.629
logic, right? Um, THEY are done by women, and

1253
01:11:33.629 --> 01:11:37.350
so we hear women's voices, and we certainly had

1254
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:41.390
a feminist agenda in putting the book together. But

1255
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:45.629
again, young men or men of any age can

1256
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:49.229
pick this book up and learn about philosophy from

1257
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:53.109
this book, and we've been very proud of the

1258
01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:57.450
responses we've gotten. That emphasize that it's not just

1259
01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:01.290
for girls that, um, actually anyone can read this

1260
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.229
and learn about philosophy.

1261
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.799
It's absolutely a feminist book, as Kim said, and

1262
01:12:07.799 --> 01:12:11.279
feminism, we think is good for everyone. It's also

1263
01:12:11.279 --> 01:12:15.120
not itself a homogenized discipline or subset of philosophy,

1264
01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:17.240
so even the word feminism, I think is a

1265
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.479
pluralistic word, um, but yeah, it's absolutely in a

1266
01:12:20.479 --> 01:12:24.959
feminist spirit of friendship and love and conversation, and

1267
01:12:24.959 --> 01:12:27.160
of course, you know, we think that men should

1268
01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.080
be feminists too.

1269
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:34.439
Yeah, yeah, I mean, definitely feminism is not anti-men,

1270
01:12:34.859 --> 01:12:40.100
right? Yes, correct. OK, so one last question then.

1271
01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.220
So you were able to write an entire book

1272
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.100
about some of the major branches of philosophy with

1273
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.540
nearly all sources written by women. I'm saying nearly

1274
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.700
and not all because I, I didn't go through

1275
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:59.580
all the references to, to check it. So what

1276
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.859
does that tell you about the contributions of women

1277
01:13:02.859 --> 01:13:07.890
to philosophy and how does it contrast with how

1278
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:09.220
they are perceived?

1279
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.890
There is power there if we're willing to look

1280
01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.970
for it. There is wisdom there if we are

1281
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:20.040
willing to look for it. There is, um, Leadership

1282
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.509
and knowledge and love there if we're willing to

1283
01:13:22.509 --> 01:13:26.520
look for it. And um societally, we've not always

1284
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.200
been willing to look for it. Uh, THAT doesn't

1285
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.120
mean that it's suddenly a new thing. Um, IT'S

1286
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.479
that we perhaps now have the luxury of being

1287
01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:41.520
able to look for it. Um, SO, I, I

1288
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:49.839
would say that, uh, We need to. Legitimize the

1289
01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:54.479
voices and questions raised by, or the voices and

1290
01:13:54.479 --> 01:13:58.689
questions of girls and women, and the voices of

1291
01:13:58.689 --> 01:14:00.959
girls and women and the questions raised by girls

1292
01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:09.750
and women. Um, But also legitimize simply um. Younger

1293
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.990
voices. Uh, THAT'S one thing we actually didn't talk

1294
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.790
about is why we chose to use the word

1295
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:18.529
girls. And I'll just try to wrap this, um,

1296
01:14:18.819 --> 01:14:21.270
by going back to a comment at the very

1297
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:25.549
beginning of the podcast, which was, you know, what

1298
01:14:25.549 --> 01:14:29.390
does a philosopher look like? Uh, I do that

1299
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:32.609
exercise with my students on the first day. Uh,

1300
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:37.189
FOR introductory classes, and they almost always see a

1301
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:42.629
toga, you know, an olive, um, wreath, um, these

1302
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:45.669
sorts of things, but, uh, more than anything, they

1303
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:49.390
see an older person, you know, um, it, it's

1304
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:52.220
male, but he always has a beard and it's

1305
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.770
usually gray. And um I, I always say, no,

1306
01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:59.100
look, look, look around. I'm sorry, I'm doing one

1307
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.450
of those obnoxious, look to your left and look

1308
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.250
to your right, y'all are philosophers. This is, this

1309
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.850
is what philosophy looks like. You are, are a

1310
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:11.569
philosopher and we're going to learn more philosophy together.

1311
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:15.649
So, um, I, I strayed from the direct answer

1312
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:18.649
of your question but hopefully kind of um tied

1313
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:19.250
it up there.

1314
01:15:20.169 --> 01:15:24.290
Mhm. Uh, Melissa, do you want to add anything

1315
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.649
to that?

1316
01:15:25.379 --> 01:15:29.939
Yeah, so, you're right, it's not all women sources,

1317
01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.220
and that makes good sense for the book, too.

1318
01:15:32.339 --> 01:15:33.620
I mean, we could have just made that a

1319
01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.140
requirement and people would have done it, but then

1320
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.490
that would have been a matter of compliance, and

1321
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:40.700
we don't want that. Um, BUT it is mainly

1322
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:46.720
women sources. And as Kim said, They're there. And

1323
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.000
no one was writing to us saying, I can't

1324
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.399
come up with women philosophers. Everyone had them ready

1325
01:15:52.399 --> 01:15:54.660
in mind, and then if they didn't, they, they

1326
01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.000
did some digging, um, to find that out. But

1327
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.759
again, you know, I wrote an entire chapter on

1328
01:15:59.759 --> 01:16:03.240
questions and, and wonder without mentioning Socrates. And as

1329
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.640
much as I love Socrates, he is to me

1330
01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.799
the goat. I didn't miss him, and I don't

1331
01:16:07.799 --> 01:16:10.310
think that Chapter is any worse for wear. So,

1332
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.310
as I'm kind of flipping through this book, as

1333
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:15.709
we're talking, and I'm looking at the bibliographies of

1334
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:19.310
each chapter, I'm thinking about how if someone wanted

1335
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:21.629
to, they could just put that together and have

1336
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:25.669
an incredible reading list in philosophy, and that itself

1337
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:27.810
could be the basis of a, of a class.

1338
01:16:28.109 --> 01:16:31.359
I'd add to that, um, Um, one thing that

1339
01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:33.799
we did as a result of this book was

1340
01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:36.680
we put together a website called The Persephone Project,

1341
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.520
and I did this with 5 former students, um,

1342
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.640
thinking about truth, meaning, and identity. And then there's

1343
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.120
a page of resources about this book with some

1344
01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.419
questions that correspond to each chapter, and they're questions

1345
01:16:50.419 --> 01:16:55.149
and reflections written by The book's intended readers. And

1346
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:57.390
so, you know, again, the hope is that it's

1347
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:59.430
not just what's in this book, but what comes

1348
01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:02.109
from it, that shows, as Kim was saying, the

1349
01:17:02.109 --> 01:17:04.589
power of all of us to be philosophers. But

1350
01:17:04.589 --> 01:17:06.359
I don't think the book is any worse for

1351
01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:08.870
wear, for not being just filled with a bunch

1352
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:11.629
of men writing. Um, WE have lots of those

1353
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:12.049
books.

1354
01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:15.100
And, not, not at all, not at all. It's

1355
01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.700
a great book, so yeah, but go ahead. Sorry.

1356
01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.180
No, I was just going to say, and no

1357
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.879
one, even, um, critics of, uh, the title or,

1358
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:27.819
or the subject matter of the book, no one,

1359
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.229
not any critic have, uh, that I've heard of

1360
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.700
anyway, has said, well, I think the book is

1361
01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.000
worse off because there's not enough men in it.

1362
01:17:37.299 --> 01:17:40.600
There's lots of critique. Um, THAT'S fair. That's what

1363
01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.339
we do in philosophy, but no one has said.

1364
01:17:44.279 --> 01:17:47.479
You should have used more men. That seems to

1365
01:17:47.479 --> 01:17:52.330
have been appreciated by almost all readers and uh

1366
01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:52.799
reviewers.

1367
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.020
Yeah, great to know. And the book is again

1368
01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.810
Philosophy for Girls, An Invitation to the Life of

1369
01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.229
Thought. Of course, I'm leaving a link to it

1370
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:06.669
in the description of the interview. And would you

1371
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:10.049
like just to let us know where people can

1372
01:18:10.299 --> 01:18:12.470
find your work on the internet before we go?

1373
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:14.720
Maybe Melissa, you can go first.

1374
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.799
Sure. So, if anyone's interested in some of these

1375
01:18:18.799 --> 01:18:22.080
ideas about intellectual joy and intellectual empowerment, I have

1376
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.240
a white paper on the power of intellectual joy

1377
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.080
for the future of women at work, and I

1378
01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.979
have a TEDx talk on women and intellectual empowerment.

1379
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.620
All of this is part of the same sort

1380
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.830
of package here, and I can share those links

1381
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:34.339
as well.

1382
01:18:35.129 --> 01:18:36.569
Right then, Kim.

1383
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:40.169
Uh, YEAH, I would say if you're interested in

1384
01:18:40.169 --> 01:18:42.729
finding the book or others like it, you can

1385
01:18:42.729 --> 01:18:45.330
find, it can be found almost anywhere online. It's

1386
01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.370
published by Oxford University Press. You can find it

1387
01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:52.009
there. Um, THEY'VE published a number of other books

1388
01:18:52.009 --> 01:18:57.640
that are outstanding pieces in contributing to Um, philosophy

1389
01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.350
done by and, and for women. Um, AND I

1390
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:05.640
would absolutely send people to Oxford, um, other academic

1391
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.200
presses, but also, uh, look out for all of

1392
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.839
those fun books that are around as well, that

1393
01:19:11.839 --> 01:19:16.629
are starting to feature and focus on the voices

1394
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:17.759
of girls and women.

1395
01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.180
And if you do read this book and like

1396
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.089
it, um, or if you don't too, that's fine,

1397
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.379
then it would be great to actually leave a

1398
01:19:25.379 --> 01:19:28.020
review, um, because the way that more books like

1399
01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.060
this get published, and I'm not talking about the

1400
01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.379
future of philosophy for girls, but other things like

1401
01:19:32.379 --> 01:19:35.950
it, The more kind of feedback comes from readers,

1402
01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:38.430
the more presses are inclined to take projects up

1403
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:41.430
like this. So whether it's through the Independent Booksellers

1404
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:45.310
Hub or through a big platform like Amazon, sorry

1405
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:47.430
to say, but it helps, um, go ahead and

1406
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:49.229
leave a review of your favorite books. In fact,

1407
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.629
that's what everyone should do right now, go leave

1408
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:54.990
5 reviews of books to encourage the kinds of

1409
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.450
books you want to see in the world.

1410
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.870
Yeah, just follow the link that I will leave

1411
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:03.859
