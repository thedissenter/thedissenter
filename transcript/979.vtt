00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.970
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.099
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Watson. Today Igen by

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.710
Doctor Camilla North. She's an Assistant Professor of Cognitive

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.010
Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge. And today we're

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.489
talking about her great book, The Balanced Brain, The

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.149
Science of Mental Health. So doctor nor welcome to

7
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.770
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.319
Thank you. It's great to be on the decent.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.260
Great. So uh actually let me start by asking

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.430
you um general questions. So why do you think

11
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:37.229
we should care about mental health? I guess that

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.330
in a way the answer should be obvious, but

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.119
perhaps there are more, less obvious answers to these

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.950
questions. So

15
00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:48.770
well, I'll tell you the obvious answer, but then

16
00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:50.209
I guess I'll tell you answers that are a

17
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.689
little bit more particular to my own views on

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.750
mental health. So the obvious answer is that everyone

19
00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.529
either firsthand or second hand has experience of a

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.830
mental health condition. That's how common they are. They're

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.730
extraordinarily disabling, probably the foremost cause of disability in

22
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:08.989
the world. That's why we hear about them all

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
the time. But actually, I think even though we

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.930
hear about them all the time, we might not

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.769
be hearing about them quite in the right way.

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.860
So my view is that much of the dialogue

27
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.540
about mental health gets a few things wrong, conflates

28
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.989
a few things and ultimately can be a little

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.069
bit unhelpful for people with mental illness. So my

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.110
interest is kind of trying to and speak to

31
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.349
some of those issues in particular. For example, the

32
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.519
fact that mental and physical health problems cannot be

33
00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:46.669
so clearly articulated as separate phenomena. That's something I'm

34
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.040
I'm very interested in. And then, you know, maybe

35
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.730
even more importantly, the fact that things we think

36
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.129
of as psychological or biological explanations are also kind

37
00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.519
of false categories in and of themselves. And I

38
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.309
think much of my research, but also my book

39
00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.370
really works to overturn those dichotomies.

40
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:10.360
And and what is really the idea of the

41
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.839
balanced brain? What do you mean by that in

42
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.399
the book?

43
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.229
So I don't think there's a kind of separate

44
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.809
category of brains in the world that are balanced

45
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.059
and you're, it's a binary thing, you're either balanced

46
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.649
or not. And oh God, if only I had

47
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.820
a balanced brain, no, I think the balanced brain

48
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.610
is a process, a process of homeostatic, responding to

49
00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.815
challenges in your environment, the way that your body

50
00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:41.485
responds to challenges like thirst or temperature changes. So

51
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.785
too, must your brain be able to respond to

52
00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.125
major challenges to its own kind of mental health?

53
00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.645
Its own, I conceptualize that as a kind of

54
00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:53.104
predictive view of the of the world and its

55
00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:55.990
its role in it. And so I think the

56
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.860
balanced brain is a set of processes that we

57
00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:04.479
all have that can sometimes for various reasons, balance

58
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.970
in a different direction, perhaps a direction towards a

59
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.949
negative mood state or towards a state of chronic

60
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.065
anxiety. But via the same processes and intervention that

61
00:03:14.074 --> 00:03:17.654
target those processes can actually usually most of the

62
00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.804
time and most people restore a sense of mental

63
00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.464
health. So I don't think of mental health as

64
00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:26.195
being a constant state of happiness or euphoria. I

65
00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:29.455
think of it as a return to balance despite

66
00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:32.705
constant frequent challenges that we all encounter.

67
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.149
But then from your perspective, specifically, as a cognitive

68
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.259
neuroscientist, how would you define mental health? And what

69
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.410
is it the result of exactly? Or where does

70
00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.130
it come from?

71
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.839
So I think of mental health. So different people

72
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.660
have completely different answers to that question. You speak

73
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.179
to an economist and they'll probably tell you something

74
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.559
to do with maybe life satisfaction. Like the happiest

75
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.139
countries in the world are the ones where people

76
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.039
say they're happiest in their lives. And then you

77
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.720
speak to a um an animal neuroscientist and they

78
00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.960
might tell you something like, well, it's kind of

79
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.675
like how long a rat swims for when it's

80
00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:14.055
in a submerged maze. Do you know what I

81
00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:18.115
mean? These seem radically different as a cognitive neuroscientist.

82
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:22.235
I actually think that there are common mechanisms that

83
00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:26.705
apply to both circumstances. Both an evaluation of your

84
00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.346
own motivational drive to get out of a submerged

85
00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:32.835
water maze and your own estimation of the of

86
00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:36.411
your life satisfaction, they of micro differences. But actually,

87
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.101
if you look at it on a subjective scale,

88
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:42.432
how happy people feel, these kind of hedonia qualities

89
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:46.552
versus general life satisfaction. There tends to be, it

90
00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:49.182
tends to be best explained by a single factor.

91
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:52.652
Statistically, meaning the most likely explanation is that there

92
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:55.921
are kind of common mechanisms driving the the micro

93
00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:58.032
and the micro estimations of mental health.

94
00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.320
And of course, when we think about our mental

95
00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:07.269
health, many times, we refer to things like pleasure.

96
00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.609
And you mentioned how economists, for example, talk a

97
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.589
lot about happiness. So I guess that leisure would

98
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.744
correlate with happiness in a way. So, but in

99
00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:19.635
the book, you distinguish between two different types of

100
00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:23.744
pleasure, feeling good at one moment in time and

101
00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:27.095
feeling good about your life in general. So why

102
00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:29.024
do you make this distinction?

103
00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.040
I think I felt I had to make those

104
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.519
distinctions or start with those distinctions in in some

105
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.089
senses because everybody else does, they're kind of conceptual

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.489
distinctions. They're actually not distinctions that I think are

107
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.209
very important. That's why I think understanding, for example,

108
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.799
the brain mechanisms of feeling happy at a moment

109
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.410
in time is that they are actually very important

110
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.489
for understanding the mechanisms of feeling happy durably throughout

111
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.519
your life for longer periods of time.

112
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.510
And, and what is really the role that pleasure

113
00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.640
and pain play in our lives? How important are

114
00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.869
them?

115
00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:14.850
So, I think I started my book with a,

116
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:18.339
a long discussion of pain. And I think that's

117
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.000
because for many people, pain is not a mental

118
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.000
health symptom. It's not something that gets talked about

119
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.920
in mental health awareness campaigns. It's not something where

120
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.010
you would show up and say, oh, I'm struggling

121
00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:32.179
with my mental health because I have pain right

122
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.579
now. Nevertheless, I think it's actually a kind of

123
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:40.839
classic example of how your own bodily experience can

124
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.589
be filtered, enhanced, suppressed by mechanisms that are going

125
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.609
on in the brain. So this this is really

126
00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.640
something that happens in the context of chronic pain

127
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.160
where the state of chronic pain to the brain

128
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.359
has much in common with depression, probably more than

129
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.880
it has in common with acute pain like stubbing

130
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.959
your toe. But there are also a few interesting

131
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.290
things we can learn from acute pain, things that

132
00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:13.140
are momentarily uncomfortable because they relate to the opioid

133
00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.890
system which gives us an inro to pleasure. So

134
00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:21.559
in rat studies, for example, um submerging rats in

135
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.730
cold water, not too cold but pretty cold for

136
00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:26.739
a little bit of time, not too long, but

137
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.600
a decent amount of time releases opioids um in

138
00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:33.079
the brain much in the same way that drugs

139
00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:37.415
can sometimes release opioids or exercise, can sometimes release

140
00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:40.445
opioids there. You might have heard them called endorphins.

141
00:07:40.454 --> 00:07:43.075
So that's why I start with pain and pleasure

142
00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:46.274
because I think they're an inro into that basic

143
00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:50.885
kind of momentary pleasure response that is somewhat underpinned

144
00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:52.295
by opioids in the brain.

145
00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:55.730
And do we have a good understanding of the

146
00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:59.950
neurobiology behind pleasure and pain? I mean, how the

147
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:06.089
brain constructs these mental experiences, these subjective experiences?

148
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.209
Yes and no. So something that's quite easy relatively

149
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.010
is to find out the neural and biological correlates

150
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.660
of pleasure and pain. This would be something like

151
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.899
putting someone in a brain scanner and finding which

152
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.359
regions are most related to the experience of pleasure

153
00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:26.220
or pain. These are the regions that as they

154
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.420
increase in subjective pleasure, these are the regions that

155
00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:32.729
become more active or same for pain. But what's

156
00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:35.986
a little bit more difficult? Something my labs particularly

157
00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:41.995
interested in is finding causal relationships between things going

158
00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:44.015
on in the brain mechanisms in the brain and

159
00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:47.546
subjective experiences like pain and pleasure. One of the

160
00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:50.416
reasons that's very difficult is that often in neuroscience

161
00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:53.695
for causal approaches, we turn to animals. So we

162
00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:57.325
might use some of the most beautiful causal studies

163
00:08:57.335 --> 00:09:00.512
are done with a technique called optogenetics, which is

164
00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:06.031
a way of temporarily activating and deactivating certain subsets

165
00:09:06.041 --> 00:09:08.271
of cells in certain regions in the brain. So

166
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.771
it's a really elegant test of kind of turning

167
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:16.052
on and off different brain functions because this is

168
00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:19.072
a somewhat invasive technique that we essentially can't do

169
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.702
in human experiments. There's a translational gap because we

170
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.651
also can't ask a rat whether it's feeling pleasure.

171
00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.369
So in my view, we we need a few

172
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.750
different types of approaches to kind of overcome that

173
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.140
problem. And this means that we know a little

174
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.520
bit less about the causal role of certain brain

175
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.969
structures in pleasure and pain. But things that we

176
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:42.119
can do include, for example, looking at patients who've

177
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.479
experienced strokes in that regions, which can sometimes eliminate

178
00:09:46.489 --> 00:09:49.799
sense of pleasure or some pain. Um OR for

179
00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:52.609
example, using drugs that enhance pleasure or pain or

180
00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:54.479
even types of brain stimulation.

181
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:59.109
And so when it comes to pleasure specifically, I

182
00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:03.140
would imagine that uh we have different roads to

183
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.770
pleasure and when it comes to our mental health,

184
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.900
some of them would uh be better or better

185
00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:13.409
consequences for our mental health and others wouldn't be

186
00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:18.880
as good, like for example, using uh drugs to

187
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.750
achieve pleasure and stuff like that. So uh things

188
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.520
related to addictive behavior, for example. So uh what

189
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.719
are really the different roads that we have to

190
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:35.609
pleasure from a neuroscientific perspective and why some of

191
00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:38.840
them might be more dangerous than others.

192
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:46.580
So I think truly, the evidence suggests that pleasurable

193
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.590
things are helpful for mental health in the short

194
00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:53.010
term, even when those same things might be detrimental

195
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.419
in the long term. So for example, an opioid

196
00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:58.080
drug can be in the short term helpful for

197
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.835
your mental health, but in the long term, the

198
00:11:00.844 --> 00:11:04.554
adverse consequences can outweigh that. But that's not exclusive

199
00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:06.955
to drugs. So, for some people, they might get

200
00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:09.784
a pleasurable response from, I don't know, skydiving out

201
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.554
of an airplane. But obviously that too comes with

202
00:11:12.565 --> 00:11:15.724
some risks. So I don't think of it so

203
00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:19.395
much like there are good pleasures and bad pleasures

204
00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:21.984
but more that all pleasures are good but some

205
00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:23.465
come with more risks than others.

206
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.070
Mhm And, and I, I mean, when it comes

207
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.270
to dealing with mental health issues, many times, we

208
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.570
have this sort of austerity approach like we have

209
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.260
to the economy as well where we talk a

210
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.309
little, a lot about self control and about long

211
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.700
term planning and delaying gratification and all of that.

212
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.500
But is austerity really always the best route to

213
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.119
mental health or can we at least sometimes focus

214
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.539
a little bit more on a short term pleasure?

215
00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:01.750
Yes, I'm not a massive fan of these approaches

216
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.710
that you mentioned where it's kind of deprive yourself

217
00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:07.000
of everything good and that will somehow improve your

218
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.159
mental health. It's, you know, at the very least

219
00:12:09.169 --> 00:12:12.719
it's counterintuitive. But I also think there's research to

220
00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:15.590
suggest that actually what we might want to do

221
00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:20.409
is enhance people's pleasurable experiences, whether those are social

222
00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:24.239
or food based or activity based. Um AND not

223
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.820
somehow suggest that everybody should just do things that

224
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.640
are quote unquote, good for them at the expense

225
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.239
of things that they enjoy, that seems, you know,

226
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.239
really, really unhelpful for mental health.

227
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.130
And so in the book, you also explore the

228
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.090
ways by which the brain connects to the rest

229
00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:45.179
of the body because I guess that mental health

230
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.340
is not just about the brain itself. So what

231
00:12:49.349 --> 00:12:52.460
are some of the ways that these connections occur

232
00:12:52.469 --> 00:12:56.169
that are relevant specifically to mental health?

233
00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:00.239
So I'm quite excited by that bit of the

234
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.739
mental health field. I think it's had real resurgence

235
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.219
in the last decade. And I'm sure I'm sure

236
00:13:06.229 --> 00:13:09.390
everybody's seen it, seen it in the news, various

237
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.650
aspects of the body being so influential for your

238
00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:14.919
mental health. Some of it is true and exciting.

239
00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:17.640
Some of it is perhaps closer to just hype.

240
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.719
But I'll give you an example of something I

241
00:13:19.729 --> 00:13:23.429
think is on the true side. So you might

242
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.080
have read that things like your immune system affect

243
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.630
your mental health. And this initially, I think some

244
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.799
of the strong evidence for this came from epidemiological

245
00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:38.090
studies. So big group studies showing that people with

246
00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:41.200
higher levels of inflammation, which you can measure by

247
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.599
various blood based markers also have higher rates of

248
00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:49.369
mood anxiety and other types of mental health problems.

249
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.929
But there is an issue with those kinds of

250
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.969
studies. There could be a whole third factor say

251
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.020
poverty, say another health condition that simultaneously increases risk

252
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:07.179
for poor mental health and heightened inflammation. So I

253
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.219
think some of the most convincing evidence in that

254
00:14:10.229 --> 00:14:13.460
field is not just the fact that those big

255
00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:17.429
epidemiological studies exist, but that in a lab, you

256
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.039
can also create worse mental health or mental health,

257
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:26.114
life changes in the brain by increasing someone's level

258
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:30.174
of inflammation. And scientists can do that using things

259
00:14:30.184 --> 00:14:35.205
like vaccines that temporarily increase inflammation. So something like

260
00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:38.809
a flu vaccine, um or in fact, there are

261
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.359
also vaccines that increase inflammation more than the flu

262
00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:46.169
vaccine can temporarily worsen people's mood and people are

263
00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:50.450
differentially susceptible to this probe. So I'm actually someone

264
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.640
who really has mood symptoms after certain vaccines, um

265
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.489
feeling down. And that's because at least in some

266
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.169
of this evidence, people whose inflammatory states increase most

267
00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:06.679
after these vaccines are the ones whose brains change

268
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.090
in the direction of depressed patients areas like the

269
00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:14.030
subgenual anterior singular cortex, which is robustly related to

270
00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:19.520
depression change also after these methods of increasing inflammation.

271
00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:23.150
So that's a causal link between increased inflammation and

272
00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:24.010
worse mood.

273
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.440
So you focused in your answer mostly on the

274
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.460
immune system. But nowadays, many times we hear people

275
00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:36.580
talking about the gut and the gut microbiome. Uh

276
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.140
AND many people, I mean, perhaps because it's a

277
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.359
new field of study or a relatively new field

278
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:47.559
of study, I guess, and many times people overhype

279
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.239
the results, I guess uh uh there's backlash from

280
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.510
some neuroscientists and, and people like that. But uh

281
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.619
how do you look at the, how do you

282
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.950
read the literature on the potential effects that the

283
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.010
gut or the gut microbiome might have on mental

284
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.250
health and the brain in general. So

285
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.570
I am so I would almost separate my enthusiasm

286
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.869
for, to answer the question about the gut versus

287
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.859
the gut microbiome specifically because the gut itself has

288
00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:25.710
a very complex and interesting nervous system. For example,

289
00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:28.570
most serotonin in the body is actually in the

290
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.159
gut. So it it stands to reason that some

291
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:36.481
very interesting aspects of our mental states might be

292
00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:39.961
influenced by things happening in the gut. And some

293
00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:42.002
of my own work actually has shown that if

294
00:16:42.012 --> 00:16:44.262
you change the state of the gut. So in

295
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.892
this case, we used an anti nausea drug that

296
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:50.351
changes um the state of the gut, that's how

297
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.622
it combats nausea. And we changed people's levels of

298
00:16:53.632 --> 00:16:56.682
disgust, avoidance using that drug. So something that you

299
00:16:56.692 --> 00:16:59.971
wouldn't imagine the gut was connected to the gut

300
00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:03.044
had a causal role in influencing. And you can

301
00:17:03.054 --> 00:17:05.263
also see this in the other direction. So I

302
00:17:05.273 --> 00:17:09.213
think most people have probably experienced things like stomach

303
00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:12.854
pain, nausea, even vomiting when they feel very stressed

304
00:17:12.864 --> 00:17:15.973
or anxious. So I would, I would feel pretty

305
00:17:15.983 --> 00:17:19.993
confident in saying that there's a bidirectional relationship between

306
00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:23.364
processes in the gut and in the brain as

307
00:17:23.374 --> 00:17:27.073
to the influence of the microbiome on those processes.

308
00:17:27.493 --> 00:17:29.675
I think it's a really exciting field, but I

309
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:33.625
don't think that the evidence is as definitive and

310
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:35.494
I would probably use the immune system as a

311
00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:39.444
comparison because like the immune system, you can see

312
00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:42.685
in epidemiological studies that there is a relationship between

313
00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:46.055
microbiome diversity. So that's like how many different kinds

314
00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:50.344
of gut bacteria you have and heightened states of

315
00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:54.599
worse mental health, heightened anxiety, heightened depression, but if

316
00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:56.569
you do it in the lab, so say you

317
00:17:56.579 --> 00:18:00.040
give someone antibiotics which is a way of messing

318
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.630
with the gut microbiome or you give them ways

319
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.760
of increasing gut microbiome diversity. The evidence is not

320
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:11.300
so definitive. Some studies maybe but some, some studies

321
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.130
seem less convincing. So this could be for a

322
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.619
few different reasons. It could be, we haven't totally

323
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.300
understood which gut bacteria are important or which context

324
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.265
they're important in. But another reason is those causal

325
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:26.095
links can often be found in animal studies who

326
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.365
are living in kind of germ free environments who

327
00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:31.686
have various genetic factors often controlled. And in humans,

328
00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:33.865
it might be that there's a contribution but it's

329
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:37.166
quite small compared to all these other things that

330
00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:39.355
matter. So I I think there is still some

331
00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:42.666
uncertainty about just how important the role of the

332
00:18:42.676 --> 00:18:45.145
microbiome is in mental health, even though it's kind

333
00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:48.001
exciting and interesting. And then the very final thing

334
00:18:48.011 --> 00:18:49.342
I'll say on that because actually I think it's

335
00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:50.901
a really cool area and so I could go

336
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:54.092
on for a while is that although I'm still

337
00:18:54.102 --> 00:18:58.251
hesitant about the kind of direct link between microbiome

338
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:01.482
diversity and mental health. I do think there's more

339
00:19:01.491 --> 00:19:04.901
likely to be an indirect link either additionally to

340
00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:06.842
or or instead of. And by that, I mean,

341
00:19:06.852 --> 00:19:12.400
microbiome health almost certainly relates to gut health. And

342
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.400
if you're having gut symptoms, your mental health is

343
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.349
worse, you know, for many, many people. So in

344
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.839
that respect, I think there may well be this

345
00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:25.130
kind of uh sideways connection between the two that

346
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.900
could end up being quite important for some

347
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.180
patients. A more indirect link then?

348
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.130
Yeah.

349
00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:34.910
So uh and, and of course, uh I would

350
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.170
imagine that when it comes to the relationship between

351
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.250
the brain and the rest of the body, when

352
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.290
it comes to mental health, this would be a

353
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.109
two way street, right? We've been talking here about

354
00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:49.810
how, for example, the immune system and the gut

355
00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:54.319
influence uh the uh the brain physiology and all

356
00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:56.750
of that and how of course, then that has

357
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.709
impact in terms of our mental health. But uh

358
00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:02.630
how about the other way around? Is it that

359
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.810
the way the body, uh uh the brain influences

360
00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:08.469
some other parts of the body or some of

361
00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:12.770
our physiology might also have an impact on our

362
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.849
mental health?

363
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.859
Yes, I I would say substantially, which is interesting

364
00:20:17.869 --> 00:20:20.469
because I think it's often the other direction that

365
00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:22.699
people are aware of the fact that, you know,

366
00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:25.959
possibly what you eat or what illnesses you have

367
00:20:25.969 --> 00:20:28.689
are affecting your mental health. People are quite attuned

368
00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:31.530
to that. But in fact, the other way around

369
00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:35.130
is almost certainly the case that processes happening in

370
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.709
your brain are also affecting your peripheral physiology. So

371
00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.319
I gave the example of, you know, feeling sick

372
00:20:42.329 --> 00:20:44.719
when you're anxious. But there are, there are actually

373
00:20:44.729 --> 00:20:47.079
so many, it's very obvious to look at effects

374
00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:51.369
on the cardiovascular system of stress, anxiety, depression. And

375
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.900
in fact, it's to the extent that in many

376
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:58.410
mental health conditions, but particularly psychosis, there are profound

377
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.119
effects on physical health and earlier mortality because of

378
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.319
physical health. So I actually think that the effects

379
00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:08.849
of mental health and physical health are, it's one

380
00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:10.739
of the most important things that we need to

381
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.310
look at sort of as a as a field

382
00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.800
at the moment. But I think we're still actually

383
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.760
growing in understanding, especially about common mechanisms that could

384
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.260
then lead later to worse mental and physical health.

385
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.739
So, for example, in my lab, we've become quite

386
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.939
interested in the role of um factors in the

387
00:21:28.949 --> 00:21:32.420
brain and body affecting metabolic as well as mental

388
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.780
health. Because if you look at conditions like diabetes

389
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.150
and depression, they often co occur in the same

390
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.180
people. So it could well be that certain changes.

391
00:21:40.189 --> 00:21:43.239
So for example, insulin receptors in the brain might

392
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:48.280
simultaneously affect your mental and physical or via metabolic

393
00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:48.709
health.

394
00:21:49.959 --> 00:21:53.560
And perhaps that also points to w uh something

395
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:55.689
that you brought up at the very beginning of

396
00:21:55.699 --> 00:22:00.550
our conversation about how it probably doesn't make much

397
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.180
sense for us to think about physical health and

398
00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:07.869
mental health as two separate things.

399
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.020
Right. Yes, it not that there aren't important distinctions

400
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.819
to be made about the types of processes that

401
00:22:16.829 --> 00:22:19.800
are causing symptoms because it can help you find

402
00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:22.619
the best treatment. But I, I don't think it's

403
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.060
helpful for example, to say that just because some

404
00:22:26.069 --> 00:22:28.780
physical system in the body is involved, then it

405
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.180
must not be a sort of something that could

406
00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:33.609
be helped with psychological therapy. That that bit of

407
00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:36.900
the argument is patently untrue. There are many people

408
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.489
with physical symptoms in the body who've been helped

409
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.290
by psychological therapies.

410
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.770
So getting into another topic, now, how much do

411
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:52.069
our expectations, positive or negative impact our mental health?

412
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.709
So I talk about expectations as a kind of

413
00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:59.199
key ingredient, a key constituent of where our mental

414
00:22:59.209 --> 00:23:01.439
health comes from. And maybe I would even go

415
00:23:01.449 --> 00:23:03.920
a little bit further now and say that in

416
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.079
some senses, I think they define our mental health.

417
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.839
So our expectations in the broadest sense, often unconscious

418
00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:14.469
beliefs about the state of the world and our

419
00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:19.130
own situation in the world. That really is the

420
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.319
closest we can get to what mental health means

421
00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:24.000
from a brain perspective.

422
00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:30.119
And what is the difference between emotions and moods?

423
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.479
And why does that matter for mental health?

424
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:37.790
So some scientists have drawn a line between emotions

425
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.709
and moods for a few reasons because emotions can

426
00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:44.969
come and go relatively quickly, might be more subject

427
00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:50.560
to certain kinds of interventions and also might not

428
00:23:50.569 --> 00:23:54.170
in and of themselves be pathological. So we all

429
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.540
feel sadness, fear, disgust, these are very normal things,

430
00:23:58.739 --> 00:24:03.290
not things to treat necessarily, but a mood state,

431
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.829
for example, a long term state of low mood,

432
00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:10.959
which can be major, depression is a very significant

433
00:24:10.969 --> 00:24:13.420
change in how someone sees the world. It is

434
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.500
an immediate effect on someone's mental health. Um And

435
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:22.130
you know, probably should be studied and also treated

436
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.290
slightly differently than emotions as kind of normal human

437
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.410
experiences.

438
00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.050
Another thing that you talk about in the book

439
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.010
and I guess also plays a very important role

440
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.430
in mental health is motivation. So what do we

441
00:24:36.439 --> 00:24:41.219
know about how motivation works from a neuroscientific perspective

442
00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:45.459
and what is its role in mental health actually?

443
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.569
So we know quite a lot about it. And

444
00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:50.670
the reason for that is because unlike pleasure, it's

445
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.280
pretty easy to study motivation in animals. And I

446
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.675
actually think motivation is an and neglected aspect of

447
00:24:58.685 --> 00:25:02.454
mental health because people take it for granted. People

448
00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:07.104
might think more immediately about things like pleasure, but

449
00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:09.905
motivation might be sort of lower down on their

450
00:25:09.915 --> 00:25:12.535
list. Despite the fact that I would argue, it's

451
00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:17.594
actually even more fundamental, you cannot experience anything pleasurable

452
00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:19.564
unless you have the sort of motivation to get

453
00:25:19.574 --> 00:25:23.185
there. You can't ever adjust your expectations unless you

454
00:25:23.194 --> 00:25:27.069
have the drive to experience new things that might

455
00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:30.469
adjust your expectations. So I think motivation is a

456
00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:34.760
really crucial component and we do have a relatively

457
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.829
good understanding of how it works from a neural

458
00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:42.459
perspective. Um From a cognitive perspective, we also have

459
00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:46.250
um computational models to describe motivation. So this is

460
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.160
a kind of very uh full field from multiple

461
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.229
domains and also not just relevant to mental health.

462
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.765
So these very that we know affect motivation, things

463
00:25:56.775 --> 00:26:00.295
like the dopamine system areas in the brain involved

464
00:26:00.305 --> 00:26:04.905
in drive in wanting things. These are altered, not

465
00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:08.185
just in some psychiatric disorders like depression, but also

466
00:26:08.194 --> 00:26:11.775
in some neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. So in

467
00:26:11.785 --> 00:26:16.625
fact, there are sometimes these common motivational syndromes um

468
00:26:16.635 --> 00:26:20.494
that are slightly different but underpinned by similar processes

469
00:26:20.505 --> 00:26:23.214
between Parkinson's disease and depression, for example,

470
00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.410
and you mentioned depression there. And I guess that

471
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.130
probably when it comes to motivation, one of the

472
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.349
hardest things for people who never suffered from depression

473
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:38.180
to understand is how low motivation can be for

474
00:26:38.189 --> 00:26:42.089
depressed people and why it is that sometimes they

475
00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:46.609
actually cannot do anything. I mean, they just can't

476
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.253
really. Yeah, exactly. And this has actually been, this

477
00:26:50.262 --> 00:26:54.343
relates to some ideas about how to treat depression

478
00:26:54.353 --> 00:26:57.123
as well. So um a few weeks ago, there

479
00:26:57.133 --> 00:27:00.343
was a news story everywhere about how effective exercises

480
00:27:00.353 --> 00:27:03.442
as a depression treatment. And you know, generally I

481
00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:05.753
support that exercise works well for many people with

482
00:27:05.762 --> 00:27:08.973
depression, but it should never be regarded as a

483
00:27:08.983 --> 00:27:12.282
panacea in my view, nor should anything. But I'm

484
00:27:12.292 --> 00:27:14.993
going to use exercise as an example here because

485
00:27:15.123 --> 00:27:18.645
there are many people with depression who could never

486
00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:22.316
just on its own, engage with exercise because they

487
00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:27.086
fundamentally are essentially prohibited by their symptoms. So they

488
00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:30.046
would need an addition of a medication or some

489
00:27:30.056 --> 00:27:33.145
other kind of intervention even to consider doing some

490
00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:35.156
exercise. So I think it really is a, a

491
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:38.916
sometimes it's a barrier that is very difficult to

492
00:27:38.926 --> 00:27:41.906
overcome for people with quite severe symptoms.

493
00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:47.319
Uh And you mentioned exercise there. What factors play

494
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:53.170
a role in what strategies techniques, uh habits, activities

495
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.479
work for a particular person when it comes to

496
00:27:56.489 --> 00:27:59.439
dealing with their own mental health. I mean, and

497
00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:03.439
why are individual differences in what works for one

498
00:28:03.449 --> 00:28:06.839
person and but might not work for another?

499
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.810
So I suppose, I think this is the most

500
00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:14.229
important question that we are grappling with in mental

501
00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:17.359
health today, which is we have for a long

502
00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:22.209
time taken a group based approach. What's the best

503
00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:25.599
treatment for depression? What's the best treatment for generalized

504
00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:30.430
anxiety? But that approach whilst it works for some

505
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.814
really doesn't work for many people. There remains a

506
00:28:33.824 --> 00:28:36.984
lot of people who are ineffectively treated by even

507
00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:39.395
our best treatments or who have to try many

508
00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:42.515
treatments until they find one that works. And there

509
00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:44.224
are a few different reasons for that. But I

510
00:28:44.234 --> 00:28:46.635
think the biggest reason for that is that we

511
00:28:46.645 --> 00:28:49.255
don't, if you have a cough, we don't just

512
00:28:49.265 --> 00:28:51.045
give you one thing for a cough. We try

513
00:28:51.055 --> 00:28:53.954
to find out what's causing the cough and then

514
00:28:53.964 --> 00:28:57.540
treat that and that's what we need to begin

515
00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:01.270
to do with different mental health conditions. Find out

516
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:06.540
biologically what mechanisms are causing the depression that you're

517
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.900
in, what mechanisms are causing your state of generalized

518
00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.270
anxiety and then treat those mechanisms. So for example,

519
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.599
if you're someone for whom these motivational circuits that

520
00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:20.140
I've mentioned are profoundly disruptive, there are treatments that

521
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.099
map better onto those than to other circuits in

522
00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:26.155
the brain. But the this is a research problem.

523
00:29:26.165 --> 00:29:29.165
This is not yet something we can do clinically.

524
00:29:29.224 --> 00:29:32.214
And I would say from an individual perspective, the

525
00:29:32.224 --> 00:29:34.925
biggest take home is actually that when something doesn't

526
00:29:34.935 --> 00:29:38.474
work for you, it doesn't mean anything is worse

527
00:29:38.484 --> 00:29:40.795
about you or even worse about the treatment. If

528
00:29:40.805 --> 00:29:42.415
a treatment doesn't work for you, the treatment may

529
00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:44.834
well work for many people. What what it means

530
00:29:44.844 --> 00:29:47.665
is that there hasn't been a correct match between

531
00:29:47.675 --> 00:29:50.604
your problems, the origins of your problems and what

532
00:29:50.614 --> 00:29:51.864
the treatment is changing.

533
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.449
Probably something very important for people to keep in

534
00:29:56.459 --> 00:29:59.630
mind. The fact that if something in terms of

535
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:05.089
psychotherapy medication psychiatry doesn't work for them, it doesn't

536
00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:09.099
mean that it wouldn't work for many other people

537
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.520
and also vice versa, right? I mean, it's not

538
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:17.189
that one size fits all in psychiatry or clinical

539
00:30:17.199 --> 00:30:18.030
psychology.

540
00:30:18.189 --> 00:30:20.729
Right. Yeah, it's one of the, uh, it's one

541
00:30:20.739 --> 00:30:23.655
of the most frustrating things in some specs of

542
00:30:23.665 --> 00:30:28.625
this field where people have a negative experience with

543
00:30:28.635 --> 00:30:31.795
a certain treatment and extrapolate or even say, look,

544
00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:35.064
this treatment only works in X percent of people

545
00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:37.395
or in X percent of cases. So it should,

546
00:30:37.405 --> 00:30:39.885
we shouldn't bother using it. I think it, it

547
00:30:39.895 --> 00:30:42.074
actually is a kind of misunderstanding of what we

548
00:30:42.084 --> 00:30:44.114
need to be doing as a field which is

549
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:47.364
not throwing any treatments that are effective for a

550
00:30:47.375 --> 00:30:50.535
decent number of people out rather better understanding when

551
00:30:50.545 --> 00:30:52.354
to use them who to use them in.

552
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.569
Mhm. Yeah. And perhaps many times what happens is

553
00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:59.520
that people go through several different kinds of uh

554
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.479
psychotherapies, uh medications and nothing seems to work and

555
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:08.619
they get really frustrated and that's also understandable.

556
00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:12.109
Yeah. And to those people, I would say what

557
00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:13.640
we need to be able to do is to

558
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:18.599
offer the widest breadth of treatments possible. So um

559
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:22.489
for example, in the UK, we offer kind of

560
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.219
first line treatments, things like antidepressant drugs, but also

561
00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:29.194
cognitive behavioral therapy. And that work for many people

562
00:31:29.204 --> 00:31:32.145
with depression, but not everyone, for some people in

563
00:31:32.155 --> 00:31:34.564
a few smaller numbers of clinics popping up across

564
00:31:34.574 --> 00:31:36.655
the country, they might have access to other kinds

565
00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:40.734
of treatments like for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation. So

566
00:31:40.744 --> 00:31:43.155
I think what we need to do is make

567
00:31:43.165 --> 00:31:46.194
sure we have on offer different treatments that might

568
00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:47.675
better treat different people.

569
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.319
So, since we're already getting into treatments and interventions,

570
00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:55.739
could you tell us a little bit about placebos

571
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.709
and placebos and why they matter in this context

572
00:31:59.719 --> 00:32:00.900
of mental health?

573
00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:05.650
So, because I think expectations are so central to

574
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.150
mental health, then of course, any treatment that changes

575
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.920
expectations can affect mental health and perhaps one of

576
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.780
the most well known ways to change expectations is

577
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:20.834
via what's the placebo effect. And I talk about

578
00:32:20.844 --> 00:32:25.165
this throughout my book, actually, the importance of placebo

579
00:32:25.175 --> 00:32:27.785
effects in different kinds of treatments. I don't think

580
00:32:27.795 --> 00:32:30.525
they should be as dirty a word as they

581
00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:32.714
are right now like, oh, it was just a

582
00:32:32.724 --> 00:32:36.969
placebo effect. Actually, a placebo effect means a lot

583
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.589
and it means perhaps even more for mental health

584
00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:42.250
symptoms than for other symptoms though it plays a

585
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.630
role in other symptoms. So even drugs that we

586
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.719
know have independent effects. So let's say opioids, which

587
00:32:49.729 --> 00:32:52.104
we've already been talking about, they have an effect

588
00:32:52.114 --> 00:32:55.025
on pain reduction. But if you don't know, you're

589
00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:58.305
receiving an opioid, they have a much smaller effect

590
00:32:58.314 --> 00:33:01.584
on your experience of pain, meaning these drugs that

591
00:33:01.594 --> 00:33:04.005
we know well, that are very reliable, clinically used

592
00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:07.635
everywhere, partially but not entirely depend on the placebo

593
00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:11.250
effect. And so the same is true across a

594
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.260
number of different treatments. And so I think, rather

595
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.010
than sort of saying we need to avoid the

596
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.459
placebo effect, which is true for people in, in

597
00:33:18.469 --> 00:33:21.349
my camp running a trial, let's say, as a,

598
00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:23.579
as a say a patient or even as a

599
00:33:23.589 --> 00:33:26.569
clinician, you might want to think about enhancing the

600
00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:30.579
placebo effect because for an individual person's treatment, that

601
00:33:30.589 --> 00:33:32.849
could be the difference between it working and not

602
00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:35.800
working essentially if they expect it to work.

603
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.760
So now we're going to get uh to go

604
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.560
through some questions that are probably more sensitive. Uh

605
00:33:44.569 --> 00:33:47.699
And it's good that we have, we've already prefaced

606
00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:52.670
this with by saying that if something doesn't work

607
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.219
for someone, it doesn't mean necessarily that there's nothing

608
00:33:57.229 --> 00:34:00.880
out there that uh will uh won't work for

609
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:07.300
them. But talking about antidepressants specifically, um first of

610
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.820
all, uh do they work? And if so how,

611
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.340
because that's a question that many people ask.

612
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.110
Yes, I understand why people are asking this question.

613
00:34:19.438 --> 00:34:22.679
Um Both questions in fact, and I think there

614
00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:24.790
is a clear answer to the first question and

615
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.290
a slightly less clear answer to the second. So

616
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.800
antidepressants do work overall, but that doesn't mean they

617
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.208
work for every single person. It doesn't mean every

618
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.719
single antidepressant works for every single person. And it

619
00:34:36.728 --> 00:34:39.330
doesn't always mean that the side effects outweigh the

620
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.840
benefits for every single person. But I think the

621
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:48.600
most robust data looking across the best studies in,

622
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.989
you know, using the best techniques I think are

623
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.540
pretty definitive that as a whole they work better

624
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.340
than placebo. Nevertheless, I think a very important discussion

625
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:03.699
has emerged around antidepressants because not everybody has a

626
00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:07.199
positive experience with antidepressants. There's some suggestion that in

627
00:35:07.209 --> 00:35:10.689
some cases they might be overused or used for

628
00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:13.659
prolonged periods time when they might not necessarily be

629
00:35:13.669 --> 00:35:17.340
suggested, maybe they're used instead of therapy because therapy

630
00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.189
isn't available. Um SAY for financial reasons. So I

631
00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:23.709
think there's a really important discussion to be had.

632
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:29.040
But I do think there has been a backlash

633
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:35.159
that is specific to psychiatric medication and psychiatric medication

634
00:35:35.169 --> 00:35:39.320
is being held to a different standard compared to

635
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.489
other medical treatments, other effective medical treatments that come

636
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.090
with side effects that don't work for everyone. And

637
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.054
I, I do think much of the debate originates

638
00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:53.405
from essentially a philosophical difference about whether psychiatric symptoms

639
00:35:53.415 --> 00:35:57.655
are indeed biological and then manifests as a debate

640
00:35:57.665 --> 00:36:01.495
about antidepressants, but that's not really in their, in

641
00:36:01.504 --> 00:36:03.395
people's heart of hearts. I think that's not the

642
00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:04.614
real debate that's happening

643
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.129
a and related to that just recently, if I

644
00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:14.479
remember correctly, probably late 2022 early 2023 there was

645
00:36:14.489 --> 00:36:19.320
an article that came out questioning the serotonin theory

646
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.760
of depression. Uh What do you make of that?

647
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.709
Is depression really the result of a chemical deficit

648
00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:30.919
or imbalance in, for example, serotonin or any other

649
00:36:30.929 --> 00:36:33.320
hormone or neurotransmitter?

650
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.310
Yes, great. So that's the kind of second part

651
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.159
of the question do they work? And how do

652
00:36:38.169 --> 00:36:40.719
they work? And I would say this is not

653
00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:44.750
totally tick boxed answered yet. The same is true.

654
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.129
Of course, non mental health treatments as well. Um

655
00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.290
Many drugs have effects. We don't entirely understand but

656
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.129
we know they work. But I think in the

657
00:36:53.139 --> 00:36:56.300
case of antidepressants. So um I don't know if

658
00:36:56.449 --> 00:37:00.139
everybody knows this, but the reason we use antidepressant

659
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:04.250
drugs that affect the serotonin system is because originally

660
00:37:04.735 --> 00:37:07.905
other drugs that affected the serotonin system, but also

661
00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:12.004
dopamine and noradrenaline were found to improve people's mood.

662
00:37:12.014 --> 00:37:16.004
So this is a a serendipitous effect, a coincidence

663
00:37:16.014 --> 00:37:18.804
that happened to work. And then from there, people

664
00:37:18.814 --> 00:37:22.465
sort of back explained why the drugs worked. Oh

665
00:37:22.475 --> 00:37:25.324
OK. Well, they increase these levels of neurotransmitters. There

666
00:37:25.334 --> 00:37:29.520
must therefore be a deficit in these neurotransmitters and

667
00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:32.449
that the evidence is mixed for that. I would

668
00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:35.879
say the, the review that you're referring to, there

669
00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:38.780
are a number of issues with that review. So

670
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.719
I wouldn't take it as definitive evidence against that

671
00:37:42.729 --> 00:37:44.889
hypothesis. But I think there are a number of

672
00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:48.800
papers suggesting complexities with that explanation. So I don't

673
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.669
fully buy a serotonin deficit explanation either. And in

674
00:37:52.679 --> 00:37:54.570
fact, I don't think anybody does, even when I

675
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.479
was an undergraduate, we were taught that wasn't the

676
00:37:56.489 --> 00:38:01.425
full. So I think a more reasonable explanation is

677
00:38:01.435 --> 00:38:03.604
that for some people, there may be differences in

678
00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:06.465
the serotonin system, those might actually often be the

679
00:38:06.475 --> 00:38:10.155
people for whom antidepressants work. But for other people

680
00:38:10.165 --> 00:38:12.814
even people for whom it works. It might not

681
00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:15.794
be something as simplistic as a deficit, but rather

682
00:38:15.804 --> 00:38:19.794
a change in the functioning of regions where serotonin

683
00:38:19.885 --> 00:38:22.415
works, where serotonin does things. And that means that

684
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:26.445
by adjusting serotonin levels, it can improve mood for

685
00:38:26.455 --> 00:38:29.020
those people. So I think one of the most

686
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.540
compelling explanations for the efficacy of antidepressants is kind

687
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.590
of one level above uh a chemical deficit. It's

688
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.620
a cognitive explanation. So if you give someone a

689
00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:44.300
single dose of antidepressants, it doesn't affect their mood.

690
00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:46.439
Um IT usually takes a couple of weeks to

691
00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:49.149
do that, but it does affect their serotonin. So

692
00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:52.790
this is kind of perplexing if you think all

693
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.489
it is is a serotonin deficit and probably why

694
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.689
I think that's not the case. Um INSTEAD a

695
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.149
single dose of antidepressants or a series of shorter

696
00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:06.270
term doses over a few days can cause immediate

697
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.534
changes in someone's interpretation of a emotional stimuli. This

698
00:39:10.544 --> 00:39:12.385
would be like if you're looking at a face

699
00:39:12.395 --> 00:39:15.824
is that face angry or neutral or happy. And

700
00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:18.985
it sounds simplistic. But in fact, these decisions, this

701
00:39:18.995 --> 00:39:22.195
information processing is what we do all day every

702
00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:27.064
day. We interpret noisy ambiguous situations in the world

703
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:32.610
as phd, positive, negative or neutral. And these micro

704
00:39:32.689 --> 00:39:37.120
interpretations can then build up into our overall expectations

705
00:39:37.129 --> 00:39:40.360
about the world, our mood. And so I think

706
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:45.080
these micro changes that antidepressants enact and this is

707
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.274
work that was sort of very beautifully demonstrated by

708
00:39:48.284 --> 00:39:50.995
two professors at Oxford, Katherine Harmer and Phil Cowan

709
00:39:51.004 --> 00:39:54.465
and their teams. I think those micro changes are

710
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:58.375
the reason why antidepressants work for many people is

711
00:39:58.385 --> 00:40:02.344
by changing information processing in the world, emotion processing

712
00:40:02.435 --> 00:40:03.014
in the world.

713
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.340
And what about psychedelics? What can we say about

714
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.000
them at this point in time? Because actually, uh

715
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:16.699
this uh this at least to some extent, um

716
00:40:16.709 --> 00:40:18.969
I guess we should be even more careful about

717
00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:23.229
them because even outside of the medical field, there

718
00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:26.270
are ways by which people can, for example, get

719
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:31.399
access to some mushrooms nowaday and nowadays and microdose

720
00:40:31.409 --> 00:40:35.399
or something like that. So what does the literature

721
00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:38.949
at this point say about psychedelics and their potential

722
00:40:38.959 --> 00:40:41.389
benefits for mental health?

723
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:45.370
So for a long time work on psychedelic drugs

724
00:40:45.379 --> 00:40:49.409
was suppressed in the mid 20th century, psychedelic drugs

725
00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:52.719
seemed like a potentially promising treatment for mental health

726
00:40:52.729 --> 00:40:57.050
conditions. But then for other reasons, governments essentially suppressed

727
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.399
use and also research into these drugs. And that

728
00:41:00.409 --> 00:41:04.139
was undoubtedly a bad thing. I think overall a

729
00:41:04.149 --> 00:41:06.560
suppression of research into a new class of drugs

730
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.290
is always unh if that drug has potential, has

731
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.260
kind of clinical potential, which I would say psychedelics

732
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.919
do. But as to the kind of direction and

733
00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:18.389
strength of that clinical potential, I think we're still

734
00:41:18.399 --> 00:41:20.060
working it out and there are a few reasons

735
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:25.340
why it's difficult. So one reason is because of

736
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:29.550
the level of excitement and hype for psychedelics, sometimes

737
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.610
hype is a good thing and, you know, obviously

738
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.399
suppression is a bad thing. But, but hype is

739
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:39.040
itself a challenge because it means that weak data

740
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.050
that confirms the hype can get publicized and picked

741
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.370
up and, you know, people are, are excited about

742
00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:47.649
it and strong data that goes against it can

743
00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:50.709
get dismissed and thought. Oh, well, you know, maybe

744
00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:52.969
not that study because they didn't quite do this

745
00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:55.129
or that. So there's a kind of different standard

746
00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:58.600
of evidence applied based on whether it confirms people's

747
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.810
enthusiasm. Um WHEREAS I guess my feelings on psychedelics

748
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.030
is that they absolutely show some clinical potential, but

749
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.939
they need, um we need to evaluate them as

750
00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:11.510
a, as a society, but also as scientists with

751
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.139
precisely the same standards as we would use for

752
00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:18.659
a new another class of new antidepressant. So sometimes

753
00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.800
the very same people who are skeptical about antidepressant

754
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.469
drugs and their efficacy are enthusiastic about psychedelics, which

755
00:42:25.479 --> 00:42:28.925
is really to me because I think we need

756
00:42:28.935 --> 00:42:32.245
to be cautious about side effects and when to

757
00:42:32.254 --> 00:42:35.544
use antidepressants. And so too, we need to be

758
00:42:35.554 --> 00:42:39.024
about psychedelic drugs. So some of the most exciting

759
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:42.645
evidence for psychedelic drugs um for example, in in

760
00:42:42.655 --> 00:42:46.254
treating depression shows effectiveness of even a single session

761
00:42:46.264 --> 00:42:50.215
of psychedelic drugs on people's longer term mood life

762
00:42:50.225 --> 00:42:53.544
satisfaction, all those variables that we were talking about.

763
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.520
But we really need a better understanding of where

764
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.860
side effects come from, which people they should be

765
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.679
used in and how they work to fully kind

766
00:43:02.689 --> 00:43:07.360
of realize their, their potential. Um, LIKE everything else.

767
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.489
I don't think they're panacea, but I do think

768
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.209
they are a really interesting area for research. And

769
00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:16.199
I have been quite excited. Um, AND in fact,

770
00:43:16.209 --> 00:43:19.100
I'm, I'm interested in running studies uh, in that

771
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.379
area in my lab as well. And I, I

772
00:43:21.389 --> 00:43:24.699
don't, by the way, think that they're useless either.

773
00:43:24.709 --> 00:43:27.540
I think they're absolutely. So I'm a, I'm um

774
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:31.590
I'm advocating for good psychedelic research. Um Not none

775
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:31.899
at all.

776
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:38.800
So another very sensitive question now does psychotherapy work

777
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.459
and what are the ways by which we can

778
00:43:42.469 --> 00:43:45.840
tell whether it works or not?

779
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:52.750
Um So psychotherapy is an effective treatment for depression,

780
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.270
but it depends which kind of psychotherapy. So it's

781
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.209
a bit like saying medication can treat depression. Well,

782
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:02.469
that's true. But which medication and like medication, psychotherapy

783
00:44:02.649 --> 00:44:05.929
has biological effects on the brain. And in fact,

784
00:44:05.939 --> 00:44:10.530
the body and so those effects relate to who

785
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.919
might or might not respond um to the intervention.

786
00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:17.110
So something like cognitive behavioral therapy, for example, is

787
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.479
about as effective as antidepressant drugs for depression, meaning

788
00:44:20.489 --> 00:44:23.540
50 to 60% of people will see a response

789
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.239
after a course of C BT. But that means

790
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.479
it doesn't work for everyone. It doesn't work perfectly,

791
00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:31.510
it might work, but it is insufficient to fully

792
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.419
treat depression. Um I think one of the most

793
00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:37.879
exciting sort of future avenues is actually marrying the

794
00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:41.219
treatments we traditionally think of as biological like drugs,

795
00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:45.280
brain stimulation with psychological therapy. And I think psychedelics

796
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.229
may hold particular potential for that. So thinking of

797
00:44:49.239 --> 00:44:51.689
them not as stand alone treatments, the way we

798
00:44:51.699 --> 00:44:55.270
might think of antidepressants, but as augmentative treatments, treatments

799
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.689
that can enhance specific things happening during a a

800
00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:00.399
psychotherapy session.

801
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:07.310
So something that sometimes we hear from people that

802
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.909
bring it to the table as a criticism of

803
00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:15.510
psychotherapy, people who question its efficacy um is that

804
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:22.030
they sometimes cite studies which apparently indicate that many

805
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.659
or or psychotherapy works as well as many other

806
00:45:26.669 --> 00:45:29.959
common activities like I don't know, talking to a

807
00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:34.560
friend, going to the church, talking to the priest,

808
00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.540
something like that. So uh what would would be

809
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.949
your reply to that?

810
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.570
So good psychotherapy trials will always compare the treatment

811
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.219
of interest, say cognitive behavioral therapy with an active

812
00:45:49.229 --> 00:45:53.060
intervention, which would be usually something like psychoeducation, which

813
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.600
means you sit with the therapist and you sort

814
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.340
of get educated on different psychological factors. So it's

815
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.120
not intervening in them the way that something like

816
00:46:01.129 --> 00:46:03.939
cognitive behavioral therapy is, but it is giving you

817
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.510
something the contact, the support. So those are the

818
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.719
trials that I look for to see if therapy

819
00:46:10.729 --> 00:46:13.810
is effective and they are harder to do. And

820
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.989
rarer than the other type of trials that maybe

821
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.189
compare it with nothing or sitting on a wait

822
00:46:18.199 --> 00:46:20.500
list, which can sometimes be worse for mental health

823
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.389
than doing nothing. So I agree with the kind

824
00:46:23.399 --> 00:46:28.030
of challenges of running psychotherapy trials. But um but

825
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.179
I would argue that having a good control group

826
00:46:30.189 --> 00:46:32.399
can make up for that and and it does

827
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:35.639
in many cases um of psychological therapy. So there

828
00:46:35.649 --> 00:46:39.370
are some types of therapy, for example, exposure therapy

829
00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:43.139
that are just extremely effective for particular conditions. Like

830
00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:46.419
say you have a phobia exposure therapy is very

831
00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:49.550
effective for that for that condition much more so

832
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.199
than talking to a friend would be. Um I

833
00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:54.320
would also say that it's not a problem that's

834
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.429
unique to psychotherapy. So um psychedelics also have a

835
00:46:58.439 --> 00:47:03.520
problem with the placebo effect. Um BECAUSE so like

836
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.120
psychotherapy expectations play a big role in your response.

837
00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:10.850
Um And even there's a great paper called tripping

838
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.050
on nothing where people had um psychedelic like responses

839
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.010
to being told they were taking a new psychedelic

840
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.729
that was actually a placebo pill. So um psychotherapy

841
00:47:20.739 --> 00:47:22.780
studies, I would like to see an active intervention

842
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:26.709
like psychoeducation. Um AND also psychedelic studies, I would

843
00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.479
like to see an active control group, maybe something

844
00:47:29.489 --> 00:47:31.250
that also makes people feel a bit high.

845
00:47:32.719 --> 00:47:36.840
So just to cover another set of uh treatment

846
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.939
slash interventions, um what can we tell about electrical

847
00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:45.459
stimulation and deep brain stimulation at this point?

848
00:47:46.389 --> 00:47:48.110
So my lab has done a lot of work

849
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.689
on electrical brain stimulation and this can mean a

850
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:53.739
big variety of different things. So I want to

851
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.889
kind of draw some of the, the clarifications before

852
00:47:56.979 --> 00:47:59.600
I answer your question. Historically, people might have heard

853
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:04.679
of something like electroconvulsive therapy, um which has, you

854
00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:10.110
know, very negative societal connotations. It's still used today

855
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:14.070
in patients with very severe depression. And in fact,

856
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.729
it is the most effective medical intervention for very

857
00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:21.149
severe depression where people haven't responded to anything else.

858
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:23.870
So I think, you know, there's, there's even room

859
00:48:23.879 --> 00:48:28.270
for something at the more um interventionist side of

860
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.709
electrical stimulation for some patients. There's a lot of

861
00:48:31.719 --> 00:48:34.229
controversy about it um which I'm happy to get

862
00:48:34.239 --> 00:48:36.669
into. Uh BUT I think there is a role.

863
00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:39.110
Um BUT I think for a much larger number

864
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.110
of patients, different types of milder brain stimulation can

865
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.469
be effective. So for example, something called repetitive transcranial

866
00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:52.169
magnetic stimulation or RT MS is an effective treatment

867
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:54.679
for depression. You get several sessions in a row

868
00:48:55.719 --> 00:48:58.139
pace than something like therapy where you're getting it

869
00:48:58.149 --> 00:49:00.270
once a week. This you're often getting sort of

870
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.080
five days in a row for a couple of

871
00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.760
weeks and then, then it can sustain for a

872
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.739
period of time after that often months. So um

873
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.750
or sometimes longer. So I would say there is

874
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.189
room for other kinds of brain stimulation approaches and

875
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:18.270
to be applied even in more mild to moderate

876
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.860
cases of depression, especially people who don't respond to

877
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:21.870
drugs or therapy.

878
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.320
Uh BY the way, just out of curiosity you

879
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.629
mentioned briefly there that are some controversies associated with

880
00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:32.810
the electrical stimulation. Could you tell us a little

881
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.550
bit about that?

882
00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:36.780
Yeah. So I think some of this controversy emerges

883
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:40.320
because the technique itself has changed over the years.

884
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.159
So that's kind of fair enough. Some of it

885
00:49:42.169 --> 00:49:46.360
has emerged because especially, you know, many decades ago

886
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.510
people received it without their consent or full knowledge

887
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.459
of what would happen. So that's obviously a kind

888
00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:55.570
of unethical approach. But I also think sometimes the

889
00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.916
controversies emerge because of just genuine complexities of the

890
00:50:00.926 --> 00:50:04.045
treatment and the condition. So I'll give you, you

891
00:50:04.055 --> 00:50:07.976
know, 11 example, for example is that people um

892
00:50:07.996 --> 00:50:11.016
uh worried about CT say that there might be

893
00:50:11.025 --> 00:50:14.295
brain damage that can occur from CT and, and

894
00:50:14.305 --> 00:50:17.696
actually, there is no robust evidence to suggest that's

895
00:50:17.706 --> 00:50:21.095
the case, there's even animal studies to, to um

896
00:50:21.355 --> 00:50:25.931
suggest brain growth that happens after T. So I

897
00:50:25.941 --> 00:50:29.842
I am very skeptical of those claims, I'm not

898
00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:33.241
so skeptical of claims of memory disruption after CT,

899
00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:38.332
that seems to be a more robustly reported phenomenon,

900
00:50:38.552 --> 00:50:41.912
but in the vast majority of cases in, in

901
00:50:41.922 --> 00:50:44.501
studies that seems to disappear. So it seems to

902
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:47.290
be a kind of short term. And the problem

903
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.669
with those claims is that people with depression have

904
00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:53.209
memory problems, so it's very difficult to control, you

905
00:50:53.219 --> 00:50:56.850
know, have a sort of placebo T group um

906
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.449
to control for it. So I think that there's

907
00:50:59.459 --> 00:51:03.770
actually still some uncertainty um about that particular side

908
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.620
effect. But in both cases, of course, I have

909
00:51:06.629 --> 00:51:10.469
immense sympathy for anyone who's had a treatment and

910
00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:13.909
feels even subjectively that it's had a really negative

911
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.070
consequence on their mental cognitive, physical health. And that's

912
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.060
the case across interventions. But for CT as well.

913
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:24.655
Mhm. So, I have one last topic here. I

914
00:51:24.665 --> 00:51:27.304
would like to ask you about, we've been talking

915
00:51:27.314 --> 00:51:30.544
here a lot about treatments and interventions or medical

916
00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:33.705
treatments. So, is there anything we can do for

917
00:51:33.715 --> 00:51:37.225
our mental health ourselves? I mean, is there some

918
00:51:37.235 --> 00:51:40.544
sort of mentally healthy lifestyle?

919
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.540
I think that's the question everyone would really like

920
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:46.000
to know the answer to. And so that was

921
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.110
why I, I made sure, you know, I wanted

922
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.389
to write a book that wasn't just about medical

923
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:54.780
interventions, but also about lifestyle interventions and whether they

924
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.959
really do or don't matter. And my short answer

925
00:51:57.969 --> 00:52:00.659
is yes, I do think that there are many

926
00:52:00.669 --> 00:52:03.250
things you can do to improve your mental health

927
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.810
in terms of an individual in their lifestyle. But

928
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.469
often those things are a little bit annoying because

929
00:52:08.479 --> 00:52:11.010
there are things that improve your physical health and

930
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.260
then have knock on effects on your mental health.

931
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:17.260
So exercise is actually a great example and exercise.

932
00:52:17.459 --> 00:52:21.239
Yes, epidemiological evidence like with inflammation in the microbiome,

933
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.889
but also causal evidence, really good trials that show

934
00:52:25.899 --> 00:52:29.949
that giving someone an exercise intervention seems to decrease

935
00:52:29.959 --> 00:52:32.320
symptoms of depression and there are a lot of

936
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.919
sort of interesting mechanisms why that might be things

937
00:52:34.929 --> 00:52:37.419
that changes in the brain, it might affect motivation,

938
00:52:37.429 --> 00:52:41.610
it might affect different aspects of neuroplasticity. Um REALLY

939
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:45.860
uh rich, rich new field there. But I would

940
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:48.750
say that's a great example of a lifestyle intervention.

941
00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:52.050
Dietary interventions are a little bit less clear. I

942
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.580
think there is evidence to suggest that if you

943
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.510
have particular dietary deficits say that you have anemia,

944
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.469
it may well have mental health consequences for you.

945
00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:04.459
So it's very important not to have things like

946
00:53:04.469 --> 00:53:08.155
that. But whether having more of certain things in

947
00:53:08.165 --> 00:53:10.735
your diet will help your mental health. I think

948
00:53:10.745 --> 00:53:13.915
we're actually still a little bit more ambiguous about

949
00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:15.945
that, but there could still be these kind of

950
00:53:15.955 --> 00:53:20.764
secondary effects via healthier um you know, cardiovascular system

951
00:53:20.774 --> 00:53:23.675
or digestive system that then could impact mental health.

952
00:53:23.685 --> 00:53:26.044
So I, you know, I feel positively about them

953
00:53:26.054 --> 00:53:27.665
even if I don't think it's always a direct

954
00:53:27.675 --> 00:53:28.314
connection.

955
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.479
So uh and related to that, and this will

956
00:53:31.489 --> 00:53:35.399
be my last question. Is there a risk of

957
00:53:35.409 --> 00:53:40.699
people becoming too obsessed with healthy lifestyles or with

958
00:53:40.709 --> 00:53:44.179
particular kinds of lifestyles that are marketed and the

959
00:53:44.189 --> 00:53:47.919
marketed here is very important as healthy. I mean,

960
00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:52.080
sometimes we see on social media or hear about

961
00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:58.320
some uh sketchy interventions out there that are really

962
00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:02.860
pseudoscience. So, is there a risk there of becoming

963
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.659
obsessed with that kind of thing?

964
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.770
Yeah, I I absolutely think there is, I mean,

965
00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.600
I guess you can tell from this whole interview

966
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:11.280
that I'm a little bit of a skeptic on

967
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.340
many of the, um, and many of the most

968
00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.739
trendy things in mental health. And not that I

969
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.639
don't think there's sort of interesting science there, but

970
00:54:18.649 --> 00:54:21.370
I, I wouldn't necessarily advise everyone to go and

971
00:54:21.379 --> 00:54:24.350
take them up myself. And I think that kind

972
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.090
of, that idea that you could maybe have an

973
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.613
influencer suggest that if you just do one thing,

974
00:54:30.623 --> 00:54:32.583
it's going to absolutely change your mental health for

975
00:54:32.593 --> 00:54:35.173
the better. Yeah. It, it could be innocuous, it

976
00:54:35.183 --> 00:54:37.353
could be dangerous. This is exactly the sort of

977
00:54:37.363 --> 00:54:40.202
thing that can lead to, um, eating disorders, like

978
00:54:40.212 --> 00:54:44.613
orthorexia people being extremely, extremely particular in what they

979
00:54:44.623 --> 00:54:47.752
eat because of belief that certain foods are bad

980
00:54:47.762 --> 00:54:50.462
for them and that can be really destructive for

981
00:54:50.472 --> 00:54:53.222
your mental health. Even something like exercise taken to

982
00:54:53.232 --> 00:54:55.085
a extreme can be bad for your mental health.

983
00:54:55.095 --> 00:54:57.055
If you look one of them, one of my

984
00:54:57.065 --> 00:54:59.275
favorite studies that I talk about in the book

985
00:54:59.285 --> 00:55:03.275
shows this great positive relationship between amount of exercise

986
00:55:03.285 --> 00:55:05.446
and mental health. Up to a point. If you're

987
00:55:05.456 --> 00:55:07.815
exercising more than about four times a week, it's

988
00:55:07.825 --> 00:55:09.906
actually worse for your mental health to do more

989
00:55:09.916 --> 00:55:11.406
and nobody knows why there might be a kind

990
00:55:11.416 --> 00:55:14.516
of complex non causal relationship there. But still, I

991
00:55:14.525 --> 00:55:17.885
wouldn't run around saying the more the better. Um,

992
00:55:17.895 --> 00:55:20.625
YET, and And so I guess I feel in

993
00:55:20.635 --> 00:55:24.800
general that there is a really important message here

994
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:29.709
about moderation, even moderation on the things that are

995
00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:34.459
themselves moderate. So not too much austerity either. Um,

996
00:55:34.469 --> 00:55:37.659
BECAUSE I think that we run the risk of

997
00:55:37.669 --> 00:55:41.659
kind of becoming so invested in these things that

998
00:55:41.669 --> 00:55:45.389
might make a tiny difference. But the fact of

999
00:55:45.399 --> 00:55:48.080
engaging with them might make a bigger difference to

1000
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.260
our mental health negatively in that case.

1001
00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.520
Yeah, I, I guess that recently I've had a

1002
00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:57.080
conversation with an anthropologist and we talked about, I

1003
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.409
mean, this might not seem related at all, but

1004
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.649
at least to some extent there is we talked

1005
00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.870
about the evolution of bipedalism in humans. And uh

1006
00:56:05.879 --> 00:56:11.389
we in our industrialized or post industrial societies usually

1007
00:56:11.429 --> 00:56:16.719
under use our bodies. But then uh anthropologists also

1008
00:56:16.729 --> 00:56:19.169
point to the fact that, hey, OK, that's true.

1009
00:56:19.179 --> 00:56:24.175
But in traditional societies, perhaps people overuse their bodies

1010
00:56:24.185 --> 00:56:27.985
or misuse their bodies. So perhaps in a way,

1011
00:56:27.995 --> 00:56:32.385
uh that's the idea related here to uh how

1012
00:56:32.395 --> 00:56:35.764
we should deal with some of these treatments or

1013
00:56:35.774 --> 00:56:38.264
habits or activities. I mean, it has to be

1014
00:56:38.274 --> 00:56:39.705
in moderation,

1015
00:56:39.955 --> 00:56:42.550
right? Yeah, I absolutely agree.

1016
00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:47.040
Great. So the book is again The Balanced Brain,

1017
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.889
the Science of mental health. And I'm leaving a

1018
00:56:49.899 --> 00:56:51.939
link to it in the description box of the

1019
00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:54.919
interview and doctor, no, apart from the book, would

1020
00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:57.169
you like to tell people where they can find

1021
00:56:57.179 --> 00:56:59.120
you and your work? On the internet.

1022
00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:02.760
Yeah, you're more than welcome to get in touch

1023
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:06.360
with me on Twitter uh X at Camilla. Nor

1024
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.270
um and you can look at my lab website,

1025
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.260
nord.co.uk if you're interested in being in any of

1026
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.429
our studies or just reading about the kinds of

00:57:14.439 --> 00:57:15.239
work that we're doing.

1028
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.909
Great. So I'm also adding that to the description
