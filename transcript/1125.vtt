00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.760
the Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez,

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.640
and today I'm joined by Doctor Daniel Fessler. He

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.119
is professor of biological anthropology at the University of

5
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.229
California, Los Angeles. And today, we're talking about topics

6
00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:22.159
like physical formidability, male muscularity, moral parochialism, and moral

7
00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.959
condemnation. Discussed an ideology and some other related topics.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.409
So Doctor Fessler, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.409
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.590
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

11
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.180
So, let's start with the topic of physical formidability.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.979
Uh, TO start off with what is physical formidability

13
00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.990
and how do you study it?

14
00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:48.500
So, uh, all we mean by physical formidability is,

15
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.520
um, uh, which of two individuals would win a

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.380
fight, um, when the only factors. Involve their physical

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.889
aspects. So across many, many species, the principal determinant

18
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.339
of this kind of winning feature is simply physical

19
00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.470
size. Big animals win fights with small animals, um,

20
00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.529
and of course we're talking about fights within a

21
00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:20.089
species rather than predation events or such. And the

22
00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:25.360
second is strength, um, and, uh, strength is evident

23
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.230
in the physical features of an individual, um, in

24
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.610
a variety of ways, uh, in different species and

25
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.430
humans, of course, um, in addition to physical size,

26
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.769
uh, muscularity is a principal determinant of that. But

27
00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:42.319
importantly, um, Uh, when we study physical formidability, we're

28
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.430
not actually studying who would win a fight based

29
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.440
on those physical characteristics. Uh, INSTEAD, um, our reasoning,

30
00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:52.720
and this is work done with uh Professor Colin

31
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.879
Holbrook at uh University of California, Merced and quite

32
00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.720
a number of other colleagues, um, uh, our reasoning

33
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.610
is as follows, um. Any organism that has minimal

34
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.380
social cognition abilities, the ability to assess other members

35
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.539
of its species, should be able to gauge in

36
00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.580
advance what its odds are of winning a conflict,

37
00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:21.330
a physical conflict with a conspecific. So, um, you

38
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
know, if two crabs come together and they're having

39
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.210
a fight, they may wave their claws at each

40
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.059
other as an indication of, um, what their respective

41
00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.250
fighting capacities are, and, and often those fights don't

42
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.809
occur because the individual who assesses themselves is likely

43
00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.210
to lose will back off, right? And um both

44
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.449
individuals are benefited by the ability to assess the

45
00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.130
probability of winning or losing. When we study physical

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.330
formidability, we're not actually interested at all in the

47
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.529
physical features of individuals. Instead, we reason that the

48
00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.410
ability to make those kinds of judgments to determine

49
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.610
what one's odds of winning a conflict are, must

50
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.899
be an evolutionarily ancient feature of social cognition, right?

51
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.449
And as a consequence, there must be representations in

52
00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:14.509
the mind. That allow individuals to store an assessment

53
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.710
of who's likely to win. And because size and

54
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.509
strength are evolutionarily ancient dimensions of the determinant of

55
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.110
who's going to win, we theorize that those are

56
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.089
the dimensions that that representation takes. So, as a

57
00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:38.850
consequence, um, in, you know, human social cognition, when

58
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.529
individuals are assessing one another's formidability, they're using a

59
00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.970
representation of size and strength, even though those may

60
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.889
not actually be the things that determine who wins

61
00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.889
a conflict. The person who has a gun wins

62
00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.289
against the person who doesn't, um, irrespective of how

63
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.570
large um or muscular either party is. But we've

64
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.410
been able to show that. It is those dimensions,

65
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:04.690
size and strength, that represent an assessment of all

66
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.570
of the factors that lead to um uh uh

67
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.929
who is likely to win a conflict.

68
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.979
Uh, AND what kinds of cues do people pay

69
00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.809
attention to when assessing physical formidability?

70
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.299
Well, as I said, um, although other many other

71
00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:28.839
scholars have studied things like how Actual physical fighting

72
00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.959
capacity is gauged, you know, how people gauge muscularity

73
00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.670
or levels of of male hormones and so on.

74
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.910
That's not actually what we're studying. Instead, we're studying

75
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:44.510
the cognition that uses that representation. So, any Any

76
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.380
tactical asset or liability is summarized with a representation

77
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.589
in the mind. You can think of it as

78
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.510
a little picture in the mind, the mind's eye

79
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.359
image of um. Of who is likely to win

80
00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.899
the fight. So, uh, our very first experiment, um,

81
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.670
uh, Professor Holbrook's in mind, um, just looked at,

82
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.350
if you see hands holding objects, some of which

83
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.510
are weapons and some of which are not, um,

84
00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.040
and you're asked to gauge how big do you

85
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880
think the person attached to that hand is. If

86
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.920
the object is a weapon, people think that the

87
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.399
person is bigger. Now, of course, that that that.

88
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.459
You know, empirically, there is no correlation, and in

89
00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:25.299
fact, we tested this just to make sure. There's

90
00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:27.459
no corre it's not that gun owners are larger

91
00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.459
than non-gun owners or anything like that, right? So

92
00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.380
why do people think someone is bigger if they're

93
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.859
holding a gun? The answer is because it is

94
00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:37.839
those dimensions of size and strength that people use

95
00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.380
when they summarize all of the tactical assets and

96
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.899
liabilities. So having a gun is a huge tactical

97
00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.140
asset, right? If someone has a gun, they just

98
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.500
seem larger in our imagination.

99
00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.769
And does the presence of comrades decrease the perceived

100
00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.649
physical formidability of opponents or not?

101
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.329
Yes, yes, absolutely. So the way that we gauge

102
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.609
um these, you know, assessments is by presenting people

103
00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:12.010
with stimuli, sometimes scenarios, sometimes vignettes, um, uh, other

104
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.970
times just images like photographs of hands holding objects,

105
00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.760
right? Um, AND we asked them to assess how

106
00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:22.010
big and muscular they think the other person is,

107
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:25.010
a potential antagonist, right? We did a series of

108
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.730
experiments where um we stopped, uh, passersby on the

109
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.410
street and um asked them to gauge a potential

110
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.880
antagonist. In this case, it was a uh uh

111
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.559
uh an individual who was incarcerated on terrorism charges,

112
00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.779
um. Very threatening looking person to the average American,

113
00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:46.829
um, uh, and, um, uh, when told, you know,

114
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.230
this is a terrorist, um, and what we found

115
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.859
is if we Stop, uh, a young man who's

116
00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:58.779
walking in a group of men. And if we

117
00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.380
ask that individual to step away from his friends,

118
00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:05.380
isolate him at a physical distance behind a visual

119
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.880
barrier where he cannot see his friends, and ask

120
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.010
him to gauge how big and strong that terrorist

121
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.170
is, OK. And we compare that to the same

122
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.040
assessments made by an individual who's allowed to stand

123
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.700
near his friends while walking down the street. What

124
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.570
we find is that the individual who is isolated

125
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.940
from his friends, assesses the potential antagonist as physically

126
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.649
larger and stronger than the individual who is near

127
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:35.700
his friends. And presumably this is because, um, not

128
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.859
only in the contemporary world, but, you know, uh

129
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.859
long before our species, having the presence of allies.

130
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.820
WAS a pri principal tactical asset. So when individuals

131
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.109
know that they have backing, as it were, they

132
00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:50.940
see a potential antagonist as less threatening, and as

133
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.420
a consequence, as less large and muscular.

134
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.049
And this physical formidability also assessed in women and

135
00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:00.750
if so,

136
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:06.970
how? Again, um, we're not talking about asking how

137
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.609
large and strong a woman actually is. Instead, we're

138
00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:14.720
talking about asking, is the same representational system used

139
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.839
in assessing women that is used in assessing men.

140
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.040
Now, we don't have a, a, an enormous amount

141
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.350
of um of data on this because we really

142
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.670
only ran um, one set of studies targeting specifically

143
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:28.839
women in this regard, but the answer is yes.

144
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.804
And that's really not. Surprising because uh we think

145
00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:36.594
this cognitive representational system long predates humans, right? And,

146
00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:39.885
and, and, and females have conflicts with females, women

147
00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.405
have conflict with women. Um, THERE'S no reason to

148
00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:44.994
think that the that the, the mind's eye image,

149
00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:47.205
as it were, would be any different on the

150
00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:49.405
basis of the, the sex of the individual. And,

151
00:08:49.494 --> 00:08:51.044
and, you know, as I said, we don't have

152
00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:53.205
extensive evidence, but what evidence we have says yes,

153
00:08:53.244 --> 00:08:54.125
that's absolutely true.

154
00:08:55.109 --> 00:09:00.030
There's something like nonviolent physical risk taking play a

155
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.900
role here.

156
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.070
It does, it does. So, um, uh, there is

157
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.869
extensive evidence both within um societies of the global

158
00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:13.049
north and, and, um, uh, certainly plenty of ethnographic

159
00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:16.190
evidence and some quantitative evidence from societies outside the

160
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.869
global North that men take more risks with their

161
00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:25.440
uh their physical well-being. Um. Voluntary risks, um, including

162
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.570
in nonviolent contests, right? Or, or, or, or contexts,

163
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.960
both contests and contexts. Um, uh, SOME of these

164
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.239
are recreational activities, right? So, um, choose a dangerous

165
00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:40.919
sport. Um, uh, MEN are more likely to engage

166
00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:43.390
in that than women are. Um, WE see this

167
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.330
in, you know, um, uh, initiation rituals in small

168
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.119
scale societies where, where, where men's rituals are often

169
00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:52.390
much more, um, uh, physically demanding and risky than

170
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.320
than women's are and so on, right? And we

171
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.880
see an an age distribution where young men are

172
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.760
more likely to um uh to take these risks,

173
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.729
these voluntary. Risks with their physical well-being outside of

174
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.409
violent contexts than um than older men are or

175
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.289
than women are and so on, right? And this

176
00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:13.280
is represented in, you know, things like motorcycle ownership

177
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.690
or emergency room admissions for, you know, accidental injuries,

178
00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:19.150
right? Um. You know, uh, here in the United

179
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.830
States, if you, if you buy a ladder at

180
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.830
a hardware store, there's a, there's a sticker on

181
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.859
the top step of the ladder saying this is

182
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.780
not a step. Don't stand here, right? And yet

183
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:31.190
young men fall off ladders much more than than

184
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.789
other demographics do. OK. So, so there's, you know,

185
00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.549
there's just abundant evidence that, um, uh, that men

186
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:39.830
take more risks with their physical well-being than women

187
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.234
do, and uh that young. MEN take more than

188
00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:44.955
older men do. Now, um, uh, quite a number

189
00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:48.945
of years ago, the, the, the eminent evolutionary psychologists,

190
00:10:49.075 --> 00:10:52.205
Margot Wilson and Martin Daly pointed out that this

191
00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:55.715
pattern of risk taking is connected to patterns of

192
00:10:55.715 --> 00:10:58.794
violent conflict and that men are more likely to

193
00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:03.034
um uh to be involved in violent altercations all

194
00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:06.320
the way up to homicide. Um, uh, AND, uh,

195
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.369
that young men in particular are at risk in

196
00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:10.609
this regard, and, and their argument, uh, which I

197
00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:12.330
think is a compelling one, is that this is

198
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.760
a reflection of, of intersexual selection, that is, uh,

199
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.650
selection on men for competition to access to reproductive

200
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.450
partners, which explains the differences in body size and

201
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.820
muscularity between males and females in our species and,

202
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.849
and many others. Um, AND, uh, they largely conceptualized

203
00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:37.409
this voluntary risk taking, um, demographic pattern as uh

204
00:11:37.409 --> 00:11:39.729
just a a kind of, uh, a reflection of

205
00:11:39.729 --> 00:11:44.479
or an ancillary, um, perhaps knock-on effect of this

206
00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:50.500
propensity to engage in violent conflict, um. We extended

207
00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:55.320
that perspective by arguing that voluntary physical risk taking

208
00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.229
outside a violent con contexts actually has signaling value,

209
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.190
right? Because an individual who is willing to take

210
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.520
significant risks with their physical well-being is indicating to

211
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.390
others that they are a dangerous opponent and a

212
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.609
valuable ally. If someone doesn't back down, even when

213
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.549
it's clear that there is a risk of injury

214
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:20.419
or death in a conflict. That person is just

215
00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:23.059
much more difficult to deter from engaging in the

216
00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:25.859
conflict, and much more difficult to defeat because they

217
00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:29.859
don't, um, they don't retreat, right? Um, uh, FANS

218
00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:33.260
of, uh, the British comedy troupe Monty Python may

219
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.059
remember, uh, the night guarding the bridge, right, where,

220
00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:40.340
you know, he's he's suffering these, these horrible injuries

221
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.049
at the hands of his opponent, and he just

222
00:12:42.049 --> 00:12:45.659
refuses to back down, right? Um, THAT, that is

223
00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:47.340
someone now in that case that individual was defeated.

224
00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:49.369
OF course, but, but the point here is that,

225
00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:51.710
that, that's somebody who's a dangerous opponent, right? It's,

226
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.239
it's just much more difficult um to deter or

227
00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:56.599
defeat them, and a valuable ally, you want that

228
00:12:56.599 --> 00:12:58.799
person on your side. So our argument very simply

229
00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.760
is that voluntary nonviolent risk taking, which follows the

230
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.280
same demographic patterns as um engagement and violence is

231
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.080
a way of communicating to potential um opponents and

232
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.969
to potential allies that one is, uh, you know,

233
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:16.929
a dangerous individual to go up against. Uh, AND,

234
00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:20.000
um, in the same kinds of experiments that I

235
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.679
described with regard, for example, to the possession of

236
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:25.559
weapons or the presence of allies, um, we show

237
00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:29.919
that if you know that someone, uh, involuntarily engages

238
00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.719
in recreational activities that are highly risky, you think

239
00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:35.000
that person in your mind's eye, right? You think

240
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.400
of them as larger and stronger than if they

241
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.760
avoid such activities. And of course, again, it isn't

242
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.760
physically actually the case that big strong People take

243
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.599
more, you know, risks bungee jumping or base jumping,

244
00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:52.039
or, you know, rock climbing or ice climbing or

245
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:55.320
whatever. Physical size doesn't actually play a role in

246
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.320
people's decisions about their own recreational risk taking. And

247
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.000
yet, when asked to imagine a recreational risk taker,

248
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.799
people think of that individual as bigger and stronger

249
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:10.280
because they're using that information, they're they're they're, they're

250
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.619
um. They're processing the signal that that individual is

251
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:17.020
emitting through their actions, uh, and they're they're using

252
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.619
that information to assess the overall likelihood that that

253
00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:21.900
individual would win a conflict.

254
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.539
Right. So let me ask you now about male

255
00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:31.890
muscularity and particularly preferences for male mus muscularity. So

256
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.539
when it comes to these kinds of preferences, do

257
00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:38.619
they differ between men's and women's magazines?

258
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.000
Yeah, so, um, uh, uh, this is not a

259
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.369
a a subject that I've studied extensively. Um, uh,

260
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.520
uh, uh, THERE was one project quite a number

261
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.049
of years ago headed up by uh Professor David

262
00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:56.489
Frederick, um, uh, and, um, we compared the degree

263
00:14:56.489 --> 00:15:00.169
of muscularity of images, uh, of men in magazines

264
00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:02.479
aimed at a male audience in the United States.

265
00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:05.900
AND magazines aimed at um a female audience. I

266
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.260
should say, by the way, that when I make

267
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.260
these kinds of generalizations, um, um. As in this

268
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.940
case, these are societies, so-called weird societies, right? Western

269
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.460
educated, industrialized, rich and democratic, right? um GLOBAL North

270
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.900
societies. um uh I I am uh. I'm an

271
00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:25.320
anthropologist by training. I, I, you know, I, I

272
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.340
conducted ethnographic work in a small scale face to

273
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.719
face community in the global South. Um, I think

274
00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:33.359
it's always important to contextualize our results and whenever

275
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:36.320
possible to, to, to conduct research across a wide

276
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.590
range of societies. So, so we want to take

277
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.390
this magazine study finding with a grain of salt,

278
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.679
right? Um, AND as I said, although other people

279
00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:46.679
have continued such research, it's not something that I've

280
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:50.080
studied extensively, but the basic finding very simply is

281
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.950
that um. Uh, THE images of male bodies in

282
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.059
magazines aimed at men, uh, this largely predates the,

283
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.710
the, the, the, the, the current digital age when

284
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.109
the idea of a of a physical magazine is

285
00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:04.340
somewhat antiquated, but I've been around for a while.

286
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.030
Um, uh, THE images in magazines aimed at a

287
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.940
male audience are more muscular than the images of

288
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.630
of men's bodies in magazines aimed at a female

289
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.010
audience, right? And um. There are a variety of

290
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.130
possible explanations here. Um, uh, ONE explanation possibly is

291
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.890
that, um, that there is prestige competition going on

292
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.809
between men. OK, so prestige competition, that is prestige,

293
00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:33.679
of course, is a is a uniquely human aspect

294
00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:37.809
of social structures. Um, ANY social animal with any

295
00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:40.280
kind of complexity to its behavior has a hierarchy.

296
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.690
A pecking order, um, the phrase comes from, uh,

297
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.940
chickens, of course, not that chickens can speak, but

298
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.099
our studies of chickens, um, uh, and, um. Uh,

299
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.960
DOMINANCE hierarchies are very simply, um, you know, uh,

300
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.700
a social hierarchy um established on the basis of

301
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.219
force or the threat of force. And although dominance

302
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:00.969
hierarchies do play some role in human social groups,

303
00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:03.580
um, uh, it's a fairly minor role in most

304
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.290
contexts in most societies. Instead, prestige is the principal,

305
00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.660
um, means of, of assigning position in the social

306
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.300
hierarchy, and prestige in contrast to dominance has nothing

307
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.140
to do with force. Instead, it is freely granted

308
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.510
deference. Uh, INDIVIDUALS acknowledge that another individual has some

309
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.069
attribute that the group values, and um they provide

310
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.829
opportunities, um, uh, uh, they, they, um, verbally acknowledge

311
00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:34.189
that individual, uh, and, um, uh, the, the sort

312
00:17:34.189 --> 00:17:37.390
of compelling explanation for this, um, uh, work by

313
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.319
initially by Jerome Barkow and then subsequently by, um,

314
00:17:41.349 --> 00:17:44.229
uh, Joseph Henri and Francisco Gil White argues that

315
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:47.895
the presence of prestige in human social. HIERARCHIES is

316
00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:51.655
a consequence of the importance of acquiring information from

317
00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:54.734
others. We are a culture dependent species, um, you

318
00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:58.175
know, we're not particularly fast or big. We don't

319
00:17:58.175 --> 00:18:01.045
have big teeth or large claws or so on.

320
00:18:01.094 --> 00:18:04.385
Instead, um, uh, most of our success in, in,

321
00:18:04.405 --> 00:18:06.555
in the world and our ability to dominate the

322
00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:08.614
planet comes from the fact that we're good at

323
00:18:08.614 --> 00:18:11.295
learning from other members of our species and, and

324
00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:14.854
cultural information snowballs over time, right? There's cumulative cultural

325
00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:18.459
evolution going on. So, um, if you identify somebody

326
00:18:18.459 --> 00:18:21.489
in your group who is good at something, right,

327
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.939
um, uh, then you want to learn from them,

328
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.500
you want to imitate them, and the, the price

329
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.089
that you pay for access in a small group,

330
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.219
such that you can follow them around, ask them

331
00:18:31.219 --> 00:18:33.979
questions, watch what they're doing, is to grant them

332
00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:38.420
deference, OK? So, prestige exists in all human societies

333
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.369
and is the principal basis for human social hierarchies,

334
00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:44.770
um, but Prestige can do a funny thing and

335
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.410
that it can go off in all kinds of

336
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.810
strange directions. Um, uh, CULTURES can choose anything in

337
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.810
potentially to be prestigious, right? Um, AND, uh, any

338
00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.250
kind of social competition can turn into a, a

339
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.540
prestige competition. So one possible explanation for that difference

340
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.780
in muscularity preferences that I described is that men

341
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.369
are just engaging in a prestige competition, right? And

342
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:11.689
certainly you see this in their, you know, their

343
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:14.729
recreational activities, for example, right? They're just, they're they're

344
00:19:14.729 --> 00:19:17.939
granting deference to individuals who are athletically skilled and

345
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.689
and and and willing to take risks and so

346
00:19:19.689 --> 00:19:24.619
on, right? Um, uh, AND that prestige competition is

347
00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:27.199
because it is men competing with men for prestige,

348
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.660
it's kind of gone into runaway where they have

349
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.489
escaped the female preferences as it were, right, or

350
00:19:32.489 --> 00:19:35.729
overshot the female preferences. So the women don't actually

351
00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:40.239
want, you know, You know, completely, you know, hypertrophied

352
00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:44.449
muscular men, um, that's not their preference. The men

353
00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.170
think that's great. Why do the men think that's

354
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.760
great? One possibility is prestige, right? Um, uh, uh,

355
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.650
ANOTHER possibility, of course, is that this is a

356
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.680
reflection of the history of violent conflict. Right? And

357
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.930
men are attending to attributes that might be useful

358
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.920
in violent conflict more than women are because um

359
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.810
uh it it is a a a more important

360
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.380
determinant of male status, independent of aspects of prestige.

361
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.599
At present, we can't really distinguish between these possibilities,

362
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.650
um, but, uh, going back to risk taking, you

363
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.189
see the same kind of overshooting often in risk

364
00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:26.130
taking activities, right? So, um, You know, uh, it's

365
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.329
true that, you know, the presence of young women

366
00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:32.250
precipitates or elicits more voluntary physical risk taking in

367
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.410
young men, but it's also true that the presence

368
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.489
of other young men is a huge risk factor.

369
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.270
Right, so here in Southern California, where I am,

370
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.829
um, uh, we have uh rattlesnakes in the in

371
00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:45.180
in the hills, right? Is it a dangerous animal,

372
00:20:45.229 --> 00:20:48.109
not, not, you know, enormously dangerous, but could certainly

373
00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:50.910
can, you know, cause, um, severe damage to a

374
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.219
limb and, and in some cases even death, right?

375
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.030
And if we look at the epidemiology of rattlesnake

376
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.829
bites in Southern California, so who gets bitten by

377
00:20:58.829 --> 00:21:01.689
rattlesnakes? Young men are much more likely to get

378
00:21:01.689 --> 00:21:04.770
bitten by rattlesnakes than anybody else, OK. Now, it

379
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.449
could be the case that that's just cause they

380
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:09.170
spend more time outdoors and, you know, therefore they

381
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.449
encounter rattlesnakes more. But if we look more detailed

382
00:21:12.449 --> 00:21:17.089
at Where people are getting bitten on their bodies,

383
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.380
when women get bitten by snakes, they're most likely

384
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.260
to be bitten on the foot or ankle or

385
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.660
lower leg. So they're just stepping someplace where there

386
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.380
happened to be a dangerous animal and they didn't

387
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.420
see it, and the snake bit them. Men are

388
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.739
often bitten on the hand, wrist, or forearm. OK.

389
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.109
Why? Because they're trying to pick up the snake,

390
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.770
right? When did they try and pick up the

391
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.760
snake? When there are other young men present, OK,

392
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.089
so this is this voluntary risk taking that I've

393
00:21:42.089 --> 00:21:46.060
described. It is, it has the formidability component to

394
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.260
it, and it can go into runaway with prestige

395
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.459
where people, you know, oh, you know, this guy's,

396
00:21:50.739 --> 00:21:52.729
you know what he's he's he's so brave, right?

397
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.900
Um, uh, THEY acknowledge this, um, uh, this risk

398
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.300
taking, and of course women don't think that's smart,

399
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.579
right, in general, they don't say, oh God, what,

400
00:22:01.699 --> 00:22:04.055
you know, what. Smart guy, right? See, he'd be

401
00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:07.145
a great life partner, you know, for, uh, you

402
00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:10.145
know, a heterosexual woman, because he picks up rattlesnakes.

403
00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:11.984
No, they think, what an idiot, right? This is

404
00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:13.464
such a stupid thing to do. Why is he

405
00:22:13.464 --> 00:22:15.385
picking up a rattlesnake? I should say, by the

406
00:22:15.385 --> 00:22:17.625
way, that although it is a, uh, uh, only

407
00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:19.545
a, a small fraction of the bite, some men

408
00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:22.119
are bitten twice by the same snake. Right? So

409
00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:24.239
they pick it up, it bites them, they say,

410
00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:25.959
dude, it bit me and they don't let go

411
00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:28.119
and it bites them again, right? OK, this is

412
00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:30.920
not something in general that women admire. It just

413
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.520
seems like this is not the kind of person

414
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.310
you want to have as a partner because they're

415
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.199
not gonna be reliable, they're likely to end up

416
00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:39.670
dead, right? Um, BUT the young men admire this,

417
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.300
and that's probably the intersection of dominance and prestige

418
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.000
operating in male male competition.

419
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.349
So, but I mean, when it comes to preferences

420
00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:52.910
for male muscularity, and since I asked you also

421
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.640
about magazines, do men tend to overestimate the degree

422
00:22:57.989 --> 00:23:00.550
of muscularity women prefer?

423
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.050
So I don't actually have data on this, but

424
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.010
I would, I I would venture to guess the

425
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.140
answer is yes, right? Um, uh, uh, SO they,

426
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.050
they, they, you know, at the gym, they're trying

427
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.319
to impress both other men and women, speaking of

428
00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:19.119
course about heterosexual individuals, right, um, uh, uh, um,

429
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:26.589
uh, or predominantly heterosexual individuals, um, uh. Uh, BUT

430
00:23:26.969 --> 00:23:29.349
we could do a whole another program on, um,

431
00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:31.010
the attraction of members of the same sex and,

432
00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:33.280
and, and my thoughts on that and um the

433
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.969
the the notion of heterosexuality is in fact, um,

434
00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:39.530
uh, probably, uh, truly applicable to only a very

435
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.689
small fraction of any population. But, but I'll set

436
00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:43.449
that aside for now and and and focus just

437
00:23:43.449 --> 00:23:46.250
on this issue. Um, I, I, yeah, I think

438
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:52.439
that that men. Uh Grossly overestimate the extent to

439
00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:54.760
which women value muscularity in a man, just like

440
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.400
they they they they grossly overestimate the extent to

441
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.319
which um physical risk taking um uh is valued

442
00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:05.119
by women, right? Um, uh, SO, and that overestimation

443
00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:08.319
is a consequence of Um, viewing it from a

444
00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:11.160
male perspective, not from a female perspective. That is

445
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.920
the the the the guy, you know, taking steroids

446
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.140
and, and, and doing bench press in the gym,

447
00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.800
you know, who can't put his arms down by

448
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.750
his side because his muscles are so hypertrophied, right?

449
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.560
Um, uh, HE isn't taking the perspective of the

450
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.959
female view of his body. Um, HE'S assuming that

451
00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:31.280
they share his view, and his view is very

452
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.760
much driven by, um, uh comparison with other men

453
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.079
in, in competition with men. Um, THOSE are conjectures

454
00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.780
on my part. I don't have evidence to support

455
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.339
that, but I'd be very surprised if that wasn't

456
00:24:42.339 --> 00:24:42.680
the case.

457
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:46.069
OK, so it still related to that, could you

458
00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:51.750
tell us about the physical trait overvaluation hypothesis and

459
00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:57.510
how gender specific media fuel emphasis on certain body

460
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:02.500
parts in within gender prestige comp competitions. Yeah,

461
00:25:02.589 --> 00:25:05.630
yeah, so, uh, so far, a lot of what

462
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.410
I have been saying could be, you know, the

463
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.500
uh the ideas could come from any evolutionary psychologist,

464
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.869
but, um, a place that I really think that

465
00:25:13.869 --> 00:25:16.699
anthropology has a very important role to play in

466
00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:20.150
the evolutionary social sciences is in um underscoring the

467
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.510
importance of cultural information and um I've mentioned culture

468
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.420
at various points, but haven't really, um, you know,

469
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:32.520
Uh, dwelled extensively on how cultural evolution can shape

470
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.689
preferences, um, and priorities in a wide variety of

471
00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:39.729
directions. So, um, you know, when we look at

472
00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:43.290
what is considered physically attractive, there are some universals,

473
00:25:43.449 --> 00:25:45.930
and those have been well studied, um, by, you

474
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.810
know, a whole school of scholars, uh, and, and

475
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.890
the evidence is quite compelling, right? So, so, um.

476
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.270
Symmetry is more attractive than asymmetry, um, because symmetry

477
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.829
presumably is a reflection of genetic quality by virtue

478
00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:01.630
of the fact that it's difficult to make something

479
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.699
s symmetrical, right? Um. Uh, SIGNS of vigor and

480
00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:10.689
health are attractive in both sexes. Um, AGAIN, uh,

481
00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:14.010
a, a reflection both of genetic quality and of,

482
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.900
um, the ability to, uh, perform the, the respective

483
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.000
functions in any partnership, right? Uh, AND, you know,

484
00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:24.540
this work has been, as I said, quite extensive,

485
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.359
then there, there, there is also quite a bit

486
00:26:26.359 --> 00:26:28.560
of work on, um, what we can think of

487
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.000
as sex specific aspects of bodies that um are

488
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.560
uh attractive. So, uh, in, in women, the waist

489
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.000
to hip ratio seems to be, um. Uh, EITHER

490
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.810
a first pass or second pass criterion depending on

491
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.119
the level of resource abundance. So, um, uh, when

492
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.530
there's, uh, uh, you know, a history of periodic

493
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.939
resource shortage, then it's a second pass criterion and

494
00:26:53.209 --> 00:26:56.020
adiposity, general body fat is a first pass, right?

495
00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:58.170
So people find more. Attractive women who have more

496
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.800
body fat because they're better buffered against um resource

497
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.969
scarcity. Uh, BUT the waist to hip ratio is,

498
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.689
is, um, uh, in, in those contexts is a

499
00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:10.650
second pass criteria, people um uh value uh a

500
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.810
lower waist to hip ratio and, um, uh, uh.

501
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.479
Uh, A compelling argument has been made, um, by

502
00:27:18.479 --> 00:27:22.010
Lasse Goin that, uh, this is a reflection of

503
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:27.189
the value of glu gluteofemoral fat deposition, um, uh,

504
00:27:27.199 --> 00:27:31.020
in pregnancy because that's where uh polyunsaturated long chain

505
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.199
fatty acids are stored, and those are critical for

506
00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:37.430
building fetal brains. You know, these are sort of

507
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:42.810
sound, biologically based, um, a kind of canonical evolutionary

508
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.189
psychological findings, similarly signs of secondary sex characteristics of

509
00:27:47.189 --> 00:27:50.699
uh of of sexual maturity. So in men, you

510
00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:53.209
know, a deeper voice, um, the presence of body

511
00:27:53.209 --> 00:27:58.369
hair, square jawline. Um, uh, IN women, protuberant breasts

512
00:27:58.369 --> 00:28:01.890
as well as that, um, gluteofemoral fat deposition, and

513
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.270
then, of course, signs of youth in women, um,

514
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.569
uh, indications that, um, uh, that a female at

515
00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:10.050
the beginning of her reproductive career and hasn't had

516
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.800
many, many children and has, has, has few children,

517
00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:16.969
um, ahead of her. Um, uh, ALL that is

518
00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:19.329
very well studied and, you know, I think very

519
00:28:19.329 --> 00:28:22.709
well documented. But the important thing is to note

520
00:28:22.709 --> 00:28:25.810
that um that culture can do funny things where

521
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.869
it can emphasize or de-emphasize different aspects of that

522
00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:34.939
basic palette, if you will, of, of possibilities. So,

523
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.310
um, although breasts are considered somewhat erotic from what

524
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.390
evidence we have and um uh by we, I'm

525
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.709
uh I'm not speaking for myself, but uh folks

526
00:28:46.709 --> 00:28:49.430
like um uh William Jakoviak at the University of

527
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.329
Nevada, Las Vegas have studied this. You know that

528
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.880
that this is an aspect of female sexual attractiveness,

529
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.959
but in the United States at least, um, uh,

530
00:28:58.969 --> 00:29:03.010
this particular, um, part of the body is Uh,

531
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.430
the technical term is hypercognized, meaning that our culture

532
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.829
pays a great deal of attention to this part

533
00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:10.550
of the body, to the point that people have

534
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.660
surgery to modify, uh, this part of their body.

535
00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:17.329
Um, uh, AND in fact, large breasts, although the,

536
00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:20.709
the, the preferences in this regard, um, like, like

537
00:29:20.709 --> 00:29:25.550
any, um, uh, uh, culturally determined feature can wax

538
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.869
and wane. So, um, uh, you know, the preferences

539
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:33.949
for total breast size. Change historically over time. But

540
00:29:33.949 --> 00:29:36.609
nonetheless, this remains a part of the body that

541
00:29:36.699 --> 00:29:39.859
uh Americans pay much more attention to in assessing

542
00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:42.699
sexual attractiveness than do people in many other parts

543
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:45.140
of the world, right? So, we always want to

544
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.219
be careful um not to assume that the preferences

545
00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:53.540
of individuals in any one society are a direct

546
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.510
You know, give us direct vision into or insight

547
00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.079
into any universal aspect of aesthetic preferences in this

548
00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:03.599
regard. Uh, AND that's why the kind of cross-cultural

549
00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:05.880
work that I described before is so important, and,

550
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.680
and that has been done um with regard to

551
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.920
waist to hip ratio, for example, quite a number

552
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.430
of scholars, um, uh Lawrence Tukuyama and um uh

553
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:19.410
um uh uh. I'm blanking now, um, but, uh,

554
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.790
work has been done, um, in quite a number

555
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:27.160
of small scale societies, including, um, uh. Uh, THE

556
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.800
Hansa in Tanzania and so on, right? And, and

557
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.199
as I said, this seems to be a second

558
00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:33.949
pass criterion in a number of places, um, uh,

559
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:36.479
so that's the kind of work that that nicely

560
00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:40.199
illustrates the intersection of, of, of, of the influence

561
00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:43.719
of culture and pan-human, um, biologically evolved psychology.

562
00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:48.680
Changing topics now, how do you approach the study

563
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.199
of moral parochialism from an evolutionary perspective?

564
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.030
Right, so this is um work done with a

565
00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:00.229
number of colleagues, um, uh. And I should say

566
00:31:00.229 --> 00:31:02.829
here that we've done a number of studies, but

567
00:31:02.829 --> 00:31:05.430
uh I would love to see this work picked

568
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.750
up by by other investigators anytime that, that, you

569
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:13.069
know, that you have um only one lab or

570
00:31:13.069 --> 00:31:16.560
one group of researchers um producing a finding, you

571
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.349
really want to see it replicated um uh or

572
00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:23.359
extended by other researchers. Um, uh, CERTAINLY the replication

573
00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:25.920
crisis in science in general and in um uh

574
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.959
social psychology in particular, uh, underscores the importance of

575
00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:32.680
that. So, um, I should, I'm, I'm qualifying what

576
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.439
I'm saying about moral parochialism because um the, the

577
00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:37.040
total number of studies that we've done is not

578
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.119
large and, and the work hasn't been extensively replicated

579
00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:43.719
by other investigators. That said, I have, you know,

580
00:31:43.949 --> 00:31:46.479
fairly high confidence that the results are real. OK,

581
00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:48.520
so what do we mean by moral parochialism? We

582
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.920
mean very simply that people's moral judgments, their judgments

583
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.839
about what they consider right and wrong from a

584
00:31:54.839 --> 00:32:00.400
moral perspective. Um, ARE, are very much tied to

585
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.209
a local context. Um, AND what I mean by

586
00:32:04.209 --> 00:32:07.130
that is not just that people are, um, are

587
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.280
ethnocentric and assuming that everyone should share their values,

588
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.319
although that is an important feature of, of human

589
00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:18.609
cultural, um, uh, and biological co-evolution. Instead, what we

590
00:32:18.609 --> 00:32:22.119
mean by moral parochialism is that uh the extent

591
00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:25.640
to which people gauge an action as being wrong.

592
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.680
IS in part contingent on where it occurs, when

593
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.359
it occurs, and the extent to which an authority

594
00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:36.020
of figure approves or disapproves of that action. Now,

595
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.119
why would this be the case? So what's the

596
00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:41.839
background hypothesis here? The basic idea is that The

597
00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:46.800
the function of moral judgment is to motivate individuals

598
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.680
in their own actions to conform to local norms.

599
00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:54.709
In order to behave in a predictable fashion and

600
00:32:54.709 --> 00:32:57.469
a reliable fashion that makes them a valuable potential

601
00:32:57.469 --> 00:33:01.150
cooperative partner. So humans are enormously cooperative, far more

602
00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.439
so than virtually any other species on the planet,

603
00:33:03.469 --> 00:33:05.829
and that together with culture is what is responsible

604
00:33:05.829 --> 00:33:08.469
for our success as a species, and that we're

605
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:12.410
so good at um at cooperating with unrelated individuals,

606
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:16.369
um. And uh the, the local rules, the norms,

607
00:33:16.449 --> 00:33:19.689
the standards for behavior are are are one critical

608
00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:22.280
part of the ability to cooperate in this way,

609
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.689
because it is only by being able to coordinate

610
00:33:24.689 --> 00:33:27.930
our actions, right, and to rely on others to

611
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.400
act in the appropriate fashion um that we that

612
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:35.390
that's kind of cooperation as possible. So, If what

613
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.910
moral judgment is doing is guiding us as actors

614
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:45.670
to locally predictable behavior and motivating us to distance

615
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.510
ourselves from and or punish individuals who fail to

616
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.829
conform in this way, right? So, non-conformists at the

617
00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:55.469
very least are unpredictable, right? If somebody doesn't follow

618
00:33:55.469 --> 00:33:57.229
the local rules, you don't know how they're going

619
00:33:57.229 --> 00:33:58.910
to act, and that makes them a bad cooperative

620
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.349
partner. That's at best, um, at worst, they may

621
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.150
be free riding and trying to take advantage of

622
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.270
others, right? And that really degrades cooperation quickly, right?

623
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.280
So, um, moral judgment is in the service of

624
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.320
motivating us to conform to the local rules and

625
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.438
motivating us to punish those who fail to conform

626
00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:20.040
to the local rules. Cooperation is always going to

627
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.120
be local. It is the people around one who

628
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.800
form one's potential cooperative partners, and it is also

629
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.840
the people around one who can potentially exploit cooperation

630
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.040
for self-interested ends, right, the free riders, right? It's

631
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:37.239
only in, you know, this historically and evolutionarily unprecedented

632
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.199
information age that we live in right now that

633
00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.639
I can be talking to you on the other

634
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.438
side of the planet, right? And we can potentially

635
00:34:43.438 --> 00:34:45.870
cooperate, right? It's one of the things that that's

636
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.760
led to the enormous boom in scientific productivity is

637
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.040
that, you know, we could collaborate on a project,

638
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.560
right? We can go and do research even though

639
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.719
we're in, you know, opposite sides of the globe,

640
00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:58.949
OK. That was never a part of our history

641
00:34:58.949 --> 00:35:02.750
as a species. It's always, always the folks right

642
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.310
around one. So it's the folks right around one

643
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.110
that one needs to care about when it comes

644
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.389
to following the rules. It's their opinions of one

645
00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:11.830
that matter in terms of integrating one into a

646
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.260
cooperative group, um, and, and it is the danger

647
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.149
of free riding or disruptive behavior, um, violence, what

648
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:22.070
have you, exploitation in the local group that matters.

649
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.600
So moral parochialism very simply is that we judge

650
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.649
an action to be more wrong when it happens

651
00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:33.919
in our group near us right now, then when

652
00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:38.919
it happens far away or long ago, right? Because

653
00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:41.760
what happens far away and long ago really doesn't

654
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.000
concern us when it comes to the potential for

655
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.159
cooperation, right? Similarly, I mentioned social hierarchies before, right?

656
00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:55.469
Um, All groups, even fairly egalitarian ones, have some

657
00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:58.070
social hierarchy. There's some individuals who are more influential

658
00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.590
than others, right? And of course, many, many groups

659
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:05.310
have formal offices with the ability to exert coercive

660
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:12.280
pressure through legitimate means, right? And Given that there's

661
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.909
always some social hierarchy, what the influential or powerful

662
00:36:16.909 --> 00:36:20.040
individual says about how the rules should operate is

663
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.580
always going to matter because they're going to structure

664
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.959
the landscape for cooperation. So we've been able to

665
00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:29.000
show in studies in a handful of small scale

666
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.629
societies and, and, and a few uh global North

667
00:36:31.629 --> 00:36:35.750
societies that if you ask people about a moral

668
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.709
transgression, some action that, that everyone would consider wrong,

669
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:45.010
theft. Violence, murder, uh unprovoked, right? Um, uh. If

670
00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.790
you frame it as it's occurring in your community

671
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.060
now. People think it is worse than if you

672
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.489
frame it as it happened someplace very far away.

673
00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:56.560
If you frame it as happening in your community

674
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.600
now, people think it is worse than if it

675
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.469
happened long ago. And if you frame it as

676
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.050
disapproved by the local authority, people think it is,

677
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.199
I think of it as a worse transgression than

678
00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:09.399
if you frame it as approved by the local

679
00:37:09.399 --> 00:37:13.250
authority, right? And you know, Um, uh, viewers and

680
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.689
listeners can, can do the thought experiment themselves, right?

681
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.169
So I don't think that there is anybody watching

682
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.770
this program right now who would say slavery is

683
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.250
not that bad. Like, like, you know, be OK

684
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.969
if we had slaves now, right? This is, this

685
00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:29.409
is obviously morally abhorrent. I'm, I'm quite confident that

686
00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:31.409
everyone watching this would, would agree with me in

687
00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:34.729
this regard. Well, um, you know, the ancient Greeks

688
00:37:34.729 --> 00:37:38.209
had slaves, OK? How do you feel about slavery

689
00:37:38.209 --> 00:37:41.010
in ancient Greece? You know, people say things like,

690
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.639
well, I mean they, they were instrumental in, you

691
00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:47.199
know, inventing democracy, right? That is the sla the

692
00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:51.110
moral evil that is slavery seems to pale. When

693
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.189
we think about ancient Greece compared to when we

694
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:56.870
think about the contemporary world, right? And that's not

695
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.179
an accident, that's because temporal and spatial distance are

696
00:38:01.669 --> 00:38:04.669
basically saying this is less and less relevant to

697
00:38:04.669 --> 00:38:07.189
who will cooperate or free ride in your local

698
00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:10.389
group. So our moral judgment is parochial. It it

699
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:14.340
is, it is parochial because ultimately, it's in the

700
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.909
service of cooperation in the local group and policing

701
00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:17.830
that cooperation.

702
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.689
Uh, WHEN do individuals resort to moral condemnation and

703
00:38:24.689 --> 00:38:28.290
what role does contextual contingency play?

704
00:38:29.379 --> 00:38:34.729
Yeah, so, um, this is basically, um, uh, an

705
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:37.010
extension of what I said just now, right, which

706
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:42.050
is that, um, uh, that the function of moral

707
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:47.449
condemnation is to signal multiple things, OK? It is

708
00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:50.050
to signal that um one knows what the rules

709
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.429
are and one disapproves of rule violations, right? Um,

710
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.540
ONE is potentially willing to inflict costs on the

711
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.379
rule violator, or to endorse and assign prestige and

712
00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:04.090
value to those who do inflict such costs, right?

713
00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.659
And um, it's, it's role is to both advertise

714
00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:14.030
one's value as a cooperator in the local group

715
00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:18.250
and to Inflict costs on or signal the potential

716
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.929
to inflict costs on those who violate those rules.

717
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.719
And this is why context matters so much. Who

718
00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.929
is that person? What is the context, what is

719
00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:29.850
the nature of the violation? All of these things

720
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:34.360
are being processed by a psychology. Uh, THAT, that,

721
00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:38.600
that is leading us to experience, um, what technically

722
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.159
we can call moral outrage or moral disgust versions

723
00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:46.860
of emotions that um in their uh in their

724
00:39:47.729 --> 00:39:51.399
Original ancestral trait, which are also present in humans,

725
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.090
are very much just about what's happening to me,

726
00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:56.889
right? So anger is my response to a transgression,

727
00:39:56.929 --> 00:39:59.610
a cost inflicted on me, that is an unwelcome

728
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.610
cost, right? So, when the baby is crying, if

729
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.824
it's My baby, I'm not angry. If it's the

730
00:40:04.824 --> 00:40:06.824
baby in the, the row behind me on the,

731
00:40:06.864 --> 00:40:09.344
you know, um, 12 hour airplane flight, now I'm

732
00:40:09.344 --> 00:40:12.004
angry, right? Cause when my baby cries, it's inflicting

733
00:40:12.004 --> 00:40:13.504
a cost on me, but it's a welcome cost,

734
00:40:13.584 --> 00:40:15.465
right? I want to care for that, um, offspring,

735
00:40:15.544 --> 00:40:17.745
right? When it's somebody else's baby, it's an unwelcome

736
00:40:17.745 --> 00:40:21.145
cost. Simple. That's what anger is doing, motivates me

737
00:40:21.145 --> 00:40:24.909
to take action to, to truncate the transgression. Um,

738
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.600
TO deter future transgressions and to advertise my, um,

739
00:40:28.669 --> 00:40:31.530
uh, uh, uh, my ability to defend myself against

740
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.530
such transgressions to any would be, um, transgressors, right?

741
00:40:34.729 --> 00:40:37.250
Very simple, right? So why do people get angry

742
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.719
about moral violations that have nothing to do with

743
00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:45.129
them, right? Maybe um uh you're an an able-bodied

744
00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:50.719
person and you see another able-bodied person park illegally

745
00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:53.810
in a space reserved for handicapped individuals. OK. A

746
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.360
lot of people would be angered by that, right?

747
00:40:56.669 --> 00:40:58.610
Some people would go over and challenge that individual

748
00:40:58.610 --> 00:40:59.929
and say, hey, what are you doing? No park

749
00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:02.689
there, right? Um, YOU know, that you don't need

750
00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:04.969
that space. Leave that for people who need it,

751
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:09.129
right? We act as if, and we feel as

752
00:41:09.129 --> 00:41:13.290
if the transgression against um somebody else, right, the

753
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:15.969
costs being inflicted on the individual who needs the

754
00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:20.169
parking space, was actually being inflicted on us, OK?

755
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:26.300
That's the difference between moral outrage, anger elicited by

756
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.060
rule violations that do not affect us versus simple

757
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.689
anger, OK. And the fact that humans experience this

758
00:41:33.689 --> 00:41:36.899
and, and the evidence that any other animal does

759
00:41:36.899 --> 00:41:39.300
so is quite limited and and to the extent

760
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.139
that there is any evidence, it's only in these

761
00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:45.060
highly encephalized species, um, uh, you know, with very

762
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.780
complex social behavior, it's very rudimentary and, and, and

763
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.760
I would say that evidence is quite thin. Um,

764
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.675
SO we can certainly say that more. Moral outrage

765
00:41:52.675 --> 00:41:55.875
is a, is a, a canonical human characteristic and

766
00:41:55.875 --> 00:41:59.034
possibly an entirely unique one. And that is because

767
00:41:59.034 --> 00:42:02.225
of the importance of culture in regulating our behavior

768
00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:05.544
and the importance of cooperation in our success, not

769
00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:08.955
just success as as a species, natural selection acts

770
00:42:08.955 --> 00:42:12.435
on individuals, not on, on populations this way, right?

771
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.590
Um, uh, BUT it is, you know, the ability

772
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.750
to be well integrated into one's group, to be

773
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.879
valued as a potential cooperator, to be able to

774
00:42:19.879 --> 00:42:21.520
play in those reindeer games, right? To be able

775
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.159
to reap the rewards of cooperation. This is the

776
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:27.399
key to success in all societies, right? Um, uh,

777
00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:32.399
AND so, um, uh, experiencing moral outrage when rule

778
00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:36.199
violations occur, advertises that we understand the rules that

779
00:42:36.199 --> 00:42:39.340
we're willing to inflict cost on on rule violators,

780
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.820
and thus that we are a reliable. Um, MEMBER

781
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.330
of the group and a good potential cooperator, um,

782
00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:49.899
uh, and contextual contingency simply means, um, uh, the

783
00:42:49.899 --> 00:42:51.899
context matters. If it happened far away, if it

784
00:42:51.899 --> 00:42:54.250
happened long ago, it doesn't matter as much because

785
00:42:54.699 --> 00:42:58.699
those individuals committing those transgressions might have been subject

786
00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:00.739
to different rules. People say things like, well, you

787
00:43:00.739 --> 00:43:03.100
know, things are different in ancient Greece, right? And

788
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.270
it was different, right? Like I, I don't know

789
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.469
what the rules were then, right? But even more

790
00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:09.709
importantly, those people are long dead. It's not gonna,

791
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.060
there there there are no opportunities for me there,

792
00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:15.750
OK? In addition, what this kind of outrage is

793
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.189
doing is it is. Um, uh, SIGNALING that one

794
00:43:20.189 --> 00:43:22.110
is on the right side of the law, as

795
00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:25.260
it were, right? So another feature of human, um,

796
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.750
social organization is that we have higher order punishment,

797
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.949
that is, we don't just punish people who break

798
00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:33.520
the rules, we punish people who fail to punish

799
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.229
people who break the rules, OK? So, if you

800
00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:41.149
say, you know, well, yeah, the, you know. The

801
00:43:41.149 --> 00:43:43.510
guy in the house next door, turns out, was

802
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:48.179
a convicted pedophile, but, you know. Doesn't bother me.

803
00:43:48.219 --> 00:43:50.459
He doesn't, I don't have any kids, not my

804
00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:54.090
problem, OK. A lot of your other neighbors are

805
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:58.010
gonna say, you're a bad neighbor for tolerating the

806
00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.379
presence. Of this morally outrageous action in in in

807
00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.560
in the in the in in in the house

808
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.959
next door to yours, right? That is, we punish

809
00:44:06.959 --> 00:44:10.389
people who failed to punish people who violate important

810
00:44:10.389 --> 00:44:15.310
rules. And in so doing, um, uh, we, we

811
00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:19.600
greatly increase the power of enforcement such that um

812
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.679
uh punishment, actual punishment doesn't have to happen anywhere

813
00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:26.639
near as often. Um, AND so context again matters

814
00:44:26.639 --> 00:44:33.870
and, you know. Tragically, and frankly, horrible things are

815
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.709
happening in the world as we speak right now.

816
00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.070
As you and I sit safely in our offices

817
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.780
looking at computers, people are being murdered, raped, enslaved,

818
00:44:43.189 --> 00:44:47.310
starved. Some of these things are in the news,

819
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.010
some of these things are not. But it's happening

820
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.870
right now, OK? Why are, why is everyone watching

821
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.570
this not constantly morally outraged? OK, cause it's not

822
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.939
happening. In their community OK, um, and that doesn't

823
00:45:02.939 --> 00:45:06.179
mean that they are immoral individuals. It doesn't mean

824
00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:08.770
that, that, you know, that that that that that

825
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:13.629
we, um, in any way. Um, uh, YOU know,

826
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.110
from our, from our sort of innate psychology would

827
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.159
condemn them for failing to condemn these actions abroad,

828
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.709
right? And one of the great successes of, of

829
00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:29.350
human cultural evolution is our ability to embrace principles.

830
00:45:30.449 --> 00:45:33.729
Outside of context, that is to do away with

831
00:45:33.729 --> 00:45:37.209
contextual contingency and say, we should all be horrified

832
00:45:37.209 --> 00:45:39.689
by those actions. We should all seek to punish

833
00:45:39.689 --> 00:45:41.780
the people who engage in them. We should all

834
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.850
seek to protect the innocent, right? Even if it's

835
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.489
not happening here and now in our neighborhood, right?

836
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.550
And there's a constant, you know, there's a constant

837
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.979
tug of war or constant friction between Um, those

838
00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:58.629
culturally evolved principles, cause that's evolutionarily novel, you know,

839
00:45:58.669 --> 00:46:00.719
it's a product of cultural evolution to say more

840
00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:03.510
rules should apply everywhere, um, uh, you know, we

841
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.229
should, we shouldn't value the life of, of someone

842
00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:08.469
in our community any more than the life of

843
00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.429
someone on the other side of the planet, right?

844
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.870
That, that's not part of our innate psychology at

845
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.110
all of our evolved psychology and um uh and

846
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.149
it's a struggle to um to work to to.

847
00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:22.870
To embrace that in our own lives and to

848
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.919
persuade, you know, others in our community and and

849
00:46:25.919 --> 00:46:28.320
policymakers to to embrace it also.

850
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.550
So I would like to get now into the

851
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.270
topic of this guests and pathogen avoidance. Uh, I've

852
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.909
had several interviews on the show already on the

853
00:46:37.909 --> 00:46:41.590
topic of this guests from an evolutionary perspective, but

854
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.469
I would like to ask you specifically about ectoparasites.

855
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.510
I mean, what are ectoparasites and do they induce

856
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.469
these guests in the same way? I mean, what

857
00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:57.409
kind of behavioral defenses do we have humans have

858
00:46:57.409 --> 00:46:58.969
against ectoparasites?

859
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.889
Yeah, um, so, uh, a parasite, of course, is

860
00:47:02.889 --> 00:47:07.169
any organism that gets its resources by exploiting another

861
00:47:07.169 --> 00:47:11.479
organism. Uh, ECTO just means on the exterior versus

862
00:47:11.479 --> 00:47:14.399
endo, which is the anterior. So an endoparasite is,

863
00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:16.969
um, you know, an organism like a tapeworm, for

864
00:47:16.969 --> 00:47:19.409
example, or a whipworm that lives in the gastrointestinal

865
00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:23.439
tract. Um, AN ectoparasite is an organism like a

866
00:47:23.439 --> 00:47:27.389
tick, a flea, a leech, a mosquito, um, uh,

867
00:47:27.399 --> 00:47:31.120
all of which are, um, uh, getting their resources

868
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.600
from their hosts on the exterior of, of the

869
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.310
organism. Uh, AND, um, this is work done together

870
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.510
with uh Professor Tom Cooper at Nottingham Trent University.

871
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.239
Um, uh, WE reason that, um, that. Uh, THE

872
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.080
wonderful work that's been done by so many scholars,

873
00:47:49.129 --> 00:47:52.080
uh, on the psychology of Disgust, and shout out

874
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.850
here to to Paul Rosin, the, the grandfather of

875
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:59.290
Disgust research, um, that work has really focused largely

876
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:05.959
on, um, on the subjective quality, the feeling states,

877
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:10.399
right, that are kind of canonically um associated with

878
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.310
the cues of the presence of pathogens, OK. So,

879
00:48:14.399 --> 00:48:18.159
uh, the late Valerie Curtis, um, for example, uh,

880
00:48:18.189 --> 00:48:22.560
nicely demonstrated that, um, Uh, in work that I

881
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.320
would like to see further replicated by the way,

882
00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:27.229
but it has been replicated some, um, uh, that,

883
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.620
uh, things like vomit, feces, body products, right, um,

884
00:48:31.719 --> 00:48:35.280
uh, you know, uh, odors of putrefaction, so that

885
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.820
the smell of things rotting, right? That these are,

886
00:48:37.879 --> 00:48:40.949
these are dis discussed elicitors um around the world,

887
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.810
right? Uh, AND of course there's cultural variation there,

888
00:48:43.919 --> 00:48:47.340
um, that's important to recognize, right? Um, uh. You

889
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.469
know, what, what is a delicious cheese to one

890
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.830
person, um, you know, smells like um uh feces

891
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.030
to another person, right? And the the the difference

892
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.439
is not their olfactory neurons, the difference is the

893
00:48:57.439 --> 00:49:01.060
cultural meaning assigned to those odors. But in general,

894
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:06.429
um, there are universal stimuli, um, uh, so absent

895
00:49:06.429 --> 00:49:09.459
the cheese context, that same odor, um, uh, uh,

896
00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:11.830
you know, would, would elicit disgust, and that disgust

897
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:16.699
is defense against. Um, EXPOSURE to pathogens, OK, um,

898
00:49:16.729 --> 00:49:21.810
and that defense is largely concentrated, um, on, uh,

899
00:49:21.899 --> 00:49:25.409
the problem of contamination, so what is touching us,

900
00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:29.250
and in particular what gets inside us, OK? Uh,

901
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.620
SO, um, the mouth, the oral pathway is particularly

902
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.159
privileged in pathogen avoidance disgust. And that's because we

903
00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:39.239
have to eat, right? That is, the, the, the

904
00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:41.760
mouth is one of the principal ways that stuff

905
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.560
outside the body gets inside the body, and our

906
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.159
immune system actually treats material that comes in through

907
00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:49.760
the mouth more um uh permissively than material that

908
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.379
might enter the body through other pathways, because if

909
00:49:52.379 --> 00:49:55.030
that didn't happen, it's called oral tolerance. We don't

910
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.590
mount an immune response, right, um, uh, to a

911
00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:58.919
lot of stuff that comes in through the mouth

912
00:49:58.919 --> 00:50:01.320
because if that didn't happen, we develop food allergies

913
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.780
all the time, right? Um, uh, AND wouldn't be

914
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.090
able to eat anything in the end. We'd constantly

915
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.560
be identifying this as foreign material, OK. So, um,

916
00:50:09.729 --> 00:50:13.449
uh, this oral pathway and, and secondary to the

917
00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:16.340
oral pathway, other orifices, uh, Kevin Haley and I,

918
00:50:16.409 --> 00:50:19.129
uh, years ago published a paper showing that um

919
00:50:19.129 --> 00:50:22.040
uh the surface of the body is where, uh,

920
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.050
that is the interface between the environment and the.

921
00:50:24.189 --> 00:50:26.639
Self is where uh disgust is concentrated, but the

922
00:50:26.639 --> 00:50:30.600
orifices are, are particularly, so, you know, um, poop

923
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.919
that splashes on your wall is less disgusting that

924
00:50:33.919 --> 00:50:36.120
poop that splashes on your clothes and poop that

925
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.399
splashes on your skin is more disgusting than poop

926
00:50:38.399 --> 00:50:41.959
that splashes on your. Your, your, your clothes, but

927
00:50:41.959 --> 00:50:44.679
poop that gets in your eye um uh uh

928
00:50:44.689 --> 00:50:46.850
uh is is more disgusting than poop that lands

929
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:49.850
on your wrist, right? Um, uh, AND that's because

930
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.209
any orifice is a potential way for pathogens, microorganisms

931
00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:57.830
to get inside the body. Enormous work on pathogen

932
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.290
avoidance discussed very important work. I, I, I mentioned,

933
00:51:00.389 --> 00:51:03.560
you know, just a tiny sliver of it, including

934
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.419
some of our contributions, but there are many, many,

935
00:51:05.469 --> 00:51:08.070
many, you know, really, really productive scholars working in

936
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:11.429
this space. Um, SHOUT out to uh Joshua Tiber

937
00:51:11.429 --> 00:51:13.300
in particular who's really um done a lot of

938
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.790
seminal work in this area. Um, uh, THE contribution

939
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.820
that, um, Tom Cooper and I want to make

940
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:25.260
is to say, The, the predominance of that set

941
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.780
of stimuli and those kinds of responses. So what

942
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.979
are the responses, you know, the loss of appetite.

943
00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:31.989
So if you're in the presence of a pathogen

944
00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:34.979
stimulus, you, you stop wanting to take things in

945
00:51:34.979 --> 00:51:37.020
through the mouth. Makes sense given what I said

946
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.620
about oral tolerance. Um, uh, AT the extreme, um,

947
00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.020
uh, you may vomit, right? So that if there's

948
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.469
a possibility you've ingested something, now you expel it,

949
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.689
right? Those responses are so compelling and so central

950
00:51:51.689 --> 00:51:54.520
to the experience of disgust. The disgust research has,

951
00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:00.830
has, um, largely overlooked another threat which disgust also

952
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:04.850
guards against, and that is not pathogens, but ectoparasites.

953
00:52:04.919 --> 00:52:09.489
That is, these, you know, macroorganisms, fleas, ticks, lice,

954
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.500
um, mosquitoes. Um, uh, LEECHES and so on, right,

955
00:52:14.629 --> 00:52:17.500
um, uh, which prey on the host on the

956
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:23.229
surface, OK? Um, AND, um, uh, ectoparasites are a

957
00:52:23.229 --> 00:52:26.669
really significant source of selective pressure. Um, WE who

958
00:52:26.669 --> 00:52:28.939
are privileged to, to, you know, to live in

959
00:52:29.149 --> 00:52:34.449
uh highly economically developed societies are, you know, Prone

960
00:52:34.449 --> 00:52:38.520
to underestimate the importance of ectoparasites in evolution because

961
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.050
um they're a nuisance for us, but they aren't

962
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.040
a threat to our well-being, right? So, you know,

963
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.889
you might have mosquitoes in your backyard or your,

964
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.500
you know, um uh when you go into the

965
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.500
into the woods for a walk, and that's irritating,

966
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.489
right? Um, uh, THEY bite you, you might be

967
00:52:54.489 --> 00:52:56.959
a little bit worried about them. But um if

968
00:52:56.959 --> 00:52:58.729
we look across species, what we see is that,

969
00:52:58.879 --> 00:53:02.479
you know, fertility declines as a function of ectoparasitism

970
00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:05.360
because they're sucking, quite literally sucking resources from their

971
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.280
host. And of course they can also be vectors

972
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.120
for disease, and in the extreme, they can actually

973
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.800
kill the animal just by taking so many of

974
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:16.439
its resources. OK. Um, SO, uh. Our argument, um,

975
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.830
uh, Tom Cooper's in mind is that the, the

976
00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.310
kind of looking under the lamppost that disgust, looking

977
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.520
at the really salient, prominent features of disgust in

978
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.919
terms of pathogen avoidance, has led investigators to overlook

979
00:53:29.919 --> 00:53:33.600
this other important selective pressure, this other threat that

980
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.290
disgust also defends against, and that is Presence of

981
00:53:37.379 --> 00:53:40.050
um uh uh uh uh of a threat from,

982
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.229
uh, you know, creatures that prey on the surface

983
00:53:42.229 --> 00:53:45.020
of our bodies in this way. Now, um, you

984
00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.760
might have felt a little bit itchy as we,

985
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.939
as we've been talking because I've been doing this

986
00:53:48.939 --> 00:53:51.129
kind of thing quite a lot. This is intentional.

987
00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:55.570
Scratching is contagious, OK. Um, IF you see somebody

988
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.949
else scratch, your skin will start to itch, um,

989
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.310
uh, and, and you will start to feel the

990
00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:04.080
desire to scratch also. OK. Why, why? What's going

991
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.510
on there? Well, if I'm scratching, that's a cue

992
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.889
that I may be exposed to ectoparasites, and if

993
00:54:09.889 --> 00:54:12.909
you're in my immediate vicinity, again, digital technology is

994
00:54:12.909 --> 00:54:15.699
evolutionarily novel, right? Um, IF you're in my immediate

995
00:54:15.699 --> 00:54:17.770
vicinity, that means you're at risk of the same

996
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.290
ectoparasites, either me transferring them to you, right? Uh,

997
00:54:21.459 --> 00:54:23.570
OR they're just, you know, uh, ubiquitous in our

998
00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:28.280
local environment. And so by up regulating the sensitivity

999
00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.760
of your skin to the possibility of uh of

1000
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.810
invasion in this fashion, um, uh, scratching, of course,

1001
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.050
is trying to remove that parasite, get it off

1002
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.820
me, right? Um, uh, AND itch is the subjective

1003
00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:49.409
sensation that motivates that behavior. Scratching is contagious because

1004
00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:54.860
um uh the attention is a limited resource, and

1005
00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.219
when there are cues that you need to be

1006
00:54:56.219 --> 00:54:59.260
attending to one particular threat, attention gets channeled to

1007
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.500
that um uh modality, and in this case it

1008
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.310
is the cutaneous sensations, the sensations on our skin,

1009
00:55:05.379 --> 00:55:10.179
right? Similarly, for example, um uh um many viewers

1010
00:55:10.179 --> 00:55:13.550
might have had the experience that, um, Uh, they,

1011
00:55:13.669 --> 00:55:15.229
they, they wake up in the morning and find

1012
00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:17.629
that they've scratched themselves. Perhaps they've they've pulled a

1013
00:55:17.629 --> 00:55:19.550
scab off and it's bleeding a little bit or

1014
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:24.399
something like that, right? Um, uh. Uh, I'm Uh,

1015
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:27.050
perhaps not my sharpest right now because, uh, my

1016
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:29.679
dog was up at 3 a.m., um, shaking his

1017
00:55:29.679 --> 00:55:31.879
head over and over again cause it turned out,

1018
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.479
uh, he's got a bit of a yeast infection

1019
00:55:33.479 --> 00:55:35.469
in one ear that I need to treat, OK.

1020
00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:43.090
Um, uh. The itch sensation is actually up regulated

1021
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:47.439
when we're asleep. That is, we experience itch more

1022
00:55:47.439 --> 00:55:50.139
easily when we're asleep than when we're awake. And

1023
00:55:50.139 --> 00:55:52.290
as a consequence of this, we may scratch ourselves

1024
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:56.100
more um in our semi-conscious state, to the point

1025
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.330
even of, you know, creating a small lesion. OK.

1026
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.409
Why, why does itch sensation increase at night? Why

1027
00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:03.290
that is, why does the threshold for us to

1028
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.889
experience that sensation um go down? And the answer

1029
00:56:06.889 --> 00:56:09.010
is because when we're asleep, we're much more vulnerable

1030
00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:12.854
to ectoparasites, right? Because we can't see them. Uh,

1031
00:56:12.985 --> 00:56:15.625
uh, WE'RE immobile, so it's easier for them to

1032
00:56:15.625 --> 00:56:19.465
reach us. Bedbugs, of course, um, you know, uh,

1033
00:56:19.544 --> 00:56:22.304
a significant problem in, in some hotel chains and

1034
00:56:22.304 --> 00:56:25.745
so on, right? Um, BEDBUGS have evolved specifically to

1035
00:56:25.745 --> 00:56:27.425
take advantage of the fact that, you know, we're

1036
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:30.635
diurnal and we, we are immobile at night. Um,

1037
00:56:30.824 --> 00:56:33.735
uh, SO, um, these are just some of the

1038
00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:37.979
ways that Uh, uh, Cooper and I see evidence

1039
00:56:37.979 --> 00:56:42.860
of evolved design for defense against ectoparasites, right? Now,

1040
00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:46.110
in particular, when you show people, you know, stimuli

1041
00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:49.879
that that. Um, uh, REVEAL the presence of an

1042
00:56:49.879 --> 00:56:53.139
ectoparasite, a film of a scalp infested with lice,

1043
00:56:53.169 --> 00:56:56.199
for example, right? People say that's disgusting when they're

1044
00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:58.439
speaking English and, and when they're speaking other languages,

1045
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.469
um, they use, um, you know, readily translatable terms,

1046
00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:08.120
right? Um, IMPORTANTLY, however, um, It isn't the same

1047
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.209
disgust. It overlaps with the the oral gastric disgust

1048
00:57:12.209 --> 00:57:14.330
that I've described earlier, that is a defense against

1049
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:18.929
pathogens, but it isn't identical. And um uh Tom

1050
00:57:18.929 --> 00:57:20.649
Cooper and I, together with a number of colleagues,

1051
00:57:20.689 --> 00:57:24.770
have demonstrated this um uh uh both in the

1052
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.370
United States, um, in China, and in a, in

1053
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.409
an unpublished paper which we hope to bring to

1054
00:57:31.409 --> 00:57:35.669
market soon in quite a number of societies, um,

1055
00:57:35.729 --> 00:57:39.929
uh, that. If you ask people about their bodily

1056
00:57:39.929 --> 00:57:44.770
sensations, and you show them either stimuli of the

1057
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.370
presence of ectoparasites or stimuli of cues of the

1058
00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:51.139
risk of pathogens. They may use the same word

1059
00:57:51.139 --> 00:57:54.000
to describe both as disgusting, but if you ask

1060
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
them about their bodies, they describe more of those

1061
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.159
cutaneous sensations, right, when they see the ectoparasites, and

1062
00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:05.370
more of the oral gastric sensations when they see

1063
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.489
the cues of pathogens, OK. Now why is the

1064
00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:10.850
same word disgust being used for both of these?

1065
00:58:10.889 --> 00:58:13.969
Well, they report some of the oral gastric symptoms

1066
00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:17.639
when they see the ectoparasites. There is overlap between

1067
00:58:17.639 --> 00:58:21.409
these and and and the reason that overlap probably

1068
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:25.729
occurs is because basically, real estate is valuable. So

1069
00:58:25.729 --> 00:58:28.169
there's a limited amount of brain tissue, and what's

1070
00:58:28.169 --> 00:58:32.080
called neural reuse is basically um applying the same

1071
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.399
neural network. For with slight variation for different adaptive

1072
00:58:37.399 --> 00:58:41.610
problems. OK. So, um, there is probably, and this

1073
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.179
is conjecture, but I, I think it's, it's grounded

1074
00:58:44.179 --> 00:58:48.570
conjecture. There's, there's overlap in the sensations of disgust

1075
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:53.780
that one experiences between um reactions to pathogen cues

1076
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:59.350
and ectoparasite cues. Because the same architecture is being

1077
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.270
used largely for both of them. Now why would

1078
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.270
that be the case? Because the defense against both

1079
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.949
is get it off me, get it away from

1080
00:59:04.949 --> 00:59:07.389
me, OK, right? I don't want to be splashed

1081
00:59:07.389 --> 00:59:08.909
with a poop. I don't want to have the

1082
00:59:08.909 --> 00:59:11.330
ticks crawling on me. Get it off me, right?

1083
00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:14.699
Of, away, back away, OK? It's not a fear

1084
00:59:14.699 --> 00:59:19.330
response, right? I, I see a lion. Right? This

1085
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.969
is a thing that can jump on me and

1086
00:59:20.969 --> 00:59:23.570
kill me right away, OK? I, I, I need

1087
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:25.129
to be in fight or flight mode. I don't

1088
00:59:25.129 --> 00:59:26.449
need to be in fight or flight mode when

1089
00:59:26.449 --> 00:59:30.639
I see leeches. They don't move very fast, right?

1090
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.780
You know, they, they, I can see them coming,

1091
00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:36.570
OK, right? Um, WHAT I need to be is

1092
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:40.090
back away, OK, back away and get it off

1093
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.159
me. If I see the leech, you know, crawling

1094
00:59:42.159 --> 00:59:44.409
along my skin, getting ready to, you know, to

1095
00:59:44.409 --> 00:59:47.830
bite me, get it off me, OK. So that

1096
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:51.320
distancing and decontamination if you will, is the same

1097
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.429
functional response. The loss of appetite is only functional

1098
00:59:55.429 --> 00:59:58.070
in one context, that is the risk of pathogens

1099
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.550
and not in the other, but the overlap in

1100
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.939
terms of the back away, get it off me

1101
01:00:02.939 --> 01:00:05.830
response is sufficient that the same architecture is probably

1102
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.469
being used for both, OK.

1103
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.429
Right. So let me ask you now about the

1104
01:00:11.429 --> 01:00:15.189
link between pathogen of violence and politics. So what

1105
01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:18.179
does pathogen of violence have to do with political

1106
01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:19.870
and social conservatism?

1107
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.060
Yeah, so this is not an area yous have

1108
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.020
probably realized by now that I keep saying the

1109
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.020
same thing over and over again, which is a

1110
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.199
little bit of work here, but I haven't done

1111
01:00:30.199 --> 01:00:31.820
a lot. I'm kind of a jack of all

1112
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.219
trades and a master of none. Um, I, I,

1113
01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.580
you know, there are a few things that I

1114
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.610
can speak to, um, with some authority. Um, uh,

1115
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.709
Colin Holbrook and I have done, I think, I

1116
01:00:40.709 --> 01:00:45.149
think we have 17 different papers on. Um, REPRESENTATIONS

1117
01:00:45.149 --> 01:00:47.669
of formidability. I'm pretty confident that's a real effect,

1118
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.469
right? I'm pretty confident in, in, in that hypothesis

1119
01:00:50.469 --> 01:00:52.270
and, and the data that we have. I'd like

1120
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.389
to see it replicated more by other groups, as

1121
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:55.830
I said, but yeah, we got a lot of

1122
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.669
data on that one, right? Um, I, I, I'm

1123
01:00:58.669 --> 01:01:00.750
something of a, uh, you know, a novice or

1124
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.459
a dilettan when it comes to political psychology, um,

1125
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:07.500
uh, but, um. Uh, AND here my former graduate

1126
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.620
student, um, uh Theo Seymour has, uh, really done

1127
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.899
quite a lot more work in the area of

1128
01:01:11.899 --> 01:01:15.800
political psychology than I have, um, but, uh. There's

1129
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.409
a body of work out there by political psychologists

1130
01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:21.840
and political scientists. I should say that this is

1131
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.419
contested. There have been um uh negative results, um,

1132
01:01:26.439 --> 01:01:28.719
and the debate is ongoing. So, so one shouldn't

1133
01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:32.959
take this as a, as a, you know, an

1134
01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:36.379
extremely well documented pattern, but um I, I, I,

1135
01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:39.600
I find it. Compelling enough to, um, you know,

1136
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.770
to, uh, at least employ the hypothesis and the

1137
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.629
and and the premise, uh, and, and, um, uh,

1138
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.340
you know, more evidence is needed as always. So,

1139
01:01:48.399 --> 01:01:50.360
so what is the basic idea here that the

1140
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.639
basic idea is that, um, social conservativism, so, so

1141
01:01:54.639 --> 01:01:58.639
conservative and liberal are, you know. Political orientation terms

1142
01:01:58.639 --> 01:02:01.830
that really mean different things in in in different

1143
01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:05.120
nation states and maybe even in different communities, right?

1144
01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:08.550
Um, uh, HERE in the United States, um, uh,

1145
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.639
there's been sort of historically a a sort of

1146
01:02:11.639 --> 01:02:16.320
marriage of strange bedfellows between economic conservatism, that is

1147
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.629
individuals who want um lower taxes, um uh and

1148
01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:24.479
um uh more room for private capital and investment.

1149
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:28.870
And social conservativism, which is individuals who want um

1150
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:33.100
to uh adhere to what they believe to be

1151
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:35.709
long standing traditions, OK. So we want to be

1152
01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:37.270
careful not to use, and the same is true

1153
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.389
with regard to economic liberalism and and social liberalism.

1154
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:44.340
They're a little more closely tied, but, but conservative

1155
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.719
and liberal in France, for example, means the the

1156
01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:49.620
the the the parameters are different than they are

1157
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.939
in the United States, so we don't want to

1158
01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:54.389
just take those words for granted. But the basic

1159
01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:56.750
argument is that it seems to be, and as

1160
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.469
I said, that the evidence is the jury is

1161
01:02:59.469 --> 01:03:01.909
still out on this, the evidence is contested, um,

1162
01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:05.479
uh, but there there's some evidence that Um, that

1163
01:03:05.479 --> 01:03:09.320
social conservatives are more reactive to threats than social

1164
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.840
liberals are, meaning that they attend to threats more,

1165
01:03:13.159 --> 01:03:16.030
um, uh, they, they, they tend to have, um,

1166
01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:19.560
uh, greater memory for threats. They tend to react

1167
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.199
more strongly to, um, to, to threats or possible

1168
01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:26.580
threats, right? THAN social liberals do. We also want

1169
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.260
to be careful that, um, you know, we don't

1170
01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.929
want to take either ends of that spectrum as

1171
01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:34.219
the reference point, the normal as it were, right?

1172
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.139
So when we're talking about social conservatives have more

1173
01:03:36.139 --> 01:03:38.139
of this, we could just as easily say social

1174
01:03:38.139 --> 01:03:42.500
liberals have less of this, right? Um, uh, um,

1175
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:45.100
uh, CERTAINLY doesn't want to pathologize anyone on the

1176
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.330
basis of their political orientations, right? Um, uh. Now,

1177
01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:53.219
why might there be a connection between threat reactivity

1178
01:03:53.219 --> 01:03:57.949
and social conservatism slash social liberalism, depending where you

1179
01:03:57.949 --> 01:04:02.520
are in that scale, right? Um. One possibility is

1180
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.399
that um if you see the world as more

1181
01:04:05.399 --> 01:04:10.439
dangerous, then um uh this is a bad time

1182
01:04:10.439 --> 01:04:12.919
as it were to to experiment with new forms

1183
01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:15.120
of social order, right? Instead, what you want to

1184
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.760
be doing right now is sticking to the tried

1185
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.229
and true, right? It worked for the previous generations,

1186
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.199
we should do the same thing now. Now is

1187
01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:26.000
not the time, right, to to start uh trying

1188
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.070
new things. On the other hand, if you see

1189
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:30.110
the world as, you know, safe, there aren't a

1190
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.790
lot of dangers around you. Well, let's let's experiment.

1191
01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.590
Let's try new ways of doing things and see

1192
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.550
if we can improve society, right? SEE if we

1193
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.590
can um uh solve some of the ills that

1194
01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:42.129
we see around us, right? Um, SO, uh, you

1195
01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:44.479
know, at least conceptually it makes sense that there

1196
01:04:44.479 --> 01:04:48.340
would be a link between um conservatism slash liberalism

1197
01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.050
in the social domain and the perception of the

1198
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:55.120
world as dangerous or relatively safe, right? And um.

1199
01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:02.649
Uh, PATHOGEN. Disgust is simply one defense against one

1200
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:07.830
category of threat, right? And so, um, uh, we

1201
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:12.729
can expect that um that Discussed in this manner

1202
01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:16.000
will be marshaled more in terms of threat, right?

1203
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.449
In in the rhetoric of social conservatives than social

1204
01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.209
liberals. Here it's important to point out, and I

1205
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:26.719
alluded to this earlier, right? In addition to disgust

1206
01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:30.709
being a response to pathogen cues to ectoparasite cues,

1207
01:05:30.919 --> 01:05:34.520
I also mentioned moral disgust, right? And moral disgust

1208
01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.639
is is discussed in response to rule violations. OK,

1209
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.790
now there is a lot of debate about whether

1210
01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:43.479
any rule can be viewed with moral disgust or

1211
01:05:43.479 --> 01:05:45.479
whether when people say that they actually mean something

1212
01:05:45.479 --> 01:05:48.239
like moral outrage and they're just using the words

1213
01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:55.929
polysimously, um, uh, um, but, uh, moral disgust. That

1214
01:05:55.929 --> 01:05:59.649
is a discussed reaction to a rule violation makes

1215
01:05:59.649 --> 01:06:03.050
sense from an uh a co-evolutionary perspective looking at

1216
01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:07.489
cultural evolution, biological evolution, because distancing yourself from a

1217
01:06:07.489 --> 01:06:10.429
rule violator as if they were contaminating, as if

1218
01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:14.300
they had disease or parasites, right? It's both as

1219
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.580
a way of punishing them because you're removing yourself

1220
01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.129
from the opportunity of, you know, cooperating with them,

1221
01:06:19.419 --> 01:06:21.419
being exploited by them, and so on, right? And

1222
01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:23.500
you are signaling to others that you disapprove of

1223
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.429
their behavior, right? Um, AND thus avoiding higher order

1224
01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:31.290
punishment yourself, right? And it's relatively low cost compared

1225
01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:33.370
to moral outrage if you think about it, right?

1226
01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:36.419
If you're, if you're disgusted by the able-bodied person

1227
01:06:36.419 --> 01:06:38.709
who parks in the handicapped space, you turn your

1228
01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:41.149
back on them, you walk away from them. If

1229
01:06:41.149 --> 01:06:42.909
you're outraged, you might go up and yell in

1230
01:06:42.909 --> 01:06:45.530
their face, right? And now you might get punched,

1231
01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:49.379
right? So, so, so, you know, ostracism is cheaper

1232
01:06:49.879 --> 01:06:53.229
than um a direct infliction of cost on the

1233
01:06:53.229 --> 01:06:56.830
transgressor. So, um, disgust seems to operate in the

1234
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:00.149
moral domain, um, uh, just like anger operates in

1235
01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:03.260
the moral domain in in this way, right? And

1236
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:09.219
um. If we look at political rhetoric, Um, what

1237
01:07:09.219 --> 01:07:14.219
we see, you know, at least anecdotally, I, and

1238
01:07:14.219 --> 01:07:16.290
I'm not sure if people have, you know, if

1239
01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:18.699
sociolinguists, for example, have studied this extensively, I don't

1240
01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:21.820
know, but, um, but at least anecdotally we see

1241
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.979
social conservatives using um the rhetoric of disgust to

1242
01:07:25.979 --> 01:07:35.870
describe threats of contamination or um uh. Uh, Sexual

1243
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.729
deviation from the norm, right? Sexual disgust is another

1244
01:07:39.729 --> 01:07:43.639
domain, um, uh, entirely separate from pathogen and ectoparasite

1245
01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:47.959
disgust, um. Uh, WHERE the, the emotion is motivating

1246
01:07:47.959 --> 01:07:53.469
the avoidance of suboptimal reproductive partners. Um, uh, uh,

1247
01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:57.889
ONE sees the language of contamination. The language of

1248
01:07:57.989 --> 01:08:04.870
um sexual deviation, excuse me, just a minute. Um,

1249
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.639
BEING used by social conservatives, it's very prominent in

1250
01:08:08.639 --> 01:08:11.989
contemporary American political rhetoric right now as we speak,

1251
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.439
um, uh, whereas, um, the language of moral disgust

1252
01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.240
might be more prominent in, in, um, the rhetoric

1253
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.589
of social liberals, right? Um, uh, AND that's consistent

1254
01:08:24.589 --> 01:08:29.470
with, um, uh, sexual disgust and pathogen disgust, um,

1255
01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:34.240
being more closely tied to threats, particularly pathogen disgust.

1256
01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.279
Um, AS opposed to moral disgust where it is

1257
01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.640
the, the set of rules, the abstractions, um, that

1258
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.080
are that are being threatened rather than any direct

1259
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.850
imminent harm, right? So, um, uh. You know, around

1260
01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:52.049
the world tragically, uh, you know, the 21st century

1261
01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:56.359
is, is witness to an enormous resurgence in xenophobia,

1262
01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:00.089
um, uh, um, you know, brought about in part

1263
01:09:00.089 --> 01:09:04.129
by the large migration flows which, um, which war,

1264
01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:08.439
violence, deprivation and economic inequality have have spurred, right?

1265
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:13.609
Um, AND that xenophobia often is couched in in

1266
01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:19.109
the language of outsiders being a threat, right? And,

1267
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.899
and, um, Quite commonly, the threat is seen both

1268
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:28.939
as the threat of violence, um, and the threat

1269
01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:32.950
of disease, right? Um, OR of um uh the,

1270
01:09:32.959 --> 01:09:37.020
the intersection of sexuality and violence, right? So. Um,

1271
01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:42.100
uh, uh, YOU know, those outsiders, they are, um,

1272
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:45.180
you know, they're bringing disease into our country. They're,

1273
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.759
um, uh, they, they, they're, you know, they're, they're

1274
01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:51.069
posing a threat to, um, you know, the innocence

1275
01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:55.109
in our society and so on, right? Um. And

1276
01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:58.959
that language often resonates more strongly with social conservatives

1277
01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:01.640
than it does with social liberals because their starting

1278
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.359
point is a premise that the world is more

1279
01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:07.399
dangerous. But as I said, that the actual political

1280
01:10:07.399 --> 01:10:11.000
psychology evidence as to whether social conservatives are more

1281
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.160
threat reactive than social liberals, this is an area

1282
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.020
of ongoing debate. In our own research we have

1283
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.620
found evidence supportive of that, but um we're just,

1284
01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.149
you know, a tiny drop in the bucket.

1285
01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.700
Right. So I have one last question then, and

1286
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.180
still on the topic of pathogen avoidance. What explains

1287
01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.399
the different reactions of liberals and conservatives to the

1288
01:10:33.399 --> 01:10:37.089
COVID-19 pandemic? Does it have anything to do with

1289
01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:39.060
what we've just been talking about?

1290
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:41.620
Yeah, these things are related and, and here this

1291
01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.740
is really um Theodore Seymour's work. This was the,

1292
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.560
the, the, the, the principal components of his doctoral

1293
01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.899
dissertation and it's work that he continues to do

1294
01:10:49.899 --> 01:10:54.580
today, um looking at uh this relationship between political

1295
01:10:54.580 --> 01:11:00.220
orientation and reactions to threat. Um, AND based on

1296
01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.580
what I just said about, uh, you know, social

1297
01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.819
conservatives being more threat reactive than social liberals and

1298
01:11:06.819 --> 01:11:10.220
about, um, you know, pathogen disgust being, uh, a

1299
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.700
prominent in political rhetoric on the right, um, you

1300
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.419
would think that here in the United States, it

1301
01:11:15.419 --> 01:11:18.529
would have been the social conservatives who were, um,

1302
01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.700
you know, who were up in arms about the

1303
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.339
possibility of a pandemic, and then when the pandemic

1304
01:11:24.339 --> 01:11:26.899
arrived, who would have been the most stringent in

1305
01:11:26.899 --> 01:11:32.290
embracing and Um, uh, enforcing the, the rules designed

1306
01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:34.209
to limit the spread of disease and in fact,

1307
01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:37.919
of course, the opposite occurred, right? So, um, uh,

1308
01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:42.040
when you look at a population level, um, uh,

1309
01:11:42.049 --> 01:11:45.919
the, the push back against public health measures, um,

1310
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:50.259
was strongest in socially conservative areas. Um, AND the,

1311
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:53.629
the, um, you know, the following of those public

1312
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:57.430
health regulations and mandates was, was more consistent in

1313
01:11:57.430 --> 01:12:00.950
socially liberal areas and tragically, um, the result was

1314
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:03.830
differences in per capita mortality, right? So, um, you

1315
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:06.509
know, we, we know, um, on a, on a

1316
01:12:06.509 --> 01:12:11.069
county by county basis, um. Uh, YOU know, how

1317
01:12:11.069 --> 01:12:13.589
people vote, right? That's all public information in the

1318
01:12:13.589 --> 01:12:15.750
United States, and we can see that and we

1319
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.270
know as a consequence, you know, where social conservatives

1320
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:20.069
are, where social liberals are, and we know what

1321
01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.629
the, the, the, the, the mortality rates due to

1322
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:26.470
COVID-19 were, right? And any casual observer of politics

1323
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.430
in the United States would this wouldn't surprise them,

1324
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.350
right, because they the push back against the public

1325
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:35.669
health measures was was vociferous and prominent from social

1326
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:39.029
conservatives. So why did this happen? Is, is the

1327
01:12:39.029 --> 01:12:41.819
basic theory wrong or is the world more complicated?

1328
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:45.779
Um, AND the answer is the second, um. So

1329
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:52.339
When Theos Amo looked more carefully in the United

1330
01:12:52.339 --> 01:12:57.680
States. Because Liberal and social liberal and social conservative

1331
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.359
are simply poles on a spectrum, right? And certainly

1332
01:13:00.359 --> 01:13:03.680
political party affiliation is not isomorphic with those polls

1333
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.379
on the spectrum, right. Um, When um uh Theo

1334
01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:14.129
looked more carefully at um Democrats, people who supported

1335
01:13:14.129 --> 01:13:19.020
the Democratic Party in um uh US elections. And

1336
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.850
measured their political orientation, not on the basis of

1337
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.370
their party affiliation, but on the basis of their

1338
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.689
views on a variety of social issues, things like

1339
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:30.120
abortion and gay marriage, and so on, right? What

1340
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.830
he saw was that The socially conservative Democrats. Took

1341
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:40.250
more COVID-19 prophylactic precautions, right? So they, they, they

1342
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.000
took more behavioral measures to avoid the possibility of

1343
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:48.120
um contracting the disease, then did more socially liberal

1344
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.509
Democrats. So within the Democratic Party. The prediction holds

1345
01:13:53.939 --> 01:13:58.770
Well, Sorry, talking for over an hour now. Um.

1346
01:13:59.629 --> 01:14:00.350
No problem.

1347
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:03.979
Um. So what's going on with individuals who voted

1348
01:14:03.979 --> 01:14:06.500
for Republican candidates and self-identify as members of the

1349
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.169
Republican Party? What what what's happening there? And the

1350
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:13.200
answer is they are threat reactive. Um, THEY'RE just

1351
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.700
responding to different threats in part because those, um,

1352
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:21.149
uh, the, the situation was framed for them by

1353
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:28.310
prominent leaders of their political party and influential individuals

1354
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:32.669
in their social circles. The threats were were framed.

1355
01:14:33.459 --> 01:14:35.479
Not in terms of the threat of disease. That

1356
01:14:35.479 --> 01:14:39.560
threat was downplayed, um, right? It was downplayed um

1357
01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.120
from the White House. It was downplayed by, you

1358
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.330
know, Um, socially conservative media influencers. Um, OH, it's

1359
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:49.009
not that big a deal, you know, it's gonna

1360
01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:51.879
pass soon. Uh, IT'S no worse than the flu.

1361
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.640
Um, YOU know, I choose not to wear a

1362
01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:02.390
mask. These are all things that we heard from

1363
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:06.479
um from leaders and prominent voices on the right.

1364
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:13.830
Um, And we didn't hear, uh, you know, They

1365
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:18.029
don't have enough um. Space in the morgue in,

1366
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.799
you know, in New York, they, they have, you

1367
01:15:19.799 --> 01:15:23.040
know, refrigerated trucks parked outside the hospitals because people

1368
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.569
are dying. At such high rates that um they

1369
01:15:27.569 --> 01:15:30.609
simply can't keep the bodies um uh anywhere, right?

1370
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.439
I mean, and those were not the the um

1371
01:15:33.609 --> 01:15:36.689
the messages that were being promulgated on the right.

1372
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.990
Instead, the message that that we're being disseminated were,

1373
01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.660
this is a threat to your civil liberties, right?

1374
01:15:43.799 --> 01:15:46.240
Um, THESE people are trying to stop you from

1375
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.720
exercising your rights, importantly, including Um, the right of

1376
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.839
assembly, the right to gather, and, and the right

1377
01:15:52.839 --> 01:15:57.830
to worship. And those are threats, right? Um, YOU,

1378
01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:01.669
you know, your, your basic rights are being infringed

1379
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:07.890
upon, right? Um, AND These public health mandates were

1380
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:13.589
framed in terms of um. Uh, uh, AN excuse

1381
01:16:13.589 --> 01:16:16.109
being used by people on the left to try

1382
01:16:16.109 --> 01:16:20.089
and regulate social behavior and and move the country

1383
01:16:20.589 --> 01:16:24.509
toward a socialist orientation in which the government um

1384
01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:26.899
uh plays a much larger role in people's lives.

1385
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.700
And they were very real. You might say that's

1386
01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.459
a very debatable proposition and in fact the people

1387
01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:38.589
promulgating those um public health measures didn't have any

1388
01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:40.779
such political agenda. I think that's where the facts

1389
01:16:40.779 --> 01:16:45.819
probably lie, but um but what is incontestable is

1390
01:16:45.819 --> 01:16:48.919
that the public health measures inflicted real economic costs

1391
01:16:48.919 --> 01:16:51.850
on many people, right? The loss of their livelihoods.

1392
01:16:52.479 --> 01:16:54.419
Many small businesses went out of went out of

1393
01:16:54.419 --> 01:16:57.020
business entirely. It's still the case here in Los

1394
01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.850
Angeles that um There are areas that were once,

1395
01:17:01.009 --> 01:17:05.290
you know, booming small business locations where they're empty

1396
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.209
storefronts now, right? Those, those, those places disappeared during

1397
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:09.890
the pandemic and they and they haven't come back,

1398
01:17:10.009 --> 01:17:13.410
right? Restaurants, for example, um, you know, took an

1399
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.979
enormous hit. So there's a very real economic cost

1400
01:17:16.979 --> 01:17:18.620
to this and so when voices on the right

1401
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.700
are framing this in terms of socialism, um, you

1402
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.810
know, that might be a misconstrual of the situation,

1403
01:17:23.859 --> 01:17:26.620
but when they're framing it in terms of, um,

1404
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:29.910
you know, an economic threat, that's very real. So

1405
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:37.660
What Theo found was that It's not that Individuals

1406
01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:41.140
who self-identified as Republican were not reactive to threats.

1407
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.970
It's that they were reactive to a different set

1408
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.979
of threats than than the disease threats, because that

1409
01:17:45.979 --> 01:17:48.339
was the way that the the pandemic was being

1410
01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:53.379
framed for them. Subsequently, um uh uh Theo headed

1411
01:17:53.379 --> 01:17:56.899
a project up looking around the world at behaviors

1412
01:17:56.899 --> 01:18:00.419
um uh uh disease avoidance behaviors during the pandemic.

1413
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:05.430
And here because conservative liberal is, as I said,

1414
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.799
very much, you know, um, local in terms of

1415
01:18:08.799 --> 01:18:12.680
what it means, right, you know, different, different political

1416
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.959
systems, different value systems, different countries, right? So so

1417
01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:18.120
conservative and and liberal or maybe not the best

1418
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.370
terms instead, um, Theo looked at traditionalism, right? So

1419
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:25.819
how much do you think we should embrace. The

1420
01:18:25.819 --> 01:18:28.020
ways that we imagine life was run in the

1421
01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.620
past versus experiment with new social forms, which is

1422
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.220
really a a broader Conceptual basis than the conservative

1423
01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.600
liberal divide and and what Theo found around the

1424
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.439
world is is um that uh the the the

1425
01:18:41.439 --> 01:18:43.750
basic theory is supported that people who are more

1426
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:48.029
oriented to to tradition. Took more steps to avoid

1427
01:18:48.029 --> 01:18:51.189
COVID-19 than people who are less oriented to tradition,

1428
01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:54.399
consistent with the idea that the orientation of the

1429
01:18:54.399 --> 01:18:58.200
past is a reflection of a desire for security

1430
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.120
in a world that one sees as dangerous and

1431
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.890
that the willingness to experiment is a reflection of

1432
01:19:03.279 --> 01:19:05.479
um a view that the world is a relatively

1433
01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:07.500
safe place and we can try new things, right?

1434
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.359
So overall, the basic thesis is supported. The United

1435
01:19:11.359 --> 01:19:13.080
States is kind of an outlier in this and

1436
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:16.229
and and really. In part that's because of, uh,

1437
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:19.319
you know, our own unique history, but in part

1438
01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:21.350
it's because of the way that the situation was

1439
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:23.189
framed by prominent voices on the right.

1440
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:29.109
Great, so Doctor Fessler, just before we go, would

1441
01:19:29.109 --> 01:19:31.350
you like to tell people where they can find

1442
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.120
your work on the internet?

1443
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:36.430
Sure, um, they can just Google my name, Daniel

1444
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:40.830
Fessler, um, uh, uh, I have a personal website,

1445
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:45.279
pretty sure the URL is danielmtfesler.com, but um, you

1446
01:19:45.279 --> 01:19:46.830
have to check on that. I don't look at

1447
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:50.959
my own website very much, um. Uh, I'm easy

1448
01:19:50.959 --> 01:19:53.549
to find and I'm a big believer in open

1449
01:19:53.549 --> 01:19:57.500
science. Um, I, I think, you know, while the

1450
01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.669
information age has brought us many ills, um, one

1451
01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:01.390
of the things that it really has the potential

1452
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.779
to do is democratize knowledge, you know, I thank

1453
01:20:03.779 --> 01:20:05.500
you for the opportunity to talk to you and

1454
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.500
and your viewers and, and share knowledge this way

1455
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.709
and speculation, conjecture conjecture also. But, uh, everything I

1456
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:13.790
published is on my website, so, um, folks can

1457
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:15.939
find it there. Um, GO to my personal website,

1458
01:20:16.069 --> 01:20:18.540

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.549
thoughts about these issues. I think, um, you know,

1468
01:20:39.959 --> 01:20:41.520
there's a lot of information out there, there's a

1469
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.560
lot of misinformation out there being a critical consumer

1470
01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.319
is really important.

1471
01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:49.979
