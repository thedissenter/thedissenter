00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.489
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Labs, and

3
00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:09.210
today I'm joined by Doctor Robert Kruger. He is

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.130
distinguished McKnight University professor in the Department of Psychology

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.520
at the University of Minnesota. And today, we're going

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.930
to talk about the classification of disorders in psychiatry,

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.399
the hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology, personality, uh, subjective well-being,

8
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.330
and other related topics. So, Doctor Kruger, welcome to

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.009
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.279
Yeah, thanks again for inviting me.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.400
So, let's start by talking a little bit about

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.060
nosology, psychiatric nosology or how the classification of mental

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.720
disorders is done in psychiatry. So, what do you

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.799
think of the way psychiatric nosology works today?

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.020
Um, SO I suppose we could start with the

16
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.700
sort of um official noseologies, I guess that's where

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.228
you're headed with this question. So, you know, descriptive

18
00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:10.948
psychiatry has a rich history, um, and has functioned

19
00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:13.228
historically in a way that's similar to how medicine

20
00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:16.819
is functioned, which is to say that clinical observation

21
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.308
is the bedrock of the classification system, right? So

22
00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:24.669
clinicians encounter patients. They see patients who have similar

23
00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:26.669
features and then based on that they start to

24
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:30.769
describe criteria for You know, patients who present with

25
00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.989
similar kinds of complaints or features and You know,

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.220
throughout the history of medicine, that kind of approach

27
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.720
has been fairly productive, especially during the 20th century.

28
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.690
Because many of those syndromes were fairly tight in

29
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.930
their organization and had an ideology that was fairly

30
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.440
circumscribed, right? So for example, you can encounter patients

31
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.849
who have similar features. You can use 20th century

32
00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.059
style technology to, you know, examine potential correlates, right,

33
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:01.769
like for instance looking at blood samples under a

34
00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.849
microscope and so on and find a key pathogen,

35
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.400
right, or some sort of specific factor that then

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.500
leads to this, you know, presentation of symptoms. And

37
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.509
I don't mean to oversimplify, you know. Semantic medicine,

38
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.479
because there are many things in that realm that

39
00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.160
are considerably more complicated in terms of their ideology

40
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.830
and pathophysiology. But, you know, to make a long

41
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910
story short, that that's the paradigm, right, that has

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.029
influenced psychiatric classification in a way that's similar to

43
00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.270
medicine, in as much as psychiatry is in fact

44
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.059
a branch of medicine. So that has, you know,

45
00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.779
that results in the kinds of classification systems that

46
00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.300
most people are familiar with that are issued by

47
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.199
authoritative bodies, most notably the American Psychiatric Association's, you

48
00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.860
know, diagnostic and Statistical Manual, or PSM and the

49
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.250
very similarly organized um international classification of Disease, which

50
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.529
is published by the World Health Organization. Right, and

51
00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:01.440
so in those systems, diagnoses are arranged into categories,

52
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.250
um, and those categories are delineated by criteria, um.

53
00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.880
And the idea basically is that these things exist

54
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.539
in nature as categories and based on the presence

55
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:16.699
or absence of a fixed number of criteria from

56
00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.380
a more extensive set, right, for example, there may

57
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.410
be 9 criteria and the threshold for diagnosis having

58
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.960
5. Using that kind of rubric, right, the clinicians.

59
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.470
Meant to utilize that kind of system to arrive

60
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.639
at an appropriate diagnosis. And then comparing potential diagnostic

61
00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.559
labels, the clinician is meant to engage in the

62
00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:41.460
process of differential diagnosis, right? So there may be

63
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.240
similar presentations but subtle differences, right? And the process

64
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.589
of diagnosis is to determine what the most optimal

65
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:55.300
and, and generally speaking singular, right, um, diagnostic label

66
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.589
would be for any given clinical presentation. So that

67
00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.720
that's the system that sort of exists um in

68
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.190
psychiatry, and that system has wide influence over all

69
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.600
mental health disciplines.

70
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.130
So one highly debated question has to do with

71
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.019
what a mental disorder is. Uh, SO, what is

72
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.779
it? I mean, what is your approach to this

73
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.709
question? What are your thoughts about it?

74
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.429
Maybe you could say a little more specifically, my

75
00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:30.149
thoughts about what specifically, maybe.

76
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.040
Uh, I, I mean, the question of what a

77
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.000
mental disorder is, what it means.

78
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.220
That's a very deep question. It's hard to answer

79
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.100
it in a succinct manner because many brilliant people

80
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.619
have written about this issue and tried to come

81
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:51.630
up with an internally consistent definition, um. Uh, THANKS

82
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.470
to the prompting of my colleague and friend Colin

83
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.489
DeYoung, it is something that I've tried to think

84
00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:58.910
about and write about more recently, and Colin and

85
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.630
I have a perspective on this that we call

86
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.910
the cybernetic perspective, um, and the idea there basically

87
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.899
is that when Uh, an organism that's goal directed

88
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.899
like, like a human being, right, um, encounters circumstances

89
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.209
that Uh, are incompatible with their goals, they often

90
00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:23.420
experience a sense of distress or misalignment, and then,

91
00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.399
you know, it's that kind of process of encountering

92
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:28.880
things that are incompatible with one's goals that leads

93
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.339
to the kind of distress, right? That might be

94
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.390
the essence of You know, um, not feeling well

95
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.320
in a psychological sense, um. And then psychopathology from

96
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.959
that perspective emerges when the uh person, you know,

97
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.959
people as an example here, right? Like when the

98
00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:52.540
person is unable to generate novel strategies or approaches

99
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.279
um to realize a different set of goals or

100
00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.859
to realize a different way of approaching their goals.

101
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.459
And so I think that's that's kind of how

102
00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:03.720
we've started to think about it. So similar to

103
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.750
other people's, you know, definitions. There's, you know, the

104
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.329
symptom presentation per se, but that's not, you know,

105
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.070
sufficient to say that psychopathology is present. There also

106
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.980
has to be a thwartedness about it, right? So

107
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.299
I guess that that's been our perspective, but most

108
00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:23.380
perspectives have key similarities, right? So a typical definition

109
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.540
is not just that there are symptoms present, but

110
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.420
also that those symptoms are debilitating, right? So there

111
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.519
has to be, for instance, social and occupational dysfunction.

112
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.010
It goes along with the sense of um. With

113
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.970
the presentation of problematic, you know, psychiatric symptoms.

114
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.170
So, you mentioned, uh, Doctor Colin the Young. I

115
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.500
met him on the show twice and we talked

116
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.940
a lot about personality traits, for example, and their

117
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.730
relationship to psychopathology. So, uh, do individual differences have

118
00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:04.010
any bearing on how we understand and study psychopathology,

119
00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.140
and if so, what is the relationship here?

120
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.970
Right, so I guess your question is generally about

121
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.929
the relationship between personality and psychopathology. Again, you picked

122
00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:17.929
a very deep topic on which there's a tremendous

123
00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:22.950
literature. Um, I guess my thinking about it is

124
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.750
that these are very closely related concepts because we

125
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.750
sort of know this um from a number of

126
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.190
different angles, right? So um based on just phenotypic

127
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.230
presentation we could call it, right? So we could

128
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.029
say that's the literature on personality, the literature on

129
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:44.709
psychopathology. These literatures have evolved somewhat independently, um, and

130
00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:47.230
the assessments that have been developed from both perspectives

131
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.890
are. Uh, PUTTING people into individual difference, you know,

132
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.329
rankings in a way that's very similar, right? So

133
00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:56.649
a personality questionnaire that's meant to get at a

134
00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:01.130
neuroticism trait often has, you know, items on it

135
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.209
that are very similar to the items on something

136
00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:09.149
like a symptom checklist for anxiety and depression. So

137
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.350
it, it may be the case that the, the

138
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.350
sort of de facto distinction has to do with

139
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.750
something like time scale, right? So personality traits are

140
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.670
often thought of as Reasonably consistent and enduring, um.

141
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.809
And psychopathology is often thought of as having more

142
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:29.690
um time varying features, right, so that it's not

143
00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:33.130
typical for a person to be continually in an

144
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.340
episode of psychopathology, but rather people sort of wax

145
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.380
and wane in their presentation over time based on

146
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.419
what's happening in their lives. So that's probably the

147
00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.049
kind of key distinction, something about the time scale,

148
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.539
but You know, speaking, you know, kind of clinically,

149
00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:53.030
uh, it's, it's very difficult for me to think

150
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.729
about a patient, you know, or a client. In

151
00:08:56.729 --> 00:09:00.950
a way that doesn't recognize their dispositional features. Uh,

152
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.469
EVEN if their current functioning is somewhat different from

153
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:07.859
their typical functioning, right? It, it, their symptom profile,

154
00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:09.469
the way in which they're presenting with things is

155
00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:13.700
embedded in their dispositions. So there's a very intimate

156
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.820
relationship um between personality and psychopathology and the way

157
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.650
I tend to think about it, and this is,

158
00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:21.460
I think, well supported by the evidence is that

159
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.679
personality is kind of the organizing structure. For the

160
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:27.640
presentation of symptoms, um, but I don't want to

161
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.330
go as far as to say the concepts are

162
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.479
entirely fungible or interchangeable because there are some important

163
00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:37.739
distinctions historically between the concepts. Um, SO hopefully that

164
00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:40.330
kind of addresses your question in a succinct way.

165
00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:44.460
Mhm. So could you tell us about the hierarchical

166
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.609
taxonomy of psychopathology project? I mean, what is it,

167
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.789
what is it about, uh, how did it start

168
00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:55.659
and what are its goals exactly?

169
00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:01.869
Right, so the high top, you know, the hierarchical

170
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:07.340
taxonomy psychology project started, um. Almost a decade ago

171
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:12.679
now, um. And the way it got started really

172
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.599
was that, um, my, you know, colleague and and

173
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.559
friend Roman Kotov, right, had this idea that plenty

174
00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:23.000
of people were doing this work on, um, trying

175
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.039
to figure out kind of the structure of psychopathology.

176
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.559
And, and that work kind of had to do

177
00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:31.679
with figuring out if there was consistency to patterns

178
00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:36.650
of comorbidity that were shown among DSM defined entities.

179
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.510
Um, SO going back to our discussion of, you

180
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.859
know, the DSM and categorical classification. In spite of

181
00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:47.780
the sort of basic underlying premise that you can

182
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.419
choose the most optimal, you know, single categorical descriptive

183
00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:54.770
label for any given patient. You know, literature had

184
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.130
emerged showing that that's very difficult to do practically

185
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.570
speaking, um, Particularly in psychiatric epidemiology, where the goal

186
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.349
is to figure out You know, the prevalence of

187
00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:09.750
different kinds of categorical diagnosis in the general population.

188
00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:14.950
So those studies um did away with the attempts

189
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.349
to have very strict hierarchical exclusionary rules among the

190
00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:20.469
categories because it's very hard to apply them in

191
00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:24.789
a way that makes conceptual or clinical sense. Um,

192
00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:27.570
SO instead you kind of assign the diagnostic labels

193
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.859
that seem appropriate for the person's, um, You know,

194
00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:34.179
complaints or presentation or endorsement of, you know, criteria

195
00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.179
in an interview. And so you get these patterns

196
00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:40.739
of comorbidity, um, we could talk a little bit

197
00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:44.349
about comorbidity, right? What does that term really mean?

198
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.989
Um. It's a little bit of a misnomer in

199
00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:52.070
my way of thinking about it because comorbidity just,

200
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.700
you know, means that you have to, you know,

201
00:11:55.989 --> 00:11:59.940
diagnoses at the same time. Given whatever time frame

202
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.409
it is you're considering the comorbidity in terms of,

203
00:12:02.859 --> 00:12:04.859
this could happen just because two things have very

204
00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:09.299
high base rates, right? So, um, you know, plenty

205
00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:12.059
of people who meet criteria for depression are also

206
00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:16.539
myopic because these are commonly observed conditions. You can

207
00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:19.580
figure out the prevalence of the joint condition just

208
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.900
from the product of the base rates of the

209
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.940
two conditions, right? So the base rate of A

210
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.150
multiplied by the base rate of B gives you.

211
00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:30.619
The probability that someone's gonna have both things if

212
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:34.739
they're not correlated with each other. But the phenomenon

213
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:38.340
right in psychiatric epidemiology that had been observed is

214
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.820
more um that these diagnoses are correlated with each

215
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.859
other. So that means that they're co-occurring at rates

216
00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:48.940
that are greater than would be predicted simply from

217
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.780
the product of the base rates. So what you

218
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.460
see in those kinds of psychiatric epi data is

219
00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.580
persons who have um diagnosis, uh well I should

220
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.099
say like, you see that there's um correlations essentially

221
00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:06.219
among diagnoses. So you have many more people with

222
00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.409
multiple conditions than you would get if you just

223
00:13:08.739 --> 00:13:11.750
worked out all the base rate products, right? And

224
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.289
it's those patterns of correlation that kind of gave

225
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:19.130
rise to the um To the structural literature that

226
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.119
was the initial inspiration for the high top consortium

227
00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:24.859
where it, it becomes clear if you start to

228
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:27.809
study this stuff that there are patterns that are

229
00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:30.840
both um hierarchical in terms of the sort of

230
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:36.690
organization of individual differences and psychopathological propensities as well

231
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.530
as dimensional, right? So let's, we can work through

232
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.570
those two concepts a little bit here if you

233
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.250
want, right? So, um. The idea of hierarchy is

234
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.409
very familiar to researchers and individual differences in areas

235
00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:53.849
like personality and mental abilities, um, and it's basically

236
00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:56.369
that if you look at patterns of correlations, a

237
00:13:56.369 --> 00:14:00.229
good way to model them is from very fine-grained

238
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:03.669
individual difference variables. So in in the world of

239
00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:07.229
psychopathology that could be particular symptom cluster is right

240
00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:10.659
like anhedonia, for example, like something that's pretty specific,

241
00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:14.030
but then those things have patterns of correlation that

242
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.700
are pretty psychologically meaningful. And and the psychological meaning

243
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.960
of those correlations is distinctive from the DSM's organizational

244
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.559
structure. That gets really interesting, right back to the

245
00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:30.200
question about personality and psychopathology. So to make a

246
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.190
long story short, if you start to look at

247
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.159
patterns of correlation among psychopathological experiences, you get a

248
00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:40.570
structure that's very similar to the structure of human

249
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:45.309
personality. Um, MAYBE seen through a darker lens, right,

250
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.890
because you're asking about the maladaptive aspects of personality

251
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.049
expressions. But you kind of see something similar to

252
00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:57.570
the well-known big five, just the maladaptive aspects of

253
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.890
those big five tendencies. So there's pretty good evidence

254
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.530
now that that's the structure of psychopathology, right? It's

255
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.479
not what the DSM imposes, right, or claims, um,

256
00:15:09.489 --> 00:15:11.169
which would be something more like this kind of

257
00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:15.570
linear organization of categories and these computerly separate chapters

258
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.059
that are studied in these distinctive literatures. Rather, the

259
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:25.489
patterns, right, of correlation among mental disorder diagnoses look

260
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:28.929
a lot like the patterns of personality that you

261
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:32.460
see in the general population. So, again, getting back

262
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.809
to high top, the the way that that effort

263
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:39.010
came about. WAS to say that, OK, like a

264
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.929
bunch of us were doing this work, um, we,

265
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.809
we knew each other and we're publishing productively kind

266
00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:47.919
of independent groups, but it made sense to bring

267
00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:52.479
everybody together in a consortium, particularly to, to, um,

268
00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:57.330
articulate a more comprehensive and empirically based classification system

269
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.789
that wasn't constrained by the traditions of the DSM,

270
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.530
right? So in DSM basically through fiat, right, like

271
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:08.049
by definition. Just because that's how authorities have put

272
00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:09.809
together the manual, these things are supposed to be

273
00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:13.960
categories. But they might not be. So that's the

274
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.349
hierarchical part, right? These things tend to be organized

275
00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:19.159
from very narrow specific sent clusters all the way

276
00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:22.479
up to broad individual difference variables that you might

277
00:16:22.479 --> 00:16:25.869
think of as a spectrum of interrelated conditions. And

278
00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:28.229
in addition, there's a, there's a related literature that

279
00:16:28.229 --> 00:16:31.109
tries to ask, OK, if we have these patterns

280
00:16:31.109 --> 00:16:34.789
of symptoms. What kind of a model would fit

281
00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:39.229
the patterning we're observing in data? This stuff gets

282
00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:42.580
a little technical, but But basically there's ways to

283
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:49.150
compare models that um Have the underlying distribution as

284
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.109
more categorical or um discrete would be maybe a

285
00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:55.250
better word for it, right, that there are discrete

286
00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:00.609
groupings of probability masses in the underlying distribution. Versus

287
00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:04.770
that it's more continuous and smooth. So that's another

288
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.199
strong empirical basis for the perspective that is um

289
00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.040
sort of underlying the high top effort, right? So,

290
00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:13.098
you know, to make a long story short, you

291
00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:18.449
can formally compare dimensional and categorical models of psychopathological

292
00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:22.050
variation. When you do this formal comparison, there's a

293
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.130
substantial literature showing that things are generally better fit

294
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.369
by dimensional models than they are fit by more

295
00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:33.359
discrete or categorical kinds of models. So those two

296
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:36.699
robust empirical observations, right, the things tend to be

297
00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:39.579
dimensional in the world of psychopathology, and that they're

298
00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:42.819
pretty well organized into a hierarchy, form the basis

299
00:17:42.819 --> 00:17:45.979
for the high top effort and provide an empirically

300
00:17:45.979 --> 00:17:51.160
based approaches to classification of psychopathology. Um, THAT'S an

301
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.770
alternative to the constraints, right, that exists primarily by

302
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.530
tradition and, you know, psychiatric methodology. Maybe one, go

303
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.000
ahead.

304
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.410
No, no, go ahead, yes, just finish what you're

305
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:04.810
going to

306
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.800
say. Well, I was just gonna say like how

307
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.650
has evolved? High has evolved into a situation where

308
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.680
there are sort of Well, there are, there are

309
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.869
two related efforts, right? There's the high top um

310
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.599
research consortium, right, which is people working on particular

311
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.680
topics inspired by the high top model. There are

312
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.339
work groups, for instance, on genetics and And neuroscience

313
00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.020
and so on and so forth, right, where the

314
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.020
idea is to take those fields and merge them

315
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.979
with the high top perspective on phenotypic organization of

316
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.680
psychopathology. And that's the consortium part, but there's also

317
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.479
a society that's formed now, um, right, so a

318
00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:42.520
scientific society where the idea is that there will

319
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.250
be annual meetings and people pay dues and they,

320
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.959
you know, come to the meetings and present their

321
00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:51.109
research, um, and I would encourage people to go

322
00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:53.800
to the high top web page. Um, I'm sure

323
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.079
we can put the URL into the show notes

324
00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:58.560
or something like this, but if you're interested in

325
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.430
this kind of thing, it's possible to get involved

326
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.569
in. Either or both, the society, right, which is

327
00:19:05.569 --> 00:19:10.209
again like a scientific organization. Um, OR the consortium,

328
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.420
which is, you know, a, a more of a

329
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.380
group focused on the science and scholarship, um. So

330
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.670
the new members are always welcome and I would

331
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.829
encourage people who are interested in what I'm talking

332
00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:24.569
about here to think about joining. That's my point.

333
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:31.050
So in this taxonomy, what are symptoms and how

334
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.849
do you deal with them and what are the

335
00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:37.609
differences between symptoms and treats?

336
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.800
Yeah, that's an excellent question. I think that's challenging

337
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.560
in the way that we were discussing earlier in

338
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.760
this conversation, but in, in short, um, that distinction

339
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.359
is pretty fuzzy. It probably has something to do

340
00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:53.709
with the time scale on which these things are

341
00:19:53.709 --> 00:19:57.260
presented. But both kinds of constructs are sitting within

342
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.109
the high top hierarchy, right? So traits again are

343
00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:04.020
more like a disposition to engage in a behavior

344
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.459
over time, right, kind of a, a probability, right,

345
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.719
that a person's gonna be in a given state

346
00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:12.140
at any given point in time over some aggregate

347
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.420
amount of time, um, whereas symptoms might be thought

348
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.979
of as more like things that change more from

349
00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:21.660
time to time. So classic examples, right, are things

350
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.160
like um self-harm, right? So. Self-harm tends not to

351
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.680
be um entirely trait-like, although some people can be

352
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.119
very persistent in their self-harming tendencies. There's more variation

353
00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:37.800
over time and how intensely people are engaging in

354
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.390
that specific and circumscribed set of, you know, very

355
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.479
troubling behaviors. Whereas the disposition, right, to want to

356
00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:49.160
harm oneself, um, is coming from, you know, neuroticism

357
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.640
and distress and, you know, qualities like that that

358
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.560
the person might have as a disposition over longer

359
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.180
chunks of time. Um, SO that I think is

360
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.780
kind of the distinction within high top, right? Symptoms

361
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.900
are more like things that come and go and

362
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.579
traits are more like things that are more consistent

363
00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:10.130
over time, but they're meaningfully related to each other,

364
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.449
because the probability of having a symptom emerges from

365
00:21:14.449 --> 00:21:17.020
the position that one has on a, you know,

366
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.489
trait like construct. And the key to moving this

367
00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:26.209
discussion forward is um fine-grained longitudinal data, um, which

368
00:21:26.209 --> 00:21:28.959
many people involved in Hightop are very interested in,

369
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.530
challenging data to collect, but kind of the key

370
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.859
to unraveling these time scales. That makes sense? So

371
00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:37.890
like if you really want to understand in in

372
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.530
an empirically based way the different time scales of

373
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.290
different human propensities to different behaviors, you got to

374
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.930
study people in an intensive longitudinal fashion. And you

375
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.329
got to study them closely over long over, you

376
00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:54.400
know, both shorter time frames and longer time frames

377
00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:57.770
to figure out what things are, what kind of

378
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.489
behaviors tend to be like this, right? Like they

379
00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:01.719
come and go, and what kind of behaviors are

380
00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:07.119
more consistent. And that gets um. It's very important,

381
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.729
but it's very challenging because you can imagine that

382
00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.410
different people, right, are gonna have different patterns and

383
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.250
so there's just a lot of different possibilities within

384
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.760
that space, and it's an active area of research

385
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.489
at this time.

386
00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:23.900
Mhm. And how do you approach etiology and um

387
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.430
causal influences including genetic and environmental influences in this

388
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.630
model of psychopathology?

389
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.869
So ideology specifically, is that what you're thinking about

390
00:22:35.869 --> 00:22:41.670
here? Like, yeah, so that, that's um. You you

391
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.390
really hit on kind of the key topics and

392
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.109
the most challenging areas, but sure, like we can

393
00:22:46.109 --> 00:22:49.390
try to get some um purchase here on the

394
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.849
concept of etiology, right? So when I think about,

395
00:22:51.989 --> 00:22:55.180
you know, ideology, I'm thinking about it in terms

396
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.550
of more distal causes and also more proximal causes.

397
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.290
Um, AND I think that that distinction between things

398
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.819
that are further in the past and things that

399
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:07.020
are more, you know, close by in the person's,

400
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.209
you know, history. Um, IT'S pretty important. So when

401
00:23:11.209 --> 00:23:15.010
I think about the distal etiology, um, I'm often

402
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.609
thinking about, well, genomics, right? Um, I think there's,

403
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:23.339
you know, plenty of evidence that, um, A key

404
00:23:23.339 --> 00:23:26.260
part of the distal etiology of psychopathology is sitting

405
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.420
in the human genome, um, which absent something terrible

406
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.900
happening to people like a radiation, right, is gonna

407
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.099
be consistent through your life, um. And those um

408
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.449
You know, causal factors can be studied now given

409
00:23:42.449 --> 00:23:48.520
modern molecular genetic technologies, um. And so that's a

410
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.599
key part of the distal ideology of psychopathology, right,

411
00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:54.510
is the complement that a person has of um

412
00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:59.959
genomic variants that In a very complex and multifaceted

413
00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:02.079
way, right? So we know that from genomics too,

414
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.680
right, that none of these causes are very discrete

415
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.880
and specific. Rather, there's a bunch of different segments

416
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.349
of DNA, oftentimes at the level of even single

417
00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:14.079
nucleotide polymorphisms, they kind of add up to give

418
00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:16.719
a person a position on a trait like, you

419
00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:20.239
know, kind of dimension. Um, THAT is probably a

420
00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:22.520
key part of the distal ideology, but that's of

421
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.880
course, only part of the equation because it's not

422
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.479
just DNA as, you know, the only driving force

423
00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:34.689
behind a person's propensities to experience psychopathology. It also,

424
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.560
um, Obviously has a lot to do with environmental

425
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.770
experiences that are often correlated with, right, so this

426
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.369
gets tricky too, right? BECAUSE the environment is not

427
00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:47.449
necessarily completely independent of the genome. People are exposed

428
00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:51.410
to environments that are correlated with their genomes. Um,

429
00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:54.300
SO the gene environment correlation active also, as well

430
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.859
as the potential for gene environment interactions, right? So

431
00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:01.459
the exposures might be, um, such that the person's

432
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:05.709
genetic propensity is enhanced or um kind of suppressed

433
00:25:06.219 --> 00:25:10.260
by environmental exposures like stress experiences and so on

434
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.439
and so forth, right? Um, SO that all gets

435
00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:17.400
kind of carrying complicated, but that's unfortunately the nature

436
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.439
of the material we're dealing with, right? Psychopathology is

437
00:25:20.439 --> 00:25:24.920
not simple to study. It's multifaceted in its ideology.

438
00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:29.219
It has both distal and proximal components. Right, so

439
00:25:29.219 --> 00:25:31.030
things that are further in the past and things

440
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.949
that are more proximal and to develop a realistic

441
00:25:35.949 --> 00:25:39.349
empirically based model of how genes and environments come

442
00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:44.040
together to influence psychopathological propensities. IS obviously the holy

443
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.479
grail, right, in terms of understanding the ideology of

444
00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:50.959
psychopathology, but pretty difficult to accomplish in a kind

445
00:25:50.959 --> 00:25:57.459
of Um, tractable, manageable, replicable, scientific way. Um, NEVERTHELESS,

446
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.300
I think that's the task in front of us.

447
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.020
IS to combine technologies that are coming from genomics

448
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.540
with an intensive understanding of exposures, right, as an

449
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.939
epidemiologist might call them, right? So environmental experiences to

450
00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:16.020
articulate more um evidence-based models of how genes and

451
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.119
environments come together to influence what a person's. Particular

452
00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:22.390
symptom profile might be like at any given point

453
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.839
in time.

454
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.300
So, uh, let me ask you a different kind

455
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.310
of question now. How would the classification of mental

456
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.910
disorders look like within the framework of a hierarchical

457
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:36.819
taxonomy?

458
00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:40.750
Right, so kind of what's the diagnostic process given

459
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.510
a high top type of model, is that kind

460
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.150
of what you're asking? Yes. Yeah, so I think

461
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.380
that the key distinction to appreciate between um classical.

462
00:26:50.229 --> 00:26:54.410
DSM style differential diagnosis as the clinical task and

463
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.699
the sort of high top classification scheme as the

464
00:26:56.699 --> 00:27:01.199
clinical task. Is that in the high top scheme

465
00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:06.400
things are both dimensional and multi-dimensional, right? So we

466
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.479
could start with the classic paradigm in the way

467
00:27:08.479 --> 00:27:10.800
that you're sort of taught to do this, um,

468
00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:14.050
when you're being trained clinically, right, is You know,

469
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.380
interview the patients, take a good history, and try

470
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.060
to figure out based on the clinical data available

471
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.689
to you, the best diagnostic label. Right, best being

472
00:27:24.689 --> 00:27:27.729
defined as, OK, consider the hundreds and hundreds of

473
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.280
categories that are sitting in something like the DSM.

474
00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:35.329
Consider a careful differential diagnosis kind of um approach,

475
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:38.810
right? Like, so is this closer to You know,

476
00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:42.459
something like major depression with recurrent episodes, there's a

477
00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:46.900
closer to something like generalized anxiety disorder, even though

478
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.750
those, you know, syndromes have overlapping features. Which they

479
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.910
clearly do in terms of the, you know, criteria

480
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.949
for the disorders, but you're supposed to consider things

481
00:27:56.949 --> 00:27:59.869
like, well, how, what's the balance between, you know,

482
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.630
sort of low mood experiences and more activated, you

483
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.030
know, kind of anxiety experiences and, and you can

484
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.589
try to do this, but with real people, it

485
00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:12.469
doesn't work well. It's something I've often, I've been

486
00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:14.829
very interested in as a clinician, right? So the

487
00:28:14.829 --> 00:28:16.030
way I got to a lot of what I'm

488
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.109
interested in is trying to do this, right? Working

489
00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:24.380
with patients. Trying to be, um, you know, A

490
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.219
good student of the of the psychiatric classification type

491
00:28:27.219 --> 00:28:30.540
system, right? Trying to use it effectively to find

492
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.099
the right diagnosis and finding that it's very difficult

493
00:28:33.099 --> 00:28:38.579
to pick the one right optimal diagnostic label. So

494
00:28:38.579 --> 00:28:41.660
then turning to the more hierarchical, you know, high

495
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.369
top kind of approach, it's more like a profile.

496
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:47.349
Um, SO instead of saying that you belong in

497
00:28:47.349 --> 00:28:50.089
this category and not these nearby ones, it's more

498
00:28:50.089 --> 00:28:53.060
like, all right, let's look at the key dimensions

499
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.329
that um have been identified in people and position

500
00:28:57.329 --> 00:28:59.900
the person based on the assessment data within those

501
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.650
dimensions. So you end up more with like a

502
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.369
profile, uh, and that that handles problems of comorbidity

503
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:10.329
and differential diagnosis much more deftly in my view

504
00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:14.729
than the differential diagnosis paradigm. So you would have

505
00:29:14.729 --> 00:29:17.430
a, a pattern right across the major, you know,

506
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.280
spectra, right, that have been developed in high top.

507
00:29:20.489 --> 00:29:22.369
You could think about the presentation of different levels

508
00:29:22.369 --> 00:29:25.449
of resolution, right? That's the hierarchical part, right? Where's

509
00:29:25.449 --> 00:29:29.430
the person on these big broad spectrums. And clinically

510
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.640
often you want to know more like the fine-grained

511
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.449
elements cause that's more clinically useful, right, to have

512
00:29:34.449 --> 00:29:36.689
some fine grain information and you don't have to.

513
00:29:37.849 --> 00:29:40.729
Deal with the differential diagnosis problem, which is often

514
00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:43.770
frustrating and has been a, a thorn in the

515
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.329
side of psychiatric classification for as long as people

516
00:29:46.329 --> 00:29:48.170
have tried to do it. Right, so there are

517
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.930
these interstitial right in between psychiatric categories that have

518
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.369
a checkered history and anybody trying to make sense

519
00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:58.599
of them. Um SCHIZOAFFECTIVE disorder is a classic example

520
00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:01.050
of this, right? When What do you do when

521
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:05.290
a person is not very clearly mood disordered versus

522
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.410
very clearly having a psychotic type of, you know,

523
00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:11.329
episode. And DSM handles this by having lots of

524
00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:13.569
different categories having to do with the time course

525
00:30:13.569 --> 00:30:18.650
and relative balance of those experiences. That is hard,

526
00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:21.339
right, because people don't fit neatly into those categories.

527
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.050
You still end up with people who have prominent

528
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:28.339
mood disorder symptoms and prominent um reality testing type

529
00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:31.180
symptoms. And then what we can see you're not

530
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.900
really supposed to use schizoaffective very often cause it's

531
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.339
an uncomfortable thing where you're not really making a

532
00:30:36.339 --> 00:30:40.989
clear decision. In something like high top, there's no

533
00:30:40.989 --> 00:30:43.630
need for such, you know, hand wringing about the

534
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.189
right diagnostic category. Rather, you have people with different

535
00:30:47.189 --> 00:30:52.109
balances of mood problems and psychotic problems, and it

536
00:30:52.109 --> 00:30:55.270
just falls naturally into the possibility that people may

537
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.800
be elevated in two different spectrums simultaneously. And and

538
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.839
that's much closer to what the phenotypes, right, the

539
00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:06.119
clinical presentations look like in data, right? That's the

540
00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:09.119
empirical basis for the high top approach. And I

541
00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:12.349
could go further and say, you know, the evidence

542
00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:15.630
from genetic research, certainly from the twin studies, right?

543
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.800
And now emerging also from the molecular studies, is

544
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.410
that these things aren't highly discreet and and separable

545
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.209
in the way that's implied by the classical, you

546
00:31:25.209 --> 00:31:30.930
know, categorical classification system. Um, So, but it requires

547
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.050
a change of focus, right? It requires the clinician

548
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.449
to be thinking more about dimensional profiles and less

549
00:31:36.449 --> 00:31:40.609
about optimal, you know, categories. If that makes sense.

550
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:41.479
Mhm.

551
00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:44.719
So in your work, I also read about the

552
00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:49.939
general factor of psychopathology or how to go from

553
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.040
individual symptoms up to a general factor of psychopathology.

554
00:31:55.199 --> 00:31:58.319
So, what is it? What what is a general

555
00:31:58.319 --> 00:31:59.839
factor of psychopathology?

556
00:32:00.609 --> 00:32:05.270
This is a concept, um. That emerges from the

557
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.540
evidence that everything that has historically been called psychopathology

558
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.790
is positively correlated with everything else. Different degrees, right?

559
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.589
So the degrees of correlation is what gives you

560
00:32:17.589 --> 00:32:20.010
evidence for the hierarchy, right? Not everything is correlated

561
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.500
with the same degree. So this gets again sort

562
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.890
of technical and statistical, but maybe I can describe

563
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.859
it verbally, you know, a little bit. If it

564
00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:34.540
were the case that all the psychopathology symptoms. Right,

565
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.819
like everything that's in the criteria of the DSM

566
00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:39.510
we're all correlated with each other to the same

567
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.420
degree. Then you would say, well, OK, it it's

568
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.099
a parsimonious way to describe that data matrix by

569
00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:51.140
saying there's one thing. And it manifests in lots

570
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.540
of different ways, but there's really kind of like

571
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.810
one thing that's driving all of this. Whereas, um,

572
00:32:57.979 --> 00:32:59.500
what you really see in data are that they're

573
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.689
correlated all positively, right? They, they're not, they're rarely

574
00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:08.020
negatively correlated or zero correlated because everything is correlated

575
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.140
at least a little bit with everything else in

576
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:16.189
psychopathology. But there are denser groups of correlations, and

577
00:33:16.189 --> 00:33:19.670
it's that patterning of the density versus sparsity if

578
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.510
you will, right of, of different patternings that gives

579
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.270
rise to the hierarchy. But nevertheless, at the highest

580
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.750
level of the hierarchy, right, you can posit the

581
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.869
existence of a general propensity to experience all of

582
00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:34.680
psychopathology because there is evidence that everything is positively

583
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.699
correlated with everything else. So this is a long

584
00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:42.949
way of saying that what it's not nonsensical to

585
00:33:42.949 --> 00:33:45.520
think about a general propensity given that kind of

586
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.609
data structure. But it's very abstract, right? Because you're

587
00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:54.849
talking about everything being correlated with everything else. I

588
00:33:54.849 --> 00:33:57.859
think the key to getting your head around this,

589
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.589
right, is that there's a hierarchy. It doesn't consist

590
00:34:01.589 --> 00:34:05.810
of just one general factor. It consists of factors

591
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.918
arranged in this hierarchical kind of arrangement. And why

592
00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:13.219
that's important is because, well, it's important for every

593
00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.208
possible reason, right? Like if you want to understand

594
00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:19.129
the etiology of these things or their pathophysiology or

595
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:22.050
how to describe a patient who presents clinically, you're

596
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.629
gonna have to think about the whole hierarchy. It's

597
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:27.110
not super clinically useful to say a person has

598
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.949
a lot of psychopathology. Like what are you gonna

599
00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:33.469
do with that practically speaking, but nevertheless, there is

600
00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.909
some evidence that you can think about a general

601
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.629
factor because everything's correlated with everything. So, again, to

602
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:43.909
make a long story short, potential ideologic factors, right,

603
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.128
like underlying genomic factors or whatever. ARE going to

604
00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:51.829
be located in different parts of that hierarchy, um,

605
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:55.089
and there's, you know, evidence for that. And not

606
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:56.688
a difficult thing is like I can give you

607
00:34:56.688 --> 00:34:58.739
an example of how this would work, right? Like

608
00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:03.648
there's propensity to experience externalizing kinds of problems, right?

609
00:35:03.809 --> 00:35:06.168
So acting out, doing things that would be grounds

610
00:35:06.168 --> 00:35:10.928
for arrest, acting impulsively, um, acting in a way

611
00:35:10.928 --> 00:35:13.688
that's um antagonistic to other people, right? Those things

612
00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:17.330
tend to coalesce into this broad externalizing spectrum. But,

613
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.070
you know, people with an externalizing propensity are at

614
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.189
a higher risk of developing substance use problems than

615
00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:28.770
people at a lower externalizing propensity. But the specific

616
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.360
substance is gonna have a lot to do with

617
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.149
the ability to metabolize specific substances. Um, SO, right,

618
00:35:35.229 --> 00:35:37.669
there are ideologic factors at different levels, like a

619
00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:41.100
person with a high externalizing propensity who's attracted to

620
00:35:41.669 --> 00:35:46.110
substances because of that propensity, presumably, right? Might not

621
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.350
be able to develop alcohol dependence, right, as opposed

622
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.810
to dependence on some other substance because they can't

623
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.909
metabolize alcohol like another person who is able to

624
00:35:55.909 --> 00:36:00.750
metabolize large amounts of alcohol, you know. Uh, BECAUSE

625
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.979
of metabolic factors that have nothing to do with

626
00:36:02.979 --> 00:36:06.270
the externalizing propensity but are sort of separate and

627
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.729
at a lower level of the hierarchy. So that

628
00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:11.580
that's the key to understanding this, right, that there

629
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.780
are ideologic factors at different levels of, of, you

630
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.850
know, breath or extraction. And so you can't really

631
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:24.709
think about alcoholism relevant genes. As separate from externalizing

632
00:36:24.709 --> 00:36:27.439
relevant genes, although there are going to be things

633
00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:30.270
within there, right, that have different positions within the

634
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.729
hierarchy. Um, SO I don't know, that's a, that's

635
00:36:33.729 --> 00:36:35.709
a pretty complicated set of things to try to

636
00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:38.850
describe briefly and, you know, verbally, but hopefully I've

637
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.969
done an OK job with it because Again, there's

638
00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:44.729
a, there's a literature, right, a scientific literature that

639
00:36:44.729 --> 00:36:46.969
supports what I'm saying here that, you know, the

640
00:36:46.969 --> 00:36:50.610
interested listener might want to get into, um, but

641
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.850
that, that's basically how that seems to work, right?

642
00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:55.169
I think there's fairly good evidence for what I've

643
00:36:55.169 --> 00:36:58.510
tried to articulate. Mhm.

644
00:36:58.879 --> 00:37:02.520
So let me ask you now a question specifically

645
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.639
about personality disorders. So, what do you make of

646
00:37:06.639 --> 00:37:12.040
the way they are currently understood and classified?

647
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.479
Well, right, so this, this question is a very,

648
00:37:16.649 --> 00:37:19.370
um, it's sort of like a specific subfield of

649
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.129
the general stuff we've been talking about, right? So,

650
00:37:22.489 --> 00:37:28.050
historically. Personality disorders, um, and their classification have emerged

651
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.919
from clinical observation. And so there's a, you know,

652
00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:35.600
historical psychiatric literature based on observing certain kinds of

653
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.199
patients, finding that some have very significant interpersonal challenges,

654
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.590
right, that go beyond just Mood symptoms or psychotic

655
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.040
symptoms or whatever, um. And it's kind of that

656
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.870
observation that some people's psychopathology manifests itself in very

657
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.659
interpersonal ways that gives rise to this putatively separate

658
00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:03.389
group of conditions called the personality disorders. Um, AND

659
00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:06.959
you know, the DSMs, um, at least up through

660
00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:10.110
DSM-4, talk about this in terms of categories, right?

661
00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:14.590
So DSM-4 posits 10 discrete categories, personality disorder as

662
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:18.550
well as personality disorder not otherwise specified. And says,

663
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.260
you know, based on this basic paradigm like find

664
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.939
the right one, right? So is this person more

665
00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:28.300
like schizoty personality disorder, right? So having odd or

666
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.939
eccentric beliefs and being sort of socially withdrawn versus

667
00:38:31.939 --> 00:38:36.439
more like borderline personality disorder which is emotional dysregulation,

668
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:43.340
um, interpersonal dysregulation, um. Transient stress-related association, like a

669
00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.030
whole host of different things that are supposed to

670
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.459
be relevant to borderline, and you gotta pick the

671
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:51.340
right label basically, as the clinician. So that doesn't

672
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.270
work, right? Um, IN the same way that generally

673
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.629
speaking, classical categorical approaches don't work cause you see

674
00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:01.620
persons who you might think of as having significant

675
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.860
personality pathology, you try to put them in these

676
00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.010
boxes and it doesn't really work because they have

677
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.340
presentations that intermingle all the different features of the

678
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.300
different 10 disorders. Um, AND that's what led to

679
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.270
these alternatives, um, that are now, you know, kind

680
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.699
of the main focus of the personality disorders literature,

681
00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:23.979
the DSM-5's alternative model of personality disorders and the

682
00:39:23.979 --> 00:39:27.649
ICD 11 personality disorder system, which is very similar.

683
00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:30.260
And those, you know, look like what we were

684
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.699
talking about before, right? They say there are these

685
00:39:33.699 --> 00:39:36.699
broad dimensions, right, that are very similar to a

686
00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:40.340
darker version of the of the big five. Um,

687
00:39:40.459 --> 00:39:41.979
AND, and when you think about a person, you

688
00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:43.659
want to think about kind of their position within

689
00:39:43.659 --> 00:39:46.860
those dimensions. Um, THEY have the added element of

690
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.439
the overall, uh, kind of constructive personality disorder, you

691
00:39:50.439 --> 00:39:54.169
know this criteria A in the alternative model, um,

692
00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:56.699
which has to do with self and other, um.

693
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.939
You know, functioning, right, like you have a clear

694
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:02.899
and consistent conception of who you are from time

695
00:40:02.899 --> 00:40:04.929
to time and place to place, and do you

696
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.129
relate to other people in a way that might

697
00:40:07.129 --> 00:40:12.229
be considered adaptive, um. And it's the combination of

698
00:40:12.229 --> 00:40:14.550
those things that kind of defines personality disorder in

699
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.989
these modern classification systems. And so the approach is

700
00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:20.709
very similar to what we've been discussing overall, right?

701
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.350
How much interpersonal and self dysfunction is there, right?

702
00:40:24.429 --> 00:40:28.070
That's criterion A. And then what's the patterning across

703
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.310
major dimensions of personality, that's criterion B again in

704
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:36.459
the AMPD approach. And that's, you know, a prominent

705
00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:39.899
approach now cause it works better, right? Like that's

706
00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:43.060
a much more, I I would say clinically useful

707
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.459
way to describe real patients, um, versus trying to

708
00:40:46.459 --> 00:40:49.100
put them into these um categories that just don't

709
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.530
capture actual clinical presentations.

710
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.709
So, let me ask you now about one last

711
00:40:55.709 --> 00:40:59.149
topic that is very different from what we've been

712
00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:02.979
talking about. What is subjective well-being?

713
00:41:04.409 --> 00:41:08.510
Well, again, like a substantial literature exists, right, talking

714
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:13.629
about what subjective well-being is. Um, I mean, I,

715
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:19.030
I have been influenced by Carol Griff's conceptualization of,

716
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.800
of what she has called psychological well-being, um, because

717
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.560
Carol is a close colleague and she and I

718
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.959
worked together on the midlife in the United States

719
00:41:26.959 --> 00:41:30.040
study, right, the big MA study. I've worked with

720
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.719
a lot of those measures and data, um, and

721
00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:35.239
there's many elements to it, but if you had

722
00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:39.209
to succinctly describe the essence of well-being, it's a

723
00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:41.760
sense that things are going well for you and

724
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.439
your place in the world is secure, right? I

725
00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:45.840
guess if I had to put it in one

726
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.750
quick phrase, um. And of course that's something that

727
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.790
all human beings strive toward, right? Everybody would like

728
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.010
to have a sense of psychological well-being. Um, AND

729
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.239
there's just different ways that it can be manifest,

730
00:41:59.489 --> 00:42:01.250
um, so I think that's another one of these

731
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:05.649
higher and multi-dimensional kinds of situations similar to psychopathology.

732
00:42:06.419 --> 00:42:09.979
Um, RIGHT, it's, it's a sense that you're Doing

733
00:42:09.979 --> 00:42:11.540
well. I mean we could talk about it in

734
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.129
terms of varieties of happiness too, right, to bring

735
00:42:14.129 --> 00:42:19.479
that construct into play, right? So there's um Eudaimonic,

736
00:42:19.689 --> 00:42:23.010
um, and hedonic versions of well-being, right? Hedonic being

737
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.659
I feel good, right? I have pleasant emotional experiences,

738
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.429
um, and eudaimonic, my, my life has a sense

739
00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:32.409
of meaning and purpose. Um, I think that it's

740
00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:34.850
the combination of those two things that, that, you

741
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:40.290
know, sort of epitomize human flourishing, right? That's the,

742
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.250
that's the stuff that you'd like to achieve as

743
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.870
a human being, right, that you're generally in a

744
00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:49.500
positive mood idonically and also. That you have a

745
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.699
sense that life is is meaningful, right? That you

746
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:55.179
have pursuits and goals and things that you're trying

747
00:42:55.179 --> 00:42:58.110
to do that bring you um joy and engagement

748
00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.860
with life in spite of all of its multifaceted

749
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.540
challenges.

750
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.540
Uh, SO you mentioned eymonic and hedonic well-being. What

751
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.139
about social well-being? Yeah,

752
00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:12.939
that's a good point, right? Um, CONNECTIONS with important

753
00:43:12.939 --> 00:43:17.250
others is, is certainly. A key element of well-being

754
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.639
also, um. And one could think about sort of

755
00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:23.189
a three dimensional kind of structure that or that

756
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.790
recognizes the social aspects as potentially separate or separable,

757
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.760
but these things tend to be pretty correlated with

758
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.399
each other, right? And they tend to be reciprocal

759
00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:34.590
in their relationship with each other. So for example,

760
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.550
people who have a disposition toward positive moods. Right,

761
00:43:38.669 --> 00:43:41.229
it, it could be argued that that disposition, that

762
00:43:41.229 --> 00:43:43.669
tendency to be in a good mood, regardless of

763
00:43:43.669 --> 00:43:48.229
what's going on, right, promotes extroverted behavior. So right,

764
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:51.510
you can think about extroversion, the personality trait like

765
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.189
being outgoing and friendly and engaged with other people

766
00:43:54.189 --> 00:43:57.870
and enjoying social interactions as having a positive emotional

767
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:02.229
core. Um, AND that's how, you know, many, many

768
00:44:02.229 --> 00:44:05.129
theorists at the intersection of personality and mood, like,

769
00:44:05.219 --> 00:44:07.800
you know, David Watson and Leanna Clark and people

770
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.280
like that have talked about it based on evidence,

771
00:44:10.399 --> 00:44:13.520
right? That, you know, extroverted behaviors have a positive

772
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.199
emotional core. People who are in a good mood

773
00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:18.000
like to engage with other people because that's a

774
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.600
normal human thing to do when you're in a

775
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.229
good mood. Well, you could go on a podcast

776
00:44:22.229 --> 00:44:25.040
and have, you know, conversations about interesting topics, right?

777
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.860
Like it requires a certain amount of Positive mood,

778
00:44:28.919 --> 00:44:30.939
right, being in a good frame of mind to

779
00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:34.419
want to engage socially. So I guess what I'm

780
00:44:34.419 --> 00:44:36.580
trying to say is like, yeah, you can think

781
00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.860
about different manifestations in the social world, in the,

782
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:43.060
in the subjective, you know, sort of world too,

783
00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:44.820
right? Like there's a difference between like how am

784
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.560
I perceiving myself subjectively and what am I doing

785
00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.320
interpersonally. But they tend to be reciprocal, right, correlated

786
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.879
with each other because they have this, you know,

787
00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:56.959
sickly kind of aspect to them where they kind

788
00:44:56.959 --> 00:44:59.800
of bounce off each other and mutually reinforce a

789
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.790
kind of sense of well-being in the world.

790
00:45:03.189 --> 00:45:07.580
So, one last question then, is there any relationship

791
00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.500
between subjective well-being and personality traits?

792
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.840
Oh, absolutely, yeah. And when I think about that,

793
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.879
they, they tend to want to be located in

794
00:45:16.879 --> 00:45:21.090
that extroversion kind of space. OK, so I think

795
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.239
there's there's, you know, a literature on this, right,

796
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.219
but. That the mood space and the personality space

797
00:45:28.219 --> 00:45:31.899
are closely related to each other, um, right, so

798
00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:35.899
the different, different mood dispositions, um, can be thought

799
00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.820
of as having something to do with the extroversion

800
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.739
neuroticism space, right, and are closely related to each

801
00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:44.399
other. Um, So I guess that's how I would

802
00:45:44.399 --> 00:45:48.540
think about that, um. You know, right, that that

803
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.270
that there's a um an effective basis for a

804
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:56.780
lot of what is considered personality because what those

805
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:02.399
personality dispositions are driven by is affective dispositions. Um,

806
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.510
SO just the tendency to be in certain kinds

807
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.149
of mood states, if you think about them over

808
00:46:07.149 --> 00:46:10.780
time, right, can be thought of as personality dispositions,

809
00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:16.860
um, and they have You know, intrapersonal and interpersonal

810
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.310
manifestations, um. And that's kind of the essence of

811
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.739
what's going on with, you know, extroversion and neuroticism,

812
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.429
right, that those big trait domains have a lot

813
00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:30.149
to do with a person's um mood dispositions.

814
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.629
Right. So, so I, I mean, does that mean

815
00:46:33.629 --> 00:46:38.800
then that if someone scores high on extroversion, then

816
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.810
they tend to also have higher subjective well-being and

817
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:48.719
if someone scores high on neuroticism, uh, it's the

818
00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:49.399
opposite then.

819
00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:54.370
Uh, THE way you said it makes it sound

820
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.500
like there's sort of one dimension, but they're kind

821
00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.540
of, um, orthogonal dimensions, right? So, OK, so the

822
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.780
key thing to sort of recognize there is that

823
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.699
a person can have simultaneous propensities toward. This regulated

824
00:47:08.699 --> 00:47:12.699
mood and positive mood. It, it's a little, it's

825
00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:15.300
maybe sounds a little hard to put together psychologically,

826
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.580
but if you think about it a little bit,

827
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.800
it kind of maybe makes more sense. So, and

828
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.550
it makes sense, uh I wanna say like phylogenetically,

829
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.120
like when you think about, you know, systems in

830
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.560
the brain and their origins, right, in evolutionary history

831
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.520
and things like this, right? There are systems for

832
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.729
dealing with the potential for threat. And there are

833
00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:36.770
systems for dealing with the potential for reward, and

834
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.530
there are separable systems. So you can imagine a

835
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.100
human organism that has high levels of both, right?

836
00:47:43.149 --> 00:47:45.250
And that would be a person who is outgoing,

837
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:51.280
friendly, um, engaged, and also anxious and worried. Um,

838
00:47:51.409 --> 00:47:53.439
THAT'S not too difficult of a person to imagine.

839
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.560
I can imagine people like this and I've known

840
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.040
people like this, right? They want to engage with

841
00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.879
people. They're very excited. They're extroverted and outgoing, but

842
00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:03.719
they're also very worried and concerned and a lot

843
00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:06.719
of anxiety and like those things can happen simultaneously

844
00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:08.709
in a person's personality, I guess it's the point

845
00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:11.919
I'm trying to make. And that's consistent with the

846
00:48:11.919 --> 00:48:14.510
structure of personality and mood, right, that those are

847
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:15.840
separable dimensions.

848
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.449
Mhm. Right. So, just before we go, where can

849
00:48:21.449 --> 00:48:24.840
people find you and your work on the internet?

850
00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:28.330
In the usual scholarly resources, I guess, right? So

851
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.449
you could have a Google Scholar page, right? I'm

852
00:48:31.449 --> 00:48:35.050
not, I'm not particularly engaged with social media because

853
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.280
I find that to be kind of um. Difficult

854
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.679
and distracting, right, when I'm trying to sort of

855
00:48:40.679 --> 00:48:44.760
concentrate on. Academic work, one could spend a lot

856
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.360
of time, and many people do, on academic um

857
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.840
social media, right, arguing about things or engaging with

858
00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.239
colleagues, and I've never loved that just in terms

859
00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:57.159
of how I want to spend my time, although

860
00:48:57.159 --> 00:49:00.340
I understand that there are potential implications for me

861
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.090
interacting with the world by not being super active

862
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.050
on social media. But I like to think about

863
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:09.510
these things in a more um Maybe old fashioned

864
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.600
way, right? Like that that my scientific publications are

865
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.949
more thought through. Um, THEN, you know, me firing

866
00:49:16.949 --> 00:49:20.429
off some social media posts, um, in response to

867
00:49:20.429 --> 00:49:22.830
some provocation, right? So I don't think I would

868
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.750
do well with the dynamic aspects of social media.

869
00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:28.620
So I don't really have a presence there. Um,

870
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.510
BUT yeah, you can find my web page at

871
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:32.750
the University of Minnesota, you can find my Google

872
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.370
Scholar profile. I don't mind emails, right? Like I,

873
00:49:36.429 --> 00:49:38.870
I don't, I have an easier time responding one

874
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.189
on one to people when I know the context

875
00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:44.550
of the conversation, right, than broadcasting something to the

876
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.629
whole world. The social media often feels to me

877
00:49:47.629 --> 00:49:50.550
like yelling into a void, and maybe some people

878
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.389
are listening, but everybody's yelling, right? And it just,

879
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.229
I, it's hard for me to conceptualize it as

880
00:49:57.229 --> 00:50:00.790
bringing together communities based on well thought out, you

881
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:04.689
know, kinds of ideas. Because everything's so spontaneous and

882
00:50:04.689 --> 00:50:07.159
sudden, but maybe I'm just old fashioned that way,

883
00:50:07.169 --> 00:50:09.689
and I should get with the times and be

884
00:50:09.689 --> 00:50:11.610
more engaged with it, but currently I don't really

885
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.050
do much of that kind of activity.

886
00:50:14.409 --> 00:50:19.010
Yeah, no, that's fair enough and interesting insights on

887
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.929
social media. So, but I will be leaving then

888
00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:25.530
links to your university page and your Google Scholar

889
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.689
page in the description of the interview. And thank

890
00:50:28.689 --> 00:50:30.770
you so much for taking the time to come

891
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:33.370
on the show. It's been really nice to talk

892
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:33.979
with you.

893
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.850
No, I really appreciate your very thoughtful questions. You

894
00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.909
certainly hit on things that are very deep. Right,

895
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.070
not easy to deal with succinctly, so hopefully I

896
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.860
did OK. It felt, it felt a bit like

897
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:50.149
a final examination, not for decades. But that's OK.

898
00:50:50.229 --> 00:50:51.790
I think those are really kind of the key

899
00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.709
questions that you were asking. So hopefully, um, your

900
00:50:54.709 --> 00:50:57.030
listeners know a little bit more about it and

901
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.350
know where to find me if they want to

902
00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:59.080
converse further.
