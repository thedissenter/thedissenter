00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.119
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.279
today I'm joined by Doctor Tristan Rogers. He is

4
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.760
a philosopher, author, and teacher. He teaches logic and

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.750
Latin at Dunham Day Classical Academy in San Francisco.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.879
And today we're going to talk about his book,

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.530
Conservatism, Past and Present, A Philosophical Introduction. There it

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.959
is.

9
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.579
Great.

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.930
So, Doctor Rogers, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.360
huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.889
Thank you very much for having me.

13
00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:38.610
So let me ask you, what motivated you to

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.970
write a book on conservatism?

15
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.650
Um, YEAH, thanks. So the, the book really developed

16
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.259
out of, um, research I was doing in philosophy,

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.610
um, on kind of the intersection of virtue ethics

18
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.419
and political philosophy, uh, something that's come to be

19
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:57.500
known as virtue politics. So my, my first book,

20
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.090
uh, titled The Authority of Virtue, Institutions and Character

21
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.689
in the Good Society, and the basic idea behind

22
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.180
that book was that, um, The purpose of politics,

23
00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:10.150
the purpose of a political community, uh, going back

24
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.919
to Aristotle, as Aristotle argues, is to promote the

25
00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.440
flourishing of the citizens, uh, is to promote the,

26
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.360
the happiness, let's say, of the citizens. And so

27
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.389
in that book, I argued that there's a, there's

28
00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.949
a kind of reciprocal relationship between the citizens of

29
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.389
the state. Uh, THEY have to obey the laws

30
00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.230
and they have to be, be good citizens, but

31
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.989
the state has to promote their, uh, their flourishing.

32
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.870
And, and not flourishing in a subjective way, but

33
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.790
flourishing in an, in an objective way, uh, connected

34
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.029
to, to the virtues of, of human flourishing and

35
00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:43.620
so on. Um, SO in that book, uh, I

36
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.470
wasn't exactly arguing for a conservative point of view.

37
00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:49.580
Um, IT wasn't really an ideological book. I was,

38
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.779
I was trying to say that both liberal and

39
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:55.459
conservative viewpoints can contribute to the enterprise of, of

40
00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.300
human flourishing within a political community. Um, BUT as

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.480
I started to work more within the framework, uh,

42
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.639
the The idea is kind of tilted in a

43
00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.839
conservative direction, um, based on this idea that the

44
00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:09.839
state has a role in promoting the human good,

45
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.600
um, uh, in a, in a kind of substantive

46
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.479
sense, which is something that many forms of liberalism

47
00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.789
will, will reject in favor of a kind of,

48
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.169
um, a kind of neutral state. Um, ALA John

49
00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.570
Rawls' liberalism. Um, SO I started taking that seriously

50
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.410
and, and my own kind of political beliefs kind

51
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.550
of tended in that direction. Um, AND at this

52
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.270
time, I just finished my, my doctoral studies at

53
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.080
the University of Arizona in 2017. If you remember,

54
00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.130
that was kind of a fraught time politically. We

55
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.330
just had the, the Trump election and everything was

56
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.070
kind of in chaos. There was a kind of

57
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.809
woke revolution going on. Um, AND I was trying

58
00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.770
to get a job in philosophy, and I had

59
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.289
these kind of heterodox views that were, that were,

60
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.039
uh, let's say not working to my advantage. Um,

61
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.729
AND I published, uh, an essay in the online

62
00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.240
magazine, uh, Quillette at that time called The Dearth

63
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.740
of, uh, Conservatives in Academic philosophy that was And

64
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.100
exploring the problem of why there are no conservatives

65
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.899
and why it would probably be a good thing

66
00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.979
if there were conservatives. Um, AND so I, that

67
00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.339
kind of, you know, planted my flag on the

68
00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.229
map. Let's say I said, look, I'm a conservative,

69
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.779
these are my views. And so I started thinking

70
00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.399
about these things more intellectually, uh, to develop, uh,

71
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.740
develop a kind of coherent, uh, conservative political philosophy,

72
00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.619
which really, uh, doesn't really exist in the field

73
00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.410
of academic philosophy, outside of a couple of people.

74
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.729
Um, THE late Roger Scruton, uh, John Keeks, a

75
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.889
few other people who are, who are not that

76
00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.830
prominent, but, um, known among conservatives. And um, so

77
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.830
I thought, well, I'm gonna take my academic work

78
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.039
in this direction and kind of pursue this virtue

79
00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.139
politics framework, uh, and, and see where it leads,

80
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.300
uh, in terms of uh conservative political philosophy. Um,

81
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.410
SO that was kind of the intellectual background, uh,

82
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.589
and kind of part of the personal, part of

83
00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:00.589
my kind of personal journey, I guess you could

84
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.910
say. And, um, so then, of course, the pandemic

85
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.990
happened and everything kind of went, went out of

86
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.630
control. And my, my first book had come out,

87
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.740
um, as I say, the Authority of Virtue, which

88
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.250
was, which was based on my dissertation, virtue Politics.

89
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.488
And so I was looking for a new project

90
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.779
to start. I didn't really plan to write on

91
00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.940
conservatism, but um there was this book series that

92
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.739
uh Rutledge publishes and um uh titled Why It's

93
00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.589
OK. And the basic rationale for the book series

94
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:30.820
was to try to make a, uh, try to

95
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.339
make a philosophical case for the way that ordinary

96
00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.480
people think and live. And so I looked at

97
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320
that series, oh, OK, this is cool. I could

98
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.920
write a, I could write a book called Why

99
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.559
It's OK to be a Conservative, that would be

100
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.519
easy, you know, it was, it was supposed to

101
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.750
be kind of a short accessible series for a

102
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.609
for a general audience, you know, maybe I could.

103
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.299
Uh, MAYBE I could make a name for myself

104
00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:52.500
in that way. So I put together this book

105
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.049
proposal, and, um, kind of, kind of quickly, actually,

106
00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:58.589
just, just in like two months, basically, just at

107
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.829
the end of, uh, 2020, and, um, sent it

108
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:03.920
off to the editor, and, uh, the editor was,

109
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.019
was enthusiastic about the idea, but he didn't think

110
00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.420
it was right for the series, but he encouraged

111
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.500
me to develop it into a more sort of

112
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.420
ambitious project, um, that included Not only uh a

113
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.839
history of conservatism, but a, a kind of a

114
00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.579
theory of conservatism or a definition of conservatism, and,

115
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.820
uh, you know, it's relevance to the, the current

116
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:27.709
uh movements going on within conservatism, which are very

117
00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.350
much in flux. Um, SO I left at that

118
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.829
opportunity. I thought, OK, great, and I, I put

119
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:34.109
together this very ambitious proposal that was, you know,

120
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.589
much longer than than the book ended up being.

121
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:40.510
I mean, so that's how, that's how conservatism, past

122
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.029
and present, uh, a philosophical introduction was, was born,

123
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.660
I guess.

124
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.140
So, but in the book you focus on philosophical

125
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.019
conservatism. What is it and how does it relate

126
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.010
or compare to other forms of conservatism?

127
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.329
Yeah, so one of the biggest problems of writing

128
00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:03.609
about conservatism is to say exactly what it is.

129
00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.299
Um, MANY people have tried to define conservatism. It

130
00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:10.940
means many different things to many, uh, different people

131
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.540
and many different places and many different time periods.

132
00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.970
Um, AND so the first, the first task I

133
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.040
had was to try to develop a, a, a,

134
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.570
a definition or an understanding of conservatism. Uh, AND

135
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.450
so I ended up with this, this idea that

136
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.600
I called philosophical conservatism, um, which takes a philosophical

137
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.209
approach to conservatism, and, uh, it consists of, of

138
00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.570
kind of 33 different parts or 33 different moves.

139
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.739
And the first part or the first move is

140
00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:43.140
to say that uh conservatism is really about the

141
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.570
search for wisdom, um, understood in the, the classic,

142
00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.869
classical philosophy sense of, of the love of wisdom,

143
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.390
the search for wisdom, the search for the good

144
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.010
life, right? The pursuit of the good life, uh,

145
00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:57.779
within a political community. Um, SO it's very much

146
00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.899
taking Aristotle's, uh, Aristotle's ethics is conception of human

147
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.179
flourishing and thinking about, well, what would that, what

148
00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:06.559
would that look like in a political context and

149
00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:09.109
The conservative aspect of the search of wisdom for

150
00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:12.230
me is that um the search for wisdom begins

151
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.429
where we are. And it begins from the society

152
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:17.589
that we live, that we live in, and it

153
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:19.859
begins from the good things that we already have,

154
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.000
uh, and, and it begins from this, this, um,

155
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:25.470
impetus or this disposition to want to conserve those

156
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.470
good things, and to build the good life out

157
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.429
of the good life that we already have, or

158
00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:31.269
the good life, or the good things that we

159
00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.929
already have. Um. And so that's the first, uh,

160
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.940
the first aspect of this, is this sense of

161
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.140
the search for wisdom, and this aspect that we

162
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.519
want to conserve what has value. Uh, WE wanna,

163
00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:43.220
we wanna be attached to the things that we

164
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.309
love, uh, a phrase. Associated with Roger's scruton. Um,

165
00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.160
SO then the question is, well, OK, we, we

166
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.540
want to conserve the things that we have, well,

167
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.279
how do we promote those things? How do we,

168
00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.119
how do we grow in wisdom? How do we,

169
00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.920
how do we, uh, uh, forge a conception of

170
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.670
happiness and the good life in a community with

171
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.160
other people? Um, WHAT does that look like and

172
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.429
how does that, how does that relate to, um,

173
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.920
Um, the political apparatus of society, um, can we,

174
00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:10.589
can we really search for wisdom through the government?

175
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.399
That, that, that's, that's something that sets off alarm

176
00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:16.839
alarm bells for certain people. Um, SO the the

177
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.760
second move is to say, well, OK, we're gonna

178
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.980
conserve the good, we're gonna promote the human good

179
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.459
in this kind of thick sense understood as a,

180
00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.959
as a life of virtue in a community with

181
00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:29.709
other people. Um, BUT that's not a license to

182
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:35.099
install the philosopher kings, um, and, you know, impose

183
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.510
a conception of the good life from the top

184
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.159
in a kind of authoritarian manner. And the reason

185
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.750
for that is that the second aspect of philosophical

186
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.719
conservatism, as I understand it, is that philosophical conservatism

187
00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:50.590
is aware of the limits of human life and,

188
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.590
and the human being. So it's built out of

189
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.429
limits that are um epistemic limitations on what we

190
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.299
can know and what I call moral limitations, which

191
00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:03.469
are limitations on our ability to um uh to

192
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.950
be moral, basically, right? We, we have weakness of

193
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.820
will, we're hypocrites, we're tempted, we're fallen creatures. Um,

194
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.750
AND so the, the search for wisdom has to

195
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.979
recognize our epistemic limits and our moral limits. Um,

196
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.140
AND so the epistemic limits, uh, kind of, uh,

197
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.150
lends weight to the idea of tradition that we

198
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.750
have these, uh, uh, systems and practices that have

199
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.349
been built up over time, and they have a

200
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:31.659
kind of, uh, uh, innate wisdom attached to them.

201
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:33.869
And, and that should be our kind of starting

202
00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:37.669
point for thinking about, um, promoting the good. And

203
00:09:37.669 --> 00:09:41.309
then the moral limits uh uh lean very heavily

204
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:43.219
on, on the idea of the rule of law,

205
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.559
and the idea that we have to, um, uh,

206
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.869
we have to follow the law, and we have

207
00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:53.549
to, uh, uh, uh. Implement changes in society in

208
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.109
a way that is consistent with the rule of

209
00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:57.659
law, and it's not radical, and is not revolutionary,

210
00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:00.909
but works kind of from within um the political

211
00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:02.989
community. And that leads to the last part of

212
00:10:02.989 --> 00:10:06.760
the view, um, which is So you might think,

213
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.969
OK, we have these limits, and so there's no

214
00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:10.739
way to promote the good, right? Because there's nothing

215
00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:12.380
we can actually do. And so you might think

216
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.299
that leads to a kind of libertarian view where

217
00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:16.940
the state just kind of, you know, uh takes

218
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.330
a kind of hands-off approach. Um, SO the last,

219
00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.659
the last part is to say, well, well, we

220
00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:24.419
need a standard of value. We have to know

221
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.979
when, when change is for the better. And in

222
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:29.820
my view, conservatism is not opposed to change, but

223
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:33.169
rather as, as Burke argues, uh, change is necessary

224
00:10:33.169 --> 00:10:36.140
in order to conserve a society. A society has

225
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.750
to be open, open to change in order to

226
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.020
uh adapt to the circumstances and sustain itself throughout

227
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.409
time. Um, SO conservatism's standard of value, in my

228
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:48.440
view, is, is human happiness is the human good,

229
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.359
is a kind of uh uh conception of justice.

230
00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:55.909
Um, BUT it's not a, uh, it's not an

231
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:58.719
ideological or an abstract sense of justice. It's not

232
00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:01.320
a theory of justice, but the sense of justice

233
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.510
that works from within a community, that works from,

234
00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:07.039
uh, within the existing traditions of a, of a

235
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.799
community of a political community, and it extracts its

236
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:13.039
moral ideas out of that tradition. Um, SO this

237
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.320
is a theme in the book that I call

238
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.140
change from within or finding justice within tradition. And

239
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.460
that's the way to uh uh uh identify and

240
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.340
legitimate change that, that genuinely, uh, uh, serves the

241
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.940
human good within a political community, um without overstepping

242
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.659
our limits and while, um, um keeping in mind

243
00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.750
this idea that we're searching for wisdom together.

244
00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:39.440
Mhm. Yeah, later in our conversation, we're also going

245
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.049
to get a little bit into more detail when

246
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:46.049
it comes to the tenets of conservatism, the values

247
00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:48.780
and ideas associated with it, or at least with

248
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.929
certain authors that are or were conservatives themselves. But

249
00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:56.330
uh now I would like to ask you, uh,

250
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.859
you mentioned justice there. And in the book, you

251
00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:05.099
tie conservatism to the virtues of gratitude, humility and

252
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.940
justice. Could you explain that?

253
00:12:07.549 --> 00:12:10.250
Yeah, so those three virtues um grow out of

254
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.929
the the three aspects of philosophical conservatism that I,

255
00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:17.169
that I just outlined. So, um, the virtue of

256
00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.409
gratitude is this idea that we have these good

257
00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:21.929
things that have been, uh, uh, bequeathed to us,

258
00:12:21.969 --> 00:12:25.010
that have been given to us from previous generations.

259
00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:28.690
We're born into families, we're born into a system

260
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.489
of government, we're born into this, uh, you know,

261
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.809
tradition. Um, AND we should be grateful for those

262
00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:39.010
things, and part of the conservative disposition is to

263
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.489
acknowledge, uh, the things that, that make the good

264
00:12:42.489 --> 00:12:44.929
life possible. Um, SO I also talk about these

265
00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:48.250
as duties of piety, uh, which traditionally are owed

266
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.690
toward your family, toward your, uh, your, your community

267
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.280
or your, or your, uh, political community, and also,

268
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:58.440
um, God. So three aspects of piety there that

269
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.469
that grow out of the sense of gratitude. Um,

270
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.469
SO that's the first virtue that I associate with

271
00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:06.190
the search for wisdom. The search for wisdom begins

272
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.590
with an appreciation for the good things that you

273
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.830
already have. Um, AND the second one, humility, I

274
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.309
connect to this idea of limits. So we should

275
00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.109
be grateful, um, and we should try to promote

276
00:13:20.109 --> 00:13:21.869
the good, but we should not try to promote

277
00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:24.940
the good in a way that exceeds our epistemic

278
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.789
and our moral limitations. And part of being aware

279
00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:32.630
of those limitations, I think, is to, uh, is

280
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.030
to have the virtue of, of humility, right? We

281
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.599
should be intellectually humble, we should not overstate our

282
00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:42.190
abilities, we should not think we can install philosopher

283
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.909
kings, anything like that. Um, AND we also should

284
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:47.179
not think that we're saints, and that every time

285
00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:49.469
we try to promote the good that, uh, just

286
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:51.469
because we have good intentions that things are gonna

287
00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:55.229
work out well, um, uh, we should have a

288
00:13:55.229 --> 00:13:56.869
kind of tragic sense of the human being and,

289
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.919
and be aware of our limitations in that way.

290
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:04.679
Um, AND, um, Socrates is very much the, the

291
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:07.349
inspiration for the, for the virtue of humility here,

292
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.130
this idea that uh wisdom consists in knowledge of

293
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.000
your, of your own ignorance and I traced that

294
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.789
theme through some of the other uh conservative thinkers

295
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.210
in the history of philosophy. Um, SO those are

296
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.440
the first two virtues, um, gratitude, humility, and then

297
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.080
the third virtue is, is justice. Um, JUSTICE as

298
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.840
a, as a virtue of a person rather than

299
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.280
a virtue of a state. So justice understood as

300
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.039
somebody who abides by the laws, um, is interested

301
00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:38.330
in promoting the common good. Um, BUT is only

302
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.590
willing to do so in ways that are consistent

303
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.599
with the political constitution, in ways that are consistent

304
00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:46.679
with the rule of law, um, is not a

305
00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:50.679
radical, is not trying to transform society into their

306
00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:53.549
own vision of what justice should be, but rather,

307
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:57.200
uh, works for justice from within, from within an

308
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.119
existing tradition, and that, that corresponds to the, the

309
00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:01.229
idea of change from within.

310
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.929
In the book, you also talk about and go

311
00:15:04.929 --> 00:15:10.080
through the history of conservatism, particularly uh through the

312
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.770
history of conservative thinkers and authors and uh I

313
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.609
would like to ask you about that, but just

314
00:15:17.609 --> 00:15:21.690
before we get specifically into that, how old is

315
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.570
conservatism?

316
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.340
Uh, YEAH, that, that's a great question. Um, SO

317
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.700
one of the, one of the things you have

318
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.900
to, uh, grapple with when you write about conservatism

319
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.210
is that, um, the history really matters, and, uh,

320
00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:40.460
you have, you know, problems of anachronism. Uh, SO

321
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.419
I talk about the ancient philosophers and many people

322
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.289
will say, well, you know, Plato wasn't a conservative

323
00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:48.460
because, you know, conservatism doesn't come along until much

324
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.809
later. Um, SO how old is conservatism? Well, the,

325
00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:55.570
the modern ideology of conservatism is usually traced to

326
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.010
the 18th century and the response to the French

327
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.609
Revolution, of course, and Edmund Burke's, uh, reflections on

328
00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:04.440
the revolution in France, um, which is not a

329
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.719
really, it's not really a political treatise, and, uh,

330
00:16:07.729 --> 00:16:10.049
you know, it's, it's very particular to its time,

331
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.409
and you have to really extract a theory of

332
00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:16.059
conservatism out of that book, um. But more generally,

333
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.419
I think the conservative disposition, I think, is as

334
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:21.219
old as as human nature. I think everybody has

335
00:16:21.219 --> 00:16:24.340
a, has a, everybody has some aspect of the

336
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.900
conservative disposition, and some people are more prone to

337
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.739
it than others, let's say, psychologically speaking. Um, THERE'S

338
00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:34.260
a kind of interesting discussion there about um um

339
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.500
the kind of personalities who tend toward. Conservatism. Um,

340
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:40.440
SO I would trace it to the, to the

341
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.640
18th century, but I think the 18th century, uh,

342
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.440
ideas of conservatism that are a response to the

343
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.710
French Revolution and, and really the rise of modernity

344
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.719
and liberalism more generally. Uh, WHEN society really starts

345
00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:56.719
to change rapidly, you might think, like, before, before

346
00:16:56.719 --> 00:16:58.599
that happens, there really isn't much of a need

347
00:16:58.599 --> 00:17:01.159
for conservatism because things are not really changing, and

348
00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:03.479
so there's no real need to defend the status

349
00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.839
quo, to defend uh the things that we, that

350
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.000
we cherish. Um, BUT for me, what's distinctive about

351
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.520
my view, in some measures that um I don't

352
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.760
begin the story of conservatism in the 18th century,

353
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.640
because I think uh the so-called Enlightenment conservatism, of

354
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.348
course, it doesn't come out of nowhere. Um, FOR

355
00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.108
me, it really grows out of these ideas that

356
00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:25.229
are associated with the, with the ancient Greek and

357
00:17:25.229 --> 00:17:29.310
Roman philosophers, um, as well as, um, Christian philosophy.

358
00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:32.829
And so for me, it's, it's particular to Western

359
00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:34.910
Europe at a particular time that's coming out of

360
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.910
these very Very strong, uh, intellectual strands. And so,

361
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.520
um, I like to think of conservatism has kind

362
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.160
of a prehistory and then the, the, you know,

363
00:17:45.199 --> 00:17:48.160
the beginning of modern conservatism begins in the 18th

364
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.640
century.

365
00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:52.030
So let me ask you a little bit about

366
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.030
some of the most ancient uh conservative thinkers that

367
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.390
you mentioned in the book, uh, including Plato and

368
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.989
Aristotle. I mean, which of their ideas would you

369
00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:08.560
associate or label as conservative?

370
00:18:09.229 --> 00:18:12.410
Yeah, so in the in the um chapter one

371
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.339
on ancient philosophy. Um, I traced the three themes

372
00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:20.459
of philosophical conservatism, the, the search for wisdom, this

373
00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:22.219
idea of limits, and the idea of change from

374
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:27.329
within, um, through three, ancient philosophers Plato, Aristotle, and,

375
00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:30.630
and Cicero. He's kind of the, he's kind of

376
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.060
the odd one out, I guess. I don't know.

377
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.189
Not many people would, would say the name of

378
00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:36.829
Cicero alongside the names of Plato and Aristotle, but

379
00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:40.189
for me, Cicero is, is an important conservative political

380
00:18:40.189 --> 00:18:43.540
philosopher. Um, SO all three of those thinkers, I

381
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.859
locate this theme of, uh, the purpose of politics

382
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:50.430
is the promotion of human flourishing, understood as a

383
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.750
life, uh, lived in accordance with the virtues, and

384
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.750
of course, that just is ancient political philosophy, and

385
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.890
I think uh that. IS a conservative way of

386
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.489
thinking about politics, um, that you find in the

387
00:19:01.489 --> 00:19:04.729
ancient philosophers, and um I had a background in

388
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:07.170
ancient philosophy, it kind of got me into virtue

389
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.609
ethics, and eventually virtue ethics got me into thinking

390
00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:12.770
about conservative political philosophy. Um, SO those are, that's,

391
00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:14.449
that's a theme that all three have in common.

392
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.469
More specifically, this idea of limits, um, so Plato

393
00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:21.670
is usually thought of as a kind of radical,

394
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.750
right? If you read the Republic, there are all

395
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.430
these wild ideas about how to reform society, we

396
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.069
should, you know, make property equal, we should, uh,

397
00:19:29.109 --> 00:19:31.709
you know, have women participate in ruling, which was

398
00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:34.239
totally radical at the time. Um, AND of course,

399
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.540
the idea of the philosopher kings. Um, I have

400
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.660
a different reading of Plato's Republic, which, uh, follows

401
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.260
some what you might call Straussian readings, which is

402
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.900
that when Plato develops the ideal city in the

403
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.619
republic, he's not putting it forward as a serious

404
00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.859
political proposal. He doesn't think this is what the

405
00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:53.099
just city should be, and this is how we

406
00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:55.420
should implement the just city. He's putting it forward

407
00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.979
as a kind of thought experiment. And the thought

408
00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.260
experiment, the purpose of it, I think, is to

409
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.819
teach us that uh ideal justice is not possible

410
00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:09.219
in this world, and that um Um, There's no

411
00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:11.180
way, there's no way to achieve the just city,

412
00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:13.020
and the reason why we can't achieve the just

413
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.739
city is that we're attached to these things, right?

414
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.209
We're attached to our families, we're attached to our

415
00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:20.359
property. And it's foolish to try to implement these

416
00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:24.800
things, um, politically speaking. Uh, AND if you read,

417
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.560
if you read the dialogue, you kind of, you

418
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.119
can kind of get hints that that's what he's

419
00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.719
up to, because when, when Socrates introduces the idea

420
00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:33.180
of the Philosopher kings, the philosopher kings are what

421
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.040
are supposed to get the Just City off the

422
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.959
ground, right? Well, you know, talk on that to

423
00:20:38.959 --> 00:20:40.119
say, how are we gonna get this thing off

424
00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:42.079
the ground? And Socrates says, well, we can get

425
00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.520
it off the ground with one change, right? 11

426
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.719
little change. Philosophers have to be kings. You go,

427
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.949
oh wow. That's a big change. And so, what

428
00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:52.500
I think Socrates is saying there is that, no,

429
00:20:52.949 --> 00:20:54.550
we, we actually can't get this thing off the

430
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.589
ground, that utopian, the utopian just City is not

431
00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:01.579
possible because of these uh limitations that we face.

432
00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:03.719
Um, AND of course, you can't get the Philosopher

433
00:21:03.719 --> 00:21:06.430
kings unless you have the Just City, right? But

434
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.069
you can only get the Just City if you

435
00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:09.630
have the Philosopher king. So it's a kind of

436
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.750
a It's, it's a circle that I don't think

437
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.859
you can get into. Um, SO I see in,

438
00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:16.790
in Plato there, uh, a strong sense that we

439
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.420
face these epistemic limits and these moral limits. Um,

440
00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:22.189
SO even if we had the knowledge, even if

441
00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:25.489
we get access Perfect justice in the way that

442
00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:28.619
the philosopher kings are supposed to. You get the

443
00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:31.099
sense from the republic that human beings would screw

444
00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:33.500
it up, right? Even if we had the knowledge,

445
00:21:33.589 --> 00:21:35.900
even if we had the technical ability, we wouldn't

446
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.300
be able to abide by, by it, right? We

447
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.010
wouldn't be able to live by it. Like, maybe

448
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.489
you could get the Just City off the ground,

449
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.819
but it would only last a day or a

450
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.380
week or something. Somebody would throw something in the

451
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.180
in the in the spokes and and mess it

452
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.500
up. Um, SO that's the contribution I see in

453
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.790
Plato. Uh, YOU also get very strong arguments in

454
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.250
Plato, uh, uh, in favor of the rule of

455
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.329
law. So Socrates' view in the, in the Creto

456
00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:01.569
dialogue that he's going to abide by the order

457
00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:04.089
of the court and face his death, even though

458
00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.530
he thinks it's unjust. He thinks he should follow

459
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.089
the laws of the city. Um, YOU got a

460
00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:12.030
strong argument for the rule of law there. Um,

461
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.579
ANOTHER dialogue, the statesman, I discussed, where a similar

462
00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:17.589
argument is given that even, even if you have

463
00:22:17.589 --> 00:22:20.150
a terrible state, it's better to obey the laws

464
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.229
of a terrible state than to uh disobey the

465
00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:25.150
laws and try to change them because you'll end

466
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.359
up doing more harm than good. Um, SO that's

467
00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:30.680
the view of Plato, Aristotle, um, I think is

468
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.520
more straightforwardly a conservative political philosopher, um, in the

469
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.839
sense that he, he has a conservative method, um,

470
00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:42.420
Aristotle's method in in ethics and in politics is

471
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.380
to work from what he calls the NOA, which

472
00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.699
are uh kind of opinions that have some, have

473
00:22:48.699 --> 00:22:51.260
something to be said about them, things that are

474
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.339
that have some argument for them that people seem

475
00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:54.939
to think that are ideas that are kind of

476
00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:57.859
floating around, right? And Aristotle wants to, to look

477
00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:00.339
at those and subject them to critical scrutiny and

478
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:01.979
to try to sort of seek the truth uh

479
00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:06.709
uh out of those ideas. Um So Aristotle doesn't

480
00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:08.959
come along and say everything we think about, uh,

481
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.660
you know, ethics and political philosophy is, is, is

482
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.160
nonsense, we should overturn it, and we should, you

483
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.300
know, build up our knowledge from scratch. He thinks,

484
00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.979
no, we should work from kind of within the

485
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.660
societies that we're brought up in, and for that

486
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.810
reason, he thinks that um habits are very important,

487
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.060
uh, a student of ethics and politics has to

488
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.459
be brought up in what he calls fine habits.

489
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.300
Um, AND out of that, we'll, we'll develop a

490
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.020
sense of, of justice and the common good, and

491
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.170
it's gonna allow us to, uh, uh, improve society

492
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.739
from within, right? And it's gonna, we can study

493
00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:44.319
political constitutions and understand what works and what doesn't

494
00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:46.900
work, and, you know, sure, we can have this

495
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.859
idea of the best constitution and a, and a

496
00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:51.329
kind of uh ultimate sense what he calls the,

497
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.369
the, the constitution that would be naturally just everywhere.

498
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:57.390
Um, BUT Aristotle, especially in his politics, he's more

499
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.989
focused on what works and what works given the

500
00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:03.270
particular circumstances, uh, that you're dealing with. And, and

501
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.790
so for me, that's a, that's a conservative way

502
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.650
of thinking about politics that, uh, it doesn't have

503
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.349
to be what's best, all things considered, but it's

504
00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:14.430
what's best for where we are and uh what

505
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.189
we're working from.

506
00:24:16.459 --> 00:24:21.859
How does conservatism then relate to Christianism and uh

507
00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:25.000
what kinds of conservative ideas can we find in

508
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.300
the philosophy of authors like Saint Augustine?

509
00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:32.670
Yeah, so the, the Christian aspect is what I

510
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.869
call the other uh source of uh conservative political

511
00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:39.189
philosophy. So there's the ancient source, and then there's

512
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:42.270
the Christian source. And of course, that that corresponds

513
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.939
to how many people think about the Western tradition.

514
00:24:44.989 --> 00:24:48.030
There's this, you know, influence of Athens, and then

515
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.550
there's this influence of Jerusalem, right? And the, and

516
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.270
the marriage of those two things is really what

517
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.030
makes the the Western tradition. And I share that

518
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.280
view, and I think that's in fact what conservatives

519
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.859
are trying to. ARE trying to conserve. Um, SO

520
00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:03.099
if the ancient aspect of that is the search

521
00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:07.040
for wisdom, What's the Christian aspect. Um, SO the,

522
00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:10.619
the subtitle of the, the chapter two on Christian

523
00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:14.000
philosophy is, uh, the limits, the limits of philosophy.

524
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.680
And for me, the, the theme of Christianity is

525
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.280
to say that we're not going to do this

526
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.270
on our own. Um, THE human being cannot achieve

527
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.560
the good life by his own efforts, um, and

528
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.310
we cannot achieve good societies by our own effort,

529
00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:35.979
uh. Takes our own effort, but it also takes

530
00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:37.619
what you might call, uh, you know, the gift

531
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.109
of grace. It takes the grace of God to,

532
00:25:40.329 --> 00:25:43.060
to be capable of happiness and to be lucky

533
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.819
enough to live in a, in a society that

534
00:25:44.819 --> 00:25:48.619
is, that is a good society. Um, SO I

535
00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:51.599
read Augustine and, and I see him. You know,

536
00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:54.760
criticizing the stoics, for example, and, and saying these

537
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.000
guys were just arrogant, you know, they were, they

538
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.920
were so prideful that they thought they could win

539
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.959
happiness by their own efforts alone, that, that human

540
00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:05.349
reason was capable of, you know, sort of winning,

541
00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:09.920
winning virtue, and, and, and, and, uh, being triumphant

542
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.439
in that way. And, uh, and of course, Augustine

543
00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:14.119
has this sort of, you know, darker sense of

544
00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:17.280
human nature that grows out of his theology. Um,

545
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.599
THE idea of original sin, of course, is associated

546
00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:22.969
with Augustine. Um, NOW, once you accept that, once

547
00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:24.569
you accept that, OK, we're not gonna win this

548
00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:27.329
thing on our own, we're not gonna, we're not

549
00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:31.290
gonna save ourselves, uh, by our own efforts. That's

550
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.290
kind of liberating in some ways, because then you

551
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.020
can, you can focus your attention on other things.

552
00:26:36.329 --> 00:26:40.010
Um, SO in Augustine, um, I traced 33 types

553
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.349
of limits. The first is the limits of human

554
00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:48.349
nature. Right, we're fallen creatures, uh, right, marked by

555
00:26:48.349 --> 00:26:52.040
sin, and there's, there's no way of overcoming that,

556
00:26:52.189 --> 00:26:56.449
right? Um. And, and that aligns with the second

557
00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:00.349
aspect of philosophical conservatism, this idea of um epistemic

558
00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:02.709
and especially moral limits, right? The idea that even

559
00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:05.839
if we could understand perfect justice, we wouldn't be

560
00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:08.859
able to uh implement and abide by it, right?

561
00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:11.349
Uh, SOMEBODY would, you know, eat the apple in

562
00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:13.310
the garden, right? So something like that would happen

563
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.949
to screw things up. Um, SO that's the first

564
00:27:15.949 --> 00:27:18.020
limit. The second limit has to do with politics,

565
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.250
um. You know, Augustine doesn't really have a political

566
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.489
theory, or he has a theology, uh, within which

567
00:27:24.489 --> 00:27:27.329
you can kind of extract aspects of, of political

568
00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:30.410
theory. Um, YOU know, Augustine thinks we need a

569
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.329
state because people aren't gonna be good on their

570
00:27:33.329 --> 00:27:35.660
own, and we need coercion to keep people in

571
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.930
line, uh, and that authority is actually good because

572
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.209
it's been instituted by God, um, and we're not,

573
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.170
but we're not gonna find salvation within, within the,

574
00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:47.569
the, the olus, right? The best we can do

575
00:27:47.569 --> 00:27:50.400
is to keep peace. And to allow a kind

576
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.439
of earthly happiness, right? So this is the The

577
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:56.680
two cities idea, the earthly city, which is the

578
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.650
city that we find ourselves in the the actual

579
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.750
city, and then there's the, the city of God,

580
00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:02.520
the heavenly city, and that's really where we should

581
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.920
be looking toward virtue and toward um um obedience

582
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.969
and love of God. Um, SO the second limit

583
00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:11.250
is the limit of politics, right? We're not gonna

584
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.530
save ourselves in the palace, and then the third

585
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:18.689
limit is of philosophy itself, um. For Augustine, uh,

586
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.569
you can't live a good life without, uh, love

587
00:28:21.569 --> 00:28:24.089
and worship of the highest good, right, which for

588
00:28:24.089 --> 00:28:28.569
him, of course, is, is, is God, um, and

589
00:28:28.569 --> 00:28:33.410
so that's Yeah, so if, if philosophy can't give

590
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.050
you a happy life, it's not gonna give you

591
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.739
a happy life within a within a political community.

592
00:28:38.209 --> 00:28:40.410
Um, THE other half of the Christian chapter, uh,

593
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.060
is, is on Aquinas, and it's um. It's, I

594
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.060
think developing more kind of the positive side of

595
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.500
the Christian influence, so Augustine gives us the sense

596
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.109
of limits and the, you know, the, the dark

597
00:28:51.109 --> 00:28:53.640
side of human nature. And this idea that we

598
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.680
can't save ourselves through philosophy, through reasoning, um, Aquinas,

599
00:28:57.719 --> 00:29:00.680
I think, kind of, uh, he, he revitalizes the

600
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.880
Christian political, uh, theorizing, um, because he, he returns

601
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.560
to ideas associated with Aristotle that we can have

602
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.400
a kind of mixed constitution, uh, and we can

603
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.000
pursue the common good. And of course, he develops

604
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.239
the idea of natural law that can serve as

605
00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:18.640
kind of a, a standard of value, right, a

606
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.400
sense of justice. Um, SO that's the second half

607
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.280
of the, of the Christian chapter, but for me,

608
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.079
Augustine is really the, the important figure.

609
00:29:26.729 --> 00:29:30.640
Mhm. So, moving on now to focusing a little

610
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.780
bit more on modern conservatism and keeping, keeping in

611
00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.680
mind the idea of change from within and that

612
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.239
means change from within the character of the existing

613
00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:47.560
political order. Um, TELL us about the conservative attitudes

614
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.520
or the attitudes by conservative thinkers, uh, toward the

615
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.109
American Revolution and the French Revolution.

616
00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.390
Yeah, so, chapter 3 is on um enlightenment conservatism.

617
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.750
Uh CONSERVATISM is sometimes thought of as a reaction

618
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.750
to the Enlightenment or rejection of the Enlightenment, but,

619
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.219
um, as Um, Jerry Muller, uh, someone who wrote

620
00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:15.569
a very good anthology on conservatism, has said, um,

621
00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:19.420
uh, conservatism is really a movement within the Enlightenment.

622
00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:22.969
It's a way of looking at, um, uh, using,

623
00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:26.020
using reason to promote human happiness in a certain

624
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.170
kind of way. And what the Enlightenment conservatives, uh,

625
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.699
provide is a kind of check against this idea

626
00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:36.130
that Uh, you know, human reason is going to,

627
00:30:36.329 --> 00:30:38.530
you know, lead to this kind of utopian society,

628
00:30:38.569 --> 00:30:41.359
or we could establish, you know, a perfect society,

629
00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:44.209
establish justice, um, in the way that the French

630
00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:48.780
revolutionaries, uh, thought that they could. Um, SO the

631
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.900
Enlightenment thinkers I discussed are, uh, David Hume, uh,

632
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.380
Edmund Burke, and then there's a final section on,

633
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.109
uh, some of the thoughts of the American founders

634
00:30:57.109 --> 00:31:00.709
from the, the Federalist Papers, and the contrast I

635
00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:03.469
draw between the American and French Revolution is not

636
00:31:03.469 --> 00:31:05.420
original to me, but you can find in most

637
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.829
conservatives who talk about these 22 great events, and

638
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:12.280
you can kind of see what the problem is.

639
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.510
So if conservatives are against Revolution, of course, conservatism

640
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.219
begins with Burke's um Critique of the French Revolution.

641
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.819
Well, how could conservatives support one revolution, the American

642
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:28.400
Revolution, but not support the French Revolution. And the

643
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.920
general idea is that the French Revolution was an

644
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.599
attempt to destroy, uh, it was, it was an

645
00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:36.599
attempt to destroy an existing society and replace it

646
00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:41.359
with something better. And, uh, the conservative critique of

647
00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:43.439
that is that that was foolish and caused a

648
00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:47.119
lot of misery and pain and destruction, and the

649
00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:50.400
people who initiated the French Revolution, you know, were

650
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.359
actually were were actually just looking for destruction. They

651
00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:56.680
weren't actually looking for anything that was, that was

652
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.640
good. Um, SO that's what you find in Burke.

653
00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:01.900
With the, with a, with a critique that this

654
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.380
is really about overthrowing a society. Um, WHAT'S the

655
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.739
reason for thinking the American Revolution is any different?

656
00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:11.339
So, as I understand it, the American Revolution was

657
00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:13.900
an attempt at reform. It was an attempt to

658
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.270
take an existing society, roughly British society, which had,

659
00:32:17.699 --> 00:32:20.339
you know, traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, and to

660
00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.910
preserve it as it was, right, but to preserve

661
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.859
it in a new, uh, independent political condition. Um,

662
00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:29.819
SO it wasn't really trying to destroy, it was

663
00:32:29.819 --> 00:32:33.489
trying to separate and, uh, establish some form of,

664
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.699
of independence. Uh, AND if you read, if you

665
00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:39.459
read Hume and Burke, uh, they, of course, Burke

666
00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:42.500
wrote quite a bit on the American, uh, on

667
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.579
the American Revolution because he was a participant in

668
00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:46.420
it cause he was a member of parliament. Um,

669
00:32:46.469 --> 00:32:48.739
BUT Hume too has some writings where he discusses

670
00:32:48.739 --> 00:32:51.300
the American cause, and Hume actually says that he's

671
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.839
American in his principles. Um, WHICH is very interesting,

672
00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.390
um. And he thought that the attempt by the

673
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.989
British to, you know, manage, manage the Americans was

674
00:33:02.989 --> 00:33:04.670
just foolish and it would be better just to

675
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.380
cut losses and and And uh and move on.

676
00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:12.219
Um, SO you can see there that, OK, so

677
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.670
now does that mean, you know, there's a conservative

678
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:20.430
justification for something like the American Revolution anytime a

679
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.910
set of subjects feel like they're being persecuted on

680
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.239
any grounds, I, I don't think so. I think

681
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.670
the American Revolution was a kind of a a

682
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.949
rare moment in history where uh you have these

683
00:33:31.949 --> 00:33:36.469
brilliant men come along and, you know, Try this

684
00:33:36.469 --> 00:33:39.069
thing that could have gone spectacularly wrong, and it

685
00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:41.270
didn't. So in hindsight, you can give a kind

686
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:46.599
of conservative philosophical defense of it, but unlike some

687
00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:48.630
liberal views, I don't think that justifies a kind

688
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.790
of right to revolution in general. Um, AND conservatives

689
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.550
would be, I think, critical of the, the kind

690
00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.949
of lay in reading of the American Revolution, wherein

691
00:34:00.949 --> 00:34:02.500
you just have to show that a certain number

692
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.569
of grievances have been have been committed, and then

693
00:34:05.569 --> 00:34:08.570
you can launch a revolution. The the conservatives are

694
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.260
gonna be very skeptical of that. They won't rule

695
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.649
out revolution, but it's always gonna be determinant on

696
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:15.770
the circumstances, and the judgment is not gonna rest

697
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.090
with any kind of philosophical principle, but it's gonna

698
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.129
rest with judgment and with, with prudence. And um

699
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:24.570
human himself is very strong on this. He says

700
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.770
that there's, there's nothing more foolish than to try

701
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.840
to develop a a philosophical theory of, of revolution,

702
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:33.708
uh. That almost always uh good sense and prudence

703
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:36.310
is on the side of, of um sticking with

704
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.790
what is already established.

705
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.909
So what kinds of ideas of conservative ideas can

706
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:47.708
we find among thinkers of the 19th century? And

707
00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:50.830
uh could you tell us specifically also, I, I

708
00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.350
mean, perhaps you can focus on the idea of

709
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.909
rhythm through authority. What does that mean? Yeah,

710
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.909
so, yeah, the subtitle of chapter 4 on 19th

711
00:35:00.909 --> 00:35:06.350
century is uh freedom through through authority. Um, WHICH

712
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.280
is a view associated with, uh, with Hegel. Yeah,

713
00:35:10.389 --> 00:35:13.070
so it's a kind of dialectic in in chapter

714
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.669
4 on 19th century philosophy, um, which is I

715
00:35:17.669 --> 00:35:20.810
think uh it's an attempt to deal with the

716
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.530
Enlightenment, right? So in the 19th century, you have

717
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.689
kind of the rise of democracy and the rise

718
00:35:25.689 --> 00:35:29.090
of what we now now would call liberalism, and

719
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.250
these things go in tandem. So you have this

720
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.050
kind of movement toward greater equality, both in the

721
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.280
social and in the political areas and culturally. Um,

722
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.669
AND then you have, um, uh, greater calls for

723
00:35:41.669 --> 00:35:45.189
liberty, right, to be released from various kinds of

724
00:35:45.189 --> 00:35:48.629
restraints, the, the restraints of tradition, uh, the restraints

725
00:35:48.629 --> 00:35:52.360
of the church, and so on. And, and in

726
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.389
my reading this is a kind of reaction against

727
00:35:54.389 --> 00:35:57.600
um what Burke had called the two great spirits

728
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.520
of uh European civilization, which he called the spirit

729
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.169
of the gentleman and the spirit of religion. And

730
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:07.969
those, I think, correspond to these calls for equality

731
00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:10.649
and liberty. So the, the spirit of the gentleman

732
00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:13.649
is this idea that uh we're not equal, that

733
00:36:13.649 --> 00:36:15.409
we have these certain kinds of standards that are

734
00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:18.169
encapsulated in this idea of the, of the European

735
00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:22.000
gentlemen who, who, who upholds various virtues, right, which,

736
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.520
which really comes out of the kind of chivalric

737
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.489
tradition. Um, And, and that provides a kind of

738
00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:31.530
check on self-interest and so on. Um, AND then

739
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:32.820
on the other hand, you have the spirit of

740
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.530
religion, um, which is a check on liberty, which

741
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.449
is to say, actually, you can't just live however

742
00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:39.850
you want, even if you're not harming other people.

743
00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.409
We have these duties and obligations, uh, that come

744
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:46.899
from God ultimately, and are, uh, you know, Encapsulated

745
00:36:46.899 --> 00:36:48.899
in the church and the church has a certain

746
00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:51.419
role in society to, you know, ensure that people

747
00:36:51.419 --> 00:36:54.979
are, are, um, are being moral up to a

748
00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:57.679
certain extent. And so by the 19th century, these

749
00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:01.050
two things are really destroyed, um. Burke's idea of

750
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.409
the gentleman kind of, you know, falls by the

751
00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:06.409
wayside, and of course the established churches are, are

752
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.370
literally destroyed in the case of the French. And

753
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.530
so you have this kind of void, um, void

754
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.709
of spirit, you might say, and um, yeah, for

755
00:37:15.709 --> 00:37:17.449
me the 19th century is about this idea of

756
00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:19.489
spirit, which is very difficult to describe, very difficult

757
00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:23.750
to really understand what that is, um. Um, BUT,

758
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.760
but for, for me, it's this idea that a

759
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.280
society is not, it's not just a set of

760
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.439
principles, it's not just a set of abstract ideas,

761
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.520
but a society is a kind of a, it's

762
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.310
a kind of a living thing. It has a,

763
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.889
it has a soul, it has a spirit, and

764
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.760
it unfolds in a certain kind of way that

765
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.760
is not really up to the direction of any

766
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.379
individual person, much less any individual politician, um. And

767
00:37:48.379 --> 00:37:49.860
so you have to work with that, right? It's

768
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.979
like if you're a, you know, if you're an

769
00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:54.540
introvert, let's say, and you're gonna, you know, go

770
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.139
out and be a salesperson or go out and

771
00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:58.340
do something that's very extroverted, you know, you can't

772
00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.300
just do that. You have to, you have to

773
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.300
either train yourself or, you know, I don't know,

774
00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:05.209
yeah, find some other line of work. There's certain

775
00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:07.260
things that you, you just can't go in that

776
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.949
direction, right? So things have a kind of motion

777
00:38:09.949 --> 00:38:12.310
of their own, I think. And so, in the

778
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.350
19th century, you have this kind of, uh, you

779
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.469
know, void of spirit, in some sense. And so

780
00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:18.110
something has to come into the void and fill

781
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.510
it. And in the 19th century, what I see

782
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.909
are these very strong spirits of, of modernity, um,

783
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.739
one, a spirit of, uh, a spirit of democracy.

784
00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:31.889
And I associate that with, uh, Alexei de Tocqueville's

785
00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:35.610
work, uh, democracy in America, and he sees democracy

786
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.379
as this kind of inevitable force that's just, it's

787
00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:40.530
coming, right? It's coming to Europe, it's coming to

788
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.570
the new world, and like, you can bury your

789
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.610
head in the sand, but, uh, it's coming. And

790
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.770
the thing that you have to do is to

791
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.250
try to deal with that and to try to

792
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.850
manage it. And to me, that's a real conservative

793
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.449
kind of disposition, like, OK, this is the way

794
00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:54.679
the world is. Let's see if we can manage

795
00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:56.399
it. Let's see if we can mitigate, you know,

796
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.639
some of its downsides and and take advantage of

797
00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:02.149
its benefits. So it's the spirit of democracy, spirit

798
00:39:02.149 --> 00:39:04.389
of equality, you might, you might call it. And

799
00:39:04.389 --> 00:39:06.429
then there's also the spirit of freedom or the

800
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:08.750
spirit of liberty, and I associate that with John

801
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.699
Stuart Mill, who of course is no conservative, um,

802
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.510
is really in some sense he's the, he's the

803
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.379
most classic of the classical liberals. And Mil comes

804
00:39:18.379 --> 00:39:20.209
along and says, look, we've got this conflict in

805
00:39:20.209 --> 00:39:23.820
society between authority and the individual, and nobody's come

806
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.300
up with a good idea of how to combine

807
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.459
these two things, how to say, here's the, here's

808
00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:29.939
the domain of society that's reserved to the individual,

809
00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:32.949
and here's the domain that's left to society. And

810
00:39:32.949 --> 00:39:35.189
Mil comes along and says, well, you know, we

811
00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:37.830
have this principle that, you know, people should be

812
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.590
free to live how they want, provided they're not

813
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.850
harming others. And that's gonna tell us that, you

814
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.510
know, this is the domain of the individual and

815
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.669
the state should really, you know, butt out unless

816
00:39:46.669 --> 00:39:49.790
it's preventing harm to other people. And that's the

817
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.469
spirit of liberty. So you take those two together,

818
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.989
you have this idea of equality, this idea of

819
00:39:53.989 --> 00:39:56.790
liberty, and of course, modern liberalism is usually defined

820
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.669
in terms of those two values, um, the value

821
00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:02.429
of liberty and the value of equality. The conservative

822
00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:06.679
critique of that is is to say that a

823
00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:10.800
society is much more than than um liberty and

824
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.850
equality. Um, SO, Uh, one of the thinkers, I

825
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.139
discussed is, uh, this guy James Fitz James Stephen,

826
00:40:19.169 --> 00:40:22.919
who was a utilitarian, uh, critic of, of Mil,

827
00:40:22.979 --> 00:40:24.090
and he was a kind of, he was a

828
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.729
kind of liberal, um, although he was much more

829
00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:31.260
conservative than than Mil was. And um uh Stephen

830
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.979
writes this book called Liberty, uh, Equality Fraternity, which

831
00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:36.419
of course is the Is the motto of the

832
00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:39.139
French Revolution, and he says, look, all these things

833
00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:42.030
are good, taken in isolation, but um they're not

834
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.969
ends in themselves. They're they're supposed to serve something

835
00:40:45.379 --> 00:40:48.379
uh greater. They're supposed to serve something better, right?

836
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.260
Like the society, society is not about just releasing

837
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.340
all restraints, right? Because if you did that, you

838
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.300
wouldn't have any morality, cause morality is really about

839
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.959
restraints in one form or another. And, and same

840
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.889
with equality, and, um, and same with, same with

841
00:41:04.889 --> 00:41:08.750
fraternity. Um, SO Stephen thought that we need, uh,

842
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.709
we need to think about institutions as restraints on,

843
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.790
on individual, on the individual will. And we have

844
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.040
to sort of think about institutions, ways to shape

845
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.840
them so that we, so that we can achieve

846
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.600
the common good, so that we can achieve the

847
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.919
overall good. And he thinks of institutions as like,

848
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.010
um, you know, reservoirs or things that direct water

849
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.850
in a certain way. So the, the water is

850
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.560
the is the liberty, right? It's the freedom to

851
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.600
do, I'm sorry. It's to do what you want

852
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.209
and, and institutions are the waterways that get the,

853
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.199
get the water going where it's supposed to go,

854
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.330
right? But liberty is not gonna tell you where

855
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.330
the water is supposed to go by itself. Liberty

856
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.810
is a kind of a, a kind of a

857
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.169
wild gas, as, as Burke calls it at one

858
00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:51.870
point. So we need institutions to kind of direct

859
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.110
people in a certain way. And, and the way

860
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.620
to do that is not to just like give

861
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.229
up on this idea that the state should have

862
00:41:57.229 --> 00:42:00.149
any role in morality, um, but to use the

863
00:42:00.149 --> 00:42:02.350
state to shape people in a certain kind of

864
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.949
way. And um Steven is associated with a view

865
00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:07.969
that later comes to be called uh legal moralism,

866
00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:10.030
um, which is part of this debate in the

867
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.709
20th century between uh Lord Patrick Devlin and HLA

868
00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:16.629
Hart, uh, which is a big debate within uh

869
00:42:16.629 --> 00:42:20.560
a legal philosophy. And um, Patrick Devlin is great.

870
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:22.270
I, I talk about him in the book, uh,

871
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.820
a lot too. Uh I got a lot out

872
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.610
of reading his enforcement of morals. He's kind of

873
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.570
a, he's kind of a minor figure, but he's,

874
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.419
he's important in the book. Uh, THE last thinker

875
00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:33.399
of the 19th century, so we have this problem,

876
00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:35.770
right? So this, these spirits, the spirit of liberty,

877
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.770
the spirit of equality, OK? If you, if you

878
00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.370
unleash those spirits, then it's gonna wreak havoc and

879
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.169
probably destroy your society. OK, so we need some

880
00:42:44.169 --> 00:42:46.330
authority, we need to allow the spirit of authority

881
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.850
to check these, these two kind of volatile forces.

882
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:51.979
And so we're still left with this question. Well,

883
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.320
how do you reconcile these two things, right? How

884
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.899
do we reconcile freedom and authority? Um, AND for

885
00:42:56.899 --> 00:42:58.939
me, Hegel is the way to reconcile these two

886
00:42:58.939 --> 00:43:03.340
things, because, um, Hagel thinks that, uh, true freedom

887
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.020
is not you doing whatever you want. True freedom

888
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.620
is you uh living within the society that you

889
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.489
inhabit, and, uh, to, to seek freedom through participation

890
00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:17.909
in the society. It's to seek freedom through, uh,

891
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.639
having a family, it's to seek participation and freedom

892
00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:24.159
through, uh, you know, living in a society. And

893
00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:25.919
so on. So he thinks that a true freedom

894
00:43:25.919 --> 00:43:27.439
has to be one out of what he calls

895
00:43:27.439 --> 00:43:30.139
the actual, and it's a very long and complicated

896
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:32.159
argument. I won't be able to do it justice

897
00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:35.840
here, um, but yeah, Hegel's idea is that that

898
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.719
freedom exists in participation in some measure. We're not

899
00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:42.639
made free by, by releasing the restraints. We're made

900
00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:47.399
free by committing ourselves to, uh, genuine, genuinely worthwhile

901
00:43:47.399 --> 00:43:49.120
pursuits. And, and in some ways, I think this

902
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.689
is a return to what's sometimes called the ancient

903
00:43:51.689 --> 00:43:55.080
conception of liberty. Which is that uh a free

904
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.959
person is someone who has responsibilities and has a

905
00:43:57.959 --> 00:44:00.600
certain role in the community. It's not someone who

906
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.090
just lives how they want, as long as they

907
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.639
don't harm others. Um, Stephen says at some point

908
00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:09.239
about Mill's idea that, um, if Mill's idea was

909
00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:11.560
correct, then In the day of judgment, it would

910
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.159
be a good plea to come to God and

911
00:44:13.159 --> 00:44:15.360
to say, you know, I harmed nobody and I

912
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.719
pleased myself, and that would be like sufficient to

913
00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:19.959
get you into heaven or something. And Steven just

914
00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:21.719
thinks like, that's a crazy idea, you know, like,

915
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.639
a, a life is not about that, right? Life

916
00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:26.229
is about, you know, doing things that are worthwhile,

917
00:44:26.399 --> 00:44:28.479
and so on. Uh, SO to sum that up,

918
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.159
the, the 19th century. It's about freedom, but it's

919
00:44:32.159 --> 00:44:33.959
about a specific kind of freedom, and it's about

920
00:44:33.959 --> 00:44:38.080
a freedom that comes through authority, not in opposition

921
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.840
to authority. Um, AND so that, uh, cuts against

922
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.600
these two kind of dominant modern conceptions of liberty

923
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.280
as either this kind of negative aspect where I'm

924
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.979
just sort of left alone. And also this positive

925
00:44:50.979 --> 00:44:52.969
aspect of liberty that the job of the state

926
00:44:52.969 --> 00:44:54.530
is to, you know, make sure I have health

927
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.100
care and to make sure that I, you know,

928
00:44:56.219 --> 00:44:58.860
have the things to make me free. It's like,

929
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.620
no, you have to win freedom for yourself through

930
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.060
participating in the in the community that you're born

931
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.860
into. Um, SO that's the way to reconcile, I

932
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.250
think, uh, freedom and authority. Mhm.

933
00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:12.830
So, when it comes to the 20th century, could

934
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.510
you tell us about this very interesting split that

935
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:21.780
occurred between the conservatives who embraced economic and social

936
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.550
liberalism like uh in figures like Friedrich Hayek and

937
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.040
Robert. Nozic and I think we can also call

938
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.560
them libertarians, at least to some extent. And uh

939
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.520
those who remained faithful to the tenets of traditionalist

940
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.679
conservatism, such as Roger Scruton.

941
00:45:41.449 --> 00:45:43.959
Yeah, so the last chapter in uh part one

942
00:45:43.959 --> 00:45:47.800
conservatism passed is on conservative thinkers of the, of

943
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.010
the 20th century. Um, THE subtitle is a tradition

944
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.469
of liberty. Um, SO in the 20th, 20th century.

945
00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:58.840
Um, CONSERVATIVES, it looks like they kind of become

946
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.280
liberals because they're trying to defend what are broadly

947
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.639
liberal societies and many of the liberal reforms that

948
00:46:05.639 --> 00:46:09.199
were won by people like John Stuart Mill in

949
00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:11.669
the 19th century, get kind of absorbed, I think,

950
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.050
into the conservative tradition. And then of course you

951
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.810
have the major uh political uh global conflicts of

952
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:23.409
the time, um, Soviet communism and uh Nazi totalitarianism.

953
00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:26.080
So these, there are these genuine threats to liberty,

954
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.169
and conservatives come along and join with liberals in

955
00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:32.969
defense of what I call our shared home. Um,

956
00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:36.139
AND so it looks like conservatives were forced to

957
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:38.620
fight on the side of liberalism to to defend

958
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.219
what, of course, are genuinely uh good sources of

959
00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:46.100
value. Um, BUT it looks like maybe conservatives maybe

960
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.899
became liberals in the 20th century, at least that's

961
00:46:47.899 --> 00:46:50.320
been the read of, of. Of some people, and,

962
00:46:50.409 --> 00:46:52.600
and I think it's, it's reasonable to say that

963
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.800
uh conservatives are committed to certain aspects of liberalism.

964
00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:58.800
If you think that our societies are good and

965
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.120
worthy of con uh conserving, then you will think

966
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.989
that the, even the aspects that could be called

967
00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:09.419
liberal will be worthy of, of conservation. Um, But

968
00:47:09.469 --> 00:47:11.429
in my view, uh, the fact that there are

969
00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:14.989
things about liberal society that are worth conserving does

970
00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:17.780
not show that that we should be liberals necessarily.

971
00:47:18.229 --> 00:47:21.620
Um, CERTAINLY not in any kind of philosophical sense,

972
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.070
um, but nevertheless, in the 20th century, that that's

973
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.979
kind of how things went. So we have the,

974
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.510
you have the rise of, um, What now we

975
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.590
call classical liberalism, which was an attempt to return

976
00:47:32.949 --> 00:47:35.469
to the liberalism of the 19th century, and it's

977
00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:39.429
very much a reaction against the, the, uh, sort

978
00:47:39.429 --> 00:47:42.669
of more progressive form of liberalism that saw a

979
00:47:42.669 --> 00:47:46.830
stronger view for the state in uh improving people's

980
00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:51.929
economic conditions. Um, AND so classical liberal liberalism comes,

981
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.159
uh, comes against that, uh, but it's really united

982
00:47:55.159 --> 00:47:57.580
on the, on the idea of social liberalism that

983
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.100
we should be free from various kinds of social

984
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.219
restraints, that people should be free to live how

985
00:48:02.219 --> 00:48:05.060
they want, provided they're not harming others in Mill

986
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.879
sense. Um, SO in this chapter, I talk about,

987
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.719
uh, two of the most prominent libertarian or classical

988
00:48:11.719 --> 00:48:14.449
liberals in, in philosophy anyway, and that's Hayek, uh,

989
00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:18.600
and, and Robert Nozick, um, Nozick, who gave the

990
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.550
kind of libertarian critique of of John Rawls's famous

991
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.280
book, uh, A Theory of Justice, and then the,

992
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.439
the more traditional conservatives are, uh, Michael Oakeshott, um,

993
00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:34.280
British political thinker, and Roger Scruton, also British. Uh,

994
00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:37.399
SO the, the dynamic between these two views, uh,

995
00:48:38.489 --> 00:48:42.110
I think the traditional conservatives, Oakshot and scrutin are

996
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.229
really at the heart of conservatism, and the classical

997
00:48:45.229 --> 00:48:47.550
liberal is, is kind of, it's part of the

998
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.310
story in the 20th century, but I don't think

999
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.750
it's essential to what conservatism is. I think it

1000
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.389
was a, a contingent reaction to the various threats

1001
00:48:55.389 --> 00:48:59.149
that that arose out of liberalism on the one

1002
00:48:59.149 --> 00:49:01.669
hand, and this, this more modern idea of liberalism

1003
00:49:01.669 --> 00:49:04.870
as being about economic equality, and also the, the

1004
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.629
kind of foreign threats to the liberal order. Um,

1005
00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:13.159
SCRUTINY in particular, um, his first book on conservatism,

1006
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.959
uh, titled The Meaning of Conservatism, which was published

1007
00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:19.280
in 1980. Um, IF you read the, the preface

1008
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.989
or the introduction to that book, he says that

1009
00:49:21.989 --> 00:49:24.530
he wrote that book in order to combat the

1010
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.419
rise of what he called Thatcherism at the time,

1011
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.439
which was uh a a movement within the Conservative

1012
00:49:31.439 --> 00:49:33.870
Party in the United Kingdom to kind of attach

1013
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:37.949
the The Hayekian or the classical liberal philosophy to

1014
00:49:37.949 --> 00:49:41.280
the Conservative Party, and indeed Thatcher is said to

1015
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.300
have held up, I think. I think Hayek's, the

1016
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.219
Constitution of liberty, she like held it up at

1017
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:48.129
some party meeting and said like, this is what

1018
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:50.540
we believed and banged it on the table and

1019
00:49:50.929 --> 00:49:54.100
and and scrutin, you know, being a traditional conservative

1020
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.709
who who Who traces the movement back to Burke,

1021
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:00.729
uh, could see that that was not what conservatism

1022
00:50:00.729 --> 00:50:03.250
was really about. And, and his critique of that

1023
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.449
uh aspect of, of conservatism in the 20th century

1024
00:50:06.449 --> 00:50:09.649
is that uh it really elevated the market above

1025
00:50:09.649 --> 00:50:13.330
all else, and it elevated economic liberty above all

1026
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:16.780
else. And conservatives are in favor of the market,

1027
00:50:16.929 --> 00:50:21.439
um. ARE in favor of capitalism, broadly speaking, um,

1028
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.449
but, but not in any kind of ultimate sense.

1029
00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:26.169
So conservatives will recognize, uh, kind of in line

1030
00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:28.810
with Marxists actually, that there are some real downsides

1031
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.729
to markets and markets really disrupt things and cause

1032
00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:35.159
all kinds of chaos and change. And so, uh,

1033
00:50:35.169 --> 00:50:36.770
we want to be kind of skeptical of the

1034
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.679
market and, and use it, uh, in order to,

1035
00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.409
uh, you know, improve economic growth and to make

1036
00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:44.370
better lives for people, but we don't want to,

1037
00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:46.040
we don't want to worship it as some kind

1038
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.560
of idle. Um, SO I see, I see Oakeshott

1039
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.320
in scrutiny as, as reacting both toward the, the

1040
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.040
modern liberals, uh, but also toward the classical liberals

1041
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.250
who, who, um, uh, are conservative in one sense,

1042
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.520
they're conservative in an economic sense, but not really

1043
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.719
in a, in a social sense, um. And these,

1044
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.300
these divisions, I think, are still with us in

1045
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.620
some measure. So one thing that comes out of

1046
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.739
the libertarian movement in the 20th century is the

1047
00:51:16.739 --> 00:51:21.010
so-called fusionist conservatism, which was a marriage in America

1048
00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:25.580
between, um, kind of traditional social conservatives, uh, religious

1049
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.169
conservatives, you might say, um, That, uh, who were

1050
00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:32.530
opposed to communism in the in the 1950s and

1051
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:37.090
1960s, and the uh libertarians or or free market

1052
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.129
types, and fusionist conservatism was supposed to kind of

1053
00:51:40.129 --> 00:51:43.270
blend those two things, so the The social conservatives

1054
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:45.989
could support the free markets, uh, but not the

1055
00:51:45.989 --> 00:51:49.750
kind of, you know, libertine lifestyle of the libertarians

1056
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.110
or the classical liberals, and the classical liberals could

1057
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.750
say, well, you guys are social conservatives, but at

1058
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.850
least you support free markets. And of course, both

1059
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:59.570
groups were very opposed to communism, uh, and the

1060
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.929
Soviet Empire, and both, both views were opposed to

1061
00:52:02.929 --> 00:52:04.889
modern liberalism. Uh, SO it was a kind of

1062
00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:07.370
a, it was a kind of a convenient alliance,

1063
00:52:07.409 --> 00:52:10.489
and it, and it was very successful, characterizes the

1064
00:52:10.489 --> 00:52:13.719
Reagan era in America and and Thatcher, of course,

1065
00:52:14.129 --> 00:52:18.050
and uh uh it kind of culminate, it sort

1066
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.969
of peaks in the 90s, I would say, and

1067
00:52:19.969 --> 00:52:21.820
then you get a kind of You got a

1068
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.979
kind of status quo conservative politics, uh, you know,

1069
00:52:26.139 --> 00:52:29.979
for, for the 2000s and 2010s, and then of

1070
00:52:29.979 --> 00:52:34.250
course, everything was blown up in, in 2016 with

1071
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.090
with Trump.

1072
00:52:36.699 --> 00:52:40.270
Uh YES, uh, let's talk then about Trump, uh,

1073
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.300
about the present of conservatism. That fusionism that you

1074
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.510
mentioned there that occurred in the 20th century between

1075
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:54.620
conservatism, or traditional conservatism and libertarianism. How did it

1076
00:52:54.620 --> 00:53:00.520
eventually transform into the sort of populist nationalist conservatism

1077
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.330
associated with Donald Trump and his supporters?

1078
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.810
Yeah, that's a great, great question. So that's really

1079
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.850
the, the focus of part two is to try

1080
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:13.090
to connect the ideas of conservatism that are explored

1081
00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:16.600
in part one, these philosophical ideas and say, well,

1082
00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:19.729
of what relevance to these ideas have uh in

1083
00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:23.399
the current moment. What relevance, to what extent is

1084
00:53:23.399 --> 00:53:27.320
conservatism present connected to conservatism past? And there's good

1085
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.560
reason to think that they have nothing to do

1086
00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.000
with each other. Um, AND the task of the

1087
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.379
book was to try to say, oh, no, actually,

1088
00:53:33.399 --> 00:53:35.520
there's, there's more to it than you think, like,

1089
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.879
you know, Donald Trump is no conservative political philosopher,

1090
00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:40.399
but, you know, if you take some of these

1091
00:53:40.399 --> 00:53:43.399
ideas that are associated with the conservative movement that's

1092
00:53:43.399 --> 00:53:46.409
going on now, seriously, you can trace them in

1093
00:53:46.439 --> 00:53:49.959
in various ways. Um, SO how did that story

1094
00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:53.979
happen? Um, So the story I want to tell

1095
00:53:53.979 --> 00:53:57.860
and and Um, I don't know how convincing it

1096
00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:03.540
is, but people more interested in the, in the

1097
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.590
history of American conservatism than I than I am,

1098
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.219
will have a more thorough story to tell. I'm

1099
00:54:08.219 --> 00:54:10.419
really interested in the ideas, but as far as

1100
00:54:10.419 --> 00:54:12.739
the, the, the politics go, I, I think the

1101
00:54:12.739 --> 00:54:16.459
simplest story is just that the fusionist, uh, consensus

1102
00:54:16.899 --> 00:54:20.580
just failed to conserve anything, um. This is a

1103
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.409
view that I think Patrick Denin has talked about

1104
00:54:22.409 --> 00:54:25.169
this and why liberalism fails, and in his, his

1105
00:54:25.169 --> 00:54:29.020
latest book, a regime change, uh, fusionism, it was

1106
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.239
supposed to be conservative, but it ended up just,

1107
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.139
uh, kind of promoting free markets, which, yeah, that's

1108
00:54:34.139 --> 00:54:37.010
a good thing. But it didn't really do anything

1109
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:41.010
for social conservatives, right? Society got way, way, way

1110
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:46.330
more liberal, um. And, uh, didn't shrink government or

1111
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.129
do any of those things that were promised, right?

1112
00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:50.209
Oh, we're gonna get a smaller government. Well, no,

1113
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.810
that didn't really happen. Um, AND so it just

1114
00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.209
really, it really just failed to conserve anything that

1115
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:58.850
conservatives care about. And so, the populist movement, I

1116
00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.770
think, is a reaction to that, to say, look,

1117
00:55:00.879 --> 00:55:03.570
we voted for you guys, you know, on these

1118
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.010
platforms. You said you were going to do this,

1119
00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.689
you said you were going to do that, and

1120
00:55:07.689 --> 00:55:10.010
it hasn't happened, right? Uh, YOU haven't been listening

1121
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:12.439
to us and, you know, we tried to You

1122
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:15.439
know, vote, vote, vote for these kind of respectable

1123
00:55:15.439 --> 00:55:17.959
people like, you know, Mitt Romney's and the George

1124
00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:20.919
W. Bush's and and the John McCains and these

1125
00:55:20.919 --> 00:55:23.399
kind of figures, and they were all useless, and

1126
00:55:23.399 --> 00:55:26.209
they didn't get the job done. Uh, SO, OK,

1127
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.409
this big loud guy is gonna come along who,

1128
00:55:28.879 --> 00:55:31.439
yeah, OK, he's, he's he's not a very nice

1129
00:55:31.439 --> 00:55:33.719
guy. He doesn't really have conservative principles, but he's,

1130
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.570
you know, gonna advocate for us and he's gonna

1131
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.179
He's going to, uh, you know, actually do the

1132
00:55:38.179 --> 00:55:39.780
things that he says he's that you guys said

1133
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.050
you were gonna do, uh, and so we'll just,

1134
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.229
we'll just go with him, um. And that has

1135
00:55:45.229 --> 00:55:49.070
been successful, it seems, uh, and so there's a

1136
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:52.310
kind of, there's a kind of backlash against the

1137
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:54.989
kind of respectable form of politics that was, you

1138
00:55:54.989 --> 00:55:57.949
know, kind of conservative in, in, in manner and

1139
00:55:57.949 --> 00:56:01.530
conservative in in temperament and and affect, but not

1140
00:56:01.889 --> 00:56:05.949
conservative in results. Um, AND then the, the nationalist

1141
00:56:05.949 --> 00:56:08.080
side, I think, is to say, well, you know,

1142
00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:10.199
we want to like refocus on what we're doing,

1143
00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:12.080
and we don't want to be involved in all

1144
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.399
these global conflicts and, and we're, we're gonna focus

1145
00:56:15.399 --> 00:56:17.360
on the health of our own of our own

1146
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.520
societies before we look at the before we look

1147
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.560
at other societies. Um, SO that's, that's, I think

1148
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.219
the story it was just You know, conservatives did

1149
00:56:27.219 --> 00:56:29.659
a bad job. They didn't do anything they said

1150
00:56:29.659 --> 00:56:32.610
they were gonna do. The conservative electorate really remained,

1151
00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:37.379
and they saw an opportunity to, you know, hire

1152
00:56:37.379 --> 00:56:39.219
somebody for the job that was willing to do

1153
00:56:39.219 --> 00:56:41.689
it and didn't really care what anybody thought, uh,

1154
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.020
especially didn't care what the media thought, or the,

1155
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.370
the so-called liberal establishment, and so on. And uh

1156
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.419
Yeah, kind of obvious in hindsight, I think, uh,

1157
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.350
but we're still grappling with this, right? So, you

1158
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.780
know, every day there's some new thing, the tariffs

1159
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.290
and the foreign policy and this and that, and,

1160
00:56:58.699 --> 00:57:01.760
uh, I don't know, for conser conservative is supposed

1161
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.469
to be kind of flexible, right? So it's it's

1162
00:57:03.469 --> 00:57:05.179
not supposed to be ideological, it's not supposed to

1163
00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:07.979
be doctrinaire, it's supposed to be kind of flexible

1164
00:57:07.979 --> 00:57:10.580
and move at the time. So I'm many conservatives

1165
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.370
are kind of unsettled by. Everything that's happened in

1166
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:16.129
the last decade or so, but I think, no,

1167
00:57:16.229 --> 00:57:19.010
it's, it's necessary in some measure, and you have

1168
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:22.770
to be very careful. Uh, THERE'S reasons to be

1169
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:26.090
afraid of populism, uh, but I think ignoring it

1170
00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:28.850
is worse. So I think populism, it's more of

1171
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:32.010
a, it's more of a symptom than a cause

1172
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:35.550
of, of the discontent that that we're experiencing in,

1173
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.250
in the, in the west.

1174
00:57:38.419 --> 00:57:40.620
So in the latter part of your book, you

1175
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.939
go through several different topics and modern aspect, aspects

1176
00:57:45.939 --> 00:57:50.939
of modern modern society that conservatives have a say

1177
00:57:50.939 --> 00:57:55.969
in or they hold certain attitudes toward them. So

1178
00:57:55.969 --> 00:57:57.840
let me ask you, I, I'm not sure if

1179
00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.969
we will have time to go through all of

1180
00:57:59.969 --> 00:58:03.409
them, but at least let's go through some illustrative

1181
00:58:03.409 --> 00:58:08.120
examples here. What kinds of attitudes do conservatives hold

1182
00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.610
toward immigration?

1183
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:15.489
Yeah, so in the nationalist chapter, um, chapter 6.

1184
00:58:16.149 --> 00:58:18.659
Um, I put forward a kind of conservative view

1185
00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:24.560
of nationalism that's not ideological. It's really about um

1186
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:30.760
thinking about uh the domestic political community, prioritizing the

1187
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.879
interests of citizens over the interests of foreigners, and

1188
00:58:33.879 --> 00:58:37.270
it's viewing the nation in terms of uh territory

1189
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:42.479
and law rather than ethnicity or religion or or

1190
00:58:42.479 --> 00:58:44.530
anything like that. Um, SO it's supposed to be

1191
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.330
a kind of minimal view of nationalism that's not

1192
00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:49.370
subject to the kind of objections that people put

1193
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.050
forward that, oh, this is just, you know, white

1194
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.330
nationalism or Christian nationalism or whatever kinds of things

1195
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.570
that people say. Um, AND then the big issue

1196
00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:02.110
that's raised by, um, Uh, by, by the nationalist

1197
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.879
idea, especially in the current moment, and it's an

1198
00:59:04.879 --> 00:59:08.360
issue that drives a lot of populism is the

1199
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.169
issue of immigration. So there's a fairly long discussion

1200
00:59:11.169 --> 00:59:15.000
of immigration in, in Chapter 6. And, uh, the

1201
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.399
view I put forward is that uh conservatives are

1202
00:59:18.399 --> 00:59:22.800
not opposed to immigration in principle. Um, Although I

1203
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.239
do think that they are opposed to illegal immigration

1204
00:59:25.239 --> 00:59:29.080
in principle, because illegal immigration is a violation of

1205
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.750
the rule of law, um, by definition. And so

1206
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.780
there's a kind of open and shut case against

1207
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.149
illegal immigration on conservative grounds, uh, if you believe

1208
00:59:38.149 --> 00:59:41.949
in the rule of law, uh, so I explain

1209
00:59:41.949 --> 00:59:45.219
that argument in chapter 6. ON the other side,

1210
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.429
there's legal immigration, and there you might take different

1211
00:59:48.429 --> 00:59:50.389
views. I, I don't think conservatives have to be

1212
00:59:50.389 --> 00:59:55.199
opposed to legal immigration in principle. Um, IN a

1213
00:59:55.199 --> 00:59:59.949
democratic society. You might think that legal immigration should

1214
00:59:59.949 --> 01:00:02.590
be determined by what the people want, and it

1215
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:07.229
should be uh decided legislatively, and of course, the

1216
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.669
problem in America is that the legislature hasn't been

1217
01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:13.429
able to pass any kind of immigration reform, and

1218
01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:16.520
so it's been subject to the whims of whatever

1219
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.669
administration is in charge, so the Biden administration just

1220
01:00:18.669 --> 01:00:22.209
kind of, you know, Didn't bother to enforce the

1221
01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:24.010
laws and so we had record numbers of, of

1222
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.479
illegal immigration and now Trump is shutting things down

1223
01:00:26.479 --> 01:00:28.330
and so, you know, it just depends on who's

1224
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:34.060
in office. Um, Now, uh, even if, so yeah,

1225
01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:36.570
even if you have legal immigration, uh, it should

1226
01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:39.600
still follow the will of the electorate, and, um,

1227
01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:42.370
if you look at opinion polling, uh, in America,

1228
01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:43.929
and, and I think this is true in Europe

1229
01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:47.689
as well, most people want less immigration, even, even

1230
01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:49.850
legal immigration, even if the law is not being

1231
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.000
broken, people think, ah, you know, the societies are,

1232
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.699
it's changing a little too fast, right? It was,

1233
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.209
there's too many people coming in, it's a strain

1234
01:00:58.209 --> 01:01:01.189
on social services. Uh, YOU know, this is not

1235
01:01:01.189 --> 01:01:03.189
the country that I grew up in. Things have

1236
01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:07.350
changed too quickly. And for years, politicians have just

1237
01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:11.760
ignored those desires. Um, YOU know, for one reason

1238
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.870
or another, whether they like the idea of having

1239
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:16.239
more labor come in or, you know, they're serving

1240
01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:19.800
all these different interests. And it also just looks,

1241
01:01:19.899 --> 01:01:22.540
it looks like being open to immigration is a

1242
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.580
good thing, right? We should welcome people, we should

1243
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.169
be generous, we should, you know, want to help

1244
01:01:27.169 --> 01:01:30.760
people who are, who are fleeing. You know, catastrophic

1245
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.959
situations and so on. Um, SO the pro, uh,

1246
01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:36.449
the pro-immigration side really has their heart is in

1247
01:01:36.449 --> 01:01:40.159
the right place and, and And there's reason to

1248
01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.560
support it. Um, BUT we have to be prudent

1249
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.000
about these things, and, you know, you just open

1250
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.600
up the doors and let people come in, or

1251
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.479
maybe even abolish borders, which some libertarians want to

1252
01:01:49.479 --> 01:01:52.300
do, um, you're not gonna have a country as,

1253
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.399
as President Trump is fond of saying, right? A

1254
01:01:54.399 --> 01:01:56.840
nation without borders is not a, is not a

1255
01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.080
country. Um, SO even for the legal side, I

1256
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.800
think there are reasons that a democratic elect electorate

1257
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.399
might want to Might want to slow immigration or

1258
01:02:07.399 --> 01:02:10.239
to impose certain kinds of restrictions to, you know,

1259
01:02:10.399 --> 01:02:14.239
up the requirements for, uh, you know, the citizenship

1260
01:02:14.239 --> 01:02:16.629
exam and so on. And I actually became an

1261
01:02:16.629 --> 01:02:18.320
American citizen in the course of writing this book,

1262
01:02:18.399 --> 01:02:20.439
so I have some I have some knowledge of

1263
01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:23.320
the immigration system and the, the civics exam that

1264
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.159
they make you take is, is embarrassingly easy and

1265
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.520
and pitiful and just, you know, it should be

1266
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.239
a lot more difficult um than it than it

1267
01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:35.520
actually is. And then the last, the last reason

1268
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.709
which is connected, you might think, well, why would

1269
01:02:37.709 --> 01:02:41.360
democratic electorates have these desires? Uh, THERE'S economic and

1270
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.479
cultural reasons why you might oppose, uh, even, even

1271
01:02:45.479 --> 01:02:48.479
legal immigration. So it might come at a cost

1272
01:02:48.479 --> 01:02:51.560
to the domestic labor force. So even if immigration

1273
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.120
is good in the aggregate, it doesn't follow that

1274
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.669
just because immigration is good for GDP that, uh,

1275
01:02:57.679 --> 01:03:00.280
you know, me working some, I don't know, manufacturing

1276
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.149
job in the middle of the country. Might not

1277
01:03:02.149 --> 01:03:03.590
be good for me. It might cost me a

1278
01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:05.070
job even if it's good for the country as

1279
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:07.750
a whole. So I think it's, it's not a

1280
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.300
good idea to ignore those people and the fact

1281
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.989
that those people have been ignored is what's driven

1282
01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:15.120
the populist movement, I think. Um, AND then the

1283
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.679
cultural reasons have to do with just, OK, we're

1284
01:03:17.679 --> 01:03:20.040
gonna let people in legally, OK, well, who should

1285
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.739
we let in? I mean, Should we let people

1286
01:03:22.739 --> 01:03:24.699
in who are kind of more like us, who

1287
01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:26.820
have beliefs that we have? Should we let people

1288
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.050
in who are, you know, Uh, coming from war-torn

1289
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.929
countries, um, these things make a difference because a

1290
01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:36.090
country is, is not just an idea, and it's

1291
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.250
not just a, a set of laws. The country

1292
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.570
is made up of the people. And so, if

1293
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.540
you import a bunch of new people into your

1294
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.370
society and they're different, uh, now your society is

1295
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:47.330
different and it's gonna change. Uh, SO I think

1296
01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.570
it's, it's reasonable to care the kinds of people

1297
01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:50.489
that you let into the country.

1298
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:55.949
What ideas do conservatives have about the family and

1299
01:03:55.949 --> 01:03:59.500
how important is the family as a kind of

1300
01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:02.629
social unit and institution?

1301
01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:06.050
Yeah, so conservatives, and this is in chapter 7

1302
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.530
on the family, um, for, for conservatives, the family

1303
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:13.770
is the most important social institution, and the government

1304
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:18.159
exists to uh serve the family, to protect and

1305
01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:20.129
and serve the family, not, not the other way

1306
01:04:20.129 --> 01:04:24.530
around, um. Um And now, why is, why is

1307
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.899
the family the most important social institution? So it's

1308
01:04:26.899 --> 01:04:31.449
the It's where we're formed morally, right? It's where

1309
01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:34.879
we develop our ideas, it's it's how society is

1310
01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:37.840
is passed on from one generation to the next.

1311
01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:43.629
Uh, PROVIDES a secure environment for children, um, and

1312
01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:47.020
it exists as its own kind of autonomous society

1313
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.429
and as a, as a potential, uh, check, let's

1314
01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:54.469
say to government, government power. Um, THE conservative view

1315
01:04:54.469 --> 01:04:57.669
is that all these all the institutions smaller than

1316
01:04:57.669 --> 01:04:59.830
the government exists as a kind of counterweight or

1317
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.909
a kind of uh uh equilibrium, equilibrium of of

1318
01:05:04.909 --> 01:05:07.810
authorities. And the family is, is the most important

1319
01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:10.570
one because it's what we're born into, it's what

1320
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:13.669
forms us. Um, AS I say in the chapter,

1321
01:05:13.729 --> 01:05:15.870
the, the family is a, is a place for

1322
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:19.790
formation, not a place for freedom. And there's this

1323
01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.189
idea that, uh, you know, the family is a

1324
01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:24.909
kind of restriction on our desires, and the family

1325
01:05:24.909 --> 01:05:27.110
should really just exist to serve the children, to

1326
01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:28.949
make them into who they're supposed to be or

1327
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:32.590
whatever, uh, whatever the idea is, and the conservative

1328
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.510
view is, no, the family is, is, is there

1329
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.350
to form you to be fit for the kind

1330
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.860
of society that you live in. Uh, SO there

1331
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.620
has to be a kind of, a kind of

1332
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:44.500
cooperation, uh, between the state and the family. And

1333
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.100
you can see this in education, right? Are the

1334
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.580
public schools there to, you know, form your kids

1335
01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.219
into the kind of citizen that the government wants,

1336
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.449
or are they there to, you know, partner with

1337
01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:58.520
the families in order to Uh, form, form children

1338
01:05:58.899 --> 01:06:02.570
in ways that, that, uh, That that are that

1339
01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:05.010
are not antagonistic, right? And, and you see this

1340
01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:07.929
conflict all over the place now with the kinds

1341
01:06:07.929 --> 01:06:09.649
of stuff that's getting taught in the public schools

1342
01:06:09.649 --> 01:06:12.330
and conservatives are, are sounding the alarm about all

1343
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.449
of that and, and rightly so, I think because

1344
01:06:14.449 --> 01:06:17.979
uh Uh, in many aspects, the, the purpose of

1345
01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:20.010
the public schools seems to be to separate the

1346
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.610
children from the families in a certain kind of

1347
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.500
way, and to turn the, turn the children against

1348
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.209
the families in a way that, uh, conservatives would

1349
01:06:26.209 --> 01:06:28.689
say is a kind of active and piety, um.

1350
01:06:29.949 --> 01:06:31.820
So that's the, the idea of the family. I

1351
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.429
talked about some other issues in that chapter. Um,

1352
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.489
SO the family is usually associated with social conservatism,

1353
01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:40.929
which has to do with, with views about sex

1354
01:06:40.929 --> 01:06:43.820
and marriage, and, and abortion and so on, so-called

1355
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.600
family values. Um, SO I give, I give, uh,

1356
01:06:47.969 --> 01:06:50.250
I give some arguments against abortion in that chapter.

1357
01:06:51.129 --> 01:06:53.300
Uh, BASED on the value of life, right? If

1358
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.219
we're gonna be conservative, if we're gonna seek to

1359
01:06:55.219 --> 01:06:58.620
conserve the good, well, life is among the most

1360
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.780
important goods, right? It's the source of all goods

1361
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.820
in some measure. And so the conservative case for

1362
01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.860
abortion is that we should preserve life, we should

1363
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.750
be Uh, we should be grateful for life, we

1364
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.870
should be open to life in a certain kind

1365
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.939
of way, um. We should be opposed to the

1366
01:07:13.939 --> 01:07:17.699
destruction of life. Um, AND of course, abortion is

1367
01:07:17.699 --> 01:07:19.459
something that gets in the way of the reproduction

1368
01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:22.669
of society over time because it interferes with the

1369
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.899
reproduction of children. Uh, OF course, birth rates are

1370
01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:28.419
at record lows, so conservatives have an interest, the

1371
01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.979
state has an interest in people having families and

1372
01:07:30.979 --> 01:07:34.530
having children, um, if only to, you know, uh,

1373
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.620
fund the social welfare programs and that that need

1374
01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.949
uh taxpayers and so on. Um, SO that's, that's

1375
01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:43.340
kind of the abortion, uh, angle of the chapter,

1376
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:46.030
and then, uh, I give some arguments for traditional

1377
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.129
marriage as well. And also uh conservative attitudes about

1378
01:07:50.139 --> 01:07:55.770
about sexual ethics, which I don't know, probably. Even

1379
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:58.219
among conservatives, not everybody is a social conservative in

1380
01:07:58.219 --> 01:07:59.899
this way, and, you know, even if you look

1381
01:07:59.899 --> 01:08:02.699
at the Trump movement and the populist movement, you

1382
01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:04.300
know, how much of that movement is really in

1383
01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.620
favor of traditional sexual morality. I mean, I don't

1384
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.459
know, it's hard to say, but I do think

1385
01:08:09.459 --> 01:08:11.540
it's core, I do think it's core to the

1386
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.280
view and and really lies at the center and

1387
01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.080
uh. You know, even if conservatives win elections, if

1388
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.620
the family is destroyed, there's not gonna be anything

1389
01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.750
left for the politicians to conserve, I think. Um,

1390
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.399
SO I'll just give you a little taste of

1391
01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:29.919
some of these arguments, um, uh, you know, the

1392
01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:32.479
argument for traditional marriage is that, you know, marriage

1393
01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.120
is a tradition, it's a custom that's, you know,

1394
01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:38.839
been the same for centuries, and it's Foolish to

1395
01:08:38.839 --> 01:08:41.569
think we could reform it. It serves a certain

1396
01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:44.970
kind of purpose. Um, MARRIAGE is not just a

1397
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:47.890
kind of voluntary arrangement that you might or might

1398
01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.410
not enter into. It's central to human life. It

1399
01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:53.529
has a certain kind of function, uh, to, to

1400
01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.640
raise children and to provide companionship for the adults.

1401
01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.209
Um, SO I give kind of a, I don't

1402
01:08:59.209 --> 01:09:02.240
know, an ethical, an ethical argument for traditional marriage

1403
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.450
that uh grows out of some of the conservative

1404
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:06.669
thinkers. Um, Hagel has a very good view of,

1405
01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:09.979
of the ethical aspect of marriage. Um, AND then

1406
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.180
the traditional conservative sexual ethic, of course, grows out

1407
01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.419
of the, the view of marriage. Um, WHAT is

1408
01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.399
sex for? What's the purpose of sex? Is it

1409
01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:21.779
just pleasure, is it just fun? Uh, NO, sex

1410
01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:25.500
is for, right, to make a marital union stronger,

1411
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.140
and it's also for the, for the production of

1412
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.060
children. And if that's true, then the moral norms

1413
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.819
that govern sex are gonna be a lot more

1414
01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:36.799
than just consent, uh, and The reason for that

1415
01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:39.560
is that uh sex can't serve its purpose if

1416
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.600
it's not governed by norms, and the norms have

1417
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.319
to kind of serve the purpose, uh, not just

1418
01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:50.310
serve the individuals. Um, And, you know, there's more

1419
01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.669
of a case to be made that the the

1420
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:55.189
conservative sexual ethic is actually better for the individuals

1421
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:57.189
as well, that it actually leads to more long

1422
01:09:57.189 --> 01:10:00.189
term happiness, um, and some of this is starting

1423
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:03.390
to kind of break through, um. I'm trying to

1424
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.709
recall her name. I think it's Louise Perry. Louise

1425
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:08.259
Perry wrote a book recently against the, against the

1426
01:10:08.259 --> 01:10:11.549
sexual revolution, uh, uh, kind of on feminist grounds

1427
01:10:11.549 --> 01:10:13.189
as I recall, I cite that book in the

1428
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:15.700
chapter. Uh, AND the basic idea is just, look,

1429
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:17.729
if you, if we're gonna be conservatives and we

1430
01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:19.470
want to promote happy lives, we want to promote

1431
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:22.750
lives of virtue, well, uh, a life of virtue

1432
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:26.330
that Leaves sexual ethics out of it and thinks

1433
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.529
that consent is the only thing that matters for

1434
01:10:28.529 --> 01:10:30.850
sex, it's not gonna be a happy life. Uh

1435
01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:32.569
MIGHT be happy in the short term, but it's

1436
01:10:32.569 --> 01:10:35.509
not gonna be happy in the long term. Um,

1437
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:37.970
SO that's kind of, kind of the case I

1438
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:38.450
give there.

1439
01:10:39.759 --> 01:10:45.450
And how do conservatives deal with issues surrounding responsibilities

1440
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.609
and rights?

1441
01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:50.000
Yeah, so this is the last, uh, the last

1442
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.479
chapter, chapter 10, um, kind of falls out of

1443
01:10:53.479 --> 01:10:55.479
the theme a little bit. So 6 is on

1444
01:10:55.479 --> 01:10:58.520
nationalism, which looks at kind of the global, not

1445
01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.000
the global, but the domestic political community. Populism kind

1446
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.520
of looks at more kind of local issues, economic

1447
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.680
issues, um, things like that. Uh, THE family is

1448
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.669
focused on the smallest unit, right, uh, of, of

1449
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:14.479
society. Um, THERE'S a chapter on education, which I

1450
01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.080
guess we're gonna skip over that, uh, which is

1451
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.640
on the, the role of schools in the community,

1452
01:11:18.759 --> 01:11:21.279
so again, at the local level. Um, AND the

1453
01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:23.919
last chapter is on responsibility. And so there I'm

1454
01:11:23.919 --> 01:11:26.040
looking at, uh, I'm really trying to answer what's

1455
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.080
the role of government. And so you might have

1456
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.689
thought, maybe you should have started with that. And

1457
01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:34.209
but for me, those other, those other ways of

1458
01:11:34.209 --> 01:11:36.089
looking at society from the different levels, from the

1459
01:11:36.089 --> 01:11:38.609
family, the local community, the national community, that's the

1460
01:11:38.609 --> 01:11:40.089
right way of thinking about it, I think, from

1461
01:11:40.089 --> 01:11:42.290
a conservative point of view. Um, SO in, in

1462
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:44.399
chapter 10, I talk about the purpose of government,

1463
01:11:44.529 --> 01:11:48.009
and I want to emphasize the purpose of responsibilities

1464
01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:51.600
over the purpose of rights. Uh, SO usually in

1465
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.490
a lot of liberal political theory, what's the purpose

1466
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:57.660
of the government? Well, it's to establish justice. It's

1467
01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.060
to protect people's rights, right? It serves this kind

1468
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:04.080
of procedural role. And then within that framework, the

1469
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.120
debate between the libertarians, let's say, and the liberals

1470
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.279
is really, well, how big should the government be

1471
01:12:09.279 --> 01:12:11.959
and how many things should it do? Should it

1472
01:12:12.279 --> 01:12:15.430
just protect people's property rights like the libertarians think,

1473
01:12:15.759 --> 01:12:17.839
or should it also ensure that people have some

1474
01:12:17.839 --> 01:12:20.850
kind of minimal level of well-being? And so that's

1475
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:23.500
the debate that you saw really in the 20th

1476
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.529
century uh between so-called big versus small government, surely

1477
01:12:27.529 --> 01:12:29.770
the debate between Rawls and Nozick, as I see

1478
01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:32.970
it, um. And I want to just kind of

1479
01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:35.490
sidestep that debate and say that the purpose of

1480
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:38.129
the government is not really how big or small

1481
01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:39.609
it should be. It should be as big as

1482
01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:41.089
it needs to be or as small as it

1483
01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:42.569
needs to be, and that really depends on the

1484
01:12:42.569 --> 01:12:45.919
circumstances. So in the American context, you know, we

1485
01:12:45.919 --> 01:12:48.680
have this massive country and the government's big because

1486
01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.879
it's a big country and it's grown to be

1487
01:12:50.879 --> 01:12:52.919
big, and it's, it's grown in ways that are

1488
01:12:52.919 --> 01:12:55.479
not good, let's say, but, OK, it has to

1489
01:12:55.479 --> 01:12:57.520
be sort of proportionate to the size of the

1490
01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.120
country. Um, BUT the thing that matters is what's

1491
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.399
the government doing? What's the purpose of the government?

1492
01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:06.040
Is the, is the government genuinely serving the common

1493
01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.060
good of the people? Um, It's conceivable that a

1494
01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:14.660
government could protect everybody's rights, but everybody was miserable

1495
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:19.359
and vicious, um. Um, THERE'S a line, uh, I'm,

1496
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.649
I'm taking a line out of uh Rosalind Hirsthouse,

1497
01:13:21.729 --> 01:13:23.709
who's a very good virtue ethicist, and she says,

1498
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.169
uh, can you imagine a liberal society in which

1499
01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:28.540
everybody's rights are respected, but everybody is wicked and

1500
01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:32.169
vicious? Seems like that's perfectly possible. Uh, WELL, if

1501
01:13:32.169 --> 01:13:35.009
that's possible, that's a society that respects people's rights,

1502
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.930
and it's, it's just in a certain sense, but

1503
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:40.689
it, it's certainly not good. And so on my

1504
01:13:40.689 --> 01:13:42.810
view, the conservative view of the government is a

1505
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:47.009
kind of reciprocal relationship which exists between the government

1506
01:13:47.009 --> 01:13:49.759
and the citizens, and the government is looking out

1507
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.490
for the well-being of the citizens, and the citizens

1508
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:54.970
are performing their obligations that they have to the

1509
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:59.950
government, they're following the law. Um, AND so, the,

1510
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.169
the citizens receive rights, but they also have responsibilities

1511
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:05.310
in order to sustain the government, and, and not

1512
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.709
just the government, but also, um, what I call

1513
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:12.689
following uh Robert Nisbet, the, the intermediate institutions, the

1514
01:14:12.689 --> 01:14:15.430
institutions that lie between the individual and the government,

1515
01:14:15.549 --> 01:14:18.140
so the, the church and the school and the,

1516
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:23.299
the family, uh, what sometimes called civil society. And

1517
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.859
The conservative view is that the health of the

1518
01:14:25.859 --> 01:14:29.180
intermediate institutions is what prevents the government from becoming

1519
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.080
too big or from uh becoming tyrannical over the

1520
01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.859
individual. Um, AND that really grows out of uh

1521
01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:38.020
a critique of liberalism that you find in uh

1522
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.649
Toville. Uh, THAT Robert Nisbet, who wrote, um, this

1523
01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:45.470
great book, The Quest for Community in 1953, um,

1524
01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:49.209
uh, drew on Tocqueville to show that Uh, actually,

1525
01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.299
liberal liberalism, when it, when it releases you from

1526
01:14:52.299 --> 01:14:54.899
the government, it actually makes the government stronger because

1527
01:14:54.899 --> 01:14:57.100
it actually weakens your ties to all of the

1528
01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.609
intermediate institutions and actually kind of destroys civil society.

1529
01:15:00.899 --> 01:15:03.620
And so you're freer, but you become, you become

1530
01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.740
perversely more dependent on the state. And so, uh,

1531
01:15:06.779 --> 01:15:08.580
Nisbet says, you know, what the state gives to

1532
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.640
the individual, it just sort of takes to grow,

1533
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.479
to grow itself. And that's the way in which

1534
01:15:13.479 --> 01:15:17.870
the, the, the social liberalism and economic liberalism, uh,

1535
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:19.879
uh, sort of work together in order to grow

1536
01:15:19.879 --> 01:15:22.680
the state, and both come at the cost of

1537
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.850
the individual. Um, ON the conservative point of view.

1538
01:15:26.009 --> 01:15:27.569
And so the way to avoid that from a

1539
01:15:27.569 --> 01:15:30.410
conservative point of view is to emphasize responsibilities, to

1540
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:33.209
not just focus on the state versus the individual,

1541
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.759
but to look at the intermediate institutions and to

1542
01:15:35.759 --> 01:15:39.250
see the, the purpose of the citizen, in conjunction

1543
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:41.890
to the purpose of government as performing various roles

1544
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.049
that you have, uh, in virtue of being a

1545
01:15:44.049 --> 01:15:47.009
member of, of, of these various institutions.

1546
01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.180
So I want to ask you just about one

1547
01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.660
more social institution, and then I have one final

1548
01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:58.939
question before we wrap up our conversation. Uh, WHAT

1549
01:15:58.939 --> 01:16:03.649
about religion? How does conservatism relate to religion and

1550
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:05.910
the society need religion?

1551
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:10.609
Yeah, um, So there are different views you could

1552
01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:14.430
take on this, um. Some conservatives like Michael Oakeshott,

1553
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.859
for example, uh, seem to not think religion is

1554
01:16:17.859 --> 01:16:23.680
central to conservatism. Um, That it's valuable, let's say,

1555
01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.720
but, but not necessary. Um, I think it's necessary

1556
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.799
in a certain kind of way, and there's kind

1557
01:16:28.799 --> 01:16:31.479
of two arguments you can give that look like

1558
01:16:31.479 --> 01:16:33.720
maybe their intention, but I think kind of come

1559
01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.319
together. Um, SO there's what you, what you might

1560
01:16:36.319 --> 01:16:40.160
call the, the skeptical or the empirical argument for

1561
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.009
religion on conservative grounds, which you see in David

1562
01:16:44.009 --> 01:16:45.850
Hume, I think, even though he was kind of

1563
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:49.319
irreligious himself, um, you definitely see it in Burke.

1564
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.709
And this is the idea that uh society needs

1565
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:56.140
religion to serve as a kind of school for

1566
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:59.390
uh forming people, for giving them a sense of

1567
01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:04.069
responsibility, of a sense that they're accountable, or they're

1568
01:17:04.069 --> 01:17:06.430
subject to some form of judgment, that is not

1569
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:07.919
just the judgment of their peers, and it is

1570
01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:09.669
not just the judgment of the government, but it's

1571
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:12.189
some kind of higher judgment. Um, SO it's a

1572
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:16.220
kind of consequentialist or utilitarian justification for religion. Of

1573
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.629
course, it doesn't say it has to be this

1574
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:20.799
religion or that religion. Although maybe there has to

1575
01:17:20.799 --> 01:17:23.419
be a majority religion. So it sees religion as

1576
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:27.020
as serving a very important social function in coordinating

1577
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.069
people and um allowing them to be united in

1578
01:17:30.069 --> 01:17:32.660
the same society, even if they have all these

1579
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.509
other, other differences and so on. And it sees

1580
01:17:35.509 --> 01:17:39.109
uh religious pluralism as, you know, potentially a problem

1581
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:42.029
for the unity of the country. Um, SO that's

1582
01:17:42.029 --> 01:17:45.580
the skeptical side. Um, I say skeptical because, um,

1583
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.950
it's not skeptical of religion, but it's skeptical of

1584
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.459
this idea that human beings can govern themselves without

1585
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:54.529
any kind of metaphysical or or uh spiritual dimension,

1586
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:58.740
right? If people can't govern themselves by the material

1587
01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.189
world alone, right? We need some kind of, we

1588
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:04.069
need some sense of the spiritual. Um, THE other

1589
01:18:04.069 --> 01:18:06.830
argument is what you might call the metaphysical argument

1590
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:11.009
for religion. Which says, no, society needs religion because

1591
01:18:11.009 --> 01:18:13.759
we have to be oriented toward the highest good

1592
01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:15.439
and the highest things, and we have to be

1593
01:18:15.439 --> 01:18:19.049
oriented toward the truth, right? And what conservatives are

1594
01:18:19.049 --> 01:18:22.089
trying to conserve is, is the, the three transcendentals,

1595
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:24.689
the, the true, the good, and the beautiful. And

1596
01:18:25.089 --> 01:18:28.080
if you exclude religion, you're gonna miss at least

1597
01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.729
one of those, and probably all of them. In

1598
01:18:30.729 --> 01:18:33.290
a certain kind of way. Um, AND so you

1599
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:35.930
see this in, uh, Joseph De Maestra, who I

1600
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:39.009
discussed in, uh, in chapter 4, who was a

1601
01:18:39.009 --> 01:18:41.330
very strong Catholic and a critic of the French

1602
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:44.290
Revolution, and he thought that in order to, he

1603
01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:46.770
says, um, I'll paraphrase, but he says, in order

1604
01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:51.049
to conserve all, you must consecrate all. That in

1605
01:18:51.049 --> 01:18:53.180
order to conserve things, they have to be sacred,

1606
01:18:53.569 --> 01:18:55.779
right? Uh, LIKE, even if you don't think they're

1607
01:18:55.779 --> 01:18:57.979
sacred, just make them sacred, right? And if you

1608
01:18:57.979 --> 01:19:00.160
make them sacred, they'll be secure, they'll be less,

1609
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:04.009
they'll be less liable to vandalism, uh, of one

1610
01:19:04.009 --> 01:19:07.009
kind or another. Uh, SO the metaphysical conservatives says,

1611
01:19:07.049 --> 01:19:08.810
no, we should, we should protect these things because

1612
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.689
they're good, because they're sacred, because they're valuable and

1613
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:16.250
they're important. Um. Now, OK, can we predict those

1614
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.759
things if we don't actually believe in them? Well,

1615
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.049
probably not. Probably you actually have to believe in

1616
01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:22.729
order to protect them, right? You can't just say,

1617
01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:24.810
well, yeah, people should be religious and we should

1618
01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:27.370
have religions and we should have churches, but, well,

1619
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:29.649
I don't have to participate in it, right? I

1620
01:19:29.649 --> 01:19:32.790
think a lot of conservatives are I think tempted

1621
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:34.120
to that view, but I think, no, if you

1622
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.629
think religion is important, you actually have to do

1623
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:38.109
it yourself. You can't just be a spokesperson for

1624
01:19:38.109 --> 01:19:39.870
it. And I think you see that now in

1625
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:42.839
some of the some of the intellectual movements toward

1626
01:19:42.839 --> 01:19:45.830
Christianity, for example, some intellectuals are starting to kind

1627
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:49.129
of come around, you have people like um Hersey

1628
01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:52.479
Ali and and and Niall Ferguson, her husband. And

1629
01:19:52.479 --> 01:19:54.359
of course, the Jordan Peterson phenomenon, all these people

1630
01:19:54.359 --> 01:19:57.129
who are kind of making, making moves toward religion

1631
01:19:57.129 --> 01:20:00.160
at first from a kind of, you know, civilizational

1632
01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.759
point of view, but I think at some point

1633
01:20:01.759 --> 01:20:03.290
you have to say, well, is this true or

1634
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:05.359
is this not true? And if it's not true,

1635
01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:07.200
then probably it's bad for society, right? But if

1636
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.049
it is true, then it's good for society. So.

1637
01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.600
Uh, SO, finally, how do you look at the

1638
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.319
future of conservatism?

1639
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:17.979
Yeah, so the last chapter is is titled The

1640
01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:23.220
Future of Conservatism. And um This is not really

1641
01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.660
original to me, I guess, but I like to

1642
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:28.180
see conservatism as a kind of a journey, um,

1643
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.660
a journey through time, and, and so that's why

1644
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.220
the, the book is organized as it is past,

1645
01:20:33.299 --> 01:20:35.930
present, and then a final comment at the end

1646
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:38.700
on the future of conservatism. Um, SO there's this

1647
01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.660
kind of critique that you see, um, that conservatism

1648
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.740
is really about a kind of quaint nostalgia or

1649
01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.140
something, right? It's about, you know, reminiscing about the

1650
01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.330
good old days and You know, you can watch

1651
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:52.770
videos of look how people dressed in the 1950s.

1652
01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:54.339
Look how beautiful they looked, you know, it's like,

1653
01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:56.009
why can't we just go back to that, to

1654
01:20:56.009 --> 01:21:00.209
this kind of quaint nostalgic idea, um. There's a

1655
01:21:00.209 --> 01:21:02.890
great interview that uh Roger Scruton did with Peter

1656
01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:05.970
Robinson of the, of the Hoover Institution. And at

1657
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.410
the end of the interview, Robinson gives him this

1658
01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:11.200
objection. He says, this all sounds great, Roger, Sir

1659
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.919
Roger, but, you know, this just sounds like Tolkien.

1660
01:21:14.089 --> 01:21:15.569
This is just like, you know, longing for the

1661
01:21:15.569 --> 01:21:19.299
Shire, and, you know, what's what of what relevance

1662
01:21:19.299 --> 01:21:21.290
is that now, and how we, how can we

1663
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:23.899
conserve when everything's been destroyed and, and what is,

1664
01:21:24.209 --> 01:21:26.279
what does the future look like given that and

1665
01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:28.209
and scruton gives this very moving answer where he

1666
01:21:28.209 --> 01:21:31.430
says, look, you know, We're always on guard against

1667
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:35.109
destruction. Things are always falling apart, but there's this

1668
01:21:35.109 --> 01:21:37.750
kind of call to build, and there's this call

1669
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:40.470
to conserve, and there's this call to, you know,

1670
01:21:40.509 --> 01:21:42.589
even if everything is gonna fall apart, like it

1671
01:21:42.589 --> 01:21:44.669
doesn't have to fall apart today, right? It doesn't

1672
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:46.189
have to fall about, it doesn't have to fall

1673
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:49.740
about fall apart tomorrow. And the purpose of conservatism

1674
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.620
in the future is just to say, well, this

1675
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.419
is how we're living. This is like, this is

1676
01:21:53.419 --> 01:21:56.540
how we'd like to continue living. And in order

1677
01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.250
to continue living like this, we have to build.

1678
01:21:58.339 --> 01:22:00.810
We can't just sort of wish that things were

1679
01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.419
like they were in the past, and we can't

1680
01:22:02.419 --> 01:22:05.049
just assume that things are gonna follow along. So,

1681
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.899
part of the, part of conservatism is conserving, part

1682
01:22:07.899 --> 01:22:09.459
of it is promoting the good. But then there's

1683
01:22:09.459 --> 01:22:11.529
also this aspect of building that in order to

1684
01:22:11.529 --> 01:22:14.180
promote, you can't just, you can't just talk, right?

1685
01:22:14.259 --> 01:22:17.359
You can't just write books on You know, conservative

1686
01:22:17.359 --> 01:22:19.439
political philosophy and think, OK, I'm gonna write this

1687
01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:21.160
book and everyone's gonna see the light and everything's

1688
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.560
gonna come forward. It's like, no, you gotta get

1689
01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.069
involved in your community, you gotta have a family,

1690
01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:27.959
you know, you should probably join a church, you

1691
01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.080
should probably get involved in politics at the local

1692
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.669
level, um. And that's gonna give you a life.

1693
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:35.270
It's gonna give you a life that's worth living.

1694
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:38.109
It's gonna be something to do, um, it's gonna

1695
01:22:38.109 --> 01:22:40.149
develop your virtue and, and so on, and you're

1696
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:43.259
gonna be a better citizen and so on, um,

1697
01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:44.589
and it's gonna be a journey and it's gonna

1698
01:22:44.589 --> 01:22:47.799
actually lead somewhere. Uh, IT'S gonna cause you to

1699
01:22:47.799 --> 01:22:50.120
build things. And the idea of the journey, and

1700
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.879
this is kind of the conservative aspect, right? You're

1701
01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:55.160
not You're not journeying into some promised land, right?

1702
01:22:55.319 --> 01:22:57.879
You're not journeying to utopia. That would be one

1703
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.680
kind of more liberal way of looking at it.

1704
01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.810
We're gonna, you know, we're gonna be the change

1705
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.439
we see in the world, and we're gonna change

1706
01:23:03.439 --> 01:23:04.799
the world for the better, right? And this is

1707
01:23:04.799 --> 01:23:08.000
what every university website says, we're gonna build students

1708
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.319
who make a difference in the world. And the

1709
01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.750
conservative attitudes and no, the journey is really about,

1710
01:23:12.879 --> 01:23:16.390
it's about building a home. It's about journeying back,

1711
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.319
right? It's about journeying home to where you should

1712
01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:21.419
be, right? To where you're meant to be. And

1713
01:23:21.419 --> 01:23:23.459
it's, it's only in the journey in that you

1714
01:23:23.459 --> 01:23:26.339
are able to find the home, right? So, you

1715
01:23:26.339 --> 01:23:28.850
journey into the past, right? You understand your tradition,

1716
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.060
you understand the society that you live in, and

1717
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.700
then what first seemed alien now seems like it's

1718
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.419
yours, right? So you make the thing yours, and

1719
01:23:37.419 --> 01:23:41.350
then you live it in the world, and I,

1720
01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:43.470
uh, I wanted to finish the book with, uh,

1721
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:49.189
the, uh, This uh This, uh, TS Eliot poem

1722
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:52.470
from the 44 quartets, where he makes this, he

1723
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:54.390
makes this point in this kind of poetic sense.

1724
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:56.229
My publisher said, oh, you can't use that because

1725
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:58.629
we have to pay the copyright, but, uh, but

1726
01:23:58.629 --> 01:24:00.430
he has this idea of the journey home, uh,

1727
01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:02.870
and the journey home, the journey leads back to

1728
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:06.350
home, and in, in undertaking the journey, he says,

1729
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:08.189
you come to know the, you come to know

1730
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:10.319
the place as if for the very first time.

1731
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:12.629
Uh, AND so that's what I see the, the

1732
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:15.149
role of conservatism is to make us feel at

1733
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:17.399
home in the world to. You know, protect against

1734
01:24:17.399 --> 01:24:19.919
the alienation, to, to build a good life for

1735
01:24:19.919 --> 01:24:22.319
ourselves, and to, to hopefully to conserve the good

1736
01:24:22.319 --> 01:24:24.669
that we have left, and maybe to build it

1737
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:25.959
and promote it into the future.

1738
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.939
Great. So, the book is again conservatism, past and

1739
01:24:30.939 --> 01:24:35.240
present, uh Philosophical introduction. Of course, I'm leaving a
