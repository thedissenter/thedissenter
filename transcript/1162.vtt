00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.849
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.840
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.569
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor, Doctor

4
00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.170
Michael Hummer. And today we're talking about his book,

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.170
Progressive Myths. So, Doctor Hummer, there it is, the

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.610
cover, really nice. So Doctor Hummer, welcome back to

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.370
the show. It's always a pleasure to talk with

8
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.750
you.

9
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.809
Thank you. Uh, THANKS for having me. It's great

10
00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:24.309
to be here.

11
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.909
So progressive myths, uh, I mean, why did you

12
00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.510
decide to write such a book and why did

13
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.270
you decide to focus specifically on progressive myths and

14
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.450
not, for example, include also myths from the other

15
00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:46.090
end of the political spectrum. The conservatives are, uh,

16
00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.049
a book just on conservative myths.

17
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.709
Yeah, well, um. So that's 2 questions. Uh, YEAH,

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.520
you know, why, why did I write about, um,

19
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.580
why did I write about this at all? Because,

20
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.819
uh, I got tired of hearing lies and deceptions

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.860
and, you know, misleading statements. And, um, it just

22
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.519
seemed to me like in political discourse, you know,

23
00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.400
there's like, there's all this argumentation going on, but

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.319
it's all like, um, almost everyone is just like

25
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.480
completely ignorant of the actual facts about the things

26
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.150
that they're talking about. And like the main, the

27
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.580
main problem is people just not knowing the facts.

28
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.790
And then there are all of these, like, you

29
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.949
know, bogus factoids that are just going around. Uh,

30
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.949
AND, you know, we can't, we can't solve any

31
00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.230
social problems if we don't know what's actually going

32
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.510
on. We're not gonna solve social problems if we

33
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.470
have just like completely incorrect conceptions of what's going

34
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.519
on. Right. And so, um, you know, like, uh,

35
00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.129
we're not, we're not gonna solve the problem of,

36
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.000
um, violence in the inner cities if we think

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.199
the problem is racist cops, when, in fact, that's

38
00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:53.319
not the problem. You know, like, the reason why,

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.120
um, you're seeing, um, Black people being killed by

40
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.959
the police on television is not because the cops

41
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.620
are a bunch of racists. It's because actually, uh,

42
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.290
1, those people are attacking the police. They're like

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.929
physically trying to kill the police officer. And 2,

44
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.839
the media is only selecting out a, uh, small

45
00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.089
fraction. So they're only selecting out white cop on

46
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.639
black cop violence to show you. That's why you're

47
00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.449
seeing that. So, you have to understand that that's

48
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.169
what's actually going on if you're going to address

49
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.460
the problem. Well, OK, if the problem is like,

50
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.589
uh, these people are attacking the cops, then you

51
00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.350
need to address that. You need to stop people

52
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.710
from attacking the cops, you know, not, OK, anyway,

53
00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.589
and then, and why did I not write a

54
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.759
book about conservative myths, you know. Um, I'm just

55
00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.309
seeing a lot more left-wing myths and ones that,

56
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.360
um, appear to educated people to be reports of

57
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.610
actual facts. Right. So like, you know, you hear,

58
00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.360
oh, the 2020 election was stolen, you hear that

59
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.520
from, uh, I guess, populist right wing voices. But

60
00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.020
that's not a thing that like, people in my

61
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.699
circles would think was an actual fact. Right, like

62
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.690
they're not things that would mislead a typical um

63
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.800
educated person.

64
00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.460
And by your circles, do you mean academics or

65
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.330
yeah, you know, academics and other intellectuals that I

66
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.770
interact with, you know, it's like, and so there's

67
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.809
not that much for me to do as a

68
00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.610
scholar. It's like, oh, well, they're just lying, as,

69
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.169
as you know, you know, like everybody, OK, all

70
00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.770
those people are just lying about the election, as

71
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.289
you know, so there's not that much for me

72
00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.729
to say.

73
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.050
Oh, OK. So then just to clarify this point,

74
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.539
by progressive, you mean left wing. Is that it,

75
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.559
or is it a particular, um, a particular, uh,

76
00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.789
uh, um, um, a, a particular group from the

77
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:55.509
left wing?

78
00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.830
Um, YEAH, I guess it's Um, It's a subset

79
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.789
of the left, yeah.

80
00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:03.589
OK.

81
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.770
The left, the left used in America used to

82
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.889
be called liberals. And they used to believe in

83
00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.529
free speech and freedom of religion and whatever, freedom

84
00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.009
of conscience and stuff like that. And that used

85
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.729
to be actually pretty important to them. Um, BUT

86
00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.769
now there's this sort of like, there's this extremely

87
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.928
illiberal segment of the left. So I don't want

88
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.970
to call them liberals anymore, right? And so I'm

89
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.420
calling them progressives. And so I intend that to

90
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.500
include the wokesters. So the woke left is the

91
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.579
people who are obsessed with race and gender and

92
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:38.260
sex and whatever these identity, identity politics. But I

93
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.299
intended to also include the, you know, people who

94
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:43.600
are thinking like, oh, like capitalism is unjust. And,

95
00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:45.459
you know, the rich are all, all exploiting the

96
00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:47.559
poor, as well as the people who are like,

97
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.339
uh, freaked out about global warming and stuff like

98
00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.540
that.

99
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.929
Right. And uh just to clarify one more point

100
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.769
before we get into the actual myths you tackle

101
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:00.850
in your book, what counts as a myth? I

102
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.489
mean, how do you determine that something is a

103
00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.929
myth?

104
00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:07.350
Yeah, I mean, so first I only wanted to

105
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.709
include Um, what you might call objective factual claims,

106
00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:14.690
not matters of opinion, and Things that are relatively

107
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.980
straightforward, OK? So like, um, And socialism is better

108
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.890
than capitalism. I wouldn't include that because it just,

109
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.750
it's, it's just too big and complicated of an

110
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.049
issue, right? It's not like a straightforward factual matter.

111
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.829
Um, BUT so they've got to be straightforward, like

112
00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:35.700
empirical factual claims. So, um, like, um, women get

113
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.450
paid less than men do for the same work.

114
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.510
Like that's a fairly straightforward empirical factual claim. Um,

115
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.260
SO, OK, so it's got to be that. And

116
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.989
also, um, well, the, the myths that I'm interested

117
00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:48.410
in, the progressive myths are ones that appear to

118
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.190
strongly support some element of progressive ideology. Uh, AND,

119
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:55.029
you know, lastly, they have to be, as a

120
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.920
matter of fact, um, empirically, objectively false. Right, or

121
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.600
highly misleading, right? By highly misleading, I mean, there's

122
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.440
some additional context that if you knew it would

123
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.489
just radically alter the conclusion that you draw. Right,

124
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.850
like, you know, this, this thing is supposed to

125
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.250
support the left wing point, but if you add

126
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.350
additional context, it actually supports the right wing point.

127
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:21.869
Right. So you start the book by talking about,

128
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.429
in terms of the myths, by talking about individual

129
00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:28.160
cases, cases that were very prominent in the media,

130
00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:33.269
that were legal and criminal cases, and you talk

131
00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:35.910
about, for example, I, I, I don't want to

132
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.029
go through every single one of them, but you

133
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.670
talk about Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Amy Cooper, Jacob

134
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.260
Blake, and Kyle. Rittenhouse and then you also covered

135
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.589
the three non-myths involving Eric Garner, Brianna Taylor, and

136
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.220
George Floyd. So what do you make of the

137
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.589
impact of the way cases like these are portrayed

138
00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:01.709
in the media and how much they influence people?

139
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:03.970
And do you think that there is a general

140
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.119
bias in the media in the way they portray

141
00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:08.010
these cases?

142
00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.750
Yeah, well, there's an obvious bias, right, which is

143
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.600
um. Uh, THERE'S a bias towards reporting black people

144
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.420
getting killed, and especially getting killed by white people.

145
00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.799
Um, NOW, as I say that, I recall the

146
00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:25.350
Kyle Rittenhouse case, which, which was widely covered. Um,

147
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.940
AND a lot of people got the impression that

148
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.940
Kyle Rittenhouse killed black people, but he didn't. Like,

149
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.250
um, I think he shot 3 people who were

150
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.179
all white. OK. But it was nevertheless reported as,

151
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.070
oh, he's a racist, and then people came up

152
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.029
with the impression that he shot some black people.

153
00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:45.309
OK. So anyway, like, that's the bias of the

154
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:47.950
media, to try to portray it as white people

155
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.029
are oppressing black people. Um, THERE are many cases

156
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.970
of unarmed white people being killed by the police

157
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.470
that you never hear about, right? So in the

158
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.869
book, I, like I listed, you know, names of

159
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:01.750
multiple, just several unarmed white people who were killed

160
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.750
by the police, and you've never heard of any

161
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.980
of them. Because they would not be covered by

162
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.799
the media, right? So, um, Yeah, I, you know,

163
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.549
that's right. And then, you know, and then sometimes

164
00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:16.679
like, um, journalists are often kind of lazy and

165
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.720
irresponsible. So, you know, sometimes their coverage will be,

166
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.839
they'll just report what somebody told them, but they

167
00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.350
don't know whether it's true, right? So like the,

168
00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.000
the Michael Brown case, you know, they would be

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.200
reporting that, uh, well, somebody told them that Michael

170
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.119
Brown had surrendered. He held up his hand and

171
00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:39.789
said, you know, don't shoot or whatever. Um, AND

172
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.429
then, you know, this racist cop just gunned him

173
00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.950
down, and that did, that did not happen, that

174
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.549
objectively did not happen. OK. But, you know, like,

175
00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:50.109
sometimes they'll just say like, you know, yeah, this

176
00:08:50.109 --> 00:08:53.710
is what people told us. But, you know, you

177
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.520
can't just say what somebody told you. You have

178
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.700
to like try to find out if it's true.

179
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.669
Mm. Uh, I mean, but what do you make

180
00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:04.909
of, for example, just to pick one of the

181
00:09:04.909 --> 00:09:07.469
non-myth cases that you talk about in the book,

182
00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:10.190
the case of George Floyd, do you think that

183
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.890
in that particular case, uh, the media covered it?

184
00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:18.875
Accurately and for example, I know that in the

185
00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:26.604
alternative online media, um, that I mean that are

186
00:09:26.604 --> 00:09:29.594
is created by right-wing figures in the US, it

187
00:09:29.594 --> 00:09:34.114
was portrayed inaccurately. So uh what do you make

188
00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:34.585
of that?

189
00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:37.780
Um, I mean, not all of the facts. Um,

190
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.039
WERE widely reported, right? So I, I think it

191
00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:42.479
was not widely reported that George Floyd was on,

192
00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:46.239
was he on meth or or fentanyl? He's on

193
00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:49.020
fentanyl. OK. So I think that was not widely

194
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.000
reported and that, that, um, uh, almost certainly contributed

195
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.559
to his death. OK, so there, there's like this

196
00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:01.809
sort of right-wing revisionary. View now that actually, um,

197
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.539
Derek Chauvin didn't kill George Floyd. He, he died

198
00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:09.359
of an overdose, overdose of fentanyl. OK. Um, AND,

199
00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:13.270
uh, I think that's bullshit. OK, because I think

200
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.710
it is too much to believe that, yeah, he

201
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.229
was just on the verge of death, and he

202
00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:20.070
was just going to die, and it just, it

203
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.830
just happened to be at the same time that

204
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.150
Derek Chauvin was kneeling on his neck with his

205
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.280
knee. Just, you know, coincidentally, like, no, OK. Now,

206
00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:32.320
uh, I, I do believe it's plausible that he

207
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.750
was in a more vulnerable state than normal, so

208
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.530
that would not normally have killed a person. But

209
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.770
it did kill him because he was in a

210
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.510
vulnerable state because he was high on this drug.

211
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.609
Yes I think that's true, but uh, that it's

212
00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:48.049
still a homicide. OK, now, uh, and I don't

213
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:50.330
think that Chauvin was trying to kill George Floyd.

214
00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:53.090
OK. And you know, you might think, well, how

215
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.650
does he get charged with murder because, you know,

216
00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:58.609
you need intent in order to have murder. But

217
00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:00.960
um the answer is there's this felony murder rule,

218
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.289
which is if you commit a felony, and the

219
00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:05.960
felony itself is intentional, and then if somebody dies

220
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.380
as a result, even though you didn't intend to

221
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.130
death, then you can be charged with murder. So

222
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.849
that was the rule that they applied. And that

223
00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:14.450
is, that rule is questionable, but they have been

224
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.250
applying that to everyone else. They've been applying that

225
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.729
to people who are not cops. So if that's

226
00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:21.969
what we do, You should apply the same rule

227
00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:25.549
to the cop. And so, so, it was a

228
00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:26.250
just verdict.

229
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.539
But, but I mean, let me just ask you

230
00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:33.340
again, uh, a question about the bias in the

231
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.460
media because one very particular, uh, particularly interesting thing

232
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.460
that I find in the US media because we

233
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.780
don't really have that kind of phenomenon here in

234
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:50.179
Portugal is that you have certain Um, mainstream media

235
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.760
channels like Fox News who tailor specifically to conservatives

236
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.739
and people on the right, and then you have

237
00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:01.239
others like, for example, CNN who tailor more to

238
00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:03.789
people on the left and progressives. I mean, the,

239
00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:07.599
but, but because you have both, do you think

240
00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:11.549
that the media in the US is biased more

241
00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:16.200
toward, uh, progressive views or, or not?

242
00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:19.359
Well, I, I mean, I think there are more

243
00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:23.020
left wing sources, and they're sort of more establishment,

244
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.679
you might say. Uh, THEY'RE like, they're right wing

245
00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:29.559
sources that are not really media companies, right? Like

246
00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:32.630
maybe they're podcasters or something like that. And so

247
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.940
it's not. Yeah, it's not really clear who has

248
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.510
the upper hand, right? And there's like talk radio

249
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.609
is more conservative, but television is more left wing,

250
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.960
um. Yeah, it's sort of like, you know, the

251
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.130
internet democratized things, OK. But, you know, this, um,

252
00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:52.840
Uh, this balance isn't really good, because it's just

253
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.880
like, oh, well, you have like people bullshitting on

254
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.520
both sides, and that does not mean that the

255
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.760
truth is going to come out. Right. Like, OK,

256
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.039
they're both just telling different lies. And by the

257
00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:05.919
way, they're covering different stories. They're telling different lies

258
00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:10.640
about different stories. So like, you know, uh. You

259
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.059
know, everybody's deceived,

260
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.280
right, but I mean, what are the lessons that

261
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.119
you think people should take from the cases you

262
00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:22.159
explore in your book when it comes to the

263
00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:27.000
way the police behaves? Are the police devils or

264
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.799
angels? I mean, do you think that we can

265
00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:31.919
make any case like that when it comes to

266
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:32.229
the,

267
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.799
well, you know, most of them are just average,

268
00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:36.799
you know, most of them are neither devils nor

269
00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:40.549
angels, um. And I, I mean, I think the

270
00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:43.200
lesson is you have to look at the facts

271
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.919
of an individual case. Justice is individual, justice is

272
00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:49.719
not collective, right? This is why I don't like

273
00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:51.280
the phrase social justice, and the people who are

274
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.799
going around talking about social justice are usually people

275
00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:56.840
who don't, in fact, Um, they don't value justice,

276
00:13:56.849 --> 00:13:59.770
and they don't know what justice is. Because justice

277
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.919
is not for groups, justice is for individuals. So

278
00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.130
like a guy gets accused of something, you have

279
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.469
to look at that individual and what he specifically

280
00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:08.250
did and what the specific details are of that

281
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.080
case. You cannot look at the group that he

282
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.710
belongs to. Right? And like, I, I feel like

283
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.349
that's what happened. Like you have these uh conservative

284
00:14:15.349 --> 00:14:17.609
commentators who are just in favor of the cops

285
00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:20.030
because they're cops. So like, they're going to defend

286
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.520
Derek Chauvin because he's a cop, and then they're

287
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.830
just going to like try to find some way

288
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.390
that he's not guilty. And then you have these

289
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.070
left wing people who are just like against the

290
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.590
cops because they're cops, and they're white, right? And

291
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.469
like, and if the person who got killed was

292
00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:34.349
black, you know, it's just because of the groups

293
00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:36.590
that they belong to, OK. So none of those

294
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.359
people know what justice is. That's not what justice

295
00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.299
is about, right? It's about the individual.

296
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.059
Right, but I mean, evaluating things on an individual

297
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:51.450
basis, it's perfectly plausible that there are a few

298
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.330
cops out there that might be racist.

299
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:58.010
Yeah, yeah, I mean, but, you know, by the

300
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.330
way, there could be cops who are prejudiced against

301
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.719
blacks, and there could also be cops who are

302
00:15:01.719 --> 00:15:05.289
prejudiced against whites, right? And, uh, by the way,

303
00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:07.840
if you just look at the shooting statistics, um,

304
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.210
they suggest that there's a bias against whites or

305
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.330
in favor of blacks. Right, that is so, which

306
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.650
is the opposite of what they tell you in

307
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.809
the media, OK. But, um, you know, if you,

308
00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:19.809
so in the media, they tell you there's a

309
00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:24.299
bias against blacks overall. Um, BUT that's so because

310
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.799
just as members of the population, black people are

311
00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:29.159
more likely to get shot by the police than

312
00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:32.400
white people. But if you control for violent crime

313
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.140
rates, then white people are more likely to be

314
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.119
killed by the police than black people. Right. And,

315
00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:42.570
uh, you know, so like, If the reason why

316
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.270
you get shot by the police is that you

317
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:49.390
were attacking them, that's not racism. And so the

318
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.880
situation is that black suspects are more likely to

319
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.780
attack the cops. OK, but like, but if you

320
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.580
sort of control for like what the person is

321
00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.409
doing, then they're more likely to shoot you if

322
00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:02.429
you're white. So, but anyway, OK, side point. But

323
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:04.309
by the way, like, I do think there's evidence

324
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:07.880
that American police are more violent than necessary. Like

325
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.960
they use force more often than police in other

326
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.880
countries, so they use force more often than they

327
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.159
have to. I think that's true. I just don't

328
00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.479
think that it's racist. It's not about race. It's

329
00:16:16.479 --> 00:16:19.219
just about an overall culture of excessive force.

330
00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:23.760
And do you think that that force that the

331
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.380
American police tends to use more than the police

332
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.140
of other countries is, uh, unjustified, or do you

333
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.020
think that that difference points to an unjustified use

334
00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:38.309
of force or, or not?

335
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.979
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean, um,

336
00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:43.520
obviously sometimes you have to use force, OK, so

337
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.270
like when you look at some of these cases,

338
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.659
um, that I discussed like the Michael Brown case,

339
00:16:47.969 --> 00:16:51.080
man, that cop had no choice. He had to

340
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.320
shoot Michael Brown, like, Michael Brown attacked him, then

341
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.320
he ran away, and then the cop tried to

342
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.859
follow him, and then Michael Brown tried to charge

343
00:16:57.859 --> 00:17:00.299
him. Right. And by the way, this is like,

344
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.950
you know, this is a suspect who outweighs the

345
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.469
cop by 50 pounds. So this is, this is

346
00:17:04.469 --> 00:17:06.699
like serious business. You cannot be, you cannot let

347
00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:09.689
that guy get on top of you. OK. So

348
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.949
he just has no choice. OK. But also, I'm

349
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.339
sure that there are cases of unjustified shootings, right?

350
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.510
And, um, you know, as I say, like, well,

351
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.829
American police use force more than police in other

352
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.868
countries. Like there's evidence of that. So, they're probably

353
00:17:24.868 --> 00:17:28.270
using force more often than, than they should. Right,

354
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.800
like, you know, probably most shootings are justified, but

355
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.719
we could reduce, we could reduce the shootings.

356
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.339
Mhm. So, I mean, this is not directly related

357
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:45.599
to uh shooting black or white people, but uh

358
00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:49.359
there are people on the left that make this

359
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:52.660
kind of case that uh that there's a bias

360
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.079
in terms of policing. I mean, because if the

361
00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:58.859
police have limited resources and they have to choose

362
00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:02.250
the area. They are going to police the most.

363
00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:06.349
Couldn't it be that over time the policing becomes

364
00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:10.439
biased towards certain groups of people like blacks, and

365
00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:13.489
then that would also be a reason why they

366
00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:17.829
catch more black people committing crime than whites, and

367
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:20.689
then one of the reasons why they have higher

368
00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:23.229
crime rates. I mean, what do you make of

369
00:18:23.229 --> 00:18:27.969
that? I mean. Um, THE reason why the police

370
00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:32.709
respond, like the police spend more time in minority

371
00:18:32.709 --> 00:18:37.430
neighborhoods, neighborhoods that are poor, and also like disproportionately

372
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.400
have, um, Racial minorities, the reason for that is

373
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.599
that there's more crime there. It's not that the

374
00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:49.079
cops are victimizing the minorities, it's that they're trying

375
00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:53.359
to protect them because that's their job. OK, like

376
00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:57.520
they get calls to, to respond to a potential

377
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.540
crime in progress. And they're supposed to go. Like,

378
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.380
like, you know, what, what are they supposed to,

379
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.650
they're there, they're there to protect those people. So

380
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.219
they have to go, and then they're going to

381
00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:09.579
wind up arresting people who are going to be

382
00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:12.540
the same color as the victims, usually, right? Because

383
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.140
like, you know, most crime is, it's within a

384
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.219
racial group. Um, IT'S with, it's people who live

385
00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:20.060
in a neighborhood victimizing other people in their same

386
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.719
neighborhood. OK. So it's like, it's like the people

387
00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:26.680
on the left are only looking at the criminals.

388
00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:29.939
They're looking at the criminals as the victims and

389
00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:32.359
like, oh, you know, you arrested all these people

390
00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:34.969
who are criminals, but they're darker skinned, so you're

391
00:19:34.969 --> 00:19:36.979
victimizing them. But look at the victims, look at

392
00:19:36.979 --> 00:19:39.890
the crime victims, right? Because like those are the

393
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.969
people we should be caring about more and they

394
00:19:41.969 --> 00:19:43.359
need to be protected and they need to be

395
00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:45.020
protected from the other people in their neighborhood.

396
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.520
Right, uh, but, but I mean, just to, uh,

397
00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:51.239
I mean, perhaps, uh, insist a little bit more

398
00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:54.750
on this point, uh, uh, just to see what

399
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.380
do you think about it. I mean, uh, but

400
00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:00.800
again, because people, uh, police have limited resources and

401
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.680
even nowadays I know that there are certain police

402
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.839
departments where people have. Already resorted to or implemented

403
00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:12.020
uh AI systems to make decisions in terms of

404
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.579
the areas they should police more. Don't you think

405
00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:20.219
that over time that could produce a bias in

406
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.300
terms of the people they catch committing crime?

407
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.109
Well, I mean, what do you, do you mean

408
00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:29.359
by a bias like they're going to catch more

409
00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:32.869
I, I, I, I mean that that perhaps uh

410
00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:37.510
they would uh over time decide to police more

411
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.510
areas that are, for example, predominantly black instead of

412
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.469
predominantly white, and so that would skew the crime

413
00:20:47.469 --> 00:20:50.489
statistics towards uh black people.

414
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.310
But I mean. They should police the high crime

415
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.869
areas more than the low crime areas, right? So

416
00:20:57.869 --> 00:21:00.250
I, so like, I don't think, like, I don't

417
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.869
think that's a bias, right? Like, OK, and then

418
00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:04.349
you're like, oh, well, but then they're going to

419
00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:06.510
catch more black ones. True, but that's what they

420
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.790
should do. And again, like, we should be more

421
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.180
concerned about crime victims than about criminals. OK. So

422
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.989
the fact that they're catching more criminals in those

423
00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:17.310
neighborhoods means that they're protecting more of the people

424
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.050
in those neighborhoods. So, like, if anything, that's a

425
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.449
bias. In favor of the minorities in that neighborhood,

426
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.849
right? Like the innocent ones, not the criminals. OK,

427
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.650
you could describe it as a bias against the

428
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.050
criminals, OK, right? But it would be like a

429
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.089
bias in favor of their potential victims. OK, but

430
00:21:36.089 --> 00:21:37.770
by the way, like, you know, I mean, maybe,

431
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.449
maybe you're suggesting, oh, well, like maybe the crime

432
00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:42.849
statistics aren't really that lopsided, like maybe white people

433
00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:45.390
are committing just as many crimes, and like, uh,

434
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.000
nobody thinks that. Like, I don't think any serious

435
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.260
social scientist thinks that, OK. Um, AND there, you

436
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.449
know, like, there aren't, um, There aren't enough unsolved

437
00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:59.609
crimes for that to be the case, OK. So,

438
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:02.209
you know, it's estimated that something like 40% of

439
00:22:02.209 --> 00:22:05.609
homicides are committed by black people in America, and

440
00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:08.010
black people are something like 13% of the population.

441
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.829
So there's just more violence occurring. Um, IT'S not

442
00:22:12.829 --> 00:22:14.400
the fault of the cops, it's not the fault

443
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.760
of the white people, you know, it's the fault

444
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.630
of the criminals.

445
00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:22.089
Right. I mean, this is not something that you

446
00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:25.810
explore in your book, but uh what do you

447
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.890
think, do you have any idea about what would

448
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:34.459
explain The fact that uh black people commit more

449
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.040
violent crime in terms of percentage than white people

450
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.000
because uh if we talk to right-wing people and

451
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.959
left wing people, they would put forth different hypotheses.

452
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.079
For example, there are right-wing pundits that would say,

453
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.780
oh, it has to do with black culture or

454
00:22:54.829 --> 00:22:56.800
It has to do with the fact that there

455
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.089
are many single parent households among the black community.

456
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.310
If you talk with left wing pundits, they would

457
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.449
say, oh no, it has mostly to do with

458
00:23:09.869 --> 00:23:14.469
poverty with poverty rates and with socioeconomic factors. I

459
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:16.829
mean, do you have any opinion on that,

460
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.189
or I mean, probably all of those things are

461
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:22.150
factors. Like we don't really know, there's no agreement,

462
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.859
and I'm not a social scientist, like. I wouldn't

463
00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:27.699
really be able to figure that out. Um. But

464
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:29.859
yeah, there are probably multiple factors. Uh, THERE'S been

465
00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:32.689
this breakdown of the family. So they're just like,

466
00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:34.739
you know, over the past whatever, several decades, there's

467
00:23:34.739 --> 00:23:37.689
been a huge increase in out of wedlock births,

468
00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:42.459
uh, particularly in the black community. And, um, you

469
00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:45.310
know, like it's, it's a reasonable point by the

470
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:50.010
conservatives that um young boys need a father. And

471
00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:52.160
that, you know, like they get to a certain

472
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.280
age and their mother can't control them anymore and

473
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.160
they need a father. Um, TO control them and

474
00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.670
keep them out of trouble. You know, with, with,

475
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.089
keep them out of the gangs or whatever, you

476
00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:05.489
know, groups of criminals. Um, THAT'S probably part of

477
00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:08.729
it. Um. And then obviously, as you also mentioned,

478
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.780
well, yeah, poverty is correlated with crime. And so,

479
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.800
and, you know, like it's lower socioeconomic status. Um

480
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.880
Yeah, uh, and this is something that you just

481
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.359
tangentially talk about in your book, but since we're

482
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:27.599
also talking here about racism, what do you make

483
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:31.760
of systemic racism? Do you think that there is

484
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.969
such a thing in the US particularly? No,

485
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.000
um, I, I don't know, like, is, is there

486
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.390
such a thing at all? Maybe, you know, but,

487
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.989
uh. It's, it's just sort of, I generally view

488
00:24:44.989 --> 00:24:48.030
it as an excuse. So like, you want, you

489
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.109
want to declare that all of our problems are

490
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:53.579
due to racism or whatever, that there's racism rampant,

491
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.349
but you can't find any actual racists, right? Or

492
00:24:56.349 --> 00:24:57.750
you, you know, you don't find enough of them,

493
00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.510
you only find like a tiny number of them

494
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.709
who have very little power. OK, so then you

495
00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:06.229
say, well, the system is racist. And then, you

496
00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:09.109
know, it's usually like, um, just sort of like

497
00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:12.150
asserted, and you don't have to prove that. OK,

498
00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:14.369
and then, you know, I try to get examples

499
00:25:14.369 --> 00:25:17.760
of, OK, how is the system racist? Um, IT'S

500
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.000
just like, just, just tell me a specific example,

501
00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:22.670
OK. I have heard examples like, oh, well, the

502
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.329
drug laws, the drug laws are racist. Because they

503
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:31.849
disproportionately send black men to prison. Because black men

504
00:25:31.849 --> 00:25:34.770
disproportionately violate the drug laws. OK, that doesn't make

505
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.449
the laws racist, right? Like, you know, is the

506
00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:42.449
murder statute racist because black people disproportionately commit more

507
00:25:42.449 --> 00:25:46.750
murders? Like, no. It's, you know, that we didn't

508
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.430
have, we didn't start um a law against murder

509
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.229
because we don't like black people. OK. We created

510
00:25:53.229 --> 00:25:56.390
that law because you can't kill people, like, because

511
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.750
that's unacceptable. Anyway, OK. But, oh, OK, but then,

512
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.989
you know, here, so, you know, this was a,

513
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.189
like one of the prominent examples, and I think

514
00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:07.859
like, I don't know, one of the Um, clearest,

515
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:11.000
most comprehensible examples of the systemic racism was that,

516
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.540
um, the penalties for crack cocaine are harsher than

517
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.290
the penalties for powder cocaine. And crack cocaine is

518
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.930
more popular among black users and powder cocaine is

519
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.339
more popular among white users. So it's probably due

520
00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:24.699
to racism. OK. And then I tried to look

521
00:26:24.699 --> 00:26:27.300
up, well, how this came about. How did that

522
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.189
difference in the um punishment schedule come about? And,

523
00:26:31.209 --> 00:26:33.530
uh, well, it turned out that actually, well, people

524
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.719
were concerned, this was whatever back in the 1970s

525
00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:39.640
or something, people were concerned that crack cocaine was

526
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.650
devastating black communities. So the government thought they were

527
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.770
going to crack down on it by making the

528
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.780
penalties harsher. OK, and that was supported by the

529
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.560
Congressional Black Caucus. It was supported by like Democrat,

530
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.530
widely supported by Democrats, widely supported by black legislators.

531
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.930
Because they thought it was going to help. Like

532
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.609
they didn't like, they didn't make the laws because

533
00:27:03.609 --> 00:27:06.140
they were trying to destroy the community. They weren't

534
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.329
trying to help the community because crack was destroying

535
00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:11.180
it. Now, it turned out that it didn't work.

536
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.670
They didn't succeed in stopping it, and like the

537
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.469
drug laws have widely failed, OK. But it's not

538
00:27:16.469 --> 00:27:20.729
racist because they failed, right? Like like they You

539
00:27:20.729 --> 00:27:23.630
know, if anything, It, it was showing that they

540
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.109
were particularly concerned about helping the black community.

541
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.439
So do you think that when it comes to

542
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:37.819
determining if some something occurs due to racism, the

543
00:27:37.819 --> 00:27:42.540
hardest part to really establish is the intent? I

544
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.699
mean, it's like the ongoing discussions that we've been

545
00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:51.819
seeing about the genocide in Gaza where of course

546
00:27:51.819 --> 00:27:55.060
the intent is the hardest part to prove. Do

547
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.765
you think that? In the particular case of racism,

548
00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:02.025
the intent is also the hardest part to prove

549
00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:05.925
because of course we can find statistics that are

550
00:28:06.145 --> 00:28:11.045
skewed toward blacks or toward whites, for example, but

551
00:28:11.265 --> 00:28:15.910
it's very hard to prove that. It's the result

552
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:22.079
of uh people uh um of people's racism, of

553
00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:28.170
people proposing laws or doing something like the uh

554
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.930
the police policing cer certain areas and not others

555
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.390
because they are racist.

556
00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:39.250
Yeah, and so. Yeah, how, how could you prove

557
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.939
what somebody's intent is? Well, um, you know, sometimes,

558
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.339
sometimes you can tell and sometimes you can't tell,

559
00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:48.609
right? But, you know, generally, I would say, well,

560
00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:51.859
start with the most straightforward and charitable interpretation unless

561
00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:54.270
there's a specific reason to think otherwise. OK, so

562
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.979
the cops are policing a minority neighborhood and there's

563
00:28:56.979 --> 00:29:00.979
two interpretations. Um, THEY hate black people, so they

564
00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:03.540
want to arrest more black people so that they

565
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.000
can cause harm to those people that they arrest.

566
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.130
And then another interpretation is, uh, actually, it's their

567
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.339
job to stop crime. And there's more crime there,

568
00:29:13.969 --> 00:29:15.890
right? And they're actually protecting the people in the

569
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.609
neighborhood. OK. Well, I just think that the second,

570
00:29:18.729 --> 00:29:20.849
like, either of these are possible explanations, but I

571
00:29:20.849 --> 00:29:23.010
think the second one makes more sense. It's more

572
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.530
like what a normal person would be motivated by,

573
00:29:26.609 --> 00:29:29.489
you know, and just, OK. Um, OR, you know,

574
00:29:29.569 --> 00:29:32.369
I gave that, uh, example of, um, the laws

575
00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:35.640
about crack cocaine. Like it seems like a straightforward

576
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.589
explanation is they were trying to stop crack cocaine.

577
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.140
It wasn't that they wanted more black people to

578
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.800
be imprisoned, it was that they wanted there to

579
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.900
be less crack. And the way that seems straightforward,

580
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.959
and that seems to be supported by, you know,

581
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.119
the fact that like most black legislators were on

582
00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:51.160
board. Right, and like, you know, the Congressional Black

583
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.280
Caucus met with Richard Nixon to urge him to

584
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.839
ramp up the drug war. No. So it sounds

585
00:29:56.839 --> 00:30:02.160
just like, you know, OK, anyway, so, um. You

586
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.640
know, just like, you know, just don't jump to

587
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.199
the most uncharitable interpretation without good reason.

588
00:30:08.729 --> 00:30:12.209
OK, that seems reasonable. So, uh, what you also

589
00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:15.770
tackle some feminist myths in your book, uh, and

590
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.459
the first one has to do with the gender

591
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:22.640
pay gap. So I mean, from what you, uh,

592
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.010
I mean you looked at the statistics at the

593
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.890
data, uh, what is the real gender pay gap

594
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.290
and what do you think explains it?

595
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.270
Yeah, so, I mean, you know, people have been

596
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.030
saying for a while that women get paid less

597
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.319
than men, and sometimes they add for the same

598
00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:41.699
work. Uh, AND then there, you know, there was,

599
00:30:42.069 --> 00:30:44.140
you hear statistics like, oh, women get paid 70

600
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.180
cents for every $1 that men earn, or 72

601
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.150
cents or whatever.

602
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.469
Yeah, I heard 75 cents or something like that.

603
00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:53.969
Yeah, OK. So, uh, it changed over the decades,

604
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:57.089
and so the most recent figure is 82 cents.

605
00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:00.050
OK, but there's still an 18 cents gap. OK,

606
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.339
now, most people when they hear this, think that

607
00:31:02.369 --> 00:31:05.410
that refers to pay for the same work, and

608
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.489
it does not. It refers to pay for different

609
00:31:08.489 --> 00:31:13.810
work, right? And so if you control for various

610
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.290
pay relevant characteristics, you know, occupation, hours worked, amount

611
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.569
of experience, etc. THINGS that are obviously relevant to

612
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:22.489
how much you get paid, if you control these

613
00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:25.449
other factors, and the pay gap virtually disappears. So

614
00:31:25.449 --> 00:31:27.410
then, you know, it goes from 82 cents to

615
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.449
96 cents, 98 cents, 99 cents, depending on what

616
00:31:30.449 --> 00:31:34.020
source you look at. Right. And so actually, like

617
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.180
if you add more context to this statistic, it

618
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.979
supports the opposite of the point. Instead of showing

619
00:31:38.979 --> 00:31:41.150
that there's sexism, it tends to show that that

620
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.359
there's egalitarianism.

621
00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:46.949
But I mean, when you control for all those

622
00:31:46.949 --> 00:31:50.630
factors, isn't there still even if just a small

623
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.569
in the single digits, uh, a pay gap or

624
00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:54.709
not? Yeah,

625
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.660
if you get a one cent pay gap or

626
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.260
something like that, that could just be random fluctuation,

627
00:31:59.339 --> 00:32:02.489
right? Um, PLUS there are, there are factors that,

628
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.229
um, you're just like multiple other possible factors that

629
00:32:05.229 --> 00:32:07.540
you can't control for, right? In fact, it is

630
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.670
plausible that there might be a reverse pay gap.

631
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.910
So, because there's just a whole bunch of other

632
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.209
uh controls that haven't been added in that would

633
00:32:15.209 --> 00:32:19.540
be difficult to add. All right, um, Uh, so,

634
00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:21.260
you know, like one thing was, if you just

635
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.130
look at never married people without children, um, the

636
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.479
women get paid more than the men. Mhm. And

637
00:32:29.479 --> 00:32:32.569
so, um, you know that like. Um, I think

638
00:32:32.569 --> 00:32:34.250
it was 18% more or something like that, the

639
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.569
statistic is in the book. Um, AND, uh, that's

640
00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:39.469
kind of weird, you know, if you have this

641
00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:42.050
theory that we live in this patriarchy, because, you

642
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.810
know, what is it that the patriarchy is discriminating

643
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.250
against most women, but not the women who are

644
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.530
most defying gender stereotypes, the one who are, who

645
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.270
are defying the gender roles, right? You know, by

646
00:32:53.489 --> 00:33:00.329
being single and whatever. Um, Yeah, so, OK, and

647
00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:01.930
now, you know, why, why might there be a

648
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.449
reverse pay gap? Um, WELL, like there's evidence in

649
00:33:05.449 --> 00:33:08.050
psychology that um people like women more than they

650
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.920
like men. So you get this just from like,

651
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.660
you know, direct surveys about like what are your

652
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.709
attitudes towards these two groups. And just like overall,

653
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.670
on average, people have more positive attitudes about women.

654
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.890
Uh, ANOTHER thing is, you know, this implicit association

655
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.910
test. Which uh left wing people like when it's

656
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.449
being used for race. But, uh, they don't like

657
00:33:28.449 --> 00:33:30.329
it as much when it's used for sex or

658
00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:32.510
gender. OK, so, but,

659
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.890
but, but about the implicit association association test, hasn't

660
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.089
that been sort of scientifically debunked? I mean, does

661
00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:44.609
it still hold any water either for race or

662
00:33:44.609 --> 00:33:45.229
gender?

663
00:33:45.729 --> 00:33:48.510
Yeah, well, it's really unclear what it means, right?

664
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.160
So, um, maybe we should tell the listeners what

665
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.349
it is. It's like, um, It's supposed to detect

666
00:33:55.349 --> 00:34:00.390
your um implicit associations with a particular category. So

667
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:05.140
you're supposed to, um, You click a button when

668
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.770
you see something on a screen that relates to,

669
00:34:07.939 --> 00:34:10.458
so for example, something that relates to either black

670
00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:13.780
people or good things, and then a different button

671
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.100
for things that relate to either white people or

672
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.300
bad things. OK. And then that test, and then

673
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.418
they sort of like time your speed at clicking

674
00:34:22.418 --> 00:34:24.978
the button correctly. And that's supposed to show how

675
00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:27.540
easy it is for you to form associations between

676
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.219
black people and good things. OK. Uh, AND then,

677
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.699
you know, and then they do for a different

678
00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.020
group, they'll like test the association between black people

679
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.520
and bad and, you know, white people and good.

680
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.139
OK. So it turns out that people have an

681
00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:44.310
easier time associating white people with good things. THAN

682
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.668
associating black people with good things. OK. So, that

683
00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:51.070
is claimed to show this kind of unconscious prejudice.

684
00:34:51.188 --> 00:34:52.860
By the way, this even happens to people who

685
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.070
have explicitly egalitarian beliefs. This will even happen to

686
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.129
left-wing people. It happened to some black people also.

687
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:04.699
So, OK. So, um, You know, maybe it means

688
00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:07.169
that, it's not really clear if that's what it

689
00:35:07.169 --> 00:35:11.189
means. Um, They had a, they've had it, so

690
00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:12.610
it, it might mean that, but they've had a

691
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.530
hard time detecting actual discriminatory behavior correlated with your

692
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.810
implicit associations, right? So like people who score on

693
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.639
the, on the implicit association test, people who score

694
00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:25.159
as having like a bias against black people, um,

695
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.530
they haven't really been able to detect that that

696
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.320
affects their behavior in a way that causes them

697
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.320
to actually discriminate. Right. OK. But so anyway, um,

698
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.679
but it turns out that the, the same test

699
00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:38.520
that shows that people have positive associations with white

700
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.100
people also shows that they have positive associations with

701
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.389
women. And less positive associations with men. Like it

702
00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:48.379
takes, it takes longer, it's harder for people psychologically

703
00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.159
to associate men with goodness.

704
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.669
Right, I mean, but, uh, you talked about those

705
00:35:55.669 --> 00:36:00.340
kinds of biases that people might have that favor

706
00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:05.419
women, uh, versus men. But what do you make

707
00:36:05.419 --> 00:36:08.479
of this point that some people make when it

708
00:36:08.479 --> 00:36:11.419
comes to the gender pay gap? Because, for example,

709
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:16.280
um, one of the arguments that, uh, some people

710
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.520
who, uh, tried to debunk the gender pay gap

711
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.399
put forth is that. Uh, BECAUSE people argue that

712
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.399
some of it has to do with personal choices,

713
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.000
with choices made by women in comparison to choices

714
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
made by men, and then they look at, for

715
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.979
example, Scandinavian countries, Norway, Sweden, Finland, uh, and also

716
00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:43.300
Iceland, which tend to score the highest in terms

717
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:49.439
of gender equality, and they see that. There's still

718
00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:53.879
certain occupations like being a nurse versus being an

719
00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:59.469
engineer that are skewed toward female or male. Uh,

720
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.209
THEY say, they, they say that also you see,

721
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:08.520
when you remove social or sociocultural obstacles, men and

722
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.120
women still make different choices, or at least in

723
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.300
those particular areas, they tend. To make different choices,

724
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:19.340
but then, um, there are some left wing people

725
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.379
that critique that point and, and point to the

726
00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:27.280
fact that for example in those same countries when

727
00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:31.379
you look at household chores and how they are

728
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:36.179
divided, it seems that women still do most of

729
00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:40.699
them even though there's been decades of pushing. For

730
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:45.000
gender equality in those countries and so they say

731
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.840
that uh uh things like that and that's not

732
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.919
the only example they give. I'm just talking about

733
00:37:50.919 --> 00:37:53.639
one of the examples they talk about, but uh

734
00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:56.439
things like that point toward the fact that even

735
00:37:56.439 --> 00:38:01.760
though those countries have been have culturally uh pushed

736
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.320
culturally and politically pushed for gender equality for decades.

737
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:13.229
Uh, THE legacy of the patriarchal culture that existed

738
00:38:13.229 --> 00:38:17.830
there before, uh, is still, I mean, is still

739
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.340
there, and so it, it, it, it, it, uh,

740
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.604
yeah, let me just please finish my point. And

741
00:38:23.604 --> 00:38:28.844
so it would influence women to pick certain kinds

742
00:38:28.844 --> 00:38:34.104
of areas that tend to be stereotypically more associated

743
00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:34.965
with females.

744
00:38:35.405 --> 00:38:37.645
Yeah, so, yeah, all that was correct up until

745
00:38:37.645 --> 00:38:40.645
the conclusion, which is a total non sequitur and

746
00:38:40.645 --> 00:38:42.715
it's like exactly the opposite of what the evidence

747
00:38:42.715 --> 00:38:45.485
supports. OK, so I think what you're describing at

748
00:38:45.485 --> 00:38:49.205
first is the countries that have the most egalitarian

749
00:38:49.205 --> 00:38:54.120
culture. Also have women making actually more different choices

750
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.620
than men. Right? Like there's, there's greater gender difference

751
00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.270
in their occupational choice. OK. That does not show

752
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.409
that it's the legacy of the patriarchy, that shows

753
00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:06.330
the exact opposite. That shows that it's the result

754
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.570
of free choice. It's like that women and men

755
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.889
want to do different things. If you get into

756
00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:15.439
an egalitarian society and it increases the differences in

757
00:39:15.439 --> 00:39:18.159
their choices, that shows that they that they actually

758
00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:22.270
have different preferences. OK. Now, um, and by the

759
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.110
way, like, you know, you can see these preferences

760
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.590
at an early age, like, you know, like small

761
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.110
children and like. Like they haven't had time to

762
00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.709
learn what the gender roles are. They barely even

763
00:39:32.709 --> 00:39:35.469
know what their gender is. And like the girls

764
00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:37.989
prefer to play with dolls and the boys prefer

765
00:39:37.989 --> 00:39:40.229
to play with toy trucks or something like that.

766
00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:43.070
It's like, no, it's like, why, why do you

767
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.050
people, why do you leftists? I keep saying, oh,

768
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.389
they were, they were brainwashed by the culture. Like

769
00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:50.790
there's no basis for saying that. Like, why don't

770
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.429
you just admit that there are differences, you know.

771
00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:57.250
It's like males and females are different. That's how

772
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.689
it is. It's not, it's not oppression, it's not

773
00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:03.489
an injustice. It's OK. It's OK for people to

774
00:40:03.489 --> 00:40:06.250
be different. Like, it's not an injustice if we're

775
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.370
not like forcing people, if we're allowing people to

776
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.929
choose what they want. That's just, right? That's justice

777
00:40:11.929 --> 00:40:12.590
and freedom.

778
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.689
So another myth that, or at least what you

779
00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:18.479
deem to be a myth that you tackle in

780
00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:21.830
your book has to do with the so-called campus

781
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.330
rape culture. So what do you make of the

782
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:30.870
statistic that 1 in 4 women are supposedly raped

783
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.929
in college and what, what is the real number?

784
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.129
Uh, SO I don't know what the real number

785
00:40:37.129 --> 00:40:38.929
is. I think it might be 5% or it

786
00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:42.090
might be 10%. I don't know. Um, BUT, but

787
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.889
it's, it's much lower than 1 in 4.

788
00:40:45.169 --> 00:40:49.790
It's not 25%, um. Um, THERE were multiple things

789
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.429
wrong with that statistic. But by the way, just

790
00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:54.070
like as a reality check, you know, the statistic

791
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.030
implies that American college campuses are more dangerous than

792
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.229
the most crime-ridden city in America. I think like

793
00:41:01.229 --> 00:41:03.739
about 10 times more dangerous for women than the

794
00:41:03.739 --> 00:41:07.409
most crime-ridden city in America, which is Detroit. You

795
00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:10.449
know, how, how did that happen? Like, what are

796
00:41:10.449 --> 00:41:13.010
these colleges doing? Like recruiting people right out of

797
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.649
the nation's prisons to be the, to be the

798
00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:18.530
freshmen. Um, BUT, OK, you know, there were a

799
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.409
number of things wrong with the statistic. Um, SO

800
00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:24.030
it's sort of like I don't know how much

801
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.550
we wanted to get into the details. Like some

802
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.110
of these things are details, like one of them,

803
00:41:27.189 --> 00:41:29.310
one of the problems was just like an error

804
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.790
in probabilistic calculation in the paper that said that,

805
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.389
right? Where they add, they added up probabilities in

806
00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:38.070
a case where they don't really add. OK. And

807
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.949
that, that just made a small difference, you know,

808
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.330
that just inflated the statistic by 2% points. OK,

809
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.590
no big deal. But then, you know, uh, and

810
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.219
then at another point, so what they've done is

811
00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:50.189
they surveyed people about experiences that they've had in

812
00:41:50.189 --> 00:41:52.429
the preceding 7 months or 5 months or something

813
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:55.830
like that. And then they multiplied by the expected

814
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.389
length of a college career, in order to get,

815
00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:00.070
you know, how many people would have one of

816
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.870
these negative experiences in their whole college career. OK.

817
00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:04.110
And when they did that, they assumed that the

818
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.050
college career is 5 years, not 4 years. So

819
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.489
that would tend to inflate the statistic again. Now

820
00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:12.610
the actually, the actual average length is 4.3 years.

821
00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:15.199
OK. So, I made that correction, the number goes

822
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.290
down again. OK. Another interesting thing is that about

823
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.610
half of the people surveyed say that um they

824
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.419
were not raped. So that, that is, they do

825
00:42:23.419 --> 00:42:25.409
a survey, they ask the person a bunch of

826
00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.820
questions, and then the surveyor classifies whether that person

827
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.780
is a rape victim or not. OK. But one

828
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.100
of the questions is, were you raped? And about

829
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.409
half the people who the surveyor classifies as rape

830
00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:37.500
victims said, no, they were not raped. OK. So

831
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.379
that's kind of weird. Um, AND now, you know,

832
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.219
so, well, it could be that they didn't realize

833
00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:44.540
that they were raped, but they were. Or it

834
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.260
could be that the surveyor is like, you know,

835
00:42:47.379 --> 00:42:50.949
giving an overly broad characterization, OK. Um, YOU know,

836
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.229
another problem, perhaps the biggest, or I don't know,

837
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.590
um, potentially the biggest error is actually, you get

838
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.949
different statistics from different surveys. So, um, I think

839
00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:04.330
the same paper that reported the 1 in 4

840
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.129
statistic also reported the results of a different survey.

841
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:11.510
That got numbers an order of magnitude lower. So

842
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.830
like 10 times lower. OK. So, it like it,

843
00:43:15.189 --> 00:43:17.229
and I don't, I don't know why. OK. You

844
00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:19.149
do a little bit different methodology and then you

845
00:43:19.149 --> 00:43:22.270
get radically different statistics. OK. And the difference in

846
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.629
methodology was basically like in one survey, the questions

847
00:43:25.629 --> 00:43:28.830
are a lot more detailed and graphic about things

848
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.830
that might have happened to you. And then you

849
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.929
get higher. Higher rates. OK, OK. And, and, and

850
00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:37.129
the other one they just ask you sort of

851
00:43:37.129 --> 00:43:41.149
like a general question. So it could be that

852
00:43:41.149 --> 00:43:45.469
the detailed graphic statistics get people to report things

853
00:43:45.469 --> 00:43:49.659
that they otherwise wouldn't have reported. That happened, or

854
00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:51.739
it could be that they get people to falsely

855
00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:54.939
report things. That they otherwise wouldn't have falsely reported.

856
00:43:55.169 --> 00:43:58.879
Um, RIGHT, it's not totally obvious, right? OK. And

857
00:43:58.879 --> 00:44:01.370
then another thing is like they, they lumped together

858
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.770
completed rapes with mere unsuccessful attempts. And uh it

859
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.360
makes a big difference, you know, like if you're

860
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.889
the victim, it makes a big difference if it

861
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:13.320
was an unsuccessful attempt or an actual successful attempt.

862
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.129
But, but I, I mean, of course, getting the

863
00:44:18.129 --> 00:44:21.669
number right is a matter of, uh, I mean,

864
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.120
I, I mean, getting to the truth is a

865
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.399
matter of uh epistemology and it has epistemic value

866
00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.639
attached to it. But do you think that apart

867
00:44:30.639 --> 00:44:37.620
from that, Reporting such statistics might also be problematic

868
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.919
in other ways. I mean, in, in, in what

869
00:44:40.919 --> 00:44:44.600
other ways do you think that reporting such numbers

870
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.199
can be problematic? Do you think that it can

871
00:44:47.199 --> 00:44:52.159
have social, uh, negative social consequences?

872
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.080
Yeah, I mean, so one thing is, if you

873
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.600
actually believe these statistics, um, should you go to

874
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.300
college if you're a woman? Or, you know, if

875
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.379
you have, if you have a daughter, should you

876
00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:05.139
send her to college? Like, there's a wonderful chance

877
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:06.810
she's going to get raped while she's there. Like,

878
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.500
I would think that people would not send their

879
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.939
kids there if they believed that. All right. Um,

880
00:45:14.199 --> 00:45:16.840
Now, yeah, so there hasn't been like this great

881
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.959
turn away from sending people to college, but that

882
00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:21.320
probably means that people don't believe the statistic. It

883
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.000
probably means that even the people who are saying

884
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.959
it don't believe it. Um, OK, but, you know,

885
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.399
the other thing is just with social problems in

886
00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:32.429
general. You kind of need accurate information. If you're

887
00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:35.590
like overstating some of the problems, then what happens

888
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.909
is that you misdirect resources. So we wind up

889
00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:41.590
directing resources to problems that we think are big

890
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.070
that are not, and then we neglect other problems

891
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.110
that are bigger. Because we have limited resources, right?

892
00:45:48.189 --> 00:45:49.959
Like we can't, we can't spend all of our

893
00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:52.649
money on everything. Right, that's a problem. And then

894
00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.689
there's just sort of like, I don't know, attentional

895
00:45:54.689 --> 00:45:57.169
resources. People are going to be attending to things

896
00:45:57.169 --> 00:45:59.010
that they think are the biggest problems, so we

897
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.600
just kind of need to have an accurate assessment

898
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.149
of how big each problem is.

899
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:07.820
OK, so let's now talk about, uh, gender, uh,

900
00:46:07.959 --> 00:46:10.409
gender myths or what you deem to be gender

901
00:46:10.409 --> 00:46:14.409
myths and transgender people. So, what is your take

902
00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:18.475
on gender? Being a social construct. I mean, perhaps

903
00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:21.495
I would ask you to please first tell us

904
00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:25.435
what the social construct is and then if you

905
00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:28.554
think that gender is one or not.

906
00:46:28.915 --> 00:46:31.034
Well, I mean, so it used to be popular

907
00:46:31.034 --> 00:46:32.635
for people on the left to say gender is

908
00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:35.114
socially constructed. It means something like, I don't know,

909
00:46:35.195 --> 00:46:39.475
like it's not, it's not biologically based or something

910
00:46:39.475 --> 00:46:43.570
that just society assigns to you a role. And

911
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:46.050
so you, you'll get left-wing people saying like gender

912
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.879
is the role assigned to you by society or

913
00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:51.270
something like that, um, which has the implication that,

914
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.010
um, women in different societies do not have the

915
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.610
same gender. Right, that they're not women in the

916
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.719
same sense, because they have different social roles assigned

917
00:46:59.719 --> 00:47:03.929
to them. OK. Um, OK, but like it just,

918
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:07.889
the conflict between this and another kind of strand

919
00:47:07.889 --> 00:47:10.209
of leftism has come out, you know, in the

920
00:47:10.209 --> 00:47:12.889
last whatever, several years, because the idea of it

921
00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:15.489
being a social construct is in conflict with the

922
00:47:15.489 --> 00:47:20.560
popular, uh, transgender ideology. Right, so like the popular

923
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:26.290
cancel ideology is, well, um. Uh, YOU get assigned

924
00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.219
a gender at birth, but the assignment could be

925
00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:32.580
wrong. OK, so like the transgender people say that

926
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.020
they're a different gender from the gender that everyone

927
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.459
around them was telling them that they are throughout

928
00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:40.739
their childhood. So if gender is just socially constructed,

929
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:42.270
how could that be? It would have to be

930
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.860
that they were wrong. Right? If gender is socially

931
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.899
constructed, then society can't be wrong. Whatever gender you

932
00:47:47.899 --> 00:47:49.659
were assigned by society has to be your gender,

933
00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:52.060
OK? But you have these transgender people who are

934
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.860
saying, No, I'm not, I'm not that gender. OK?

935
00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:58.050
And like, and, you know, some of them, some

936
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.899
of them will be saying that they always knew

937
00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:03.429
from the beginning. Right, there are cases of these

938
00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:06.110
people who like, you know, from the age of

939
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:09.830
4 years old, they like, it's a, it's a

940
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.850
boy, but they say that they're a girl. From

941
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.469
the age of 4 years old, they're trying to

942
00:48:13.469 --> 00:48:16.550
wear dresses and stuff like that. OK, and you

943
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.500
know, you get that, it's like, well. Yeah, OK,

944
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.800
they were not taught that by society. It looks

945
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.659
like it is innate. It looks like there's something

946
00:48:26.659 --> 00:48:30.449
innate in in the brain. That tells them what

947
00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:33.860
gender they're supposed to have. And in a small,

948
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.679
very small range of cases, it just clashes with

949
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.919
their body. So like, you know, there would be

950
00:48:39.919 --> 00:48:42.550
a person who their brain is telling them that

951
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.590
they're supposed to be female, but their body is

952
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.310
male, or vice versa.

953
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.770
But uh, I mean, but do you? Do you,

954
00:48:53.969 --> 00:48:56.870
do you make a, or make a distinction between

955
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.810
sex and gender? Because, uh, I've talked with a

956
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.129
lot of anthropologists on the show, some of them,

957
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.889
uh, evolutionary or biological anthropologists, others even cultural anthropologists,

958
00:49:11.929 --> 00:49:15.469
and they all tell me that it is important

959
00:49:15.469 --> 00:49:19.520
to Uh, make a distinction between sex and gender

960
00:49:19.979 --> 00:49:25.219
because wherever you are biologically, either a male or

961
00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:29.620
a female, uh, does not need to correspond exactly

962
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.659
to the kind of social expectations put on you

963
00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:37.580
in the particular society you live in as a

964
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.500
woman or a man, and so they say that

965
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.780
it's important to make that distinction. What do you

966
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.639
think of that?

967
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.540
Yeah, so. Um, THERE is an important distinction, but

968
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.919
I don't think it has to do with social

969
00:49:51.919 --> 00:49:55.560
roles, or, you know, society's expectations of you. Like

970
00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.639
society's expectations of you are a completely separate thing.

971
00:49:57.719 --> 00:50:02.090
That's neither sex nor gender, right? Sex is, um,

972
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.040
Characteristics of your body, particularly your reproductive system, right?

973
00:50:07.199 --> 00:50:08.989
And then, and, you know, maybe to a lesser

974
00:50:08.989 --> 00:50:13.419
extent, the secondary sex characteristics, OK. But, um, gender,

975
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.699
in my view is something that's in your brain

976
00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:18.110
or in your mind. Uh, IT'S a set of

977
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:21.350
psychological characteristics that evolution designed to go along with

978
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:25.489
a particular biological sex. So the masculine gender is

979
00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:28.939
the set of psychological characteristics that are adaptations, evolutionary

980
00:50:28.939 --> 00:50:33.709
adaptations for life in a male body. And femininity

981
00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:37.229
is the adaptations for, you know, psychological adaptations for

982
00:50:37.229 --> 00:50:39.899
life in a female body. OK, so that, right,

983
00:50:39.939 --> 00:50:42.459
that's basically my theory, and it is possible to

984
00:50:42.459 --> 00:50:45.459
have a mismatch. It's possible to have a basically

985
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:51.850
feminine. Mind or psychology and just accidentally. You know,

986
00:50:51.929 --> 00:50:54.459
you're in a male body OK. Now, I think

987
00:50:54.459 --> 00:50:57.100
that's extremely rare. So if you look at the

988
00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.159
DSM-4, like the most recent version, which is from,

989
00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:03.379
I think, 2013, it reports the prevalence of this

990
00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:05.979
in the neighborhood of 1 in 10,000 people in

991
00:51:05.979 --> 00:51:08.729
the population. OK, so it's not like this is

992
00:51:08.729 --> 00:51:12.469
going on all the time. Uh, BUT something else

993
00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.419
has happened in recent years, like in the last

994
00:51:14.419 --> 00:51:18.510
decade, where the number of people identifying as transgender

995
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.929
has just exploded. So it's like exploded by a

996
00:51:21.929 --> 00:51:25.550
hundredfold or more. So in some surveys, you now

997
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.860
have 1% or more of people saying that they're

998
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.510
transgender. OK, so I think that is not the

999
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.689
same phenomenon. So I think there was one phenomenon

1000
00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:39.520
that the DSM was talking about, that is something

1001
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.290
like 1 in 10,000 people in the population, where

1002
00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:44.389
you genuinely have a mismatch between your, your innate

1003
00:51:44.389 --> 00:51:47.370
gender that's programmed into your brain and your body

1004
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.250
type. But then there's another phenomenon that's going on

1005
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.810
today, which has exploded the number of people who

1006
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.370
call themselves transgender, and it's partly this kind of

1007
00:51:55.370 --> 00:52:00.649
social contagion. Right, it's that, um, First of all,

1008
00:52:00.729 --> 00:52:03.050
people can get confused about their gender, especially young

1009
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.860
people. And like, you know, Like people could even

1010
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.979
get confused about their sexual orientation. Um, AND, you

1011
00:52:10.979 --> 00:52:15.199
know, like, there's, you know, a documented phenomenon that,

1012
00:52:15.219 --> 00:52:20.209
um, social contagion can affect anorexia. So like, um,

1013
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:26.110
adolescent, young adolescent women can be, um, They can

1014
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.129
become anorexic because other people around them are anorexic,

1015
00:52:29.909 --> 00:52:34.550
because like it's getting reinforced by online content and

1016
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.300
maybe their friend group and stuff like that, OK.

1017
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.030
And in that phenomenon, you can have people who

1018
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.590
are starving, literally on the brink of starvation, and

1019
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.489
they think that they're fat. OK, so if that

1020
00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:49.610
can happen, it's, it's even more like even more

1021
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.689
easily possible for somebody to get confused about their

1022
00:52:51.689 --> 00:52:54.550
gender. So I think part of what has happened

1023
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.750
is that there's a bunch of people who are

1024
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.149
confused about their gender, and that confusion is being

1025
00:52:58.149 --> 00:53:02.699
reinforced by elements in the culture. Like there's online

1026
00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:04.820
content where people are trying to encourage you to

1027
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.860
think that you're transgender, and like encouraging you to

1028
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:11.550
attribute sort of general malaise that teenagers undergo to

1029
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:12.379
being transgender.

1030
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.870
But don't you think that at least part of

1031
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:19.909
that big increase in the number of people who

1032
00:53:19.909 --> 00:53:26.389
identify as transgender could uh be something similar to

1033
00:53:26.389 --> 00:53:32.389
what happened when, for example, in schools, teachers stopped

1034
00:53:32.389 --> 00:53:36.110
forcing people to learn to write with their right

1035
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.550
hand and so after that there was uh an

1036
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:45.064
explosion. In terms of left-handed people and what happened

1037
00:53:45.064 --> 00:53:49.725
also with homosexual people when uh it became more

1038
00:53:49.985 --> 00:53:54.584
uh socially acceptable to be a gay or lesbian

1039
00:53:54.784 --> 00:53:58.304
that their number also in a very short period

1040
00:53:58.304 --> 00:54:01.064
of time increased. I mean, do, don't you think

1041
00:54:01.064 --> 00:54:04.705
that at least part of that could be explained

1042
00:54:04.705 --> 00:54:07.185
as a phenomenon similar to that?

1043
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.129
Yeah, so I don't know the statistics on like

1044
00:54:10.129 --> 00:54:13.429
how many people are left-handed or whatever, but um,

1045
00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:16.830
so there could be increased reporting because of increased

1046
00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:23.189
social acceptance of transgenderism. But a hundredfold, right? Because

1047
00:54:23.189 --> 00:54:25.550
like the DSM said, 1 in 10,000 people or

1048
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.159
something in that neighborhood, that general order of magnitude

1049
00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:30.870
had gender dysphoria. And then you get like surveys

1050
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.219
in which 1%, so that's like 100 times as

1051
00:54:33.219 --> 00:54:36.429
many people say that they're transgender. OK. And then,

1052
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.709
and by the way, it varies, um, geographically and

1053
00:54:40.709 --> 00:54:43.270
with the group. So, like, uh, they're more, it's,

1054
00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:46.389
it's stronger among young people. OK, and then like,

1055
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.250
it's stronger in New York or in blue states,

1056
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:53.429
like there's more transgenderism. OK. Uh, ANOTHER, another interesting

1057
00:54:53.429 --> 00:54:55.949
thing is like, um, you know, it runs in

1058
00:54:55.949 --> 00:54:58.879
friend groups. OK. So I think there was one

1059
00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:02.439
anecdote where um there were, there were a group

1060
00:55:02.439 --> 00:55:06.520
of, uh, like multiple young women who were working

1061
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:09.439
with a popular coach at a high school. So

1062
00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:11.879
I think it's like 4 or 5 women. And

1063
00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:15.939
then like, and the coach came out as transgender,

1064
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.280
and then like multiple of the women like came

1065
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.209
out as transgender within the next year. It's like,

1066
00:55:22.239 --> 00:55:26.520
OK. You know, this is, this is not like,

1067
00:55:26.669 --> 00:55:28.949
this is not just chance, OK? And it can't

1068
00:55:28.949 --> 00:55:31.909
be that like, they just were really transgender all

1069
00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:35.429
along, right? And furthermore, like, this is happening with

1070
00:55:35.429 --> 00:55:37.989
people who never showed any signs of being trans

1071
00:55:37.989 --> 00:55:40.810
when they were Young, right, like when they were

1072
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.889
little kids, OK. So if you, if you were

1073
00:55:43.889 --> 00:55:46.050
4 years old when you first said that you

1074
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.929
were the other gender, then I believe you. If

1075
00:55:47.929 --> 00:55:49.409
you're, if you're 4 years old and then you

1076
00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:51.959
persisted in that for the next 10 years, then

1077
00:55:51.959 --> 00:55:55.330
I believe you. OK. But if you always acted

1078
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.090
like a normally feminine girl, and then when you

1079
00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.850
reach the age of 14, you decided that you're

1080
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:01.350
a boy, I don't believe you.

1081
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.449
Oh, OK, but in terms of the, the consequences,

1082
00:56:05.889 --> 00:56:10.500
let's then, uh, assume that, uh, A big chunk

1083
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.469
of uh those people now identifying as transgender, it

1084
00:56:15.469 --> 00:56:18.620
uh it has to do with the social contagion.

1085
00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:23.360
I mean, in terms of the potential consequences of

1086
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.889
that, I mean, when it comes to, for example,

1087
00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.969
uh, them, uh, transitioning to the other. Sex or

1088
00:56:33.969 --> 00:56:38.300
having access to, for example, puberty blockers or or

1089
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:43.139
when they're older, having access to sex reassignment surgery.

1090
00:56:43.219 --> 00:56:48.610
I mean, since that is sort of um. Since

1091
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:54.389
they have to be seen and followed by doctors,

1092
00:56:54.899 --> 00:56:57.050
uh, I mean, do you think that that would

1093
00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:03.679
really have any big social consequences, because if they,

1094
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:08.409
if doctors are able to spot the ones that

1095
00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:14.620
are not really transgender people. Uh, IT, it couldn't

1096
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.300
it just be the case that over time the

1097
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:21.000
over time, the ones who are not will just

1098
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.100
grow out of it, and there, there won't be

1099
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:27.139
any relevant consequences.

1100
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.669
Well, I mean, they will grow out of it

1101
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.979
if um they are not allowed to make permanent

1102
00:57:32.979 --> 00:57:36.739
changes to their body. So, you know, like, it,

1103
00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:39.780
we have left wing people saying that like, You

1104
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.060
know, transgender kids who are underage should be able

1105
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.739
to go through surgeries to alter their body and

1106
00:57:44.739 --> 00:57:48.750
like, That that may be ruining their lives. You

1107
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:52.510
know, or that they should take these drugs to

1108
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:55.110
uh block puberty and like take cross-sex hormones or

1109
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:59.030
things like that. Uh, AND, you know, like, If

1110
00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:00.629
the majority of these people are going to turn

1111
00:58:00.629 --> 00:58:02.500
out to not really be trans, you can't be

1112
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.870
doing that. Right? Like this is serious long-term consequences.

1113
00:58:05.959 --> 00:58:09.120
So, look, I think, um, once, once you're 18

1114
00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.709
or over, you do whatever you want, right? It's

1115
00:58:11.709 --> 00:58:14.600
nobody else's business. But before the age of 18,

1116
00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:16.360
like I think the parents have to protect the

1117
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.080
children. And I don't, I don't really know how

1118
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:23.739
to tell. You know, who's who's really trans. I,

1119
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:26.679
I don't, I don't really have good advice about

1120
00:58:26.679 --> 00:58:28.649
that, but I, I don't think that you should

1121
00:58:28.649 --> 00:58:31.919
just, you know, give the transition to everyone. Um,

1122
00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:33.439
I think, you know, like the, I think the

1123
00:58:33.439 --> 00:58:35.959
parents have to. They have to roll, they have

1124
00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:37.800
to, they have to be able to veto that.

1125
00:58:39.209 --> 00:58:41.340
Uh, I mean, but the, the, those sorts of

1126
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:46.090
claims you say some left-wing people make about, uh,

1127
00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.260
small children having access to, that, that they should

1128
00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:54.280
have access to, uh, puberty blockers or even surgery.

1129
00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:59.620
I mean, that, that's not something allowed by the

1130
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.580
medical system or, or is it?

1131
00:59:02.929 --> 00:59:04.879
Yeah, I don't really know how much is happening,

1132
00:59:04.889 --> 00:59:07.129
like, cause, you know, I, I keep hearing right

1133
00:59:07.129 --> 00:59:09.330
wing people saying that that they're doing this to

1134
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.530
the kids, but I don't know if that's propaganda.

1135
00:59:11.649 --> 00:59:14.889
I haven't really fact checked it, right? So, I,

1136
00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:16.649
I don't want to say like it, it, it

1137
00:59:16.649 --> 00:59:19.669
probably has happened. Uh, I don't, I don't know

1138
00:59:19.669 --> 00:59:20.129
how much.

1139
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:26.050
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, SO, uh, just another sort of,

1140
00:59:26.669 --> 00:59:30.110
uh, phenomenon or even data point having to do

1141
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:34.370
with transgender people. I mean, are there really, because

1142
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:40.290
that also points to, uh, perhaps the rate of

1143
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:45.909
people that are actually transgender or not transgender. So

1144
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:50.709
are there really many people who did transition because

1145
00:59:50.969 --> 00:59:56.320
uh I've From what I've read, it's around 1

1146
00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.020
to 2% of people who regret transitioning and then

1147
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.060
the transition. I, I mean, do you have any

1148
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.090
other data about that?

1149
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.179
So I tried to look up, so there's, you

1150
01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:13.580
know, two things called desistence and de-transitioning. So desistence

1151
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.260
is where you say that you're transgender, but then

1152
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.020
you later come to identify with your uh gender

1153
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.060
assigned at birth, as they call it. Um, AND

1154
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.879
Um, there are widely varying estimates of the prevalence

1155
01:00:24.879 --> 01:00:26.909
of that, OK. But that does appear to be

1156
01:00:26.909 --> 01:00:29.919
very common. And so the DSM back in 2013

1157
01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:32.159
said that the majority of cases of gender dysphoria

1158
01:00:32.159 --> 01:00:35.219
will resolve on their own. Um, AND the people

1159
01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:37.840
will come to accept their birth gender. OK. Um,

1160
01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:40.659
And then I, and I don't, I don't remember

1161
01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:44.409
the statistics from more recent surveys. OK, de-transitioning is

1162
01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.120
less common. So this is where you actually like

1163
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.330
make some serious effort to transition to living as

1164
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:52.449
the other gender. And it's less common after that

1165
01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:56.310
to go back. Now, um, I don't know why

1166
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.020
that is. So that could be partly because it's

1167
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:00.310
only the people who have more serious gender dysphoria

1168
01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:03.350
who make the transition in the first place. It

1169
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:06.149
could also be because, like, once you transition, it's

1170
01:01:06.149 --> 01:01:09.310
harder to go back, right? Like, there's sort of

1171
01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:11.469
like a psychological pressure to stick with it, because

1172
01:01:11.469 --> 01:01:13.750
otherwise, you know, you have to admit that you

1173
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.570
totally fucked up your life or something like that.

1174
01:01:15.919 --> 01:01:18.750
Uh, OK. So, and then, and I don't know

1175
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:22.189
the prevalence of de-transitioning. Um, I think I tried

1176
01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:24.370
to look it up, but I didn't really find

1177
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.239
Um, I didn't find a clear answer. OK, uh,

1178
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.409
I, I don't believe that it's 1 to 2%.

1179
01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:35.159
Like that sounds to me like So I don't

1180
01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:36.159
know what it is, and I don't know where

1181
01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.679
that comes from, but that does sound to me

1182
01:01:37.679 --> 01:01:41.969
like a propaganda figure. Um, FROM political activists, so,

1183
01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:44.350
Yeah, just, you know, so like I know that's

1184
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:46.679
not very helpful, but whenever I hear stuff like

1185
01:01:46.679 --> 01:01:48.860
that, like, it usually turns out to be bogus.

1186
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.030
OK, so just one more question about transgender people

1187
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:57.030
and then we'll, we'll, we'll move on to other

1188
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.850
topics. So, in the book you also talk about

1189
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:05.260
autogynophilia. I mean, what is that and what influence

1190
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.530
do you think it might have when it comes

1191
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:11.629
to these debates surrounding transgender people?

1192
01:02:12.489 --> 01:02:17.840
Yeah, um, Autogonopila is, um, being sexually excited by

1193
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.800
the thought of yourself having a woman's body. And,

1194
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.050
uh, so we know that this is a real

1195
01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:27.679
phenomenon because some transgender people, trans women in particular,

1196
01:02:28.649 --> 01:02:33.770
self-describe as autogonophile. So, like the, the whole theory

1197
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:37.989
of autogonophilia as a major, major motivation for transgenderism,

1198
01:02:38.169 --> 01:02:42.280
it derives from surveys. Um, ESPECIALLY, you know, trans

1199
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.520
women who say that they're sexually aroused by the

1200
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.600
thought of having a female body. OK. Now, um,

1201
01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:51.360
if that's the reason why you're transitioning, I think

1202
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.989
you are not in fact a woman. Right? Because

1203
01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:57.830
like that's not what gender is. Like feminine gender

1204
01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.590
is not being sexually excited by the thought of

1205
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:02.550
yourself having a female body. And like, and so

1206
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.100
if that's the reason why you want to transition,

1207
01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:07.489
then there's no evidence that you actually have feminine

1208
01:03:07.489 --> 01:03:09.979
gender. That doesn't mean that you can't do it.

1209
01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.540
Like, in my view, you can do whatever you

1210
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.219
want with your own body. So you can like

1211
01:03:14.219 --> 01:03:17.979
get a surgery if that's what you want. OK.

1212
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.300
But I don't think that you can fairly demand

1213
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.679
that other people say that you're a woman, right?

1214
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.879
Cause like, Like whether the word woman is connected

1215
01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:29.620
to biological sex or gender is sort of like

1216
01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.300
open to debate. Like some people think, well, you're

1217
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.739
a woman if you have a female biological sex

1218
01:03:34.739 --> 01:03:36.929
and not otherwise. And then some people think, no,

1219
01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.330
you could be called a woman if you just

1220
01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.899
have feminine gender, even though you have a male

1221
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.929
biological sex, OK. But if you're just an autogynophile,

1222
01:03:42.979 --> 01:03:45.040
you don't have either. You don't have to have

1223
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.959
any gender, and you don't have female sex, so

1224
01:03:46.959 --> 01:03:48.760
like, You know, why do you think that you

1225
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.020
can make other people call you a woman?

1226
01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:54.399
Yeah, because there are also people who talk about

1227
01:03:55.199 --> 01:04:01.080
a social transition, uh socially transitioning, and so, um,

1228
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:06.030
they say that. I, I mean, you basically should

1229
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:09.830
be called a woman or a man if you

1230
01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:13.050
present yourself socially as such.

1231
01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:18.840
Yeah, um, I mean, I, that would be fine

1232
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.830
with me. I don't, I don't really care, but

1233
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.800
it's like if somebody asked me, well, is this

1234
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.280
person really in fact a woman, I, like, I'm

1235
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.479
gonna have to say no. Like, like if the

1236
01:04:28.479 --> 01:04:32.520
person is like, you know, an autogynophile, and like,

1237
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.939
and that's the reason for the transition. Um, MY

1238
01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.820
honest view is that they're not a woman, they're

1239
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.300
a man. Now, like, I don't care if they

1240
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.110
call themselves a woman, like, they're not upset about

1241
01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.300
that or whatever. Like they, they can do that

1242
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.939
if they want. And like, you know, and maybe

1243
01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:48.929
like, maybe it would be nice and polite to

1244
01:04:48.929 --> 01:04:52.219
pretend that you think they're a woman, right? OK.

1245
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:53.939
But also, like, I think they have no right

1246
01:04:53.939 --> 01:04:55.840
to get mad if somebody else doesn't believe them.

1247
01:04:56.959 --> 01:05:00.580
You know, And, and actually more generally, like, you

1248
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.780
don't really have a right to control other people's

1249
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.959
beliefs, so Um, if the other person doesn't believe

1250
01:05:06.959 --> 01:05:09.439
you, even though, even if they, even if they're

1251
01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:11.280
wrong, they still have the right to not believe

1252
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.560
you. It's like, you know, if somebody's, if somebody

1253
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.350
doesn't believe that I'm a man, even if they're

1254
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:21.280
like being totally irrational, like I, it's, it's within

1255
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.290
their rights. And you know, like there's no basis

1256
01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:25.570
for thinking that I'm not a man, but if

1257
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.169
somebody says I'm not a man, like I can't

1258
01:05:27.169 --> 01:05:29.919
really. I can't, I don't have any basis for

1259
01:05:29.919 --> 01:05:32.959
retaliating. I can say they're an asshole, whatever. I

1260
01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:35.500
can retaliate verbally, like that's what I can do,

1261
01:05:35.919 --> 01:05:37.979
right? But I shouldn't be trying to harm them

1262
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:41.250
in some substantial way. It's like, They can think

1263
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:42.030
what they think.

1264
01:05:43.469 --> 01:05:45.800
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we can control

1265
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.540
people's thoughts either way. So, uh, I mean, moving

1266
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:55.379
on to economic myths, you tackle generational wealth in

1267
01:05:55.379 --> 01:05:58.540
your book. So what do we know about it?

1268
01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.909
Most wealth due to inheritance, family connections, and luck,

1269
01:06:05.149 --> 01:06:08.820
or is it, or are there other factors, or

1270
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.669
other factors playing out here and how can we

1271
01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.570
know that? How do we know that?

1272
01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:17.669
Yeah, yeah, good question. No, there's a, there's substantial

1273
01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:20.219
upward mobility in our society. So like if you,

1274
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.159
if you track people over time, um, people who

1275
01:06:23.159 --> 01:06:26.149
start out in the bottom 20%, uh, you know.

1276
01:06:26.989 --> 01:06:29.300
Commonly move up. OK. And by the way, people

1277
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.360
just to be clear, you're focusing on the US,

1278
01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760
correct? Right, yeah,

1279
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.919
I only had statistics for the US, and people

1280
01:06:37.919 --> 01:06:39.280
who start out at the top, like in the

1281
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.479
top 20%, will commonly move down, right? It's not

1282
01:06:42.479 --> 01:06:44.000
like, you know, it's not like your birth is

1283
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.389
your destiny, um. Uh, THERE is a correlation between

1284
01:06:48.389 --> 01:06:52.669
parents' income and children's income, but that correlation appears

1285
01:06:52.669 --> 01:06:57.110
to be, um, entirely due to genetics and not

1286
01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:00.510
to environment. And we know this from, uh, adoption

1287
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.989
studies. So like, um, the correlation goes away for

1288
01:07:04.989 --> 01:07:08.300
adopted children, roughly speaking. There's like a Korean adoption

1289
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.370
study where American families adopted Korean children. Right? And

1290
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:15.120
then it turned out that um that raises the

1291
01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.040
correlation between parents' income and children's income.

1292
01:07:18.899 --> 01:07:22.500
So, but genetics that would manifest in terms of

1293
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.300
what, in terms of intelligence and IQ for example,

1294
01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:26.540
or other factors.

1295
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.580
Right, yeah, so, yeah, so intelligence is one of

1296
01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.979
the major factors in just your success in life

1297
01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:35.500
in general and making income. Um, THERE'S also conscientiousness,

1298
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.979
just this personality trait, um, uh, that, you know,

1299
01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.530
that's the other important one. And, um, that's probably

1300
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:47.310
partly genetic. OK, but so, um, Oh, yeah. And

1301
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:50.270
where, where does most wealth come from? Uh, WELL,

1302
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.949
actually, no, it did not come from inheritance. So

1303
01:07:51.949 --> 01:07:54.550
like the left wing theory is, yeah, there's just

1304
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:56.790
this generational wealth, and people just like, you know,

1305
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:58.419
somebody got rich a long time ago, and then

1306
01:07:58.419 --> 01:08:00.229
they just pass it down, and then like when,

1307
01:08:00.429 --> 01:08:02.060
when their kids inherit the wealth, and it's easier

1308
01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.229
to get more wealth and so on. No, that's

1309
01:08:04.229 --> 01:08:06.189
not the way that works, actually. Like if you

1310
01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:08.909
inherit a huge fortune from your parents, you'll probably

1311
01:08:08.909 --> 01:08:10.949
waste most of it, and then your kids will

1312
01:08:10.949 --> 01:08:12.649
get a much smaller fortune and it's going to

1313
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:14.830
It's going to peter out. OK, that's what usually

1314
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:20.229
happens. Actually, most, um, most millionaires got, got to

1315
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.990
be millionaires by just regular saving and investment over

1316
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.350
a long period of time. And we know that

1317
01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:31.508
from surveys. So, um, And, you know, there's like,

1318
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:34.957
there's just like data on uh how much, how

1319
01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:37.488
much like most millionaires have inherited, and, you know,

1320
01:08:37.608 --> 01:08:39.249
it's a, it's a modest amount. Uh, I think

1321
01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:43.038
most of them have inherited nothing. Right, Most of

1322
01:08:43.038 --> 01:08:45.538
the people who report being millionaires have zero inheritance

1323
01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:49.089
thus far. Right? And so like, yeah, yeah, you

1324
01:08:49.089 --> 01:08:51.390
know, you want to get rich, OK, like, um,

1325
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:55.620
well, be smart, be hardworking, and save money over,

1326
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.529
you know, a couple decades. That's what you do.

1327
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:02.270
Oh, OK, but at a certain point in the

1328
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.629
book, and, and this is an actual quote from

1329
01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:08.350
your book, you say that the quote, the richest

1330
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:13.290
1% of Americans have in fact inherited an average

1331
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:21.549
of $719,000. I, I mean, if that's correct, isn't

1332
01:09:21.549 --> 01:09:23.790
that still quite a lot of money?

1333
01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:28.028
Uh, $700,000 is a lot for most people, but,

1334
01:09:28.048 --> 01:09:30.249
uh, it's a tiny, it's a small fraction of

1335
01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:32.068
the amount of money that those people actually have,

1336
01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.408
right? Like they did not inherit most of their

1337
01:09:34.408 --> 01:09:37.898
money, they earned most of their money. So,

1338
01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:41.938
uh, oh, OK, but someone, uh, probably would say,

1339
01:09:42.008 --> 01:09:47.948
OK, so they inherited that money, $700,000 they start

1340
01:09:48.127 --> 01:09:52.188
with a huge advantage in terms of their wealth

1341
01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.788
accumulation, right.

1342
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.339
Um, YEAH, you know, definitely an advantage to and

1343
01:09:57.339 --> 01:10:00.490
have some starting money, right? Um, BUT, you know,

1344
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.450
like you give, if you give most people $700,000

1345
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:05.779
they're not gonna do anything interesting with it. They're

1346
01:10:05.779 --> 01:10:08.140
going to spend it. Like they're, they're not gonna

1347
01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.100
turn, they're not going to turn it into $10

1348
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.470
million. Right, like, you know, all the people are

1349
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.149
like complaining about how they're poor and their parents

1350
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:18.430
were poor. Like, if you give them $700,000 see

1351
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:21.959
what they do with it. And, you know, OK,

1352
01:10:22.169 --> 01:10:23.680
you know, you may not know this, like if

1353
01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.240
you haven't met a lot of people, but, you

1354
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.259
know, just like you get enough experience with people,

1355
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.350
you're gonna realize that this is true. The vast

1356
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.479
majority of people would just like waste it within

1357
01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:36.129
a few years or whatever. Um. And you know,

1358
01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.779
they would not turn into a great fortune.

1359
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:44.529
So another related point that you tackle in the

1360
01:10:44.529 --> 01:10:49.209
book has to do with whether rich people are

1361
01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:54.290
paying a fair share of taxes. I mean, whether

1362
01:10:54.290 --> 01:11:00.370
it is through Uh, generational wealth or through those

1363
01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:04.370
kinds of psychological factors that play a role in

1364
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:10.089
how successful people get, uh, financially speaking. I mean,

1365
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:14.140
how do we determine whether they are really paying

1366
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.450
a fair share of taxes? What does that mean?

1367
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:19.890
Yeah, yeah, hard to say what is a fair

1368
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.649
share, right? That's sort of like a, I don't

1369
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:25.049
know, um, matter of opinion, matter of debate. Um,

1370
01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:27.089
BUT, you know, here's a thought experiment. Say like

1371
01:11:27.089 --> 01:11:28.939
there are 5 people who go out for dinner,

1372
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.729
and, um, you know, it's a, it's a cheap

1373
01:11:32.729 --> 01:11:36.319
dinner, so the bill comes and it's $100. And,

1374
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:38.089
you know, you think, OK, what would be the

1375
01:11:38.089 --> 01:11:41.180
fair way of dividing up this bill? Uh, YOU

1376
01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.299
know, that's supposed to be analogous to like, um,

1377
01:11:43.419 --> 01:11:44.930
you know, the bill for the government, right? The

1378
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:47.419
government's budget, who, you know, who should pay how

1379
01:11:47.419 --> 01:11:50.060
much of the budget. Um, AND, you know, one

1380
01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:54.399
thought might be, everybody pays $20 divided evenly. Another

1381
01:11:54.399 --> 01:11:56.709
thought would be, well, maybe everybody pays for what

1382
01:11:56.709 --> 01:12:00.410
they themselves ate at the dinner. OK. Yeah, these

1383
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:02.439
would be kind of like intuitive notions of fairness.

1384
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.290
But uh if you look at either of these,

1385
01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:08.890
then the rich in America are paying vastly more

1386
01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:12.759
than their fair share. Right? Like, what's happening is,

1387
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.640
uh, roughly the bottom 40% are paying nothing. Like

1388
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:21.020
they're, they're getting Um, kickbacks. So they're getting, they're

1389
01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.459
getting, um, benefits from the government that are greater

1390
01:12:23.459 --> 01:12:25.100
than the amount of money that they're paying in.

1391
01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.379
So, in effect, they're paying a negative amount of

1392
01:12:27.379 --> 01:12:30.390
the bill. And then, like almost all the bills

1393
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:33.640
being paid by the top 20%. Right. So it's

1394
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.240
like you're at this, you're at this dinner, and

1395
01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.410
like, you know, two of the people say, um,

1396
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.399
they want to get money back. They don't want

1397
01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:43.359
to pay any of the bill. They want other

1398
01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.879
people to pay them for having the dinner. And

1399
01:12:45.879 --> 01:12:47.560
then there's like one person who pays almost nothing,

1400
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.069
and then there's one person who pays roughly 20%,

1401
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.439
and somewhere roughly the amount, you know, the equal

1402
01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:55.919
amount. And then there's like one other person who

1403
01:12:55.919 --> 01:12:58.910
has to pay. For everybody else. It has to

1404
01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:00.709
pay for the entire shortfall, which is a huge

1405
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:03.430
shortfall. That's our system. And then, OK, and then

1406
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.669
the other 4 people start loudly complaining that that

1407
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:07.790
one person who paid for almost everyone is not

1408
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.950
paying his fair share. OK, cause that's the situation

1409
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:11.549
in America.

1410
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:17.330
Oh, OK, but I, I mean, looking at uh

1411
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:24.529
statistics related to, I mean, economic inequality, wouldn't that,

1412
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:29.770
would that, wouldn't that also uh weigh in on

1413
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:34.009
how we determine whether rich people are paying their

1414
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:38.479
fair share of taxes? I mean, because if the,

1415
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:45.259
let's say the richest 1%. Own uh uh 60%

1416
01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:48.899
of uh the, the, the eco the economy or

1417
01:13:48.899 --> 01:13:50.850
something. I, I mean, I don't know the exact

1418
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.740
number. I'm just inventing a number here and the

1419
01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.140
others, uh, have, uh, I mean, basically you have

1420
01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.660
to share the other 40% of the economy amongst

1421
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.930
themselves. I mean, wouldn't you say that that's an

1422
01:14:04.234 --> 01:14:08.415
Fair, whatever the reason, uh, that, uh, happened.

1423
01:14:08.995 --> 01:14:12.314
Uh, NO, no, I would not say that. So

1424
01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:15.475
like, well, what if, and, uh, I don't know

1425
01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:17.714
what the numbers are either, OK. But anyway, so

1426
01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:19.495
you're, you know, you're at that dinner and like,

1427
01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:21.674
uh, there's this one person, and, you know, the

1428
01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:23.354
other people, the other 4 people want this one

1429
01:14:23.354 --> 01:14:25.834
person to pay for almost all of the bill,

1430
01:14:25.955 --> 01:14:29.714
right? OK. Um, AND he's like, no, that doesn't

1431
01:14:29.714 --> 01:14:31.515
seem fair to me. And then they say, well,

1432
01:14:31.595 --> 01:14:33.424
but you have more money than the rest of

1433
01:14:33.424 --> 01:14:38.160
us. So that's why you should pay. Now, like

1434
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.910
that would not normally fly, right? Like you would

1435
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.549
not think, well, just because he has more money,

1436
01:14:42.589 --> 01:14:44.109
that means that it's fair for him to have

1437
01:14:44.109 --> 01:14:47.549
to pay for everyone else. And now, OK, now

1438
01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:48.620
if the way that he got the money was

1439
01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.990
that he stole it from the other people, then

1440
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.870
maybe, yeah, right. Although, like, just how much of

1441
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.899
the bill he has to pay is a separate

1442
01:14:55.899 --> 01:14:57.350
issue. You just like say, well, he has to

1443
01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.790
return the money then, and then just paying even

1444
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:04.060
share of the bill, OK. OK, but anyway, what

1445
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.299
if the reason that that one person has more

1446
01:15:06.299 --> 01:15:09.529
money is that, well, he's like created more wealth.

1447
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.379
Like, what if he actually created um the meal

1448
01:15:13.379 --> 01:15:17.290
that they just had? And then, and like, and

1449
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:19.529
then they're all just like, oh, but you had

1450
01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:21.370
all this food to begin with, it's so unfair.

1451
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:22.850
And the reason he had the food was that

1452
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:27.339
he grew the food and prepared it. OK, because

1453
01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:29.850
I think that's basically the situation, right? They're the

1454
01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:33.020
people who are contributing an enormous amount to the

1455
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.770
productivity of society, and then those people get rich,

1456
01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:37.959
and then other people start complaining that they're rich.

1457
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.250
Like the reason why they're rich is that they

1458
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:45.180
contributed, like they, they were productive. And and then

1459
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.370
there are a bunch of people who are being

1460
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:48.759
unproductive and who are complaining about the productive people

1461
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.020
having more money than them.

1462
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.660
OK, but, but since we're talking fairness here, someone,

1463
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:59.959
a socialist, for example, might argue, oh, OK, you

1464
01:15:59.959 --> 01:16:02.930
say that they are, they earn, uh, they earn

1465
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.479
that money because they are more productive, but in

1466
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:12.319
fact, It's uh their workers, the collective of workers

1467
01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:17.100
that are uh uh that are being productive, I

1468
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:21.259
mean that are producing the the really valuable, valuable

1469
01:16:21.259 --> 01:16:26.259
things, and then he's just extracting money from their

1470
01:16:26.259 --> 01:16:29.120
work. I mean, what, what would you make of

1471
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:29.979
such an argument?

1472
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.600
Yeah, so everybody who's participating in a business is

1473
01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:37.939
being productive, you know, by default, unless there's something

1474
01:16:37.939 --> 01:16:40.220
weird going on, right? But normally, everyone is being

1475
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.060
productive because otherwise they wouldn't be working for the

1476
01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.419
business. Now, that does include the workers, but it

1477
01:16:45.419 --> 01:16:49.259
also includes the managers and includes investors who provided

1478
01:16:49.259 --> 01:16:51.100
the capital to start the business and things like

1479
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.140
that. OK. It's just that, um, you know, a

1480
01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.350
bunch of socialists don't understand this, and they only

1481
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.270
see the people who are doing like physical labor

1482
01:16:59.270 --> 01:17:01.750
on an assembly line as being productive, and they're

1483
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.509
not seeing the productivity of other sort of less

1484
01:17:04.509 --> 01:17:07.750
tangible contributions, right? But like, if there's somebody who

1485
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:10.089
is figuring out what the business should be doing,

1486
01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:12.689
somebody who took the initiative to start the business,

1487
01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.859
and is deciding what products it should be making,

1488
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:16.470
and like where it should try to sell them,

1489
01:17:16.509 --> 01:17:19.069
and it's, you know, all, all the, what the

1490
01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:20.750
policy should be, like, all that has to be

1491
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.919
done. If nobody does that, there's no business and

1492
01:17:23.919 --> 01:17:26.970
there's no productivity. So that person is also being

1493
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.890
productive. OK. So then you might ask, OK, yeah,

1494
01:17:30.009 --> 01:17:32.290
sure, they're being productive, but how productive are they

1495
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:34.439
being as productive as the people who are physically

1496
01:17:34.439 --> 01:17:37.890
assembling the goods? Well, like the way that you

1497
01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.649
measure that, like if you're an economist, the way

1498
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:41.689
that you would measure that is probably um their

1499
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:45.609
marginal productivity, which is to say, if you subtract

1500
01:17:45.609 --> 01:17:49.160
one person from the business without replacing them, how

1501
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.169
much does the productivity of the business go down?

1502
01:17:52.009 --> 01:17:53.959
So, if, or, you know, how much does the

1503
01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:56.439
productivity of society go down? OK. So if you

1504
01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:59.919
subtract one blue collar worker from the economy, how

1505
01:17:59.919 --> 01:18:03.049
much does that reduce overall productivity? OK, a little

1506
01:18:03.049 --> 01:18:05.689
bit. And then if you subtract one capitalist from

1507
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:08.209
the society, and you know, like a person who

1508
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:10.529
provides capital to startup businesses, you subtract that from

1509
01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:13.330
the economy, how much does that reduce productivity? Well,

1510
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:17.250
it's, it's a lot more. Right, because that person

1511
01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.830
is affecting the productive activities of many other people.

1512
01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.390
Right, so like if I start a business, that

1513
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:26.830
causes many other people to start doing things in

1514
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:30.220
that business which are productive. Right? And so it,

1515
01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:32.490
it's not implausible that the person who starts a

1516
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:35.509
business could actually be 100 times more productive than

1517
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:39.089
an individual worker who works for that business, right?

1518
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.069
OK, so let's move on to some other myths,

1519
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.689
in this case, science, uh, myths related to science

1520
01:18:48.689 --> 01:18:54.509
or how we should approach science and scientific consensus

1521
01:18:54.509 --> 01:18:56.689
and things like that. So, uh, first of all,

1522
01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:59.600
let me Ask you, do you think that uh

1523
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.160
people should say that we should trust science? I

1524
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.200
mean, is science something that uh people should trust

1525
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:13.200
or should we use some other verb here?

1526
01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:17.700
Well, like, you have to sort of like clarify

1527
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.459
what it means to trust science, right? You can't

1528
01:19:21.459 --> 01:19:25.060
really trust science, you can trust a person. Right?

1529
01:19:25.109 --> 01:19:27.810
Or you can trust statements that you hear. And,

1530
01:19:27.859 --> 01:19:29.540
so the people who are saying trust the science,

1531
01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.479
what they actually mean is trust the people who

1532
01:19:32.479 --> 01:19:35.939
are telling you that something was scientifically established, right?

1533
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.180
Or trust the assertions that are made about what

1534
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.959
science shows. And that sounds a lot less obvious,

1535
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.500
right? OK, so like the scientific method is a

1536
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.189
good way of trying to find stuff out. But

1537
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.419
is this a good method? Um, BELIEVING whatever somebody

1538
01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:54.899
else tells you has been scientifically established. That's a

1539
01:19:54.899 --> 01:19:58.540
lot less of an impressive method, OK? Because one

1540
01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.339
of the problems is that, well, the people who

1541
01:20:00.339 --> 01:20:02.660
are telling you what science shows may not themselves

1542
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.520
know. Like, often it's journalists who don't actually understand

1543
01:20:06.899 --> 01:20:10.560
science, OK? And, you know, they may not even,

1544
01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.930
they may not understand what a scientist told them,

1545
01:20:13.279 --> 01:20:17.740
or they may just like, they may not even

1546
01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.779
be listening to the scientists. They might be listening

1547
01:20:19.779 --> 01:20:21.500
to political activists, OK.

1548
01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:26.330
And, and what if, if it's the expert, him

1549
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:29.509
or herself, what if, if, if it's the actual

1550
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.129
scientist communicating the information?

1551
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:36.569
Yeah, so, you know, usually, um, like we have,

1552
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:41.049
we have well developed sciences where, um, most people

1553
01:20:41.049 --> 01:20:44.359
cannot acquire expertise about it. So like their best

1554
01:20:44.359 --> 01:20:46.240
bet, if they have to make a judgment, I

1555
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.009
mean, you know, you could suspend judgment about the

1556
01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:50.120
things that you don't have expertise about. But if

1557
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.600
there's some reason why you need to have a

1558
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.080
belief about it or want to have a belief

1559
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.319
about it, you know, your best bet is usually

1560
01:20:56.319 --> 01:20:58.779
to try to figure out what most experts think.

1561
01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.000
OK, so like, I'm not an expert on biology,

1562
01:21:02.109 --> 01:21:04.279
but I know that most biologists believe the theory

1563
01:21:04.279 --> 01:21:06.399
of evolution, so I believe it. And that's the

1564
01:21:06.399 --> 01:21:08.740
main reason I believe it. I have an idea

1565
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.060
of what the evidence is, but I haven't verified

1566
01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.299
that evidence for myself. I just know that people

1567
01:21:13.299 --> 01:21:14.740
say that this is the evidence that we have,

1568
01:21:14.799 --> 01:21:17.770
and it sounds good. OK. And I, and, but

1569
01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:20.490
more importantly, I know that virtually every biologist agrees

1570
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:24.310
with evolution, so that's probably true. OK, but you

1571
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:25.669
know, um, you don't want to just like go

1572
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:28.310
with one person, right? If you just like met

1573
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.029
one scientist and he says X, well, you know,

1574
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:32.950
you want to know if other scientists also agree

1575
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:33.310
with that.

1576
01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:38.100
Oh, OK, but, but then, I mean, about uh

1577
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:43.779
knowing that many scientists agree with the particular claim,

1578
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.100
um, does then consensus matter in science because for

1579
01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.720
example, in the book you talk about that figure

1580
01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.194
that some people use of. Uh, AND, uh, you

1581
01:21:56.194 --> 01:21:59.194
can tell us where it comes from of 99%

1582
01:21:59.194 --> 01:22:04.895
of climate scientists agreeing that, uh, climate change, uh,

1583
01:22:04.915 --> 01:22:08.064
is a thing and it, that it is man-made.

1584
01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:12.535
Uh, SO, uh, what do, how should we approach

1585
01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:15.274
scientific consensus then?

1586
01:22:15.634 --> 01:22:18.595
Yeah, so, yeah, unfortunately, the, the issue has become

1587
01:22:18.595 --> 01:22:21.555
politicized as a result of which you can't really

1588
01:22:21.555 --> 01:22:24.129
trust the things that people tell you. OK. So

1589
01:22:24.129 --> 01:22:27.169
you hear, like there are people saying, 0, 97%

1590
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:30.229
of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made.

1591
01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:32.890
Uh, THERE'S, you know, one version of it is

1592
01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:35.609
they agree that human activity is the main cause

1593
01:22:35.609 --> 01:22:38.209
of global warming. Another version is they agree that

1594
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:41.330
human activity is one cause of global warming. By

1595
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:45.250
the way, that's importantly different. OK. Um, BUT it

1596
01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:47.330
turns out that, oh, where did that come from?

1597
01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:49.689
So it came from, there's an academic paper that

1598
01:22:49.689 --> 01:22:53.540
says that they surveyed abstracts of um papers in

1599
01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.930
climate science. They had like thousands of abstracts, and

1600
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.649
they didn't read the whole papers, they just looked

1601
01:22:58.649 --> 01:23:00.729
at the abstracts. And then they looked for ones

1602
01:23:00.729 --> 01:23:02.569
where the abstract appeared to take a position on

1603
01:23:02.569 --> 01:23:06.830
anthropogenic global warming, right? Like man-made global warming. OK.

1604
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:10.049
And it turned out that actually, um, the majority

1605
01:23:10.049 --> 01:23:13.709
of the majority of these abstracts did not take

1606
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:17.029
any position on that. They didn't like, they didn't

1607
01:23:17.029 --> 01:23:20.140
apparently say whether they thought that it was man-made

1608
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.410
or not. But the people writing this paper just

1609
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:26.600
excluded all of those. And they only looked at

1610
01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.680
the ones where it looked like the abstract did,

1611
01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:31.479
did take a position on whether it was man-made.

1612
01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:35.759
And then among those, 97% of them implied that

1613
01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:38.189
human activity was at least part of the cause,

1614
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.520
not that it was the main cause, and at

1615
01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.120
least part of the cause. OK. Now, that is

1616
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.000
not an adequate methodology because for one thing, um,

1617
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.240
it could be that the papers that don't take

1618
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.879
a position are disproportionately likely to be people who

1619
01:23:52.879 --> 01:23:55.910
don't have a position. Like it could be that

1620
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:58.149
the reason why all these abstracts were not taking

1621
01:23:58.149 --> 01:24:00.109
a position on anthropogenic global warming is that the

1622
01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:03.990
scientists didn't know whether it was anthropogenic. So then

1623
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:06.870
if you can't then report, 97% of people agree

1624
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:09.529
that it is. You see what I mean? OK.

1625
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:12.430
In, um, in the same year that that paper

1626
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.149
was published, which I think was 2013, uh, somebody

1627
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:18.729
actually did a survey of the American Meteorological Society.

1628
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.629
Um, AND in that survey, about 50% of the

1629
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:25.120
people said that they agreed that global warming was

1630
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.629
man-made. OK, and then it was like 70% among

1631
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:32.240
climate specialists. OK, so that's a lot less than

1632
01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.700
97%. Right. And by the way, that's a better

1633
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:39.180
methodology, right? Right. The other thing, um, you know,

1634
01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:41.459
the other thing is like, well, surveying abstracts isn't

1635
01:24:41.459 --> 01:24:45.140
the same as surveying scientists. Right? Like it could

1636
01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:47.580
be that the people who believe in anthropogenic global

1637
01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.339
warming are more likely to publish papers. So then

1638
01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:52.850
that would skew the results. So a better methodology

1639
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:55.359
is to just survey a bunch of meteorologists.

1640
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.950
OK, but then what should people do with all

1641
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:02.830
of that information? I mean, since, as you said

1642
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:05.790
that it's of course a very reasonable point to

1643
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:09.589
make that the vast, vast majority of people do

1644
01:25:09.589 --> 01:25:14.330
not have enough expertise or even time to evaluate

1645
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:20.359
the evidence themselves. Uh, HEARING about those figures, about

1646
01:25:20.359 --> 01:25:25.560
a certain percentage of climate scientists that think that

1647
01:25:25.569 --> 01:25:30.959
climate change is due to man-made activity, uh, uh,

1648
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:33.890
uh, I, I mean, what should people make of

1649
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:34.490
that then?

1650
01:25:34.919 --> 01:25:37.390
Yeah, yeah, good. So, yeah, so, well, it's still

1651
01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.890
probably true, right? It's just not as overwhelming as

1652
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:44.950
it's being portrayed by the political activists, right? So,

1653
01:25:45.029 --> 01:25:47.549
um, I think there's widespread agreement that there is

1654
01:25:47.549 --> 01:25:50.790
global warming, like temperatures have gone up, um, you

1655
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:53.740
know, a little over one °C since the start

1656
01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:57.970
of the industrial revolution. Um, Yeah, I've forgotten how

1657
01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:02.109
much exactly, but anyway, OK. Um. So temperature probably

1658
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:04.229
has gone up, and then, you know, majority of

1659
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:06.950
the climate scientists think that human beings are at

1660
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:08.669
least part of the cause, a significant part of

1661
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:12.259
the cause. So that's probably true. Uh, YOU know,

1662
01:26:12.399 --> 01:26:14.899
so, but it wouldn't be totally shocking if that

1663
01:26:14.899 --> 01:26:17.379
turned out to be false, right? Like it would

1664
01:26:17.379 --> 01:26:20.140
be shocking if 97% or 99% of the climate

1665
01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:23.109
scientists were wrong. It wouldn't be shocking if 70%

1666
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:24.870
of them were wrong, and the other, you know,

1667
01:26:25.779 --> 01:26:28.220
whatever, 10% were right or something like that. That

1668
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:29.770
wouldn't be totally shocking, like stuff like that has

1669
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:33.240
happened in the history of science. Um, SO, OK.

1670
01:26:33.379 --> 01:26:35.970
Um, uh, THE other thing is, OK, so like,

1671
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.299
you know, human beings are contributing to warming the

1672
01:26:39.299 --> 01:26:42.160
planet. Um, THE other, another thing that people say

1673
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.819
is, oh, it's going to kill all of us.

1674
01:26:45.209 --> 01:26:48.140
Like I've heard this, I've heard this from students

1675
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.439
who are under the impression that, uh, like climate

1676
01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:56.040
scientists agree that the entire human species is in

1677
01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.359
danger of going extinct because of a phenomenon that

1678
01:26:59.359 --> 01:27:02.919
increased temperatures by 1 degree in the last 150

1679
01:27:02.919 --> 01:27:05.779
years. Like, like, yeah, that's going to kill everyone.

1680
01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.919
And just like as a sort of initial reality

1681
01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:12.040
check, that doesn't seem very plausible. OK. But then

1682
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.430
if you look at what actual climate scientists say,

1683
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:19.919
like virtually none of them say that. They, they

1684
01:27:19.919 --> 01:27:21.600
do say things like, well, there's going to be

1685
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.319
more flooding in coastal areas. Um, YOU know, there's

1686
01:27:25.319 --> 01:27:28.029
probably gonna be more deaths due to heat. Right,

1687
01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.720
you know, sometimes people die of heat stroke and

1688
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.830
things like that. So there's gonna be increases that.

1689
01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.839
There's gonna be increases in malaria in someplace. They

1690
01:27:33.839 --> 01:27:35.439
say stuff like that. They don't say everyone is

1691
01:27:35.439 --> 01:27:36.060
going to die.

1692
01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:41.509
Yeah And I mean, where do you think that

1693
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.089
that claim, like you said, that scientists say that

1694
01:27:45.089 --> 01:27:48.689
global warming is likely to destroy civilization if we

1695
01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:52.089
don't take drastic action very soon? I mean, that

1696
01:27:52.089 --> 01:27:54.229
kind of claim, where do you think it comes

1697
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:57.330
from? Is it from activists or someone

1698
01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:01.250
else? Yeah, it's, it's political activists, right? Political activists

1699
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:03.490
who don't know what they're talking about and, you

1700
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:06.180
know, maybe they're just liars. Um, THEY'RE, you know,

1701
01:28:06.259 --> 01:28:08.359
there aren't liars or they just don't understand, OK.

1702
01:28:08.899 --> 01:28:11.410
But, um, you know, there's this, there's this thing

1703
01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:15.549
where Greta Thunberg said, um, It's something like, you

1704
01:28:15.549 --> 01:28:18.509
know, we had 12 years to stop global warming

1705
01:28:18.509 --> 01:28:19.830
or it would probably lead to the end of

1706
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:23.589
civilization, then AOC said something like that also. Um,

1707
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:28.669
AOC, uh, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from wherever it

1708
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:32.390
is. Anyway, you know, left-wing congressman, um, she probably

1709
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:37.029
got it from Greta Thunberg. Greta Thunberg, apparently, um,

1710
01:28:38.009 --> 01:28:39.399
Got it or thought that she got it from

1711
01:28:39.399 --> 01:28:42.569
an IPCC report. It was an IPCC report that

1712
01:28:42.569 --> 01:28:45.979
said, you know, we've got to drastically curtail CO2

1713
01:28:45.979 --> 01:28:49.370
emissions within 12 years if we are going to

1714
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:51.410
stop, if we're going to keep global warming under

1715
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:56.370
1.5 degrees C relative to pre-industrial levels, and we

1716
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:59.569
were already, we're already at 1 degree. OK, so

1717
01:28:59.569 --> 01:29:01.689
to prevent another half degree of warming, we would

1718
01:29:01.689 --> 01:29:05.549
have to drastically curtail within 12 years. OK. They

1719
01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.549
never said that the failure to do so would

1720
01:29:07.549 --> 01:29:10.259
result in the destruction of civilization, either then or

1721
01:29:10.259 --> 01:29:14.569
ever, not in 12 years or ever. OK, so

1722
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:18.299
I don't know, and it just looks like the

1723
01:29:18.299 --> 01:29:20.830
activists didn't like look at the actual report. They

1724
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:22.709
heard that there was a 12-year time limit or

1725
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:26.080
something. Right, but they didn't, they didn't get what

1726
01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.209
it was a limit for.

1727
01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.330
Oh, OK, but, but then let me ask you,

1728
01:29:30.569 --> 01:29:33.419
and uh, I understand perfectly well that as a

1729
01:29:33.419 --> 01:29:38.299
philosopher, you're interested in, uh, people telling the truth,

1730
01:29:38.459 --> 01:29:43.459
people telling things as they are, and the epistemic

1731
01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:47.225
value of claims. But do you think that Uh,

1732
01:29:47.254 --> 01:29:54.115
climate activists exaggerating the potential consequences of climate change

1733
01:29:54.575 --> 01:29:59.245
might have some political value in, in terms of

1734
01:29:59.254 --> 01:30:04.015
trying to raise people's awareness of the, of climate

1735
01:30:04.015 --> 01:30:04.455
change.

1736
01:30:04.895 --> 01:30:06.084
Yeah, I mean this is what a lot of

1737
01:30:06.084 --> 01:30:08.615
activists think that, well, if we just tell the

1738
01:30:08.615 --> 01:30:12.770
truth, then people won't take action. If we just

1739
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:15.529
say like, well, there's going to be a moderately

1740
01:30:15.529 --> 01:30:18.049
serious global problem that's, you know, in line with

1741
01:30:18.049 --> 01:30:20.569
like 10 other global problems, then people won't do

1742
01:30:20.569 --> 01:30:22.649
anything about it. OK. So we have to like

1743
01:30:22.649 --> 01:30:24.649
vastly exaggerate it so that we can get people

1744
01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:26.250
alarmed so that then they will make the government

1745
01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:29.529
do something. But the problem is, we have limited

1746
01:30:29.529 --> 01:30:33.490
resources. We can't address every problem, and we won't

1747
01:30:33.490 --> 01:30:36.450
address every problem. So we need to direct our

1748
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:39.669
resources to the biggest problems. And if you have

1749
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:41.950
this thing that's like number 50 on the list

1750
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:43.910
of problems, and you promote it so that everyone

1751
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:47.169
thinks it's number 1, that means that you're taking

1752
01:30:47.169 --> 01:30:49.910
resources away from much more serious problems that need

1753
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:52.950
to be fixed. We could address malaria, like that

1754
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:57.810
would be an easier intervention, like, You know, the

1755
01:30:57.810 --> 01:30:59.620
bunch of people who are dying from malaria or

1756
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.189
tuberculosis, like, it's much cheaper to save lives from

1757
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:06.109
that than it is to save lives by trying

1758
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:08.759
to stop global warming. You try to stop global

1759
01:31:08.759 --> 01:31:10.720
warming, like you're going to spend trillions of dollars

1760
01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.620
and it's just going to slow it down a

1761
01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:16.259
little bit. OK. But like we, we know really

1762
01:31:16.259 --> 01:31:18.459
effective ways of stopping some of these other problems.

1763
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:22.979
So, you know, like insecticide treated um mosquito nets,

1764
01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.660
OK? Because malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.

1765
01:31:26.029 --> 01:31:29.100
Right. So, uh, now let me just ask you

1766
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:34.160
a few more general questions not related to specific

1767
01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:38.140
political myths, but do you think that the political

1768
01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:43.549
myths nowadays are more widespread than they were before?

1769
01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:47.720
And if so, what do you think are the

1770
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.419
causes behind it?

1771
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:52.890
Yeah, it seems like they are. It seems like

1772
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:55.890
there's more political BS going around. Um, IT seems

1773
01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:57.490
to have something to do with the internet and

1774
01:31:57.490 --> 01:32:00.370
social media. Right? So what has happened in the

1775
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:04.970
past, whatever, couple of decades is, um, everyone gets

1776
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:07.890
a voice. So like, it used to be that,

1777
01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.930
um, we had a small number of news sources

1778
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:13.529
that would give people information about the current state

1779
01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:16.839
of our society. And then like, well, yeah, pretty

1780
01:32:16.839 --> 01:32:20.790
much everyone would have pretty similar information. But now

1781
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:22.750
we have this situation where, like, you know, a

1782
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:26.109
14-year-old with an internet connection can like start posting

1783
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:28.290
content that could be seen by millions of people.

1784
01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:31.450
And just, just like anybody can post whatever they

1785
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:33.779
want. And then, and then there's, and there's this

1786
01:32:33.779 --> 01:32:37.870
kind of competition. Right, so, you know, it's like

1787
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:40.540
not only that there is. This sort of like

1788
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.259
this openness for anybody to say anything, but like

1789
01:32:43.259 --> 01:32:46.549
we have these algorithms which will promote the content

1790
01:32:46.549 --> 01:32:50.810
that's most engaging. OK. So there's this competition among

1791
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:54.180
providers to find the most engaging content. Like, there

1792
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.569
are a bunch of people who just want to

1793
01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.490
get as many clicks and as many likes as

1794
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.410
possible. They might get paid more for that, or

1795
01:32:59.410 --> 01:33:00.850
they might just get like an ego boost from

1796
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:04.169
that. And it turns out that the way of

1797
01:33:04.169 --> 01:33:06.729
getting the most engagement or like the way of

1798
01:33:06.729 --> 01:33:09.640
attracting the most attention is not to be the

1799
01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:13.080
most accurate. Like the stuff that attracts the most

1800
01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.580
attention is not the most accurate information. It's emotional

1801
01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:20.709
information, which is very frequently inaccurate. Like the like

1802
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:24.560
the way to get people most excited is frequently

1803
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:27.439
to lie. You're to say, to say that stuff's

1804
01:33:27.439 --> 01:33:29.359
happening, that's a lot more exciting than what's actually

1805
01:33:29.359 --> 01:33:29.640
happening.

1806
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.100
Uh, BUT do you look at misinformation and the

1807
01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:38.430
spread of misinformation, particularly on the internet and social

1808
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:43.060
media, as something dangerous, as a big problem as

1809
01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.770
some people make it out to be, because I,

1810
01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:50.560
I think it was in 2024. I can't remember

1811
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.279
exactly the international organization, but, but I think it

1812
01:33:54.279 --> 01:33:58.560
was the UN who put forth a list of

1813
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.000
the biggest problems that we had to deal with

1814
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.080
over the next few years, and misinformation came out

1815
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.899
number one. Uh, AHEAD of, I don't know, war,

1816
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:16.430
climate change, and stuff like that, but I, I

1817
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:18.609
mean, do, do you think that it is that

1818
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.609
serious?

1819
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:23.149
You know, it's really hard to estimate how big

1820
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:26.669
of a problem it is, because its impacts are

1821
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:29.879
hard to identify and they're indirect. So the effect

1822
01:34:29.879 --> 01:34:32.279
of, like the, you know, initially you might think,

1823
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:33.680
oh well, a bunch of people have false beliefs,

1824
01:34:33.759 --> 01:34:35.680
big deal. Like, how does that compare to like,

1825
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:38.279
you know, um, whatever, millions of people dying from

1826
01:34:38.279 --> 01:34:41.830
world poverty. How, how could you say that misinformation

1827
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:44.350
is above that? But I think the rationale would

1828
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:46.620
be, well, misinformation is preventing us from solving the

1829
01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.100
other problems. So like, we're not going to identify

1830
01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.779
what the problems are that we need to attend

1831
01:34:51.779 --> 01:34:55.140
to, nor what are the actual relevant facts about

1832
01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:57.339
those problems, if we have a bunch of people

1833
01:34:57.339 --> 01:35:01.049
just like lying about them, right? And so. And

1834
01:35:01.319 --> 01:35:04.319
so, you know, it's, it's not implausible that it's

1835
01:35:04.319 --> 01:35:06.270
a major problem. It's not implausible that it could

1836
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.580
actually be the top problem.

1837
01:35:08.759 --> 01:35:12.200
Because you think that perhaps misinformation would play a

1838
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.759
role in the other big problems that we have

1839
01:35:15.759 --> 01:35:17.140
to deal with. Is that?

1840
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:19.479
That's right. That's right, yeah. You know, cause us

1841
01:35:19.479 --> 01:35:22.439
to misallocate resources, cause us to adopt policies that

1842
01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:25.209
don't work. Because we have incorrect beliefs about the

1843
01:35:25.209 --> 01:35:26.629
nature of the problems, right?

1844
01:35:28.259 --> 01:35:31.299
OK, so, and do you think that political beliefs,

1845
01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.339
because those are the ones you focus on in

1846
01:35:33.339 --> 01:35:38.029
your book, are different from other sorts of beliefs.

1847
01:35:38.089 --> 01:35:42.100
I mean, are they, uh, epistemologically speaking, do you

1848
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.120
think that they are different from other beliefs?

1849
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.129
Well, um, so, well, and you know, I'm just

1850
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:52.419
trying to interpret the epistemologically speaking, uh, modify, or,

1851
01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:52.870
or, or,

1852
01:35:52.959 --> 01:35:55.379
or, oh, OK, OK, or perhaps let me put

1853
01:35:55.379 --> 01:35:58.759
it another way, uh, do you think that, uh,

1854
01:35:58.939 --> 01:36:05.000
the way that people, um, Deal psychologically with political

1855
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.200
beliefs that they are different from other kinds of

1856
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.790
beliefs that people might have. So instead of on

1857
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:14.950
the on the approaching it on a on an

1858
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:19.200
epistemological basis, let's perhaps do it on a psychological

1859
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:19.750
basis. Yeah,

1860
01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:22.089
yeah, yeah, I mean like the, the major difference

1861
01:36:22.089 --> 01:36:25.430
between political beliefs and most ordinary beliefs is, uh,

1862
01:36:25.439 --> 01:36:27.640
for most of your beliefs you bear the consequences

1863
01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.140
of error. So if you have incorrect beliefs about

1864
01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.439
your personal life, that is going to personally harm

1865
01:36:33.439 --> 01:36:36.459
you. Um, IF you, so I don't know, you're

1866
01:36:36.459 --> 01:36:38.620
considering a job offer, you want to have correct

1867
01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.299
beliefs about the terms of the job, and correct

1868
01:36:41.299 --> 01:36:42.660
beliefs about what the job is going to be

1869
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.930
like, you know. Um, IF you don't, then you're

1870
01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:47.810
going to pay the costs of having incorrect beliefs.

1871
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.609
But with political beliefs, um, the costs of being

1872
01:36:51.609 --> 01:36:53.700
wrong are mostly borne by other people, not by

1873
01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:56.879
you. Right. So like, uh, let's say I think

1874
01:36:56.879 --> 01:36:59.600
that immigration harms the economy. That's not what I

1875
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.879
think, but, you know, suppose I think that, um,

1876
01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.520
and I'm wrong about that, actually, it helps the

1877
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.600
economy. OK, so then what I do is I

1878
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.990
vote for anti-immigration politicians, and Like, I don't bear

1879
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:16.069
the cost of that. So the probability that I

1880
01:37:16.069 --> 01:37:18.149
actually make a difference to the outcome of an

1881
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:19.189
election is on the order of 1 in a

1882
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:20.939
million, 1 in 10 million, or something like that.

1883
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:24.229
So probably there will be no costs from me

1884
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:26.830
individually thinking that. But if there's like millions of

1885
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:28.310
people who think that, then it could be serious

1886
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:32.060
costs. OK. But You know, like, like, for me,

1887
01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.100
personally, I don't have any incentive to try to

1888
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.580
be more accurate because I know there's almost no

1889
01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:37.939
chance that I would actually make a difference in

1890
01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:39.939
policy. If I did make a difference in policy

1891
01:37:39.939 --> 01:37:42.979
in the one in a million chance, um, the

1892
01:37:42.979 --> 01:37:45.100
cost will be borne by me and the entire

1893
01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.740
rest of society. So I'm only going to bear

1894
01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.319
a tiny fraction of the cost. OK. And that's

1895
01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:51.339
why most people are not very careful about their

1896
01:37:51.339 --> 01:37:55.189
political beliefs. They don't care enough. To make sure

1897
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.500
that they're

1898
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.629
right. And do you think that there will be

1899
01:37:58.629 --> 01:38:02.830
anything that people could do to care more about

1900
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:06.850
their own political beliefs, and do you think that,

1901
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:10.549
I, I mean, how can we avoid the potential

1902
01:38:10.549 --> 01:38:13.750
harm of political myths?

1903
01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.370
Yeah, well, I don't know, so I don't, I

1904
01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:20.069
don't know if we can fix this problem, but

1905
01:38:20.169 --> 01:38:22.450
what I attempt to do is I try to

1906
01:38:22.450 --> 01:38:26.439
convince people that it's wrong to be irrational. Right,

1907
01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.839
and so even though to be, you know, irrational

1908
01:38:29.839 --> 01:38:31.700
and you're thinking about political matters,

1909
01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.000
but, but by wrong, do you mean epistemically wrong

1910
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.020
or also morally wrong?

1911
01:38:38.359 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah, morally wrong. Oh,

1912
01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:40.450
OK, OK,

1913
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.390
so, um. It's, yeah, it's not just that you'll

1914
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:45.100
have a false belief, it's that you're, you're being

1915
01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.470
immoral. And so even though it's not going to

1916
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:49.149
harm you personally, and it might be in your

1917
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:52.029
interests to be reckless about your political beliefs, um,

1918
01:38:52.069 --> 01:38:54.790
it's morally wrong. And why is that? Well, because

1919
01:38:54.790 --> 01:39:00.339
this is harming society. Now, you individually are. Only,

1920
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.839
only contributing a small amount or a small probability

1921
01:39:02.839 --> 01:39:06.600
of harming society, right? Although in that one in

1922
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.680
a million chance that you actually affect the outcome,

1923
01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.279
it would be a large harm that you cause.

1924
01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.959
But anyway, you individually are only contributing a small

1925
01:39:12.959 --> 01:39:15.009
amount to the harm, but it's like, it's part

1926
01:39:15.009 --> 01:39:17.759
of this larger phenomenon. You're being a part of

1927
01:39:17.759 --> 01:39:20.919
this larger social problem that's like a major problem

1928
01:39:20.919 --> 01:39:23.799
for society. Right? That, you know, we have bad

1929
01:39:23.799 --> 01:39:26.270
policy because we have a bunch of irrational beliefs

1930
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:28.669
about political issues. Uh, AND it's just wrong to

1931
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:30.029
contribute to that if you don't have a good

1932
01:39:30.029 --> 01:39:31.160
reason for contributing to it.

1933
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:34.330
So, one last question then, and I guess that

1934
01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:39.049
this ties to my previous question about uh trusting

1935
01:39:39.049 --> 01:39:43.189
science and when we also talked about trusting experts.

1936
01:39:43.649 --> 01:39:46.270
Uh, HOW do you think that people can find

1937
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:50.770
reliable sources of information? Because I mean nowadays, particularly

1938
01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:54.890
on the internet, there are so many bad and

1939
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:58.509
unreliable sources of information. So how can people find

1940
01:39:58.509 --> 01:39:59.450
the good ones?

1941
01:40:00.009 --> 01:40:02.009
Yeah. So, I mean, I think there's some kinds

1942
01:40:02.009 --> 01:40:04.169
of sources that are generally reliable that are sort

1943
01:40:04.169 --> 01:40:07.089
of, I don't know, like the canonical sources. So

1944
01:40:07.089 --> 01:40:09.520
like if you wanted to learn about a, um,

1945
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.729
a case that appeared in US courts, you can

1946
01:40:12.729 --> 01:40:16.330
get actual documents from the case. Like, you could

1947
01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:19.370
read the judge's report on why he made a

1948
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:21.290
decision or something like that. OK? And that will

1949
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:24.470
generally be accurate. Um, TAKE for example, the Michael

1950
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:26.109
Brown case where like there's a whole bunch of

1951
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:28.160
bullshit in the media about it, but you could

1952
01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.899
actually read the FBI report about it. They investigated

1953
01:40:31.899 --> 01:40:34.229
it and they interviewed like all the witnesses they

1954
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:36.500
could find, and they looked at the forensic evidence.

1955
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:37.950
Look at the report, you're going to find out

1956
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:39.580
the truth. You're going to find out what actually

1957
01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:43.200
happened. Um, ANOTHER thing is like for certain social

1958
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.240
issues, there'll be just like kind of official sources.

1959
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:49.319
So like, I think the FBI, um, crime statistics

1960
01:40:49.319 --> 01:40:52.379
are probably pretty reliable. Probably know what's going on.

1961
01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:54.680
Or, you know, uh, the Federal Reserve has a

1962
01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.069
bunch of economic statistics. They're probably like, they're not

1963
01:40:58.069 --> 01:41:02.319
partisan hacks, you know, they're not, they're not, yeah,

1964
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:05.240
they're not like producing propaganda for a particular um

1965
01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:08.149
political side. Uh, THE other thing is like, well,

1966
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:10.569
you could try to, you look for authors who

1967
01:41:10.569 --> 01:41:13.970
appear to be reliable. OK, so like, I think

1968
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:18.089
Scott Alexander, the blogger is um highly reliable, right?

1969
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:20.569
You know, not that he's always right, but he's

1970
01:41:20.569 --> 01:41:23.270
conscientious, you know, and he's, he's not a partisan

1971
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:25.479
hack. He's, he's not trying to produce propaganda, he's

1972
01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.609
trying his best to find out what happened. And

1973
01:41:27.609 --> 01:41:29.109
sometimes like he will do a lot of work

1974
01:41:29.759 --> 01:41:31.529
to find out what's going on with a particular

1975
01:41:31.529 --> 01:41:33.649
issue, which, you know, most readers don't want to

1976
01:41:33.649 --> 01:41:35.620
do that amount of work, so it's really helpful.

1977
01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:38.330
And that, well, how could you tell who's reliable?

1978
01:41:38.729 --> 01:41:41.799
Um, I don't know all the signs, but it's

1979
01:41:41.799 --> 01:41:44.040
sort of like when you start reading somebody, you

1980
01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:48.259
can get a sense. You know, like, um, they

1981
01:41:48.259 --> 01:41:50.339
appear to be trying to address the other side,

1982
01:41:50.379 --> 01:41:51.939
and what they say about what the other side

1983
01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:54.740
says sounds reasonable, that, that they, that that is

1984
01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:58.129
what they would say, right? And like, they're addressing

1985
01:41:58.129 --> 01:42:02.359
things that sound like the reasonable argument, the reasonable

1986
01:42:02.359 --> 01:42:05.910
objections, um. Uh, YOU know, they're like trying to

1987
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:08.390
collect evidence. You know, they're not just saying stuff,

1988
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:10.990
they're collecting evidence and telling you about the evidence.

1989
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.959
Uh, SOMETIMES they qualify their statements. You know, like,

1990
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:18.589
They, they don't just say whatever, like, this is,

1991
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:20.229
this is always the case. They'd be like, so

1992
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:22.669
this is usually the case, or like, uh, this

1993
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:24.990
is probably the case or something like that. So

1994
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:27.629
anyway, and that I have more, more things like

1995
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:29.620
that in the book, but Yeah.
