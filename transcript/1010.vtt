00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.089
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.000
Center. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.069
today I'm joined by Doctor Michael Price. He is

4
00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.619
senior lecturer in psychology at Brunel University London. And

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.139
today we're focusing mostly on the bio cultural evolution

6
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:23.350
of religio spirituality and also the topic of universal

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.809
Darwinism. We're going to get into that. So Michael,

8
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.030
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.329
Thanks. It's great to be here. Thanks for inviting

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.610
me.

11
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.389
So perhaps tell us first uh because you identify

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.810
yourself as uh an evolutionary psychologist, right? Is that

13
00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:47.700
right? Uh And so, uh as an evolutionary psychologist,

14
00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:51.139
how did you get interested in a topic like

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.340
religious spirituality? What got you there?

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.389
Yeah. Um Well, I, I wasn't, it wasn't my

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.069
main topic originally, my main focus as a phd

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.900
student at UC Santa Barbara uh was more in

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.599
the evolution of cooper operation. Um But I've always

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.760
been interested in sort of um moral systems, the

21
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:15.480
evolution of moral systems. Um And so sort of

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.239
uh yeah, iii I can't say exactly what led

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.970
me to, to religion. Um And it was fairly,

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.089
you know, kind of a mid career shift of

25
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.580
focus a little bit. But, um, uh, I think

26
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.010
I was getting just a little bit, um, uh,

27
00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:36.010
you know, um, ready for some, a new source

28
00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:38.809
of inspiration in my, in my academic career. So,

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.089
you know, early on I was just, you know,

30
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.449
on fire with enthusiasm for evolutionary psychology and moral

31
00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.389
psychology. And then I thought, like, well, maybe I've

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.650
gone about as far as I can And um

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.419
you know, the nice thing about being at a,

34
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.330
at a UK University, in contrast with some more

35
00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:58.129
high pressure us universities is you do have a

36
00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.650
little more time and space to kind of explore

37
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.870
new, new areas. And so for a while, I

38
00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.370
just sort of immersed myself in this new topic

39
00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.038
and how could I approach it in a way

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.059
that it hadn't been approached before? Sort of what,

41
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.520
what are the gaps in our evolutionary understanding of

42
00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.899
religion? And I started to think there were some

43
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.759
pretty significant gaps and that I might have something

44
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.000
to say about those. And um then a few

45
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.619
years ago, uh a, a good friend of mine

46
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.850
and a close colleague, Dominic Johnson University of Oxford,

47
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.949
uh invited me to, to kind of co-lead this

48
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.190
um this reg grant program on the evolution of

49
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.199
science and religion as meaning making systems, which enabled

50
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.270
Dominic and I to pursue our own research, but

51
00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.330
also to distribute um eight or 17 reg grants

52
00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.240
to, to other researchers around the world. Uh So

53
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.740
I just got increasingly immersed in this topic to

54
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.789
the point where now it's pretty much the the

55
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.149
center of my gravity, a center of gravity in

56
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.449
terms of my research interests,

57
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.110
you mentioned the term meaning making there related to

58
00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.550
science and religion. What does meaning making mean in

59
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.669
this context?

60
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.119
Uh Well, I think it's, it's simply, you know,

61
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.990
when, when the events and experiences that uh that,

62
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.869
you know, we encounter throughout our lives, how do

63
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.119
we make sense of those? Um And you know,

64
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.300
how do we attribute sort of the significance of,

65
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.779
of events? Um IS that so if you just

66
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.550
want to sort of centralize it, maybe from a

67
00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.279
scientific perspective, we try and say there's some kind

68
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.550
of, you know, physical explanation, some kind of causal

69
00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.960
explanation. And even if I'm not aware of what

70
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.440
it is, it's, it's sort of we can break

71
00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.750
it down in the materialistic terms, whereas a religious

72
00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:49.419
perspective might be more oriented towards sort of some

73
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.279
higher plan, some higher purpose that isn't necessarily uh

74
00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.149
something we can collect empirical evidence about even in,

75
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.130
in principle. So, um they're just, they're often contrasted,

76
00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.309
especially in the western world um uh as, as

77
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.220
opposite approaches, you know, of, of ways of making

78
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.050
sense of the world. So do you take sides

79
00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.699
science versus religion? Um It's not really the way

80
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.178
we're approaching it. I think the way we're approaching

81
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.450
it is sort of these two alternate ways that

82
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.239
people use uh for solving problems, uh specific sets

83
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.880
of problems in their lives. Um So, yeah,

84
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.269
and what would be some of those problems? Because

85
00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.980
I was wondering here when it comes to religion,

86
00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.690
I mean, we can get also into that specifically

87
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.570
because I've also already had tons of interviews on

88
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.600
the show with cognitive scientists of religion for example.

89
00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.005
But when it comes to religion, the of problems

90
00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:50.375
uh socially, morally and others that it allows for

91
00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:55.035
us to solve, let's say, are more or less

92
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.785
obvious. But when it comes to science, what are

93
00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:01.744
the kinds of problems that you are alluding to

94
00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:02.075
here?

95
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.559
Well, I think with science, it's, it's pretty straightforward

96
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.299
that, I mean, the scientific method is a uh

97
00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.880
an approach to producing uh objective knowledge that cannot

98
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.899
be beat. I mean, it's, it's, I think it's

99
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.559
really proved itself over the past uh as it's,

100
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.329
as it's evolved culturally over the past uh centuries,

101
00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:28.299
relatively new invention. I mean, compared to so there

102
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.220
are plenty of sort of pre scientific societies, but

103
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.630
there are no like societies we would consider pre

104
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.940
religious. So science is really, you know, pretty, it's,

105
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.000
it's, it's pretty straight story can be interpreted as

106
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.309
a, an invention that humans have created for the

107
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.230
generation of objective knowledge. Um uh And then so,

108
00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.970
and then, and that, you know, that, that utility

109
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.670
can be applied to basically an infinite number of

110
00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:58.779
problems we might face, right, that um and trying

111
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.329
to control our environments and lives. Uh WHEREAS with

112
00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:08.130
religion, um so there's different approaches to, to. So

113
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.420
as soon as you talk about problem solving and

114
00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:13.720
you're talking about evolution, you're talking about adaptations because

115
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.089
adaptations are problem solving devices. Um Like a biological,

116
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.470
genetically encoded adaptation uh has been selected by evolution

117
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.320
because it's particularly good at solving some adaptive problem

118
00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:30.500
related to ie related to survival and reproduction or

119
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.450
set of adaptive problems. Um So, when people talk

120
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.160
about the evolution of religion, often, I think you

121
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.769
may have been alluding to this a little bit

122
00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.279
before. They, they often talk about cooper and social

123
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.299
coordinations and almost like a, a cultural group level

124
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.899
problems. And they say it not so much psychological

125
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.179
religiosity but religion as a as a cultural attribute,

126
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:58.200
um we've tried, we've tended to approach it religiosity

127
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.600
um as a psychological and individual level approach to

128
00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:07.290
interpreting events and experiences in your life that you

129
00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:09.489
so that it's a kind of bias that allows

130
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.720
you to interpret these events in a way that

131
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.320
solves problems for you. And the kinds of problems

132
00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:18.869
we focused on are problems related to dealing. Well,

133
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.160
essentially uh uh finding a source of motivation in

134
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.049
the face of adversity. Um So a source of

135
00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.540
especially like optimism and sense of purpose. Um And

136
00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:38.459
these are mo widely regarded by in psychology as

137
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.859
sort of motivational systems or motivational mechanisms that keep

138
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:47.279
you motivated to persist in trying to achieve strive

139
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.279
for adaptive goals. So the kinds of problems that

140
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.420
we focused on Dom and myself um have been

141
00:07:56.429 --> 00:08:00.709
those kinds of problems related to motivation uh and,

142
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.739
and solving adoptive problems. And when we say in

143
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.329
the face of adversity, we don't just mean say

144
00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.149
you're starving to death or you're uh you know,

145
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.079
like a real existential crisis or something. But every

146
00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:15.549
day adversity, I mean, every day we face, you

147
00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:21.010
know, problems about uh you know, being motivated um

148
00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.429
and, and sort of persisting in your goals and,

149
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.190
and not being too depressed to, to sort of

150
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.829
carry on and that kind of thing.

151
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.369
And when it comes to science specifically, do you

152
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.210
think that the sort of adaptation is perspective that

153
00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:39.808
you can apply to religion, you can also apply

154
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.479
to science? Because I was just thinking that perhaps

155
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:48.049
the kinds of um cognitive frameworks that we bring

156
00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:52.599
into science, theoretical perspectives, the way we approach knowledge

157
00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:57.239
production tend to be, tend to be very counterintuitive.

158
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.859
So would that also have to do uh with

159
00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:03.940
adaptation is in any way? I mean, do we

160
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.770
have any sort of adapted, evolved adaptations that predisposes

161
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.059
in any way to doing science or is that

162
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.929
sort of, uh um I don't know if we

163
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.780
could call it a secondary trade that is more

164
00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:22.179
the result of cultural evolution or something like that?

165
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.950
Yeah, I mean, I think we certainly have kind

166
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:32.130
of adaptation, proto scientific predispositions. Um YOU know, um

167
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:38.760
where certainly, uh you know, human ancestors uh in

168
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.380
the environment which we evolved were doing something like

169
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.390
science when they were through trial and error discovered

170
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.179
a way to make a better, you know, uh

171
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:50.270
arrow, arrow point or, or tool of some kind

172
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.169
or way of forging whatever. So, I think, yeah,

173
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:57.109
we have the ways of sort of uh acquiring

174
00:09:57.119 --> 00:10:01.700
knowledge for sure and, and, and having expectations about

175
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.609
what might work and then having those falsified. Um

176
00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:06.869
And then, so moving on. So, yeah, I think

177
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.419
there's this rudimentary, certainly we have the sort of

178
00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:14.270
adaptive uh machinery in place. And then, like you,

179
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.500
like you say, I think the scientific method in

180
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.929
a formal sense is simply the, the cultural elaboration

181
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.500
or almost amplification and, and, and um formalizing those

182
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.659
processes and saying here's what really works and here's

183
00:10:30.349 --> 00:10:33.789
uh yeah, we have these adaptations for generating and

184
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.669
acquiring knowledge, but we also have adaptations that make

185
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:41.270
us often very bad at, at discerning the empirical

186
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.979
truth because we're such biased creatures and we have

187
00:10:43.989 --> 00:10:46.489
our own subjective interest and we have our own

188
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.830
often, you know, interest in lying or misrepresenting the

189
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.380
truth um or for, for whatever reason, um we

190
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.429
have all kinds of inbuilt biases that we really

191
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.859
need to often it's an uphill battle to overcome

192
00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:02.590
those. So, but with a formal scientific method that

193
00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:05.289
says, you know, here, you have this hypothesis and

194
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:08.590
you try to falsify it and you know, um

195
00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:12.549
it's, it's essential uh for keeping us sort of

196
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.500
on the straight and narrow when it comes to

197
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:20.840
the production of, of objective knowledge. Um Now, so

198
00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:23.309
I, I, what was the rest of your question

199
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.510
there?

200
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.489
Uh I, I mean, basically, just to reformulate some

201
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.020
of what I said, I was trying to remember

202
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.539
the exact terms that people like, for example, David

203
00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:37.559
Sri using their work because he has two very

204
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.859
uh interesting terms when he, when he mentions basically

205
00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:46.590
uh core knowledge that is intuitive biology, intuitive physics,

206
00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:51.362
and intuitive psychology, or folk psychology, biology, and physics.

207
00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:57.353
Because that's what we are intuitively predisposed to thinking

208
00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:00.552
about things in the world, about other people, about

209
00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:03.862
other animals and plants and so on. But then

210
00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:07.122
when, and that would connect in a way, at

211
00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:09.612
least according to the work of some people out

212
00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:13.903
there that would connect to religion directly. But then

213
00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:17.565
when it comes to science, there's reps one further

214
00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:20.666
step that we need to take because the way

215
00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:27.776
we understand, for example, physics, scientifically, biology, scientifically, psychology,

216
00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:32.125
scientifically, uh I mean, in many ways is very

217
00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:37.226
counterintuitive and detached from that sort of core knowledge.

218
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:41.245
Oh yeah. Right. So I, that was something I

219
00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:43.306
was trying to allude to, to.

220
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.960
Yeah. Um So I, I guess I would say

221
00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.059
I would characterize scientific method or science as a

222
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:56.070
cultural adaptation. Um But it's also a by-product of

223
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.489
uh you know, pre-existing adaptations that, that we can

224
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.090
use um often effectively without in the absence of

225
00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:08.400
a formal scientific method, often effectively uh to, to,

226
00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:14.869
to, to generate knowledge. Um But we've also found

227
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.669
that if we really formalize that process and we

228
00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.020
just talk about forget about our, our subjective biases,

229
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.770
we just, we have a theory, we have predictions

230
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.320
that would either falsify or support the theory. Um

231
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.080
Once we formalize that method, then we were able

232
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.869
to make all kinds of crazy discoveries that turn

233
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.650
out to be true in the scientific sense. But

234
00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:40.390
that are entirely counterintuitive, right about like particle physics

235
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.500
and how a particle can tell a context another

236
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.669
particle or another system. It's has a superposition where

237
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:49.020
it's all everywhere at once or you know, particles

238
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.710
that can tunnel through solid matter things that aren't

239
00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:55.030
just counterintuitive to us. But are they seem impossible

240
00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.679
like any right thinking rational person is going to

241
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.909
say that's impossible, you know, that's. So the scientific

242
00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:04.669
method has taken us building on these adaptations that

243
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:07.479
were much more intuitive. I think it's taken us

244
00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:12.840
far beyond um the limits of our, of our,

245
00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:15.869
of our intuition and of our, you know, we're

246
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.219
evolved to deal with the universe at the, at

247
00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:20.760
the scale that, that, that we live in, not

248
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.929
at the scale of, you know, atomic physics. So

249
00:14:23.719 --> 00:14:28.760
um I think that, yeah, the scientific method has,

250
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.200
it's, it's kind of everything is the result of

251
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.530
adaptations, you have to start with adaptive psychology. Um,

252
00:14:35.539 --> 00:14:37.020
BUT it could be seen as, as, as a

253
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.359
by product and elaboration of those adaptations that has

254
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.250
been allowed us to sort of travel far beyond

255
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.400
their limitations. Um And just with religion, I think

256
00:14:48.469 --> 00:14:51.580
it's, it's potentially a similar thing, but it's just

257
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.679
dealing with a different set of problems that are

258
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.710
very important to people. Um, I mean, there are,

259
00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.119
there are, there are people who have interests beyond

260
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.219
just generating objective knowledge and people have an interest

261
00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:10.030
in issues for which there is no empirically right

262
00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:13.590
or wrong answer. So for example, we're talking about

263
00:15:13.599 --> 00:15:17.219
optimism a lot in, in our studies and whether

264
00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:21.059
you're optimistic about uh the future or not, there's

265
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.090
no right or right, right or wrong answer about,

266
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:26.969
you know, should you be optimistic or not? Because

267
00:15:26.979 --> 00:15:29.719
it's, it's, it's, it's an expectation about the future

268
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:31.130
and there's no way of answering whether you're right

269
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.669
or wrong until the future. So there's no real

270
00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:37.409
truth value assigned to optimism. Nevertheless, um optimism is

271
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:43.080
associated with all kinds of survival benefits. Um And

272
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.950
uh and uh it's associated with more successful and,

273
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.640
and goal striving, goal achievement, et cetera. So it

274
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.950
has certainly really tangible important repercussions for survival and

275
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.119
reproduction, but it has nothing to do with whether

276
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.000
you're objectively right or wrong. Um Like a lot

277
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.609
of our biases. I mean, they're often wrong, in

278
00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:05.859
fact, like we are, evidence suggests that people, human

279
00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:09.559
nature does have this optimism bias that is in,

280
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.049
in sort of psychologically he healthy people. It's, it's,

281
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:17.840
it's biased towards expecting, towards being over optimistic. But

282
00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:20.000
that seems, that seems to be a bias that

283
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.919
is, has been adaptively functional, uh, in our, in

284
00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:24.960
our ancestral past.

285
00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.919
Yeah, I, I mean, just to be fair here

286
00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:32.359
in religion, there's also some things, not many, but

287
00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:36.299
some things that are also at least slightly counterintuitive,

288
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:39.809
like what people refer to when they use the

289
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.119
term minimally counterintuitive ideas in the cognitive science of

290
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.880
religion. Like, I don't know, Jesus walking on water

291
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.210
or some of the miracles that he supposedly performed

292
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:56.070
that are described in the Bible, I mean, beings

293
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.169
that are part human beings, part other animals and

294
00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:03.559
stuff like that. Just because apparently it is when

295
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.069
it comes to the ways our memory works, it

296
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.729
becomes more salient to have those ideas.

297
00:17:12.108 --> 00:17:16.868
Absolutely. Yeah, those ideas. Pascal Boyer is brilliant researcher,

298
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.709
talks about you and others talk about counter minimally

299
00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:23.199
counter of ideas and for sure, like just like,

300
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:28.339
um you know, science has, has made the, you

301
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.859
know, seemingly impossible, has shown us that it's, it's

302
00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:33.979
true somehow and, and in ways that we can't

303
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.199
intuitively grasp. But nevertheless, it's, it's enabled all kinds

304
00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:41.339
of technological advances. So religion also talks about impossible.

305
00:17:41.349 --> 00:17:43.979
We, we're using Christianity as an example here. But

306
00:17:44.089 --> 00:17:47.390
all um all kinds of things that we normally

307
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.579
regard as impossible, virgin birth and resurrection, et cetera,

308
00:17:51.589 --> 00:17:53.670
the things you mentioned. And I think in the

309
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.719
case of religion, it's often, I, I see that

310
00:17:56.729 --> 00:17:58.369
is kind of different because it's, I, I see

311
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.500
those as costly signals of your, of your religious

312
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.569
devotion. So if you're willing to suspend disbelief to

313
00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.839
the point where you believe in things that are,

314
00:18:07.849 --> 00:18:10.079
are in every, any other context would be seen

315
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.739
as impossible. Well, that's a sign of your unquestioning

316
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.910
devotion. Um And I guess I'd, I'd step back

317
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.270
too and say often when you talk about you,

318
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.810
when you, when you tell people you're studying religion

319
00:18:24.199 --> 00:18:29.890
or spirituality, um they immediately think of something like,

320
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.459
oh, you mean like the Catholic church or they

321
00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:35.119
think some, some specific cultural manifestation or set of

322
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.030
beliefs. Um And what we're actually trying to get

323
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.599
at is not none of that we're trying to

324
00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:43.520
get right to the core. And the reason I've,

325
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.500
I've used this term sometimes religious spirituality is because

326
00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:49.640
we're, we're, we're looking at a level of, of

327
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.770
resolution to where those, those concepts are indistinguishable, religiosity,

328
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.750
spirituality. So at a, at a higher, at a

329
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.109
higher level, usually religion refers to sort of organized

330
00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:02.630
religions, like being a member of a, of a,

331
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.800
of an institutionalized, you know, uh church or something.

332
00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:10.239
Whereas spirituality can be more sort of individualistic or,

333
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.800
or much more like, um you know, you're not

334
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.910
necessarily affiliated with it organized organized way of understanding

335
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.109
the, the the universe in that way. But uh

336
00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:22.459
what we're trying to get at really is what

337
00:19:22.469 --> 00:19:26.569
is the cognitive core of, of when people talk

338
00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:30.599
about religiosity and spirituality, what do they essentially mean

339
00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:33.680
cognitively? So when we strip away all the cultural

340
00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:39.349
layers, um we're really trying to get a, just

341
00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:43.449
a, just the cognitive essence of, of religiosity. Yeah.

342
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.420
Uh And how does the cultural aspect get into

343
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.829
the picture here when it comes to religious spirituality?

344
00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:56.239
Because of course, as I mentioned in the introduction,

345
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.689
you approach things zero through a bio cultural evolutionary

346
00:20:01.699 --> 00:20:06.359
perspective and not just let's say an evolutionary psychological

347
00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:11.910
perspective or a biological evolutionary perspective. So how does

348
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.670
the culture get into the picture here?

349
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.099
Yeah, that's a, that's a great question. So I

350
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:21.500
mean, my background in evolutionary psychology means that I

351
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.180
was, you know, my phd advisors were were to

352
00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.530
be cosmetics who are sort of founders of this

353
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.680
modern field of, of evolutionary psychology, which they would

354
00:20:29.689 --> 00:20:32.890
define sort of the U CS B way is

355
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.400
of defining it is, is looking at what would

356
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:41.010
be genetically encoded cognitive information processing mechanisms um that

357
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.959
are that are, it's trying to arrive at a

358
00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:46.369
very precise definition of human nature as a as

359
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.520
as the as in the brain mind is a

360
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.300
bundle of these, of these adaptations. Um So they're

361
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.550
talking very much about sort of the genetically encoded,

362
00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:59.530
you know, psychological mechanisms, mechanisms Um And so I

363
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.839
think initially when I was trying to look at

364
00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:03.979
religion, I kind of, I am a little, you

365
00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:07.609
know, that's, that's my preferred approach too. Um, BUT

366
00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:11.390
I wanted, I started to realize that there's, there

367
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.160
is a lot of, you know, uh significant cultural

368
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.170
varia cross cultural variation in how these religious, um,

369
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.390
uh, these religious pres. Uh, SORRY, I, I would

370
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.699
say ways of looking at the world are expressed.

371
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.189
Um And I didn't want to have to be

372
00:21:31.199 --> 00:21:33.810
in the position of where I was claiming that

373
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.790
what we're saying could be an adaptive function of

374
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.640
religiosity is necessarily, you get that you're necessarily going

375
00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.140
to find it, say hunter gatherer societies all over

376
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.959
the world, mainly because the data we've been collecting

377
00:21:47.969 --> 00:21:50.589
hasn't been from hunter gatherer societies. So I wanted

378
00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:53.160
to be a bit more agnostic about whether this

379
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.410
is, um you know, the extent to which these

380
00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.650
are just sort of raw psychological adaptations expressing themselves

381
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.709
in the same way around the world and in

382
00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:07.660
all types of societies versus, you know, again, uh

383
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:12.000
they could be elaborated culturally in different ways. Um

384
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:16.599
And some cultural manifestations of these, these uh uh

385
00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:20.300
sort of underlying adaptations for religiosity, some of them

386
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.020
might be more effective than others at solving the

387
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.109
problems or sort of satisfying the motives that, that,

388
00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:34.449
that these adaptations ancestrally um satisfied for people. So

389
00:22:34.459 --> 00:22:37.810
I use the term bicultural, I guess maybe an

390
00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:40.329
analogy would be helpful. So if you think about,

391
00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:43.930
so sometimes people think about, ok, there's biological evolution,

392
00:22:43.939 --> 00:22:46.300
there's cultural evolution and these things are sort of,

393
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.589
you have to take a side and there are

394
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.310
alternative types of explanations and partly that's, I think

395
00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:56.250
political because, uh, you have, you know, people with

396
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.140
their preferred approach is competing for journal pages with

397
00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.380
other people they see as the different faction. And

398
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.319
so I don't, I don't buy into any of

399
00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:07.420
that. Actually, I think, you know, the, the kinds

400
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.510
of behaviors you'd expect to evolve are the ones

401
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.680
that are going to be most consistent with, both

402
00:23:12.689 --> 00:23:17.760
with, with biological evolution and also cultural evolution. Um

403
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.380
And I see like cultural behavior and, and cultural

404
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.300
evolution again as an elaboration or exaggeration and amplification

405
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.079
of underlying psychological adaptation. So if you think about

406
00:23:29.089 --> 00:23:33.869
a candy, like skittles, these little like fruit flavored

407
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.119
candies that are kind of like fruit, except every

408
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.880
aspect of fruit that appeals to, to our evolved

409
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.239
psychology has just turned up to 11. You know,

410
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.540
so really like the really, really sweet or really,

411
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.900
really sour or really, you know, tangy and the

412
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.630
colors are just, they, they're really, really bright and

413
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.819
it's sort of pushing all those buttons that makes

414
00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:58.680
a fruit appealing to our evolved psychology and just

415
00:23:58.689 --> 00:24:01.250
kind of ramping them up. And so much of

416
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.550
culture is like that, you know, it's, it's not

417
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.280
sort of overriding our, our evolved psychology. It's actually

418
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.219
allowing us, it's an expression of it and often

419
00:24:10.229 --> 00:24:14.959
kind of a, an exaggeration of it. Um So

420
00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:18.939
that's why I call it bio cultural uh is

421
00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:23.910
because I think certainly at, at, at root, um,

422
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.930
you're, you're working with, you know, we're working with

423
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:31.930
these evolved adaptations. Um BUT then different cultural forms,

424
00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:37.430
different cultural manifestations might uh have elaborated on those

425
00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:40.550
in, in, in different ways. So, you know, maybe

426
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.920
monotheism, for example, is a particularly effective way of

427
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.530
solving some of these problems that these adaptations originally

428
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.260
evolved to solve. Uh Or maybe it's not, I

429
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.199
mean, maybe maybe a more, less agentic view of,

430
00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:56.640
of, of God like Buddhism say is, is, is

431
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.099
more effective. So I want to leave that room

432
00:24:59.109 --> 00:25:04.280
for cultural differences probably because they obviously exist and

433
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.300
um you don't want to deny something that's obviously

434
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.640
true.

435
00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:11.780
Uh And from an evolutionary perspective, what would you

436
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.790
say are perhaps some of the main benefits of

437
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.959
religion, particularly the ones that have the fitness payoffs?

438
00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:25.819
Yeah. Um Well, to answer that, just to give

439
00:25:25.829 --> 00:25:27.479
you a little bit of a, you probably already

440
00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:30.319
have a good understanding of this. Maybe for listeners

441
00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:35.719
um in evolution approaches of religion, uh this is

442
00:25:35.729 --> 00:25:38.250
a bit of a oversimplification but they've tended to

443
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.819
fall in, in two camps and one camp. And

444
00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:44.290
probably the, I would say like the, the, the

445
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.180
the predominant one is, has seen religious explains religiosity

446
00:25:49.189 --> 00:25:53.219
as a of adaptations for social cognition like, you

447
00:25:53.229 --> 00:25:55.800
know, theory of mind, our abilities to read, to

448
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.709
read minds of other, other people, other other animals

449
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.689
uh agency detection. So these, these mechanisms associated with

450
00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:07.640
social cognition um are sort of we just one

451
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.510
way to think about it is we just turn

452
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.699
them towards the universe at large. And so a

453
00:26:11.709 --> 00:26:13.739
way to think about God is simply we take

454
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.900
our theory of mind, you know, attributing intentions and

455
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.609
agency and um emotions to other people and we

456
00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:25.160
just sort of turn it towards the universe at

457
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.619
large is what Jesse Barring is called the existential

458
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.060
theory of mind. Um And so a lot of

459
00:26:31.069 --> 00:26:35.060
like Pascal Boyer and others of Justin Barrett, you

460
00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:41.180
know, see religious thinking as a byproduct's for social

461
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:44.979
cognition. Um And then there's another camp that says,

462
00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:47.410
well, they think there's probably some adaptive aspects to

463
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.329
religious thinking and these tend to have to do

464
00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:53.989
with cooper social coordinations and, and broadly Cooper and

465
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.479
that can be cooperated at the level of the

466
00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:58.709
individual, like, like my, my colleague, Dominic Johnson has

467
00:26:58.719 --> 00:27:02.140
written a book about uh God is watching you

468
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:07.079
about how uh religious ideas about punitive deities sort

469
00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:10.150
of make us more allow us to cooper more

470
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.900
adaptively. Um Or, you know, the idea that whole

471
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:19.439
cultures benefit from, from religious um belief systems that

472
00:27:19.449 --> 00:27:23.239
enhance co-operation and, and, and coordinations within groups that

473
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.500
then allow them to spread by a conquest or

474
00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:29.479
because they're imitated by other groups to give them

475
00:27:29.489 --> 00:27:33.010
some political advantage. Uh So it's sort of like

476
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.329
you choose, you're, if you're, if it's a doubt,

477
00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:36.680
if you want to go to the sort of

478
00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:39.530
extended that adaptation, you say it's cooper operation or,

479
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.089
or otherwise you say it's a by product. And

480
00:27:42.589 --> 00:27:44.750
our approach has been to sort of say there's

481
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.160
this whole other uh huge literature on, you know,

482
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:55.219
the relationship between religiosity and health, basically physical mental

483
00:27:55.229 --> 00:27:57.930
health. Um And most of this research is not

484
00:27:57.939 --> 00:28:03.660
explicitly evolutionary hasn't been sort of evolutionary. So it's

485
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.229
a little bit strange because so it's a fairly

486
00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:11.030
well documented positive relationship between religiosity and physical and

487
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.060
mental health. Mostly it's conducted in western societies. But,

488
00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:17.939
but still, it's sort of an obvious, it raises

489
00:28:17.949 --> 00:28:21.099
the question of, well, you know, could this have,

490
00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:23.839
could, could this be relevant to an evolutionary understanding

491
00:28:23.849 --> 00:28:27.000
if there are these connections to health and survival?

492
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:31.020
I mean, literally survival and longevity. Um And so

493
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.739
that, that is the approach we've, we've been taking

494
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.869
more is looking at what is how, how from

495
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.819
an evolutionary perspective, can we, can we try and

496
00:28:40.829 --> 00:28:44.020
explain this relationship? And also like, what are the

497
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.380
mediating psychological variables that could help explain sort of

498
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:52.150
religious thinking? Um Then, and then that leads to,

499
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.369
to in better physical and mental health. Uh What

500
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.869
or what is sometimes referred to as well being.

501
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.670
Um And uh yeah, so, I mean, that's been,

502
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.439
I think the main differences in our approach is

503
00:29:07.449 --> 00:29:10.119
we're trying to come up with a, a more

504
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.750
satisfying evolutionary explanation that that doesn't leave out this

505
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.099
kind of potentially quite important part of the explanation.

506
00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:21.069
And then also integrates these sort of non evolutionary

507
00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:25.030
approaches with these evolutionary approaches which for whatever reason,

508
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.300
have tended to focus on cooper operation and then

509
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.569
the by product idea.

510
00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:32.459
So uh I want to connect or try to

511
00:29:32.469 --> 00:29:35.239
connect all of this to an idea that you

512
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.790
proposed in your work that you called universal Darwinism.

513
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.680
But just before we get into that, since we've

514
00:29:42.689 --> 00:29:46.109
already talked here about the main benefits of religion

515
00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:50.089
and also how it has some fitness payoffs. Do

516
00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:54.589
you think that by studying uh religion or religious

517
00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:58.089
spirituality from an evolutionary perspective and really getting a

518
00:29:58.099 --> 00:30:02.390
better understanding of uh the benefits we get from

519
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.790
it and how we get them, we could apply

520
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.069
these to secular societies and get the same sorts

521
00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:17.630
of individual and social benefits uh without the religious

522
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.650
aspect to them or not.

523
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.640
That's a, that's a great question. Um I would

524
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.979
say that, ok, so this is also sort of

525
00:30:26.989 --> 00:30:29.079
more about the state of the field. But when,

526
00:30:29.089 --> 00:30:32.400
when most social scientists usually not coming from an

527
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.790
explicitly evolutionary perspective, when they've tried to explain this

528
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.569
positive relationship between religiosity and health, it's usually in

529
00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:45.390
terms of social support. Um So religious people, like

530
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.760
if they are members of congregations or, or whatever,

531
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.900
they they, they tend to have these religious communities

532
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.189
that are good sources of social support. And we

533
00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:55.839
know that social support is good for your health.

534
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.680
Not, it doesn't have to be religious. So there's

535
00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:02.719
nothing uniquely, uh nothing unique about religion in this

536
00:31:02.729 --> 00:31:05.550
regard in terms of explaining its relationship with health.

537
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.810
It's simply, it's a good, a good gives you

538
00:31:07.829 --> 00:31:13.390
access to a community of social support. Um And

539
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.540
uh if that were true, then I would say

540
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.300
the answer to your question about, could we have

541
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:23.329
a secular society? Uh That sort of solved all

542
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:26.609
those problems without sort of veering into this religiosity

543
00:31:26.619 --> 00:31:29.239
worldview? I would say, yeah, uh as long as

544
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.260
we can give people access to that kind of

545
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:36.800
social support. Um And yeah, that was, that was

546
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.609
an approach I was taking a few years ago

547
00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:40.410
and I published a study on that and looking

548
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.170
at secular congregations, particularly the, the Sunday Assembly, which

549
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.650
is kind of been, they don't call themselves this,

550
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.579
but uh probably the most easiest way to explain

551
00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:53.079
it. It's like an atheist church um that started

552
00:31:53.089 --> 00:31:54.439
here in London, that kind of spread all over

553
00:31:54.449 --> 00:31:57.089
the world. Um So I think that, and I

554
00:31:57.099 --> 00:31:58.849
do think that is part of the explanation for

555
00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:02.900
why religion has positive associations with health and social

556
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.560
support. But I think there's a lot more to

557
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:07.050
it. I think there is some, there are things

558
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.189
that are unique about religious, not behavior like social

559
00:32:11.199 --> 00:32:16.979
behavior but religious belief per se. Um That, that

560
00:32:17.729 --> 00:32:20.750
I think it would be considered pretty uniquely religious.

561
00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:24.380
Um And I, I'm not trying to be cagey

562
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.020
about this. I'll just say like, what I, what,

563
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.250
what we think it is is this belief that

564
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.630
there's a higher plan, that one's life is following

565
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.949
the high, higher plan. So a plan that has

566
00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:38.709
been uh created by some kind of higher power

567
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:40.890
or powers And we've tried to define it in

568
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.949
a way that is uh universal. So we're talking

569
00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:48.900
about at least for all major world religions. Um

570
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.800
THIS, we needed, we needed a definition that would

571
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.469
apply equally well to say monotheistic abrahamic religions or,

572
00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:58.859
or Buddhism or Hinduism or indeed sort of informal

573
00:32:58.869 --> 00:33:03.180
spirituality uh where you people say, uh even like

574
00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.380
reading your horoscope um or saying like, oh the

575
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.229
universe is trying to tell me something. I'm looking

576
00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:11.369
for a sign in a kind of informal spiritual

577
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.420
way. Um So we're trying to come up with

578
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:22.030
the definition of religiosity slash spirituality that would apply

579
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.349
across religions. And what we landed on was this

580
00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:28.280
sort of belief in a higher plan. Um Because

581
00:33:28.489 --> 00:33:30.550
that is, and we've done a lot of research

582
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.219
since then, that, that, that supports this idea that

583
00:33:33.619 --> 00:33:37.790
um it is a, it's very hard to define

584
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.829
sort of religiosity or religious belief. People think it

585
00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:43.180
sounds easy, but then you realize what are you

586
00:33:43.189 --> 00:33:46.040
actually talking about? So we were just focusing on

587
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.449
what is the cognitively, what do all of these

588
00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.339
things we call religion? What do they have in

589
00:33:50.349 --> 00:33:53.189
common as a, as an essential belief that it

590
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:56.130
makes them unique? And I think it would be

591
00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.510
this belief in a higher plan that your life

592
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.650
is following this, this plan. That is, and it's,

593
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.800
it's, you know, invariably it's a benevolent plan, at

594
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.250
least benevolent with respect to you yourself and your

595
00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.080
own welfare, not necessarily with respect to everybody else.

596
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.280
They might die in the, you know, the apocalypse,

597
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.199
but you're gonna be, you're gonna be ok. Um

598
00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:18.929
So it has to do with this idea that

599
00:34:18.938 --> 00:34:22.360
this plan is, is, is, has been devised by

600
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.520
some kind of higher power or powers, not necessarily

601
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.447
a God, but some kind of power. Um And

602
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:31.728
it's, it's ultimately consistent with your long term welfare.

603
00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:37.228
Ok. So that serves as that. Well, first of

604
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.339
all, that's a uniquely religious idea. I don't know

605
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:43.228
of any sort of scientific ideas that, I mean,

606
00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.239
you can, I know of some sort of theoretical

607
00:34:46.248 --> 00:34:47.829
ones that we don't have yet have this sort

608
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.888
of a technology to test. We don't have the

609
00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:54.458
ability to, uh, you know, produce empirical evidence one

610
00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:56.290
way or the other. So I think there are

611
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.510
scientific ideas for how that that could happen in

612
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.979
theory, but they're not widely accepted hardly any, you

613
00:35:02.989 --> 00:35:06.050
know, nobody really believes them. Uh And any to

614
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.139
the extent that they believe in religious religious beliefs.

615
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:12.959
So that is what I think is probably the

616
00:35:12.969 --> 00:35:16.419
unique aspect of what we call religion, spirituality, uh

617
00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:19.429
cross culturally that sets it apart. And it makes

618
00:35:19.439 --> 00:35:22.500
it uniquely useful to people as a kind of

619
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.219
repository or a foundation for optimism and sense of

620
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:31.010
purpose because it really can people, people do find

621
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.500
it useful for uh amplifying, especially in times of

622
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.659
where you might be, you might be, uh you

623
00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:41.250
know, uh tempted to give up, sort of throw

624
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.639
in the towel because you don't think you're going

625
00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:46.760
to succeed if people can sort of say no,

626
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.189
you know, there's this, this is part of a

627
00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:50.389
higher plan and I have this, this is not

628
00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:53.060
just my purpose, this is a purpose shared with

629
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.540
this higher power. I think that can make people

630
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.560
more resilient and more persistent and in the pursuit

631
00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.810
of goals and, and it becomes a self fulfilling

632
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:07.639
prophecy uh where, whereby uh just the fact that

633
00:36:07.649 --> 00:36:10.000
you, you don't give up and that you are,

634
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.360
you, you're striving for these goals more intensely. It's

635
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:18.310
that, that, that um motivation itself makes, makes you

636
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.719
more likely to achieve the goal,

637
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.600
right? So, tell us now about this idea of

638
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:28.679
universal Darwinism. What do you mean uh by it

639
00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:32.000
basically? Yeah, I mean, so a few years ago

640
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.570
when I was sort of looking for, for new

641
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.189
sources of inspiration. Uh Well, years ago I read

642
00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:40.649
this book called The Life of the cosmos by

643
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.679
a physicist named Lee Smolen that talks about um

644
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.870
the multiverse and how the the types of universes

645
00:36:48.879 --> 00:36:50.250
that are going to be most common in the

646
00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.399
multiverse are gonna be those that reproduce most prolifically

647
00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:56.449
and successfully. And talks about black holes is basically

648
00:36:56.459 --> 00:36:59.979
the reproductive system of the universe. So, um that's

649
00:36:59.989 --> 00:37:03.540
one way of thinking about universal Darwinism is it's

650
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.899
the basic ideas of just, you know, the, the

651
00:37:07.909 --> 00:37:12.360
uh the kind of orderly forms that exist in

652
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.520
the universe around us are those which have almost

653
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:19.169
by, well, pretty much by definition. Um YOU know,

654
00:37:19.179 --> 00:37:22.729
found ways to combat the second law of thermodynamics.

655
00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:25.810
You know, the, the the the the tendency towards

656
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.469
of isolated systems to towards increased entropy, increased disorder.

657
00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:34.290
Um And so the kinds of orderly systems we

658
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.580
we observe all around us are, are all examples

659
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.729
of systems that have temporarily at least found ways

660
00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:43.780
to kind of subvert circumvent that the second law

661
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:48.860
of thermodynamics. And that's basically what, what universal Darwinism

662
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.250
is. It's, it's, it's, it's sort of saying that

663
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:57.159
the, the principles um or the the processes that

664
00:37:57.169 --> 00:38:00.199
we can observe in, in biological evolution in a

665
00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:05.199
more abstract way are operating the universe is basically

666
00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:07.939
saturated. The multiverse is saturated with these same kind

667
00:38:07.949 --> 00:38:11.959
of processes. And really what it's about is second

668
00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:15.520
law of thermodynamics. OK. So this increased sort of

669
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:21.050
relentless march towards entropy and then um processes that

670
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.689
uh have of order of, of, of, of com

671
00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:29.379
sometimes complex order that have found ways to, to

672
00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:33.989
subvert this law. Um And the kind of supreme

673
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.090
example of uh complex organization is is life and,

674
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.689
and you know, adaptations and then the, the the

675
00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:48.250
organisms that are composed of these adaptations that are

676
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.889
bundles of these adaptations. These are the least entropic,

677
00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:53.949
I mean, Lee Moen himself says this in his

678
00:38:53.959 --> 00:38:57.919
book that these are the the least entropic entities

679
00:38:57.929 --> 00:39:01.070
in the universe. Um And there's a formal definition

680
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.080
for that, just meaning like if you swapped out

681
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.419
uh say cells from one part of your body,

682
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:09.080
say your liver and you exchange it with neurons,

683
00:39:09.229 --> 00:39:12.449
um you're gonna start, you're gonna start to interfere

684
00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:15.370
with the ability of that system to exist, you're

685
00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:19.270
gonna hasten its, its, its uh path, you know,

686
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.020
down towards entropy. Um And so by that definition,

687
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.020
like living living organisms are the, the, the most

688
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.179
sort of the least entropic systems um that we

689
00:39:31.189 --> 00:39:33.620
know of. So I think it, it's very, it's

690
00:39:33.629 --> 00:39:39.709
helpful in understanding adaptation and in understanding why adaptation

691
00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:43.179
is so important. Um And, and understanding that, you

692
00:39:43.189 --> 00:39:48.770
know, or um complex organizational complexity is the hallmark

693
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.699
of of selection. So basically, you have, you know,

694
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.610
second law of thermodynamics, then you have kinds of

695
00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:01.860
selective processes that this this destructive process that, that

696
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:06.540
creates entropy is simultaneously responsible for creating the order

697
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.060
because it's like everything that can slip through its

698
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:14.489
net um becomes, becomes examples of, of, of orderly

699
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:22.129
systems. Um And yeah, I thought it's, um and

700
00:40:22.139 --> 00:40:24.239
it really just sort of relates to our understanding

701
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.699
of the universe in a very deep, deep level.

702
00:40:26.709 --> 00:40:30.489
So, um I, and I gotta, I gotta give

703
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.370
credit to a friend of mine named John Campbell

704
00:40:33.379 --> 00:40:35.699
who was an independent scholar, um who I kind

705
00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:39.830
of stumbled across, um who wrote some really excellent

706
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.149
books. Uh Darwin does Physics um and some other

707
00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:47.459
books and he, he passed away a couple of

708
00:40:47.469 --> 00:40:50.300
years ago. But um I, I thought he just

709
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.679
had some really brilliant ideas that influenced me, me

710
00:40:52.689 --> 00:40:55.939
a lot. And we, we published together and one

711
00:40:55.949 --> 00:41:00.199
of his kind of anecdotes that really, I thought

712
00:41:00.209 --> 00:41:05.010
was really the most compelling was talking about sort

713
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.149
of the founder of information theory, Claude Shannon. Um

714
00:41:09.159 --> 00:41:10.870
And in the forties, when he was coming up

715
00:41:10.879 --> 00:41:13.550
with information theory, he was trying to define and

716
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:19.070
uh information and, and knowledge um mathematically and then

717
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.159
sort of the, the opposite of it is what

718
00:41:22.169 --> 00:41:27.040
he called ignorance. Um And he was asking Von

719
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.060
Neumann, the famous mathematician when he showed him his,

720
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.020
his mathematical formula for ignorance. And he wasn't sure

721
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.500
whether he should call it ignorance, what he should

722
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.500
call it. And, and, and Von Neuman said, we'll

723
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.919
just call it entropy because it's mathematically equivalent to

724
00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:43.260
entropy. And so this, this mathematical equivalence of knowledge

725
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:47.979
and information with uh with entropy. And then by

726
00:41:47.989 --> 00:41:53.919
the same token, um I'm sorry, with ignorance, ignorance,

727
00:41:53.929 --> 00:41:56.169
uh The absence of knowledge, ignorance is equivalent to

728
00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:59.429
entropy. And by the same token adaptation is equivalent

729
00:41:59.439 --> 00:42:01.840
to knowledge, it's sort of, it's knowledge about what

730
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:05.030
it takes to, to persist in one's environment.

731
00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:09.379
But do you think that this idea of universal

732
00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:13.729
Darwinism and life and Darwinian selection as a sort

733
00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:20.189
of anti anthropic process would have implications beyond science?

734
00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:24.620
I mean, as to how we think about existence

735
00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:27.520
and life more specifically, do you think that it

736
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:32.659
would have potentially, I don't know, existential implications or

737
00:42:32.669 --> 00:42:32.909
not?

738
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.360
I mean, I think absolutely like down the road.

739
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.399
Um I mean, I see no limitations on what,

740
00:42:40.409 --> 00:42:42.360
you know, as long as we can avoid extinction

741
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.739
as, as a species, I think human knowledge is

742
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:48.840
just gonna, so I'm not gonna, you know, take

743
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.340
anything off the table and in, in terms of

744
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.520
um how we could use this understanding um to

745
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.840
answer sort of existential questions that were presently just

746
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.919
incapable of under understanding. Um But I also acknowledge

747
00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:04.639
that there's a lot that we just, we are

748
00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:07.500
aren't capable of understanding. I think where it's become

749
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.969
useful for me in the study of religion is

750
00:43:09.979 --> 00:43:17.310
in thinking about uh ideas about function. Um SO

751
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:22.300
adaptations have functions and, and, and, and uh their

752
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.320
function is to basically withstand the second law of

753
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.199
thermodynamics is to withstand the forces of entropy. Um

754
00:43:30.489 --> 00:43:32.760
And then thinking about sort of Lee Mullen's idea

755
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.830
about function at this higher level, right, at this,

756
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.030
at this multiverse level, with black holes have this

757
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.419
function of allowing rep uh universes to reproduce. And

758
00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:42.879
then it, you know, it just occurring to me

759
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.919
increasingly that it seemed increasingly like that was what

760
00:43:46.929 --> 00:43:49.169
religious, what we call religious thinking. That's what it's

761
00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:52.449
doing. It's taking this, this idea of function or

762
00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:57.179
purpose, um uh and just applying it to a

763
00:43:57.189 --> 00:44:01.530
level higher and saying it's not just obviously organisms

764
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.610
have purposes, you know, they're hungry and they want

765
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.760
to eat or whatever. Um But what if our

766
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.969
universe has a purpose or what? If not just

767
00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:12.639
my life, not, not, I don't just have purposes

768
00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:14.280
in my own life. What if life itself, like

769
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.729
the evolutionary process has some higher purpose? Um And

770
00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.260
it, it, it, first of all, it made me

771
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.750
think that's sort of what that's, that's essentially, I

772
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.560
think what religion is doing. It's, it's, it's moving

773
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.800
that level of evolved purpose or function just up,

774
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.050
up a level to a level we don't have

775
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.330
access to for them by and large, you know,

776
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.800
in terms of collecting empirical data, which I think

777
00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.169
takes it out of the realm of scientific uh

778
00:44:40.229 --> 00:44:43.719
scientific knowledge. So it, it's, it's not a competing

779
00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:45.750
way of, I don't see it as a way

780
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.310
of a competing way of understanding the world. It's

781
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.679
a way of understanding the world for like questions

782
00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:53.469
that we don't have the ability to answer empirically,

783
00:44:53.479 --> 00:44:57.290
but they're still very important to us. Um And

784
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.929
for me, so I think just thinking about this

785
00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:04.300
um purpose of this higher level helped me arrive

786
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:09.409
at this definition of religiosity, spirituality. Like that's, that's

787
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.389
a pretty good working definition of religion, psychologically, it's

788
00:45:13.399 --> 00:45:16.520
this idea of purpose at a higher level. Um

789
00:45:17.139 --> 00:45:19.159
So, yeah, I think, I think it has some

790
00:45:19.169 --> 00:45:21.729
kind of limited utility in that regard for now.

791
00:45:21.889 --> 00:45:25.320
I think just because we don't have the ability

792
00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:29.159
to test these ideas right now, the practical scientific

793
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.959
u utility is, is limited.

794
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.159
So let me ask you about one last topic

795
00:45:36.169 --> 00:45:40.570
slash question because there's at least one more domain

796
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:45.090
that religion usually deals with that from a more

797
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.120
scientific perspective. I mean, it's a, it's a little

798
00:45:48.129 --> 00:45:51.929
bit more complicated to really make a move from

799
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.903
describing what the world is or what the world

800
00:45:55.913 --> 00:45:59.583
looks like. Uh uh uh GOING from that to

801
00:45:59.722 --> 00:46:02.812
what we should do, what we ought to do.

802
00:46:02.822 --> 00:46:05.212
That is the more moral domain going from the

803
00:46:05.222 --> 00:46:08.282
descriptive to the prescriptive. But do you think then

804
00:46:08.472 --> 00:46:13.512
from an evolutionary perspective, there's uh I mean that

805
00:46:13.522 --> 00:46:17.802
we could derive moral principles from this kind of

806
00:46:17.863 --> 00:46:21.926
uh view in science? I mean, is there, for

807
00:46:21.936 --> 00:46:26.506
example, since from an evolutionary perspective, at the end

808
00:46:26.516 --> 00:46:29.645
of the day, it all, it all boils down

809
00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:33.785
to our ability to reproduce or not reproduce, I

810
00:46:33.795 --> 00:46:37.025
mean, to our fitness, do you think that there's,

811
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:41.345
for example, any moral obligation for us to, uh,

812
00:46:41.355 --> 00:46:47.825
reproduce and to promote future human evolution or not.

813
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:52.060
Well, um, I mean, the short answer, if you're

814
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:57.040
talking about can evolutionary knowledge or scientific knowledge tell

815
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.939
us what our morals should be. I, I'd say

816
00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:03.100
no. Um, PRETTY unequivocally. No. Um, I think that's

817
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:06.489
a road that it's, it's for sure, a double

818
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:11.510
edged swords. Um, AND I also just don't think

819
00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:14.040
I can't see how it, it could really be

820
00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.580
true. I mean, I, I think it could tell

821
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:20.159
us, you know, why we might be interested in,

822
00:47:20.169 --> 00:47:22.100
in, in, you know, engaging the behaviors that were

823
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.040
associated with reproduction and survival in the past. But

824
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.590
it can't tell us anything about sort of what's

825
00:47:29.469 --> 00:47:33.320
right or wrong. I think, you know, certainly not.

826
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:38.300
Sometimes it, people have, I think, abused evolutionary knowledge

827
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.989
and saying this or that is natural or unnatural.

828
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.080
Um, AND to me that distinction makes no sense.

829
00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:46.389
Uh, FIRST of all, because what if it's not

830
00:47:46.399 --> 00:47:49.260
natural, then what is it? I mean, that implies

831
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:53.189
there's some, something else like there's some supernatural realm

832
00:47:53.199 --> 00:47:56.409
or, or, and I just think that's, uh, so

833
00:47:56.419 --> 00:47:59.459
short answer is I do not think, II, I

834
00:47:59.469 --> 00:48:01.810
believe that the naturalistic fallacy is in fact a

835
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.629
fallacy. And, um, I don't, I certainly don't look

836
00:48:06.639 --> 00:48:11.040
to, I, I do think this idea is very

837
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.330
hard. It's, people are, it, it's very hard to

838
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.439
like excise it from people's understanding and, and there's

839
00:48:17.449 --> 00:48:19.260
a tendency of humans who want to do that

840
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.709
and to say that to think that if you're

841
00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:24.810
calling something into adaptation, that somehow elevates it morally,

842
00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:30.379
um which I think is really closer to being

843
00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:33.110
wro wrong than right. Because, you know, so many

844
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.169
of our most valued uh cultural creations are byproduct's

845
00:48:38.179 --> 00:48:40.530
of, of adaptations. And to say something is a

846
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.830
byproduct's in no way to sort of demote it

847
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.949
and say it's less natural. I mean, ma mathematics

848
00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:50.760
and, you know, uh uh so much of our

849
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:54.090
art and culture and technology and transportation, all of

850
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.310
these things that make our lives. Well, I think

851
00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.060
on balance probably, probably, well, at least we, we

852
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.090
try and use them to make our lives more

853
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.560
enjoyable and livable and they're all by products and

854
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.250
that doesn't mean they're immoral. Um So I, the

855
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.409
short answer is no, I don't think you can

856
00:49:10.419 --> 00:49:14.409
derive morality from evolution. I any more than you

857
00:49:14.419 --> 00:49:16.889
can from geology or chemistry or I think it's

858
00:49:16.899 --> 00:49:20.330
just a way of, you know, again, generating objective

859
00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:25.439
knowledge about human nature. And just, II, I thought

860
00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:27.360
you might be asking what about the connection between

861
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.409
religion and morality? And I don't think there's any

862
00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:33.840
necessary connection there either. I mean, actually when you

863
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.860
talk about, you know, when we, we sort of

864
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:44.820
retrospectively label uh what we call in hunter gatherer

865
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.979
societies, we call it religious beliefs, religious behavior, of

866
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.659
course, to them, it's just the way they see

867
00:49:50.669 --> 00:49:52.760
the world, they don't distinguish, they don't call it

868
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.520
religion. They just think this is the way the

869
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.649
world we, we think the world is. Um, BUT

870
00:49:57.659 --> 00:50:01.770
oftentimes it has no explicit ties to morality. Um

871
00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:04.209
And this connection with morality I think is more

872
00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:08.840
of AAA, culturally evolved thing. Um Which kind of

873
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:13.679
makes sense because religion and culturally has become such

874
00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:18.379
a powerful kind of uh social force that if

875
00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:20.979
people have a moral agenda, they're gonna wanna loop

876
00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:23.040
it, tie it in to, to religion just to

877
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.429
sort of reinforce it. And, but I don't think

878
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:28.070
there's any necessary connection. Again. I think the sort

879
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.219
of the essence of religiosity is just simply this

880
00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:34.409
belief in a higher plan. And it has, it's,

881
00:50:34.419 --> 00:50:38.310
I think Steven Pinker, was it? Well, they call

882
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.070
it kind of a, it's like a, a dust

883
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.169
bunny, like intellectual, dust bunny. Um I'm not sure

884
00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:46.530
if he was talking about religion this way, but

885
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.360
it's, it, it, it sort of collects all this,

886
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.239
all this baggage, you know, like morality and, and,

887
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:56.080
and uh people's ideas about sin and, and what's

888
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.280
right and wrong and, and really, in essence, it's,

889
00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.159
it's, it's not about that. It's just about believing

890
00:51:01.169 --> 00:51:03.479
that there's a higher plan in your life is

891
00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:06.000
somehow following this higher plan.

892
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.520
Great. So before we go, would you like to

893
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.000
tell the audience what are the kinds of work

894
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:17.129
you're doing at the moment what you're going to

895
00:51:17.139 --> 00:51:19.389
be working on in the near future? And does

896
00:51:19.399 --> 00:51:24.179
it, uh have anything to do with religious spirituality

897
00:51:24.189 --> 00:51:27.399
or are you moving on to other sorts of

898
00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:28.000
topics?

899
00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:31.199
Uh, WELL, it does have to do with religio

900
00:51:31.209 --> 00:51:33.969
spirituality and I'll just, I'll just call it religiosity.

901
00:51:33.979 --> 00:51:38.489
But, uh, and so we have, for the past

902
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.550
few years, Dominic Johnson and I have been coding

903
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.760
a project funded by Templeton Religion Trust and is

904
00:51:44.939 --> 00:51:48.040
a fund uh called the Evolution of Science and

905
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.520
religion is mean making systems. So it's mainly a

906
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.429
reg granting program. We've, we, we funded other projects

907
00:51:54.439 --> 00:51:57.320
uh looking at religion and science. And we've also

908
00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:02.209
been conducting our own research. Um And as far

909
00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:04.300
as our own research goes, the main focus has

910
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.669
been, well, we've, we've completed a big cross cultural

911
00:52:07.679 --> 00:52:12.340
study. So all major religions, 54 countries, uh 39

912
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:15.800
languages, six continents. So a truly cross cultural study

913
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:21.530
over 55,000 participants. Um And, you know, we, we

914
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:25.300
have tried to define religion, come up with a

915
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.429
way of defining religiosity in a, in a psychologically,

916
00:52:29.439 --> 00:52:31.199
in a way that would, that would work cross

917
00:52:31.209 --> 00:52:33.219
culturally. So that's where that sort of belief in

918
00:52:33.229 --> 00:52:35.729
a higher plan measure that we devise, that's where

919
00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:38.189
it came from. And then trying to test it

920
00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:44.770
against these alternate alternative hypotheses about um whether, you

921
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.060
know, belief in a higher plan, uh this construct

922
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:51.040
that we've, we've devised, whether it's a better predictor

923
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.669
of optimism and sense of purpose or what we

924
00:52:53.679 --> 00:52:56.600
call these sort of motive motivating outlooks, this motivational

925
00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:00.040
mechanisms, whether it's a better predictor of those compared

926
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:03.159
to religious social support, which is, as I mentioned,

927
00:53:03.169 --> 00:53:06.739
this kind of a pretty, pretty, pretty, probably the,

928
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:10.040
the uh conventional wisdom about the link between uh

929
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:15.570
religiosity and well being. And then also there's been

930
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.439
some other ideas about, well, maybe the links between

931
00:53:18.449 --> 00:53:21.040
religious belief and well being have more to do

932
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.179
with this just a belief system in general and

933
00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:25.860
not a religious one per se. And so some,

934
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:29.340
some very interesting work suggesting that uh belief in

935
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.110
science and what's called like scientific faith could produce

936
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.479
the same sorts of, of uh you know, positive

937
00:53:35.489 --> 00:53:39.300
outcomes with well being. Um So we also tested

938
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.370
that we looked at sort of scientific belief and

939
00:53:41.379 --> 00:53:43.320
compared it and we, and, and, and um and

940
00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:47.280
looking at a sort of multi multilevel regression models

941
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.770
that allow us to um partial out the, the

942
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.219
variant and, and well, well being that's explained by

943
00:53:54.229 --> 00:53:57.729
belief and I are plan versus religious social support

944
00:53:57.739 --> 00:54:03.000
versus scientific belief. Um And we've started publishing uh

945
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:08.570
those results. Um And uh we are in the

946
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.719
verge of publishing the rest but has basically found

947
00:54:11.729 --> 00:54:15.370
that there's pretty cross cultural support for the belief

948
00:54:15.379 --> 00:54:18.120
in the higher plan tends to be stronger and

949
00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:21.370
more consistent than for either of those alternative hypotheses.

950
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.330
But that's not to sort of throw shade on

951
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.929
those alternatives because I think they're, they're, they're good,

952
00:54:26.939 --> 00:54:29.090
they're plausible. We didn't want, we wanted to test

953
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.610
them because we thought they were good ideas and

954
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.729
they were plausible ideas. Um, NOT because we wanted

955
00:54:33.739 --> 00:54:37.300
to, you know, have strong men. So, um, actually

956
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:40.699
the evidence that we found cross culturally, it supports

957
00:54:40.709 --> 00:54:43.389
all three of those, those hypotheses or those, those,

958
00:54:43.399 --> 00:54:46.229
those approaches. But I mean, the belief in a

959
00:54:46.239 --> 00:54:49.580
higher plan did tend to get more consistent and,

960
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:53.379
and I'd say stronger support, uh uh overall

961
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.350
great. And if people are interested, where can they

962
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.820
find you when you work on the internet?

963
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.219
Yeah, I mean, a lot of the, the, uh

964
00:55:04.229 --> 00:55:08.810
religion work has been sort of, uh, we've been

965
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.750
sort of working on it for years and now

966
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.389
we're ready to publish. And so we have a

967
00:55:12.399 --> 00:55:15.570
paper, well, we have a special issue, Dominic Johnson

968
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.719
and I are co editing a special issue of

969
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.639
the journal Religion Brain and Behavior that's going to,

970
00:55:20.649 --> 00:55:22.659
we're going to have an article on that and,

971
00:55:22.669 --> 00:55:24.969
uh that, that will be forthcoming in a few

972
00:55:24.979 --> 00:55:27.219
months. I'm not exactly sure when, uh but it's

973
00:55:27.229 --> 00:55:29.560
also going to have about, I think eight other

974
00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.260
articles by some of our re grantees who are

975
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.879
also doing research on the same, on the same

976
00:55:34.889 --> 00:55:39.370
program. Uh And then hopefully within also within a

977
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:40.810
few months, we're going to publish our sort of

978
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.550
flagship study from this our flagship manuscript based on

979
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.399
this cross cultural study that is where we're comparing

980
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.530
um belief in a higher plan to religious social

981
00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.600
support and belief in science. But the one coming

982
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:58.360
out in religion, brain and behavior um takes a

983
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.310
different angle. It looks at the extent to which

984
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.300
religious belief and scientific belief are seen as compatible

985
00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:08.070
or not in different regions of the world. And

986
00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.060
so we're very used to thinking of them as

987
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.949
incompatible in western societies. And they are, I mean,

988
00:56:12.959 --> 00:56:16.100
people in the sense that the more you believe

989
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:18.780
in, in uh belief in a higher plan, the

990
00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:22.179
less you, you the lower is your scientific faith.

991
00:56:22.709 --> 00:56:27.110
Um But it's not true in and outside of

992
00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.000
uh sort of North and South American, sort of

993
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:32.800
historically Christian societies and European societies. Uh It's not

994
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.580
the case in, in Africa and Asia, uh especially

995
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.129
Hinduism, they actually positively correlated. So faith in science

996
00:56:39.139 --> 00:56:42.280
and, and, and, and belief in our plan. So,

997
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:45.320
and we found that the extent to which the

998
00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.879
more compatible these two belief systems are, uh the

999
00:56:48.889 --> 00:56:53.639
more each beli belief system is respectively independently associated

1000
00:56:53.649 --> 00:56:57.919
with well being. So, in other words, in cultures

1001
00:56:57.929 --> 00:57:02.699
where they're seen as more compatible, um the associations

1002
00:57:02.709 --> 00:57:05.169
with belief in a higher plan and well being

1003
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.520
and the associations with belief in science and well

1004
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:10.840
being are both stronger. So there's actually they're kind

1005
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.800
of operating, seeming seem to be operating synergistically as

1006
00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:18.020
opposed to Um So if you could somehow, you

1007
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:22.750
know, uh hit upon uh a belief system that

1008
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.699
allows you to kind of extract the, the best

1009
00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:29.550
of both. Um So it allows you to kind

1010
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.620
of have religious beliefs but, but they don't conflict

1011
00:57:33.629 --> 00:57:38.030
with or undermine belief in science. Um But still

1012
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.409
allow you to kind of have the, the benefits

1013
00:57:40.419 --> 00:57:43.179
in terms of the optimism and sense of purpose

1014
00:57:43.649 --> 00:57:47.580
without, without, without forfeiting scientific knowledge that that really

1015
00:57:47.669 --> 00:57:50.229
could be the best of both worlds. Um And

1016
00:57:50.239 --> 00:57:53.870
we're not prescribing anything we're not saying of, of

1017
00:57:53.879 --> 00:57:55.709
course, we're not saying anybody should go out and

1018
00:57:55.719 --> 00:57:57.709
join a religion or anything like that. We're just,

1019
00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:01.070
we're just reporting these results that um there does,

1020
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.879
there does seem to be some, some benefits to

1021
00:58:03.889 --> 00:58:06.320
well being from, from both kinds of belief systems

1022
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:09.840
um that I think are, are, are worthy of

1023
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.929
further investigations, especially because these aspects of well being

1024
00:58:13.939 --> 00:58:17.860
we're talking about are, are they, they're seen as

1025
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:21.219
motivational mechanisms. So they have this evolutionary function in

1026
00:58:21.229 --> 00:58:24.810
terms of encouraging striving and enhanced goal achievement, but

1027
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.709
also their core components of good mental health. So

1028
00:58:27.719 --> 00:58:30.479
if you think about the sort of a very

1029
00:58:30.489 --> 00:58:32.550
depressed person is going to be very low in

1030
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.320
optimism and low in sort of sense of purpose.

1031
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.320
And there's kind of this global public health crisis

1032
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:40.649
at the moment in terms of depression. And it's

1033
00:58:40.659 --> 00:58:43.090
one of the most significant public health problems in

1034
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:47.159
the world. And uh this is one way of,

1035
00:58:47.169 --> 00:58:52.459
of, of addressing that, that problem. Um So we

1036
00:58:52.469 --> 00:58:55.719
hope that there will be some applied value eventually.

1037
00:58:55.729 --> 00:58:59.290
Um You know, once we've, these are just initial

1038
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.649
studies, we haven't established causation. And so there's a

1039
00:59:01.659 --> 00:59:03.409
lot of work to be done. But we can

1040
00:59:03.419 --> 00:59:05.560
imagine down the road that there could be, I

1041
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.840
think some significant applied value as well.

1042
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.429
